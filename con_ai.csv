Automated teller machines (ATMs) are a classic example of ubiquitous computing as they pervade our everyday life and for many are typical artifacts of convenient modern living. More important most people are unaware that in using an ATM they are connected via a computer to a powerful network. Through our research reported within this article we examine the user acceptance and usability aspects of a novel contactless ATM. This prototype ATM has iris identification speech recognition speech synthesis and communication to a user's personal digital assistant (PDA). In this article we describe our experiences of and explorations with Stella a contactless ATM. First we briefly discuss the background to the study in terms of technology and trends and then overview previous usability research in the area. We report our findings from a cognitive walkthrough the heuristic review of the prototype focus groups and a user trial. These results underline the need for multiple evaluation methods for novel concepts. In general from the findings of this work consumers believe that speech is a technology that will create more usable applications even when faced with the relative failure of current technology to live up to their expectations or fulfill their practical needs. People are often initially resistant to the concept of iris identification and the PDA interaction yet basic experience with a usable prototype quickly overcame people's reservations. Finally we outline some of the underlying challenges facing voice-based interaction approaches to this form of ubiquitous public self-service computing.;2001
Contemporary small screen devices are used as personal companion or communication devices. However their physical dimensions constrain the processing communication and user interface capabilities. Thus rich content presentation and diverse service access via small screen appliances is limited accordingly. This paper introduces the Composite Device Computing Environment (CDCE) that provides a framework for dynamically detecting and utilising surrounding computing resources to overcome the small screen device limitations. CDCE includes the communication infrastructure in addition to supporting alternative models for interactivity between small screen clients and surrounding computing resources.;2001
Corpus-based analysis and design of spoken dialogue systems have been widely used. However in such approaches the dialogue performance cannot be predicted before the system is on line and the dialogue corpora need to be recollected if the system is modified or different conditions are assumed. Also the effects of different factors from the system's dialogue strategies speech recognition and understanding conditions and accuracy to the user's response pattern etc. on the dialogue system performance cannot be quantitatively identified and analyzed because they cannot be precisely controlled in different corpora. In this paper a complete development of computer-aided analysis and design approaches for spoken dialogue systems based on quantitative simulations is presented. With this approach the various performance metrics of a dialogue system can be flexibly defined and numerically evaluated such that the behavior and performance of the dialogue system can be well predicted and efficiently analyzed before the implementation of the real spoken dialogue system is completed. How the different dialogue performance measures vary with respect to each of the many very complicated factors regardless of whether it is caused by an individual component by the overall system design or by users' response patterns can be separately identified because all such factors can be precisely controlled in the simulation. Several analysis examples are presented to show how the approach can be used including selection and tuning of speech understanding front end system strategy design considering query factors and confirmation factors and objective estimates of user's degree of satisfaction. This approach is therefore very useful for the analysis and design of spoken dialogue systems although the online test corpus-based analysis and user survey can always follow after the system is online.;2001
Disaster rescue is one of the most serious social issues that involves very large numbers of heterogeneous agents in the hostile environment. The intention of the RoboCup Rescue project is to promote research and development in this socially significant domain at various levels involving multiagent teamwork coordination physical agents for search and rescue information infrastructures personal digital assistants a standard simulator and decision-support systems evaluation benchmarks for rescue strategies and robotic systems that are all integrated into a comprehensive system in the future. For this effort which was built on the success of the RoboCup Soccer project we will provide forums of technical discussions and competitive evaluations for researchers and practitioners. Although the rescue domain is intuitively appealing as a large-scale multiagent and intelligent system domain analysis has not yet revealed its domain characteristics. The first research evaluation meeting will be held at RoboCup-2001 in conjunction with the Seventeenth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-2001) as part of the RoboCup Rescue Simulation League and RoboCup/AAAI Rescue Robot Competition. In this article we present a detailed analysis of the task domain and elucidate characteristics necessary for multiagent and intelligent systems for this domain. Then we present an overview of the RoboCup Rescue project.;2001
For assessing the synthesized speech output component in a complex application system application-oriented evaluation methods and methodologies are needed which are not supplied by standardized lest batteries so far. Many standardized tests analyze synthetic speech mainly with regard to its form (surface structure) and only to a less degree with regard to the meaning that is assigned to it (deep structure). In turn in order to obtain a valid assessment focus for an application system the functional aspect of speech (which depends on its deep structure) has to be taken into account. In the paper two case studies are presented which focus on the acceptability of the synthesis component and its constituent dimensions in different application scenarios. In the first one synthetic speech in a car navigation and traffic information system is assessed. The second study relates to synthetic speech in a dialogue system. The assessment is limited to laboratory experiments and avoids costly field tests. It turns out that different dimensions contribute to a variable degree to overall acceptability differently depending on the application scenario. Application-oriented testing is thus required to identify the application-specific dimensions. It is discussed which characteristics of the application have to be modeled in the assessment and examples are given for both applications. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.;2001
How do we decide how to represent an intelligent system in its interface and how do we decide how the interface represents information about the world and about its own workings to a user? This article addresses these questions by examining the interaction between representation and intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation covers at least three topics in this context: (1) how a computational system is represented in its user interface (2) how the interface conveys its representations of information and the world to human users and (3) how the system's internal representation affects the human user's interaction with the system. I argue that each of these kinds of representation (of the system information and the world the interaction) is key to how users make the kind of attributions of intelligence that facilitate their interactions with intelligent systems. In this vein it makes sense to represent a systmem as a human in those cases where social collaborative behavior is key and for the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple ways on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by discussing issues of representation and intelligence in an embodied conversational agent-an interface in which the system is represented as a person information is conveyed to human users by multiple modalities such as voice and hand gestures and the internal representation is modality independent and both propositional and nonpropositional.;2001
In this paper we will present a lossless data compression technique called statistical the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm for personal digital assistants (PDAs). This compression algorithm may be viewed as a variant of the LZ77 and the contribution of this algorithm is to include the statistical properties of the source information while most of the LZ-based compression methods such as LZ78 and LZW do not take this property into consideration. In addition a prefix entropy-coding scheme is designed to improve the lookup table time for decoding. These prefix codes are especially suitable for PDAs in certain situations. The decoding of prefix codes works very fast by using simple logical and arithmetic operations.;2001
Management Case Studies describe approaches to real-life management problems in health systems. Each installment is a brief description of a problem and how it was dealt with. The cases are intended to help renders deal with similar experiences in their own work sites. Problem solving nor hypothesis testing is emphasized. Successful resolution of the management issue is not a criterion for publication-important lessons call he learned from failures too.;2001
Many of the intelligent tutoring systems that have been developed during the last 20 years have proven to be quite successful particularly in the domains of mathematics science and technology. They produce significant learning gains beyond classroom environments. They are capable of engaging most students' attention and interest for hours. We have been working on a new generation of intelligent tutoring systems that hold mixed-initiative conversational dialogues with the learner. The tutoring systems present challenging problems and questions to the learner the learner types in answers in English and there is a lengthy multitum dialogue as complete solutions' or answers evolve. This article presents the tutoring systems that we have been developing. AUTOTUTOR is a conversational agent with a talking head that helps colleges Students learn about computer literacy. ANDES ATLAS AND WHY2 help adults learn about physics. Instead of being mere information-delivery systems our systems help students actively construct knowledge through conversations.;2001
Multi-domain spoken dialogue systems with high degree of intelligence and domain extensibility have long been desired but difficult to achieve. When the user freely surfs among different topics during the dialogue it will be very difficult for the system to control the switching of the topics and domains while keeping the dialogue consistent and decide when and how to take the initiative. This paper presents a distributed agent architecture for multi-domain spoken dialogue systems with high domain extensibility and intelligence. Under this architecture different spoken dialogue agents (SDA's) handling different domains can be developed independently and then smoothly cooperate with one another to achieve the user's multiple goals while a user interface agent (UIA) can access the correct spoken dialogue agent through a domain switching protocol and carry over the dialogue state and history so as to keep the knowledge processed coherently across different domains.;2001
Personal computing and communication devices such as computers personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones are moving to their next generation in which the end user will be able to access a multitude of information with a single device either locally or through a network. One likely trend in future personal computing and personal communication is that there will not be a single but several equivalent devices available to users allowing access to information in various forms. Each user depending on his/her needs would access one or several among them depending on the situation and his/her preference. Using existing protocol mechanisms in this case a mapping and negotiation of resources during connection setup would be performed which would remain in place throughout the life of the connection. This paper provides an overview of universal multimedia access (UMA) a concept for accessing multimedia content through a variety of possible schemes and discusses some of the issues that arise regarding its deployment. In particular UMA will provide a solution for adapting the delivered content when users attempt to access their choice irrespective of their terminal characteristics and communication infrastructure as opposed to the assumption that the content remains fixed and the objective is to deliver the original content at all times. This recognition represents the impetus for the development of media descriptions and hence UMA that is the notion that valuable information can be derived from a variety of conversions of a multimedia content source. The issues discussed are future requirements on content servers and multimedia viewers media conversions UMA protocols and UMA network architectures. The problems addressed are quality of service issues in network solutions for multimedia communications and reconfigurable architectures and network control based on source adaptations through media conversions and transcoding.;2001
Recently the business circumstances of LCD industry have changed drastically by several factors. One is the global competition caused by the rushing entries of many companies and another is the progress of broadband wireless information technology. In this LCD business circumstance NEC has been focusing technology development mainly on the field of ASLMs (Application Specific LCD Monitors) and mobile displays. For the application specific LCD monitors wide viewing angle LCDs are the core technology. NEC has improved the performances such as contrast ratio response speed brightness and operating temperature range and developed new specified applications including professional graphic monitors. A reflective type LCD and a low power consumption circuit technology are core technologies for mobile LCDs. NEC has developed some LCDs for mobile phones and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants). They have excellent color and moving picture quality and are suitable for human-machine interfaces for broadband mobile network terminals.;2001
Technology was supposed to provide solutions to all of our problems but at times it seems to just give us more headaches. Worse its presence can be inescapable. Our work week has gotten longer and our time away from the office is being invaded by email cell phones and digital assistants. The candle burning at both ends no longer applies it's a firecracker with a short fuse. So we research it buy it upgrade and fix it-all to get a handle on it. But there's no escaping the tremendous issues that technology brings. Whether it's copyright law and intellectual property how to create usability standards for the Internet or how to protect companies-and ourselves-from hackers and viruses T+D's technology and trends editor Kaplan-Leiserson takes a look at the efforts that will bring a little order to the free-for-all that is the Web.;2001
Texts function as both means and motive for human activity in the same way that other technological objects function: They move from private mediational means to public motive as part of the shifting consciousness that sustains the everyday life of complex organizations. In complex organizations the status of text the condition of public visibility is all achievement rather than a given. Seeing texts as objects calls our attention to a range of textual phenomena associated with the advent of information technologies. In infomated environments the virtual states of textual objects are becoming ever more ubiquitous and consequential. A sample analysis of the texts produced and used ill the context of the new technology of personal digital assistants (PDAs) suggestsfor example that such ITexts may facilitate the migration of the documentary reality of the workplace into file home.;2001
The belief that humans will be able to interact with computers in conversational speech has long been a favorite subject in science fiction reflecting the persistent belief that spoken dialogue would be the most natural and powerful user interface to computers. With recent improvements in computer technology and in speech and language processing such systems are starting to appear feasible. There are significant technical problems that still need to be solved before speech-driven interfaces become truly conversational. This article describes the results of a 10-year effort building robust spoken dialogue systems at the University of Rochester.;2001
The paper examines conversations in the 18th-century London and Paris financial marketplaces. The aim is to highlight the place of conversations as the key form of interaction. in the marketplace and to evaluate financial conversations against the broader cultural background of literary and scientific dialogues of the time. The relevance of this enterprise is that it leads to a better understanding of how the verbal interactions of the marketplace shape transaction outcomes and contribute to forms of rationality specific for financial markets. Grounded in the analysis of empirical material the paper distinguishes between conversations-qua-transactions and conversations-about-the-world. It shows how they produce and require specific forms of knowledge from the participants at the same time they shape the transactions outcomes. On this basis the paper argues that the phenomenon of sudden mood swings in the marketplace cannot be entirely explained in irrational psychological terms but must be seen as the outcome of a particular conversational system.;2001
The promise of e-business is coming true: both businesses and individuals are using the Web to buy products and services. Both want to extend the reach of e-business to new environments. Customers want to check accounts access information and make purchases with their cellular phones pagers and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Banks airlines and retailers are competing to provide the most ubiquitous convenient service for their customers. Web applications designed to take advantage of the rich rendering capabilities of advanced desktop browsers on large displays do not generally render effectively on the small screens available on phones and PDAs. Some devices have little or no graphics capability or they require different markup languages such as Wireless Markup Language (WML) for text presentation. Transcoding is technology for adapting content to match constraints and preferences associated with specific environments. This paper compares and contrasts different approaches to content adaptation including authoring different versions to accommodate different environments using application server technology such as JavaServer pages(TM) (JSP(TM)) to create multiple versions of dynamic applications and dynamically transcoding information generated by a single application. For dynamic transcoding the paper describes several different transcoding methodologies employed by the ISM WebSphere(TM) Transcoding Publisher product including HyperText Markup Language (HTML) simplification Extensible Markup Language stylesheet selection and application HTML conversion to WML WML deck fragmentation and image transcoding. The paper discusses how to decide whether transcoding should be performed at the content source or in a network intermediary. It also describes a means of identifying the device and network characteristics associated with a request and using that information to decide how to transcode the response. Finally the paper discusses the need for new networking benchmarks to characterize the server load and performance characteristics for dynamic transcoding.;2001
The recent availability of small personal digital assistants (PDAs) with a touchscreen and communication capabilities has been an influential factor in the renewed interest in telewriting a technique for the exchange of handwritten information through telecommunications means. In this context differential chain coding algorithms for compression of the handwritten ink are revisited. In particular it is shown that the coding efficiency of multi-ring differential chain coding (MRDCC) is not always better when compared to single ring differential chain coding (DCC) as previously suggested. These algorithms were tested on over 300 handwritten messages using a relative compactness criterion and a per-length distortion measure. The probabilities of relative vectors in MRDCC and DCC are related an expression for relative compactness in the MRDCC case is introduced and the application of Freeman's criteria for the selection of the appropriate code for a family of curves is illustrated.;2001
This article details how computers have changed life for those of us in pediatric intensive care. A week of clinical activity is described with a focus on the interactions with computer system that have become an integral part of patient-care activities for many of us. it becomes clear that the boundaries between personal computers hospital systems and the Internet are often not sharply defined. Resources that are used every week may include those residing on a personal digital assistant on the hospital's electronic medical record or on a distant site on the World Wide Web. Key resources on the Internet (World Wide Web and e-mail) are identified. The technical underpinnings particularly the network that provides the infrastructure for various resources are described.;2001
This paper outlines the potential offered by technological progress in the information and communication technologies (ICTs) industries for the health sector in developing countries presents some examples of positive experiences in India and considers the difficulties in achieving this potential. The development of ICTs can bring about improvements in health in developing countries in at least three ways: as an instrument for continuing education they enable health workers to be informed of and trained in advances in knowledge they can improve the delivery of health and disaster management services to poor and remote locations and they can increase the transparency and efficiency of governance which should in turn improve the availability and delivery of publicly provided health services. These potential benefits of ICTs do not necessarily require all the final beneficiaries to be reached directly thus the cost of a given quantum of effect is reduced. Some current experiments in India such as the use of Personal Digital Assistants by rural health workers in Rajasthan the disaster management project in Maharashtra and the computerized village offices in Andhra Pradesh and Pondicherry suggest creative ways of using ICTs to improve the health conditions of local people. However the basic difficulties encountered in using ICTs for such purposes are: an inadequate physical infrastructure insufficient access by the majority of the population to the hardware and a lack of the requisite skills for using them. We highlight the substantial cost involved in providing wider access and the problem of resource allocation in poor countries where basic infrastructure for health and education is still lacking. Educating health professionals in the possible uses of ICTs and providing them with access and connectivity would in turn spread the benefits to a much wider set of final beneficiaries and might help reduce the digital divide.;2001
This paper promotes socially intelligent animated agents for the pedagogical task of English conversation training for native speakers of Japanese. Since student-agent conversations are realized as role-playing interactions strong requirements are imposed on the agents' affective and social abilities. As a novel feature social role awareness is introduced to animated conversational agents that are by now strong affective reasoners but otherwise often lack the social competence observed in humans. In particular humans may easily adjust their behavior depending on their respective role in a social setting whereas their synthetic pendants tend to be driven mostly by emotions and personality. Our main contribution is the incorporation of a social filter program to mental models of animated agents. This program may qualify an agent's expression of its emotional state by the social context thereby enhancing the agent's believability as a conversational partner. Our implemented system is web-based and demonstrates socially aware animated agents in a virtual coffee shop environment. An experiment with our conversation system shows that users consider socially aware agents as more natural than agents that violate conventional practices.;2001
This paper questions the validity of traditional scientific method for the study of human learning and proposes five postulates for the advancement of a conversational science. It considers how an evolving capacity for lifelong learning has been constrained by inappropriate research methods and educational practice leading to a learning deficit in the population. Over 25 years of action research offers solid evidence for the humanisation of science as a conversational research process which respects the individual as a unique meaning constructing self-organising learning (SOL) entity. A learning conversation pedagogy which enables learners to act as personal scientists and action researchers and a SOL Systems Seven for a community of action researchers is outlined. Finally the paper considers how SOL entities can function as catalysts for new form of ORDER with a potential for the emergence of a new species of learning and of being human.;2001
We describe a personalized recommender system designed to suggest new products to supermarket shoppers. The recommender functions in a pervasive computing environment namely a remote shopping system in which supermarket customers use Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to compost and transmit their orders to the store which assembles them for subsequent pickup. The recommender is meant to provide an alternative source of new ideas for customers who now visit the store less frequently. Recommendations are generated by matching products to customers based on the expected appeal of the product and the previous spending of the customer. Associations mining in the product domain is used to determine relationships among product classes for use in characterizing the appeal of individual products. Clustering in the customer domain is used to identify groups of shoppers with similar spending histories. Cluster-specific lists of popular products are then used as input to the matching process. The recommender is currently being used in a pilot program with several hundred customers. Analysis of results to date have shown a 1.8% boost in program revenue as a result of purchases made directly from the list of recommended products. A substantial fraction of the accepted recommendations are from product classes new to the customer indicating a degree of willingness to expand beyond present purchase patterns in response to reasonable suggestions.;2001
A lot of external natural language resources are used in spoken dialogue systems. These resources present considerable problems because of the needed space and slow lookup-time. It is therefore very important that the presentation of external language resources is time and space efficient. It is also very important that new language resources are easily incorporated into the system without modifying the common algorithms developed for multiple languages. This paper presents the method and results of compiling the large Slovenian phonetic and morphology lexicons (Slflex and Slmlex) into corresponding finite-state transducers (FSTs). Representation of large lexicons using finite-state transducers is mainly motivated by considerations of space and time efficiency. In addition the approach of hardware implementation for both large (Slovenian) lexicons is described. We will demonstrate that the structure of the FST is very appropriate for storing in the Atmel AT49BV161 flash memory chip and the lookup algorithm for obtaining any desired information from the FST structure can be efficiently implemented using the Atmel AT90S8515 microcontroller. The described hardware implementation of both Slovenian lexicons can be connected directly to the PC using RS232 above all for development and test purposes and can be used especially in embedded systems which use speech technology.;2002
A low-power three-dimensional (3-D) rendering engine is implemented as part of a mobile personal digital assistant (PDA) chip. Six-megabit embedded DRAM macros attached to 8-pixel-parallel rendering logic are logically localized with a 3.2-GB/s runtime reconfigurable bus reducing the area by 25% compared with conventional local frame-buffer architectures. The low power consumption is achieved by polygon-dependent access to the embedded DRAM macros with line-block mapping providing read-modify-write data transaction. The 3-D rendering engine with 2.22-Mpolygons/s drawing speed was fabricated using 0.18-mum CMOS embedded memory logic technology. Its area is 24 mm(2) and its power consumption is 120 mW.;2002
A printed integrated inverted-F antenna is introduced which operates in the Bluetooth frequency band (2.4-2.485 GHz). The proposed antenna is a part of the radio frequency printed circuit board (PCB) of a cellular telephone or a personal digital assistant (PDA) The antenna being an integral part of the PCB reduces the cost and complexity of designing and manufacturing a separate antenna. The maximum dimension of the antenna on standard FR4 substrate is 25 X 5 X 1 mm(3). The antenna operates within 2:1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) and has a free-space peak gain of 1.5 dBi.

A uniquely packaged internal inverted-F antenna is proposed for Bluetooth or wireless local area network (WLAN) application. The antenna is printed on the inside surface of the stylus holder of a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a smart phone. The proposed antenna operates within 2 : 1 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) throughout the entire Bluetooth band (2.4-2.485 GHz). The bandwidth of the antenna is 11% with the stylus inserted while it is 12.4% without it. The radiation pattern of the antenna is very nearly uniform in the planes of interest.;2002
An increasing number of distributed applications will be written for mobile hosts such as laptop computers third generation mobile phones personal digital assistants watches and the like. Application engineers have to deal with a new set of problems caused by mobility such as low bandwidth context changes or loss of connectivity. During disconnection users will typically update local replicas of shared data independently from each other. The resulting inconsistent replicas need to be reconciled upon re-connection. To support building mobile applications that use both replication and reconciliation over ad-hoc networks we have designed xmiddle a mobile computing middleware. In this paper we describe xmiddle and show how it uses reflection capabilities to allow application engineers to influence replication and reconciliation techniques. xmiddle enables the transparent sharing of XML documents across heterogeneous mobile hosts allowing on-line and off-line access to data. We describe xmiddle using a collaborative e-shopping case study on mobile clients.;2002
Background and objectives: Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are being used more frequently by anesthesiologists. PDAs are pocket-sized electronic devices that at their most basic level store information. Basic features include calendar phone directory memo pad and checklist. More advanced features are increasingly common and blur the distinction between PDAs and personal computers (PCs). This article reviews the main options for PDAs purchasing tips and software applications especially as they apply to anesthesiologists.;2002
Background: Researchers typically record data on a work-sheet and at some later time enter it into the database. Wireless data entry and retrieval using a personal digital assistant (PDA) at the site of patient contact can simplify this process and improve efficiency. Methods: A surgeon and a nurse coordinator provided the content for the database. The computer programmer created the database placed the pages of the database on the PDA screen and researched and installed security measures. Results: Designing the database took 6 months. Meeting Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requirements for patient confidentiality satisfying institutional Information Services requirements. and ensuring connectivity required an additional 8 months before the functional system was complete. Conclusions: It is now possible to achieve wireless entry and retrieval of data using a PDA. Potential advantages include collection and entry of data at the same time easy entry of data from multiple sites and retrieval of data at the patient's bedside.;2002
Barely before Internet-facilitated e-commerce has begun to take hold a new wave of technology-driven commerce has started-mobile (m-) commerce. Fuelled by the increasing saturation of mobile technology such as phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) m-commerce promises to inject considerable change into the way certain activities are conducted. Equipped with micro-browsers and other mobile applications. the new range of mobile technologies offer the Internet in your pocket' for which the consumer possibilities are endless including banking. booking or buying tickets shopping and real-time news. Focusing on business-to-consumer markets this paper examines how value is added in the stream of activities involved in providing m-commerce to the consumer. As such it analyses the key players and technologies that form part of the m-commerce value chain providing a foundation for future strategic analysis of the industry. Drawing on some of the key factors that may influence the take-up of m-commerce-including technological and other issues-the paper also provides predictions regarding the future of m-commerce.

Bluetooth is a new short-range wireless technology designed to enable wireless communication between diverse devices. It is gaining increasing popularity and acceptance in the world today. There is a growing body of research on the subject but very few if any of the analyses provide a balanced view of the technology which describe its pros and cons and implications for businesses. This paper attempts to critically analyze the Bluetooth technology from a various perspectives. It begins with a description of the technology in terms of its hardware software and network infrastructure. Then it addresses the related issues of interference security and reliability. This microanalysis is followed by a larger macroanalytical view which includes the advantages of this technology its role in the global third generation (3G) wireless scheme health/safety issues and business implications. It concludes with the applications of Bluetooth and its future potential. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.;2002
Complexity in civil engineering projects has increased over the years which has led to an increase in the number of organizations involved in those projects. In today's environment these organizations operate in different parts of the world requiring their personnel to be geographically distributed. However current project management practices require project personnel to be geographically collocated and thus are unable to provide the infrastructure to support geographically distributed project management teams. In addition current project management practices require access to personal computer (PC) based resources for project information. which is not always a feasible alternative for on-site project personnel as it requires certain hardware and office configurations Thus alternatives to PC-based resources such as personal digital assistants (PDA) or phones are needed for information access. Moreover once project information has been conveyed to all project personnel the system should aid them in terms of providing data analysis tools and presenting technical or management solutions to the problems encountered by the project personnel. This paper presents a collaborative project management system with a knowledge repository analysis resources and multiple device access to support the infrastructure of distributed project management teams in complex architecture/engineering/construction projects. The primary goal for such a system would be to provide a platform where project information can be effectively shared with any of the project management personnel from anywhere and with a very few limitations on the computing device.;2002
Creating conversational interfaces for children is challenging in several respects. These include acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR) language and dialog modeling and multimodal-multimedia user interface design. First issues in ASR of children speech are introduced by an analysis of developmental changes in the spectral and temporal characteristics of the speech signal using data obtained from 456 children ages five to 18 years. Acoustic modeling adaptation and vocal tract normalization algorithms that yielded state-of-the-art ASR performance on children speech are described. Second an experiment designed to better understand how children interact with machines using spoken language is described. Realistic conversational multimedia interaction data were obtained from 160 children who played a voice-activated computer game in a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) scenario. Results of using these data in developing novel language and dialog models as well as in a unified maximum likelihood framework for acoustic decoding in ASR and semantic classification for spoken language understanding are described. Leveraging the lessons learned from the WoZ study and a concurrent user experience evaluation a multimedia personal agent prototype for children was designed. Details of the architecture and application details are described. Informal evaluation by children was found positive especially for the animated agent and the speech interface.;2002
Designing the dialogue policy of a spoken dialogue system involves many nontrivial choices. This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for automatically optimizing a dialogue policy which address the technical challenges in applying reinforcement learning to a working dialogue system with human users. We report on the design construction and empirical evaluation of NJFun and experimental spoken dialogue system that provides users with access to information about fun things to do in New Jersey. Our result show that by optimizing its performance via reinforcement learning NJFun measurable improves system performance.;2002
Experiences of students using optically scanned cards were compared with those of students using personal digital assistants (PDAs) to log patient encounters in a primary care clerkship. From April to September 2001 students were offered the option of using a PDA in lieu of scanned cards to track clinical encounters. Data obtained from PDA users were compared with those previously obtained from scanned card users. Verbal and written feedback was obtained from all students. Of the 71 students invited to participate 21 (30%) owned a PDA and of these 20 agreed to participate. Eighteen students completed the pilot. One student was unable to participate owing to software installation problems another student lost data because of improper back-up. Students using the PDAs recorded more encounters per rotation and had fewer missing data when compared with students who used scanned card. Additionally feedback from students suggested that PDAs offered other important educational benefits.;2002
Grammar-based parsing is a prevalent method for natural language understanding (NLU) and has been introduced into dialogue systems for spoken language processing (SLP). A robust parsing scheme is proposed in this paper to overcome the notorious phenomena such as garbage ellipsis word disordering fragment and ill-form which frequently occur in spoken utterances. Keyword categories are used as terminal symbols and the definition of grammar is extended by introducing three new rule types by-passing up-messing and overcrossing in addition to the general rules called up-tying in this paper and the use of semantic items simplifies the semantics extraction. The corresponding parser marionette which is essentially a partial chart parser is enhanced to parse the semantic grammar. The robust parsing scheme integrating the above methods has been adopted in an air traveling information service system called EasyFlight and has achieved a high performance when used for parsing spontaneous speeches.;2002
In a spoken dialog system it is an important problem for the computer to identify the speech act (SA) from a user's utterance due to the variability of spoken language. In this paper a corpus-based fuzzy fragment-class Markov model (FFCMM) is proposed to model the syntactic characteristics of a speech act and used to choose the speech act candidates. A speech act verification process that estimates the conditional probability of a speech act given a sequence of fragments is used to verify the speech act candidate. Most main design procedures are statistical- and corpus-based to reduce manual work. In order to evaluate the proposed method a spoken dialog system for air travel information service (ATIS) is investigated. The experiments were carried out using a test database from 25 speakers (15 male and 10 female). There are 480 dialogs containing 3038 sentences in the test database. The experimental results show that the speech act identification rate can be improved by 10.5% using the FFCMM and speech act verification with a rejection rate of 6% compared to a baseline system.

In the past few years as the number of dialogue systems has increased there has been an increasing interest in the use of natural language generation in spoken dialogue. Our research assumes that trainable natural language generation is needed to support more. flexible and customized dialogues with human users. This paper focuses on methods for automatically training the sentence planning module of a spoken language generator. Sentence planning is a set of inter-related but distinct tasks one of which is sentence scoping i.e. the choice of syntactic structure for elementary speech acts and the decision of how to combine them into one or more sentences. The paper first presents SPOT a trainable sentence planner and a new methodology for automatically training SPOT on the basis of feedback provided by human judges. Our methodology is unique in neither depending on hand-crafted rules nor on the existence of a domain-specific corpus. SPOT first randomly generates a candidate set of sentence plans and then selects one. We show that SPOT learns to select a sentence plan whose rating on average is only 5% worse than the top human-ranked sentence plan. We then experimentally evaluate SPOT by asking human judges to compare SPoT's output with a hand-crafted template-based generation component two rule-based sentence planners and two baseline sentence planners. We show that SPOT performs better than the rule-based systems and the baselines and as well as the hand-crafted system. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.;2002
In this paper we describe a generation system for spoken dialogue that not only produces coherent informative and responsive dialogue contributions but also explicitly models human styles of interaction. This generation system is based on conversation acts theory. It has been implemented in the TRIPS spoken dialogue system and includes components that plan content perform surface generation for different modalities and coordinate output production. We discuss our implementation and describe an evaluation of the generation output. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reseved.;2002
In this paper we describe how language generation and speech synthesis for spoken dialog systems can be efficiently integrated under a weighted finite state transducer architecture. Taking advantage of this efficiency we show that introducing flexible targets in generation leads to more natural sounding synthesis. Specifically eve allow multiple wordings of the response and multiple prosodic realizations of the different wordings. The choice of wording and prosodic structure are then jointly optimized with unit selection for waveform generation in speech synthesis. Results of perceptual experiments show that by integrating the steps of language generation and speech synthesis we are able to achieve improved naturalness of synthetic speech compared to the sequential implementation.

It has always been difficult for language understanding systems to handle spontaneous speech with satisfactory robustness primarily due to such problems as the fragments disfluencies out-of-vocabulary words and ill-formed sentence structures. Also the search schemes used are usually not flexible enough in accepting different input linguistic units and great efforts are therefore required when they are used with different acoustic front ends in different tasks specially in mufti-modal and mufti-lingual systems. In this paper a new hierarchical tag-graph-based search scheme for spontaneous speech understanding is proposed. This scheme is based on a layered hierarchy of grammar rules and therefore can integrate all the statistical and rule-based knowledge including acoustic scores language model scores and grammar rules into the search process. More robust speech understanding is thus achievable. In addition this scheme can accept graphs of different linguistic units such as phonemes syllables characters words spotted keywords or phrases as the input thus compatible to different acoustic front ends and mufti-modal and mufti-lingual applications can be easily developed. This search scheme has been successfully applied to a mufti-domain mufti-modal dialogue system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.;2002
Mobile devices such as cameras or mobile phones can be used as props actively to convey a specific impression to people in the vicinity and to feel better when interacting with them. Based on field studies and interviews three aspects of users acting with mobile devices are described: warm versus cold devices how a mobile device conveys a specific impression by association to similar devices and specific situations of use and how the characteristics of a mobile device may open or restrict the body language of the user.;2002
Mobile knowledge seekers often need access to information on the Web during a meeting or on the road while away from their desktop. A common practice today is to use pervasive devices such as Personal Digital Assistants or mobile phones. However these devices have inherent constraints (e. g. slow communication form factor) which often make information discovery tasks impractical. In this paper we present a new focused-search approach specifically oriented for the mode of work and the constraints dictated by pervasive devices. It combines focused search within specific topics with encapsulation of topic-specific information in a persistent repository. One key characteristic of these persistent repositories is that their footprint is small enough to fit on local devices and yet they are rich enough to support many information discovery tasks in disconnected mode. More specifically we suggest a representation for topic-specific information based on knowledge-agent bases that comprise all the information necessary to access information about a topic (under the form of key concepts and key Web pages) and assist in the full search process from query formulation assistance to result scanning on the device itself. The key contribution of our work is the coupling of focused search with encapsulated knowledge representation making information discovery from pervasive devices practical as well as efficient. We describe our model in detail and demonstrate its aspects through sample scenarios.;2002
Navigation is the process by which people control their movement in virtual environments and is a core functional requirement for all virtual environment (VE) applications. Users require the ability to move controlling orientation direction of movement and speed in order to achieve a particular goal within a VE. Navigation is rarely the end point in itself (which is typically interaction with the visual representations of data) but applications often place a high demand on navigation skills which in turn means that a high level of support for navigation is required from the application. On desktop systems navigation in non-immersive systems is usually supported through the usual hardware devices of mouse and keyboard. Previous work by the authors shows that many users experience frustration when trying to perform even simple navigation tasks - users complain about getting lost becoming disorientated and finding the interface 'difficult to use'. In this paper we report on work in progress in exploiting natural language processing (NLP) technology to support navigation in non-immersive virtual environments. A multi-modal system has been developed which supports a range of high-level (spoken) navigation commands and indications are that spoken dialogue interaction is an effective alternative to mouse and keyboard interaction for many tasks. We conclude that multi-modal interaction combining technologies such as NLP with mouse and keyboard may offer the most effective interaction with VEs and identify a number of areas where further work is necessary.;2002
New portable signal-processing applications such as mobile telephony wireless computing and personal digital assistants place stringent power consumption limits on their constituent components. Substantial power savings can be realized if 5 V designs are translated to use the new lower supply voltage standards. This conversion however is not achieved easily: a design originally targeted for implementation in a 5 V technology will typically require significant rework to meet timing and throughput requirements at the lower operating voltage. In this paper we describe a high-level synthesis system which assists the designer in performing this task minimizing the need for manual redesign. Techniques employed in this work include pipelining and a new approach to module selection that minimizes power consumption subject to timing constraints. Using these and other high-level synthesis techniques to target designs to 3.3 V libraries we show that it is possible to reduce power consumption by as much as 56% as compared to the original 5 V implementation while meeting specified minimum throughput and maximum latency constraints.;2002
Objective: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the uses of handheld computers (also called personal digital assistants or PDAs) in family practice residency programs in the United States. Study Design: In November 2000 the authors mailed a questionnaire to the program directors of all American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and American College of Osteopathic Family Practice (ACOFP) residency programs in the United States. Measurements: Data and patterns of the use and non-use of handheld computers were identified. Results: Approximately 50 percent (306 of 610) of the programs responded to the survey. Two thirds of the programs reported that handheld computers were used in their residencies and an additional 14 percent had plans for implementation within 24 months. Both the Palm and the Windows CE operating systems were used with the Palm operating system the most common. Military programs had the highest rate of use (8 of 10 programs 80 percent) and osteopathic programs had the lowest (23 of 55 programs 42 percent). Of programs that reported handheld computer use 45 percent had required handheld computer applications that are used uniformly by all users. Funding for handheld computers and related applications was non-budgeted in 76 percent of the programs in which handheld computers were used. In programs providing a budget for handheld computers the average annual budget per user was $461.58. Interested faculty or residents rather than computer information services personnel performed upkeep and maintenance of handheld computers in 72 percent of the programs in which the computers are used. In addition to the installed calendar memo pad and address book the most common clinical uses of handheld computers in the programs were as medication reference tools electronic textbooks and clinical computational or calculator-type programs. Conclusions: Handheld computers are widely used in family practice residency programs in the United States. Although handheld computers were designed as electronic organizers in family practice residencies they are used as medication reference tools electronic textbooks and clinical computational programs and to track activities that were previously associated with desktop database applications.;2002
Objective: To assess the practicality of using personal digital assistants (PDAs) for the collection of logbook data procedural performance data and critical incident reports in anaesthetic trainees. Design: Pilot study. Setting: Two tertiary referral centres (in Victoria and New Zealand) and a large district hospital in Queensland. Participants: Six accredited Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) registrars and their ANZCA training supervisors. Interventions: Registrars and supervisors underwent initial training for one hour and supervisors were provided with ongoing support. Main outcome measures: Reliable use of the program average time for data entry and number of procedures logged. Results: ANZCA trainees reliably enter data into PDAs. The data can be transferred to a central database where they can be remotely analysed before results are fed back to trainees. Conclusions: This technology can be used to monitor professional performance in ANZCA trainees.;2002
Objectives: This article details the introduction and development of the use of microcomputers as adjuncts to traditional cognitive rehabilitation of persons with acquired brain injury. Summary: The initial application of video games as therapeutic recreation in the late 1970s was soon followed in the early 1980s by the use of the first personal computers and available educational software. By the mid-1980s both the IBM PC and Macintosh platforms were established along with simplified programming languages that allowed individuals without extensive technical expertise to develop their own software. Several rehabilitation clinicians began to produce and market specially written cognitive retraining software for one or the other platform. Their work was detailed and reviewed as was recently released software from commercial sources. The latter discussion included the latest developments in the rehabilitation applications of personal digital assistants and related organizing reminding and dictation devices. A summary of research on the general and specific efficacy of computer-assisted cognitive retraining illustrated the lingering controversy and skepticism that have been associated with this field since its inception. Conclusions: Computer-assisted cognitive retraining (CACR) can be an effective adjunct to a comprehensive program of cognitive rehabilitation. Training needs to be focused structured monitored and as ecologically relevant as possible for optimum effect. Transfer or training or generalizabitity of skills remains a key issue in the field and should be considered the key criterion in evaluating whether to initiate or continue CACR.;2002
Our goal is to develop a believable embodied agent able to dialogue with a user. In particular we aim at making an agent that can also combine facial expressions in a complex and subtle way just like a human agent does. We first review a taxonomy of communicative functions that our agent is able to express non-verbally but we point out that due to the complexity of communication in some cases different information can be provided at once by different parts and actions of an agent's face. In this paper we are interested in assessing and treating what happens at the meaning and signal levels of behaviour when different communicative functions have to be displayed at the same time and necessarily have to make use of the same expressive resources. In some of these cases the complexity of the agent's communication can give rise to conflicts between the parts or movements of the face. In this paper we propose a way to manage the possible conflicts between different modalities of communication through the tool of belief networks and we show how this tool allows us to combine facial expressions of different communicative functions and to display complex and subtle expressions.

Personal digital assistants and other mobile computing devices rely on synchronization protocols in order to maintain data consistency. These protocols operate in environments where network resources such as ban h memory and processing power are limited. In this article we examine a number of popular and representative synchronization protocols such as Palm's HotSync Pumatech's Intellisync and the industry-wide SyncML initiative. We investigate the scalability performance of these protocols as a function of data and network sizes and compare these protocols to a novel synchronization approach CPISync which addresses some of their scalability concerns. The conclusions of this survey are intended to provide guidance for handling scalability issues in synchronizing data on large heterogeneous tetherless networks.;2002
Purpose: From 1991 through 2000 incoming medical students (M-Is) at the School of Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University have been surveyed with a written questionnaire on their Computer literacy. The survey's purpose is to learn the students' levels of knowledge skill and experience with computer technology to guide instructional services and facilities. Methodology: The questionnaire was administered during M-I orientation or mailed to students' homes after matriculation. It evolved from sixteen questions in 1991 to twenty-three questions in 2000 with fifteen questions common to all. Results: The average survey response rate was 81% from an average of 177 students. Six major changes were introduced based on information collected from the surveys and advances in technology: production of CD-ROMs distributed to students containing required computer-based instructional programs delivery of evaluation instruments to students via the Internet modification of the lab to a mostly PC-based environment development of an electronic curriculum Website development of computerized examinations for medical students to prepare them for the computerized national board examinations and initiation of a personal digital assistant (PDA) project for students to evaluate PDAs' usefulness in clinical settings. Conclusion: The computer literacy survey provides a snapshot of students' past and present use of technology and guidance for the development of services and facilities.;2002
Recent federal mandates have increased interest in the use of functional behavior assessment as a necessary part of initial and ongoing work with students with externalizing behavior disorders. A multifaceted approach to functional behavior assessment provides a comprehensive assessment of both behavioral excesses and deficits commonly found in externalizing behavior disorders and also provides for the linkage of assessment information to educational interventions that can be implemented and monitored in educational settings for students with behavior disorders. The authors using a variety of empirically derived methods describe specific components of a multifaceted approach to functional behavior assessment in the context of the widely accepted behavioral excess/deficit model for students with externalizing behavior disorders. Empirically derived and validated methodologies (i.e. indirect data collection and analysis direct observation and recording of behavior and use of probes to establish baseline rates and measure impacts of intervention) are described. Technology-assisted data collection and analysis using computer-assisted functional behavior assessment interviews and direct observation of behavior using personal digital assistant (PDA) based software are also presented as a means to improve efficiency and reduce time needed to conduct adequate functional behavior assessments. Specific strategies to address academic skill and performance deficits as well as social skills deficiencies in the context of a multifaceted functional behavior assessment are also presented for students with externalizing behavior disorders.

Spoken dialogue system performance can vary widely for different users as well for the same user during different dialogues. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an adaptive version of TOOT a spoken dialogue system for retrieving online train schedules. Based on rules learned from a set of training dialogues adaptive TOOT constructs a user model representing whether the user is having speech recognition problems as a particular dialogue progresses. Adaptive TOOT then automatically adapts its dialogue strategies based on this dynamically changing user model. An empirical evaluation of the system demonstrates the utility of the approach.;2002
Spoken dialogue system promise efficient and natural access to a large variety of information sources and services from any phone. However current spoken dialogue systems are deficient in their strategies for preventing identifying and repairing problems that arise in the conversation. This paper reports results on automatically training a Problematic Dialogue Predictor to predict problematic human-computer dialogues using a corpus of 4692 dialogues collected with the How May I Help You(SM) spoken dialogue system. The Problematic Dialogue Predictor can be immediately applied to the system's decision of whether to transfer the call to a human customer care agent or be used as a cue to the system's dialogue manager to modify its behavior to repair problems and even perhaps to prevent them. We show that a Problematic Dialogue Predictor using automatically-obtainable features from the first two exchanges in the dialogue can predict problematic dialogues 13.2% more accurately than the baseline.;2002
Study Objective. To examine the breadth clinical dependability and case of use of drug-information software programs for personal digital assistants that incorporate the Palm operating system. Design. Prospective evaluation with descriptive analysis. Methods. Nine drug-information software programs were evaluated for breadth clinical dependability and ease of use based on responses to 50 questions. Results. Breadth of information (percentage of questions that could be answered) was 32-75% LexiComp Platinum was the leader in this category. Clinical dependability (factual completeness) of information was 66.7-100% LexiComp Platinum led this category as well. MobileMicromedex provided the narrowest breadth of information and the least clinically dependable information. Time to locate an answer to posed questions averaged 17.5 +/- 4.98 seconds The fastest retrieval time was achieved by Davis's Drug Guide for Physicians (12.1 sec). Tarascon's Pharmacopoeia required the fewest viewed PDA screens to locate the requested information (3.3 screens). Cost of programs ranged from free to $129.95. Cost was not related to breadth or clinical dependability. Conclusions. LexiComp Platinum offered the greatest breadth of information and the most clinically dependable content. MobileMicromedex was the least helpful of these products for answering straightforward drug-information questions.;2002
Telecommunications networks are rapidly advancing toward adequate capacity to support multimedia content transmission between mobile terminals. This development opens opportunities for terminal manufacturers to realize functions on the devices that previously have been considered impractical. It is necessary for the terminals however to exploit advances in new display technologies such as reflective-color liquid-crystal displays bistable displays organic emissive displays and microdisplays to make use of the new functionality. The state of the art of mobile phone and personal digital assistant displays as well as some of the emerging technologies are reviewed based on their applicability in new uses in mobile terminals.;2002
The ability of portable electronic products like cellular phones and personal digital assistants to withstand accidental impacts and shock is a valuable attribute consumers expect and manufacturers desire. Usually manufacturers conduct expensive experimental drop tests to determine the fragility of such products during the product design cycle. An alternative to conducting drop tests is to perform numerical simulation. This paper examines the feasibility of studying the drop impact response of an electronic pager using a finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit. Experimental drop test results are then used to compare with that of numerical simulation. Parameters examined include surface strains on pager housing and impact force. Comparisons show good correlation between experimental and numerical results. Finite element computation allows critical impact orientations and drop heights to be identified so that selective experimental drop tests can be performed to determine the actual physical robustness of these products.;2002
The advent of mobile devices and the wireless Internet is having a profound impact on the way people communicate as well as on the user interaction paradigms used to access information that was traditionally accessible only through visual interfaces. Applications for mobile devices entail the integration of various data sources optimized for delivery to limited hardware resources and intermittently connected devices through wireless networks. Although telephone interfaces arise as one of the most prominent pervasive applications they present interaction challenges such as the augmentation of speech recognition through natural language (NL) understanding and high-quality text-to-speech conversion This article presents an experience in building an automated assistant that is natural to use and could become an alternative to a human assistant. The Mobile Assistant (MA) can read e-mail messages book appointments take phone messages and provide access to personal-organizer information. Key components are a conversational interface enterprise integration and notifications tailored to user preferences. The focus of the research has been on supporting the pressing communication needs of mobile workers and overcoming technological hurdles such as achieving high accuracy speech recognition in noisy environments NL understanding and optimal message presentation on a variety of devices and modalities. The article outlines findings from the 2 broad field trials and lessons learned regarding the support of mobile workers with pervasive computing devices and emerging technologies.;2002
The realization of Ubiquitous Services calls for the development of various kinds of network appliances. These include compact personal digital assistants that can access the network anywhere and anytime and network sensor arrays that can collect real-world data on a user's physical condition and the surrounding environment and then send that data out onto the network. This article describes NTT's extremely low-power circuit technology that plays a key role in achieving ultra-small network appliances.;2002
The use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to access drug information in a health system is described. Given the widespread use of PDAs at an 872-bed university health system an opportunity existed to provide current drug information to physicians via these devices. As part of the health system's intranet extensive online content had been made available through a browser extension to PDAs was a natural next step. There were two primary requirements: the ability to synchronize information with the database server when a PDA was used and the development of content and applications by using existing staff. Mobile enterprise software was chosen that supports multiple PDA platforms is easy to use and does not require programming skills. The software works through customized channels or collections of information from a content provider. The customized channel service works over the Internet. Two channels of content were created an ambulatory care channel and an inpatient care channel. The ambulatory care channel contains a list of preferred ambulatory care agents poison control information the locations of outpatient pharmacies drug information and safety tips for prescribing. The inpatient channel contains the inpatient formulary current news and events information on currrent drug shortages and recalls pharmacy contact information and medication safety tips. When a user synchronizes his or her PDA the software contacts the department's intranet servers and processes the request. The data are compressed and downloaded to the user's PDA. A university health system successfully used PDAs to access drug and other information.;2002
This paper addresses the impact of telephone transmission channels on automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. A real-time simulation model is described and implemented which allows impairments that are encountered in traditional as well as modern (mobile IP-based) networks to be flexibly and efficiently generated. The model is based on input parameters which are known to telephone network planners thus it can be applied without measuring specific network characteristics. It can be used for an analytic assessment of the impact of channel impairments on ASR performance for producing training material with defined transmission characteristics or for testing spoken dialogue systems in realistic network environments. In the present paper we present an investigation of the first point. Two speech recognizers which are integrated into a spoken dialogue system for information retrieval are assessed in relation to controlled amounts of transmission degradations. The measured ASR performance degradation is compared to speech quality degradation in human-human communication. It turns out that ASR shows a different behavior than expected human quality judgments for some impairments. This fact has to be taken into account in both telephone network planning as well as in speech and language technology development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.;2002
This paper describes a novel mobile video monitoring system. The receiver is a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) with a PHS (Personal Handy Phone system) card. The sender is a PC-based video encoding system which is connected to an ISDN line by ISDN-TA. Functions such as camera selection remote camera control and high-resolution snap shot are implemented. In this paper details of the system are explained and a practicability assessment is performed. An experiment was conducted to measure the upward and downward transmission delay. From the results the system performs consistently to a theoretical behavior. Furthermore the performance of this system is quite practical for mobile video monitoring.;2002
This paper describes an approach to processing meaning instead of processing information in computing. Human intellectual activity is supported by linguistic activities in the brain. Therefore processing the meaning of language instead of processing information should be able to lead us to realize human intelligence on a computer. As an example of proposed framework for processing meaning we build a travel consultation dialogue system which can understand utterance by a user and retrieve information through dialogue. Through a simulation example of the system we show that both information processing and language processing are integrated into one processing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper describes our ongoing attempts to build a communityware system by presenting a project of providing digital assistants to support participants in an academic conference. We provided participants at the conference with a personal assistant system with mobile and ubiquitous computing technologies and facilitated communication among the participants. We also made online services available via the Web to encourage the participants to continue their relationships even after the conference. In this paper we show the system we provided for the project and report the results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.;2002
This paper describes some examples of human-voice interface technology recently developed by NEC. The first is a network speech interface that enables the Internet to be easily accessed via mobile car or home terminals. This speech interface is composed of a client-type speech interface and a servertype speech interface. The second is a speaker-independent large-vocabulary speech-recognition system and a speech-synthesis system which are necessary to realize such a network speech interface. The third example is an emotional-spoken-dialogue system aimed at making the human-machine dialogue more pleasant to use.;2002
This paper describes the response planning and generation components of the MERCURY flight reservation system a mixed-initiative spoken dialogue system that supports both voice-only interaction and multimodal interaction augmenting spoken inputs with typing or clicking at a displayed Web page. MERCURY is configured using the Galaxy Communicator architecture (Seneff Hurley Lau Schmid & Zue 1998) where a suite of servers interact via program control mediated by a central hub. Language generation is performed in two steps: response. planning or deep-structure generation is carried out by the dialogue manager and is well-integrated with other aspects of dialogue control control flow is specified by a dialogue control table (Seneff & Polifroni 2000a). Response generation or surface-form generation is executed by a separate language generation server under the guidance of a set of recursive generation rules and an associated lexicon (Baptist & Seneff 2000). The generation of the textual string for the graphical interface and the marked-up synthesis string for spoken outputs are controlled by a shared set of generation rules (Seneff & Polifroni 2000b). Thus there is a direct meaning-to-speech mapping that eliminates the need to analyze linguistic structure for synthesis. To date we have collected over 25000 utterances from users interacting with the MERCURY system. We report here on both the results of user satisfaction studies conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and on our own tabulation of a number of different measures of dialogue success.

This paper explores packet loss recovery for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in spoken dialog systems assuming an architecture in which a lightweight client communicates with a remote ASR server. Speech is transmitted with source and channel codes optimized for the ASR application i.e. to minimize word error rate. Unequal amounts of forward error correction depending on the data's effect on ASR performance are assigned to protect against packet loss. Experiments with simulated packet loss in a range of loss conditions are conducted on the DARPA Communicator (air travel information) task. Results show that the approach provides robust ASR performance which degrades gracefully as packet loss rates increase. Transmitting at 5.2 Kbp s with tip to 200 ms added delay leads to only a 7% relative degradation in word error rate even under extremely adverse network conditions.;2002
This paper presents a novel technique that allows testing spoken dialogue systems by means of an automatic generation of conversations. The technique permits to easily test spoken dialogue systems under a variety of lab-simulated conditions as it is easy to vary or change the utterance corpus used to check the performance of the system. The technique is based on the use of a module called user simulator whose purpose is to behave as real users when they interact with dialogue systems. The behaviour of the simulator is decided by means of diverse scenarios that represent the goals of the users. The simulator aim is to achieve the goals set in the scenarios during the interaction with the dialogue system. We have applied the technique to test a dialogue system developed in our lab. The test has been carried out considering different levels of white and babble noise as well as a VTS noise compensation technique. The results prove that the dialogue system performance is worse under the babble noise conditions. The VTS technique has been effective when dealing with noisy utterances and has lead to better experimental results particularly for the white noise. The technique has permitted to detect problems in the dialogue strategies employed to handle confirmation turns and recognition errors suggesting that these strategies must be improved.

This study examined whether the number of errors in discharge medication lists at a psychiatric hospital would decrease when the practice of transcribing the lists by hand from physicians' discharge orders was replaced by the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to create and directly print out such lists. In a four-month period before the use of PDAs was introduced 20 of the 110 hand-transcribed lists (22 percent) contained errors. In the four-month period after the use of PDAS was implemented seven of the 90 PDA-generated lists (8 percent) contained errors. Use of a PDA may be helpful in providing safer patient care.;2002
This study was aimed at evaluation of the validity and reliability of an alternative dietary measurement method that assists epidemiologic studies. We validated a handheld personal digital assistant with camera and mobile phone card called Wellnavi in which a 1-d weighed diet record was employed as a reference method. Twenty college students majoring in food and nutrition participated in this study. They were asked to keep a diet record and to take digital photos of all these recorded food at the same time then send them to the dietitians by the mobile phone card. In the reliability study other twenty students from the same college were asked to take digital photos of the same meal during a day by two same instruments under the same circumstances and to send these photos to the different dietitians electronically. With respect to validity median nutrient intakes estimated by the Wellnavi method and the diet record method are comparable. Correlation coefficients between the median nutrient intakes estimated from these two methods ranged from 0.46 for monounsaturated fatty acid to 0.93 for vitamin B-12 and copper (median r=0.77). With respect to reliability our data show a good agreement between two Wellnavi instruments for most of the nutrients. Correlation coefficients between the nutrient intakes estimated from 2 instruments ranged from 0.55 for vitamin B-1 and water-insoluble dietary fiber to 0.92 for vitamin B-12 (median r=0.78). In conclusion the results indicate this dietary assessment instrument can usefully measure individual dietary intakes for a variety of nutrients in an epidermologic study.;2002
Walking locomotion has been proved as an adequate technique for autonomous motion on an uneven terrain. However natural scenarios can be extremely complex and human intervention is regularly required. In such a case a dialogue system known as human-machine interface (HMI) is essential for interrelation between human and machine. The objective of this paper is to present a human-machine interface developed for a four-legged robot. This HMI is based on a multi-modal interface which integrates some ideas about collaborative control. It was developed as an operator's interface for guiding a walking robot but it can also be used as a tool for analysing and debugging new gait algorithms. The interface includes some methods for defining robot trajectory and graphic representations for gaining information on both the robot and its environment. This work is tailored to the SILO4 walking robot therefore the SILO4 mechanism and control system are first introduced to lay out the possibilities of this new walking robot. Then the main concepts on which the HMI design is based are introduced prior to the description of the different modules and functionality of the human-machine interface. Finally some simulations and experiments with the SILO4 walking robot have been conducted to validate the performance of the HMI presented in this article.;2002
We describe a corpus-based approach to natural language generation (NLG). The approach has been implemented as a component of a spoken dialog system and a series of evaluations were carried out. Our system uses n-gram language models which have been found useful in other language technology applications in a generative mode. It is not yet clear whether the simple n-grams can adequately model human language generation in general but we show that we can successfully apply this ubiquitous modeling technique to the task of natural language generation for spoken dialog systems. In this paper we discuss applying corpus-based stochastic language generation at two levels: content selection and sentence planning/realization. At the content selection level output utterances are modeled by bigrams and the appropriate attributes are chosen using bigram statistics. In sentence planning and realization corpus utterances are modeled by n-grams of varying length and new utterances are generated stochastically. Through this work we show that a simple statistical model alone can generate appropriate language for a spoken dialog system. The results describe a promising avenue for using a statistical approach in future NLG systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.;2002
We have developed a new way of accessing biological databases and bioinformatics applications on the Internet. This new service bioinformatics wireless application protocol (BioWAP) service which is accessible by mobile devices makes it possible to access bioinformatics services where normal PC or personal digital assistant (PDA) connections are not feasible. The BioWAP service includes major biological databases and applications demonstrating a simple method of implementing WAP interfaces to uncompliant applications i.e. the applications that are not WAP or Internet based. The BioWAP service can be browsed with any WAP terminal.(1);2002
We present a design and implementation for displaying and manipulating HTML pages on small handheld devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) or cellular phones. We introduce methods for summarizing parts of Web pages and HTML forms. Each Web page is broken into text units that can each be hidden partially displayed made fully visible or summarized. A variety of methods are introduced that summarize the text units. In addition HTML forms are also summarized by displaying just the text labels that prompt the use for input. We tested the relative performance of the summarization methods by asking human subjects to accomplish single-page information search tasks. We found that the combination of keywords and single-sentence summaries provides significant improvements in access times and number of required pen actions as compared to other schemes. Our experiments also show that our algorithms can identify the appropriate labels for forms in 95% of the cases allowing effective form support for small screens.;2002
We present an integrated discourse recipe-based model (DRM) for dialogue generation and interpretation. Discourse recipes are generalizations of discourse plans. The DRM has been implemented as part of a conversational agent that supports task-oriented dialogue between human and artificial pilots. The design of the DRM has been strongly influenced by its implementation in the Soar cognitive architecture. In the DRM discourse recipes are acquired as a side effect of dialogue planning. The discourse recipes can be used for generation and interpretation in future situations in place of planning and reasoning from first principles. We describe the motivation for a discourse recipe-based approach and present the design of the DRM.;2002
We study how decisions for word ordering and word choice in surface natural language generation can be automatically learned from annotated data. We examine four trainable systems for surface natural language generation in the air travel domain called NLG[1-4]. NLG1 is a lookup table which stores the most frequent phrase to express a concept and is intended as a baseline system for comparison purposes. NLG2 and NLG3 attempt to find the highest probability word sequence with respect to a maximum entropy probability model. They differ in that NLG2 predicts words left-to-right while NLG3 predicts words in dependency tree order. NLG4 requires a dependency-style grammar of phrase fragments and conditions on their use and attempts to find the highest probability word sequence that is consistent with the rules and conditions of the grammar. NLG4 has been implemented in a dialog strategy for a prototype air travel conversational system in which word order is dynamically modified to emphasize certain aspects of the run-time dialog state.

A high-density packaging technology is necessary to realize miniaturization and better performance of mobile electronics products like cellular phones and personal digital assistants. One of the most promising technologies is three-dimensional (3D)-stacked packaging technology. This paper describes a newly developed ultra high-density 3D-stacked package called a flexible carrier folded real chip size package (FFCSP). The stacked-FFCSP is fabricated by stacking very thin single chip packages (single-chip FFCSP) of real chip size on top of one another. Each single chip FFCSP consists of an LSI chip and a small piece of flexible printed circuit (FPC) which has an insulating layer made of thermoplastic resin. The advantages of the stacked-FFCSP are its small size thinness highly flexible assembly and good test yield compared with conventional stacked multi-chip packages (S-MCPs). The FFCSP will enable future miniaturization and raise the functionality of the next trend of mobile electronics products.;2003
A persistent problem with personal digital assistants (PDAs) is the difficulty of entering data into the devices. The best current solutions to the problem are small soft keyboards and constrained handwriting recognizers. Another solution is use of speech. PDAs do not yet have the power to support full speech dictation but they do have sufficient power to support voice spelling. Voice-spelling problems include the high acoustic confusability between certain letters of the alphabet and the difficulty of memorizing code words for the letters of the alphabet. This paper describes several User-Centered Design studies conducted to develop a voice-spelling alphabet for PDAs that overcomes these problems including: (1) the development of a model of user performance to assess the potential of voice spelling as an alternate input method for PDAs (2) Web-based surveys for determining the words that people tend to associate with the letters of the alphabet (3) accuracy experiments used to tune the final voice-spelling alphabet and (4) the development of a graphical user interface for displaying code words as a prompt when voice spelling is used. The results of these studies suggest that it would be worthwhile to develop a working voice-spelling system for PDAs in the future.;2003
Although researchers use internet-based surveys more often than ever in their research there is little research on the effect of incentives on response rate speed and cost. This study attempts to fill in some of the blanks by comparing the different incentives offered to respondents of web-based surveys. The results indicate that offering a luggage tag to each respondent and including them in a draw for a bigger value prize (a personal digital assistant) yields the highest response rate. In terms of response speed there are no significant differences among each incentive group. The most expensive group in terms of costs was the combination of luggage tag and prize draw.;2003
AnyHeart is a single-piece implantable biventricular assist device. This electromechanical BVAD has a moving-actuator mechanism. To monitor the status of AnyHeart from anywhere at any time a portable personal digital assistant (PDA) monitor and web-based remote monitoring system were developed. The PDA local monitoring system has replaced bulky personal computer monitoring systems. The web-based remote monitoring system has several functions such as data collecting storing and posting through the internet. Basically interventricular pressure (IVP) is a parameter indicating the filling level of the blood chambers of AnyHeart. The pump output can be estimated using IVP which is acquired noninvasively from AnyHeart. With the proposed method we can estimate the pump output with a small margin of error.;2003
As mobile handheld computing devices become more common and are used for an ever-increasing variety of tasks new mechanisms for data entry must be investigated. Personal digital assistants often provide a small stylus-activated soft keyboard as do some mobile phones that include touch screens. However there is little data regarding the importance of keyboard size or the users' tasks the effectiveness of these keyboards or user reactions to these keyboards. In this article an experiment designed to investigate these issues in the context of a palm-style QWERTY keyboard is described. In this study 30 novices completed 6 realistic tasks using either a small medium or large soft keyboard. The results not only confirm that keyboard size does not affect data entry rates but that making the keyboard smaller does not increase error rates or negatively impact preference ratings. However tasks that required users to switch between the alphabetic keyboard and the numeric keyboard do result in significantly slower data entry rates. A model that accurately predicts the time required to enter predefined text is presented and directions for future research are discussed.;2003
Automatic dialogue systems used for instance in call centers should be able to determine in a critical phase of the dialogue-indicated by the customers vocal expression of anger/irritation-when it is better to pass over to a human operator. At a first glance this does not seem to be a complicated task: It is reported in the literature that emotions can be told apart quite reliably on the basis of prosodic features. However these results are achieved most of the time in a laboratory setting with experienced speakers (actors) and with elicited controlled speech. We compare classification results obtained with the same feature set for elicited speech and for a Wizard-of-Oz scenario where users believe that they are really communicating with an automatic dialogue system. It turns out that the closer we get to a realistic scenario the less reliable is prosody as an indicator of the speakers' emotional state. As a consequence we propose to change the target such that we cease looking for traces of particular emotions in the users' speech but instead look for indicators of TROUBLE IN COMMUNICATION. For this reason we propose the module Monitoring of User State [especially of] Emotion (MOUSE) in which a prosodic classifier is combined with other knowledge sources such as conversationally peculiar linguistic behavior for example the use of repetitions. For this module preliminary experimental results are reported showing a more adequate modelling Of TROUBLE IN COMMUNICATION. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.;2003
Background and Objectives: In our previous projects students and residents have readily adopted personal digital assistants (PDAs) but faculty have generally been reluctant. The objective of the project reported here was to maximize adoption of PDAs by ourfaculty using a combination of strategies. Methods: Through cost-shared funding we provided full-time and community teachers with PocketPCs or Handspring Visors along with preinstalled medical soft-ware. Use patterns and satisfaction were assessed by structured questionnaire and focus group discussions. Results: For the calendar address book and pharmacopoeia we found that 83% of faculty use these two to three times per day. Cost sharing and software preinstallation were popular Device synchronization and e-mail showed potential but caused problems. Easy access to technical support from peers and a variety of information-sharing structures eased maintenance issues. Point-of-care data access was important to faculty Conclusions: With the right support structures faculty adopt PDAs in clinical and teaching settings.;2003
Background: Undergraduate medical education in the United States is changing. Many medical schools have developed a set of basic clinical skills (BCS) that all students are required to have mastered however very few have acquired objective information regarding specific student experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the BCS encounters for junior medical students at a large midwestern university utilizing a handheld personal digital assistant (PDA). Methods: A core curriculum of BCS was proposed and involved 52 procedures/skills. An electronic BCS database was developed utilizing HanDBase software and then placed on a PDA (Palm) and distributed to 25 third-year medical students randomly as they entered their clinical year. Students logged their skill encounters for 9 months and then electronically transferred the database by e-mail. Results: Students participated in 1115 procedural/skill encounters (range 17 to 90 median 41 average 44.6). Of the 52 core BCS all students performed 10. Fewer than 50% of students had any exposure to very common skills. Thirty-four percent of skill encounters occurred at a county hospital 19% at a clinic 10% at a university hospital 10% at a private hospital 7% at a VA hospital 4% at a children's hospital and 16% at miscellaneous locations. Conclusions: The PDA devices were simple and convenient to use while allowing for easy transfer and tabulation of database information by electronic mail. Significant gaps in BCS exposure were noted across the curriculum. Mentor sign-off on the PDA permitted early feedback opportunities. We can now begin to reward educators for skills mentoring and perform formal assessment of BCS within specific clerkships to enhance future educational objectives. (C) 2003 Excerpta Medica Inc.

Based on experience in orchestrating collaborative learning scenarios with ubiquitous computing technology three approaches for extending co-constructive modelling and discussion environments with Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) connected through a wireless network are described. One application is an annotation tool the second one replicates a modelling system on the PDA and the third one makes use of a wireless optical reader in addition to the PDA. They all provide 'lightweight' synchronisation mechanisms in PC-based environments. General design and implementation strategies for such extensions are discussed in terms of model view and controller.;2003
Building a collaborative trusting relationship with users is crucial in a wide range of applications such as advice-giving or financial transactions and some minimal degree of cooperativeness is required in all applications to even initiate and maintain an interaction with a user. Despite the importance of this aspect of human-human relationships few intelligent systems have tried to build user models of trust credibility or other similar interpersonal variables or to influence these variables during interaction with users. Humans use a variety of kinds of social language including small talk to establish collaborative trusting interpersonal relationships. We argue that such strategies can also be used by intelligent agents and that embodied conversational agents are ideally suited for this task given the myriad multimodal cues available to them for managing conversation. In this article we describe a model of the relationship between social language and interpersonal relationships a new kind of discourse planner that is capable of generating social language to achieve interpersonal goals and an actual implementation in an embodied conversational agent. We discuss an evaluation of our system in which the use of social language was demonstrated to have a significant effect on users' perceptions of the agent's knowledgableness and ability to engage users and on their trust credibility and how well they felt the system knew them for users manifesting particular personality traits.;2003

Delivering streaming video over wireless is an important component of many interactive multimedia applications running on personal wireless handheld devices. Such personal devices have to be inexpensive compact and lightweight. Wireless channels have a high channel bit error rate and limited bandwidth. Delay variation of packets due to network congestion and the high bit error rate degrades the quality of video at the handheld device. Multimedia application use a buffer at the handheld device smooth out the delay variation and improve the quality of streaming video. However the buffer size has to be kept small in order to reduce the size weight and power consumption of handheld devices. In this paper we propose a novel selective retransmission scheme for multimedia transmission over wireless networks. Our scheme is based on retransmission of only the most important information in a video in order to achieve a high quality of video. Our objective is to develop a simple cost effective scheme which offers an acceptable video quality over a noisy wireless channel using a small buffer size at the handheld device. We have developed an analytical Model to determine the networking requirements video quality as a function of video compression parameters and network error conditions and optimally dimension the buffer at the handheld device.;2003
Emerging radio technologies like WLAN and Bluetooth enable electronic devices of any kind to communicate with one another. A simple and easy to implement application layer protocol called BTRC protocol was developed allowing devices to exchange data of any kind and format over different protocols like TCP/IP or Bluetooth. Based upon this protocol a universal remote control system was implemented. Software applications simulating cellular phones and personal digital assistants (PDA) were developed as remote control devices. BTRC server devices send their graphical XML based user interface to the remote control. In this way the use of household devices is simplified significantly.;2003
Existing IrDA standard optical wireless links operate at data rates up to 16 Mbit/s. Such links are incorporated into millions of products such as mobile phones personal digital assistants laptop and palmtop PCs. Longer term IrDA is destined to create standards for links at even higher data rates. The performance of such links depends crucially on the efficient operation of the IrDA IrLAP protocol. The authors examine the IrDA IrLAP protocol performance at data rates up to 100 Mbit/s. Using a mathematical analysis based on the concept of 'window transmission time' the throughput equation of IrLAP is derived. Subsequently optimum values for important design parameters of the link layer such as window size and frame length are derived for maximum IrLAP throughput as a function of BER. The results indicate that the IrLAP protocol offers excellent performance even at 100 Mbit/s. High link layer throughput even at high data bit error rates is possible provided the IrLAP window size and frame length values are adapted to optimum values for the corresponding BER. Results are presented on link performance limited due to the turnaround time. Such results are important to hardware manufacturers of high speed optical wireless links.;2003
Expert systems (ES) which are a branch of artificial intelligence has been widely used in different applications including medical consultation and more recently in rehabilitation for assessment and intervention. The development and validation of an expert system for memory rehabilitation (ES-MR) is reported here. Through a web-based platform ES-MR can provide experts with better decision making in providing intervention for persons with brain injuries stroke and dementia. The application and possible commercial production of a simultaneously developed version for non-expert users is proposed. This is especially useful for providing remote assistance to persons with permanent memory impairment when they reach a plateau of cognitive training and demand a prosthetic system to enhance memory for day-to-day independence. The potential use of ES-MR as a cognitive aid in conjunction with WAP mobile phones Bluetooth technology and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) is suggested as an avenue for future study.;2003
Handheld computers also known as personal digital assistants (PDAs) are becoming an increasingly valuable aid to physicians at the point of care. We review the use of handheld computers and their impact in clinical practice and medical education. Clinicians commonly use PDAs to access patient data and as a clinical reference tool. In medical education handheld computers are most frequently used to track patient encounters and procedures done during medical school rotations and residency training. This report describes some interesting applications for present and future use of PDAs in inpatient care and medical education. Physicians and educational programs not using PDAs may wish to consider incorporating this technology.;2003
Improved microsurgical technique has resulted in a high percentage of successful free tissue transfers. When a tissue transfer fails in the head and neck however the results are orocutaneous fistulas carotid artery exposure and deformity that adds morbidity expense and may delay adjuvant therapy. Postoperative monitoring of tissue perfusion can detect early problems in free tissue transfer that may allow for early intervention and salvage. The authors have demonstrated that reflectance photoplethys-mography can detect perfusion changes in free tissue transfer within 5 minutes of a pedicle insult intraoperatively. Normative data for viable flaps from various donor sites have been established. The authors now report their initial experience with a newly developed reflectance photoplethysmograph based on a hand-held computer for routine clinical use. Their results are compared with a conventional surveillance protocol that included observation bleeding to pin prick and bedside duplex scanning of the vascular pedicle. In a series of 30 free tissue transfers (29 patients) there was one ischemic event (skin paddle loss only) which was detected by the monitor. The monitor was able to predict correctly (one flap) survival of a free tissue transfer even when duplex ultrasonic data were indicative of an absence of perfusion. Personal digital assistant-based photoplethysmography appears to be a promising device for bedside diagnosis of free tissue transfer viability or ischemia.;2003
In recent years a question of great interest has been the development of tools and techniques to facilitate the evaluation of dialogue systems. The latter can be evaluated from various points of view such as recognition and understanding rates dialogue naturalness and robustness against recognition errors. Evaluation usually requires compiling a large corpus of words and sentences uttered by users relevant to the application domain the system is designed for. This paper proposes a new technique that makes it possible to reuse such a corpus for the evaluation and to check the performance of the system when different dialogue strategies are used. The technique is based on the automatic generation of conversations between the dialogue system together with an additional dialogue system called user simulator that represents the user's interaction with the dialogue system. The technique has been applied to evaluate a dialogue system developed in our lab using two different recognition front-ends and two different dialogue strategies to handle user confirmations. The experiments show that the prompt-dependent recognition front-end achieves better results but that this front-end is appropriate only if users limit their utterances to those related to the current system prompt. The prompt-independent front-end achieves inferior results but enables front-end users to utter any permitted utterance at any time irrespective of the system prompt. In consequence this front-end may allow a more natural and comfortable interaction. The experiments also show that the re-prompting confirmation strategy enhances system performance for both recognition front-ends. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.;2003
In this article we present a PDA-based system for extending human memory or/and information retrieval using a human face as the lookup index. The system can help a user to remember names of people whom he/she has met before and find useful information such as names and research interests about people whom he/she is interested in talking to. The system uses a captured face image as the lookup index to retrieve information from some available resource such as departmental directory web sites personal homepages etc. We describe the development of a PDA-based face recognition system and introduce algorithms for image preprocessing to enhance the quality of the image by sharpening focus and normalizing both lighting condition and head rotation. We use a unified LDA/PCA algorithm for face recognition. We address design issues of the interface to assist in visualization and comprehension of retrieved information. We present user study and experiment results to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed System. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2003
In this paper we revisit the concept of mandatory access control and investigate its potential with personal digital assistants (PDA). Only if applications are clearly separated and Trojans cannot leak personal information can these PDAs become personal trusted devices. Limited processing power and memory can be overcome by using Web services instead of full-fledged applications-a trend also in non-mobile computing. Web services however introduce additional security risks some of them specific for mobile users. We propose an identification scheme that can be effectively used to protect privacy and show how this system builds upon a light-weight version of mandatory access control.;2003
In this paper we treat design philosophies and enabling technologies for ambient awareness within grids of future mobile computing/communication devices. We extensively describe the possible context sensors their required accuracies their use in mobile services-possibly leading to background interactions of user devices-as well as a draft of their integration into an ambient aware device. We elaborate on position sensing as one of the main aspects of context aware systems. We first describe a maximum accuracy setup for a mobile user that has the ability of Augmented Reality for indoor and outdoor applications. We then focus on a set-up for pose sensing of a mobile user based on the fusion of several inertia sensors and DGPS. We describe the anchoring of the position of the user by using visual tracking using a camera and image processing. We describe our experimental set-up with a background process that once initiated by the DGPS system continuously looks in the image for visual clues and-when found-tries to track them to continuously adjust the inertial sensor system. We present some results of our combined inertia tracking and visual tracking system we are able to track device rotation and position with an update rate of 10 ms with an accuracy for the rotation of about two degrees whereas head position accuracy is in the order of a few cm at a visual clue distance of less than 3 m.

In this paper an important question whether a small language model can be practically accurate enough is raised. Afterwards the purpose of a language model the problems that a language model faces and the factors that affect the performance of a language model are analyzed. Finally a novel method for language model compression is proposed which makes the large language model usable for applications in handheld devices such as mobiles smart phones personal digital assistants (PDAs) and handheld personal computers (HPCs). In the proposed language model compression method three aspects are included. First the language model parameters are analyzed and a criterion based on the importance measure of n-grams is used to determine which n-grams should be kept and which removed. Second a piecewise linear warping method is proposed to be used to compress the uni-gram count values in the full language model. And third a rank-based quantization method is adopted to quantize the bi-gram probability values. Experiments show that by using this compression method the language model can be reduced dramatically to only about 1M bytes while the performance almost does not decrease. This provides good evidence that a language model compressed by means of a well-designed compression technique is practically accurate enough and it makes the language model usable in handheld devices.;2003
In this paper we give a short overview of the SMARTKom system a flexible and adaptive multimodal dialog system. The system uses a common dialog backbone to realize three interaction scenarios. Through the use of generic methods and knowledize sources for multimodal fusion and fission we were able to develop a generic dialog system for flexible multimodal interaction. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we present an agent-based system designed to support the adoption of knowledge sharing practices within communities. The system is based on a conceptual framework that by modelling the adoption of knowledge management practices as a change process identifies the pedagogical strategies best suited to support users through the various stages of the adoption process. Learning knowledge management practices is seen as a continuous process taking place at individual and social level that includes the acquisition of information as well as the contextual use of the information acquired. The resulting community-based system provides each member of the community with an artificial personal change-management agent capable of guiding users in the acquisition and adoption of new knowledge sharing practices by activating personalised and contextualised intervention.

Limited information is available on personal digital assistant (PDA) use patterns in medical settings. Recognizing that use patterns may be important considerations for development of handheld-based information systems the authors characterized PDA use at their institution. A survey was mailed to all internal medicine physicians at the Mayo Clinic Rochester Minnesota in May 2002. PDA use prevalence user demographics hardware preferences and work setting and application use frequencies were assessed for respondents reporting current PDA use. Use patterns of trainees (residents and subspecialty fellows) and attending physicians were compared. Trainees reported more frequent PDA use in the hospital setting and for direct patient care. Attending physicians reported more frequent PDA use in administrative settings and for calendar functions. These findings may reflect differences in the information needs and work roles of learners and experienced physicians. Such factors may be important considerations for the development and implementation of institutional PDA resources.;2003
Literacy learning - learning how to read and write - begins long before children enter school. One of the key skills to reading and writing is the ability to represent thoughts symbolically and share them in language with an audience who may not necessarily share the same temporal and spatial context. Children learn and practice these important language skills everyday telling stories with the peers and adults around them. In particular storytelling in the context of peer collaboration provides a key environment for children to learn language skills important for literacy. In light of this an embodied conversational agent Sam  who tells stories collaboratively with children was designed. Sam looks like a peer for pre-school children but tells stories in a developmentally advanced way modelling narrative skills important for literacy. Results demonstrated that children who played with the virtual peer told stories that more closely resembled the virtual peer's linguistically advanced stories: using more quoted speech and temporal and spatial expressions. In addition children listened to Sam's stories carefully assisting her and suggesting improvements. The potential benefits of having technology play a social role in young children's literacy learning is discussed.;2003
Modern Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) architectures often utilize a wholesale data transfer protocol known as slow sync for synchronizing PDAs with Personal Computers (PCs). This approach is markedly inefficient with respect to bandwidth usage latency and energy consumption since the PDA and PC typically share many common records. We propose analyze and implement a novel PDA synchronization scheme (CPIsync) predicated upon recent information-theoretic research. The salient property of this scheme is that its communication complexity depends on the number of differences between the PDA and PC and is essentially independent of the overall number of-records. Moreover our implementation shows that the computational complexity and energy consumption of CPIsync is practical and that the overall latency is typically much smaller than that of slow sync or alternative synchronization approaches based on Bloom filters. Thus CPIsync has potential for significantly improving synchronization protocols for PDAs and more generally for heterogeneous networks of many machines.;2003
OBJECTIVE: To review some common medical applications available for personal digital assistants (PDAs) with brief discussion of the different PDA operating systems and memory requirements. Key search terms included handheld PDA personal digital assistants and medical applications. DATA SOURCES: The literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1999-August 2002). Other information was obtained through secondary sources such as Web sites describing common PDAs. DATA SYNTHESIS: Medical applications available on PDAs are numerous and include general drug references specialized drug references (e.g. pediatrics geriatrics cardiology infectious disease) diagnostic guides medical calculators herbal medication references nursing references toxicology references and patient tracking databases. Costs and memory requirements for these programs can vary consequently the healthcare provider must limit the medication applications that are placed on the handheld computer. CONCLUSIONS: This article attempts to systematically describe the common medical applications available for the handheld computer along with cost memory and download requirements and Web site information. This review found many excellent PDA drug information applications offering many features which will aid the healthcare provider. Very likely after using these PDA applications the healthcare provider will find them indispensable as their multifunctional capabilities can save time improve accuracy and allow for general business procedures as well as being a quick reference tool. To avoid the benefits of this technology might be a step backward.;2003
Over the past decade computer-assisted learning in the field of chemistry has given rise to a large number of systems that approach this objective from different viewpoints: static courses aimed at specific concepts tutorial systems 2D and 3D virtual environments and so on. Correct structuring and representation of the knowledge to be taught the building of a suitable student interface and the adaptation of the learning process to the knowledge of the student are but a few of the challenges to be faced in the development of efficient computer-assisted learning systems. The present study tackles the use of computerized dialogue systems as a viable alternative for the simulation of teacher-student interaction and proposes an ontology for the characterization of such interaction employing the object-oriented paradigm in the modeling of both the knowledge to be taught and the actual level of the student. The proposed solution is based on the representation of the knowledge to be taught through a network of multiconnected knowledge frames (chunks) where each chunk may be specialized in more specific frames (prerequisites and subobjectives) contain associated explanations of varying complexity and with a range of explanatory models and be associated with one or a set of possible questions the student might ask to this end a constantly evolving knowledge model is maintained throughout the explanatory process. Based on the proposed model Java was used to develop and manage an explanatory system that could be used in any type of teaching system based on student-dominated dialogues. Here the system has been applied to the teaching of chemistry laboratory practice by its integration into the Virtual Chemistry Laboratory (VCL) a system designed by the authors to simulate chemistry techniques in a virtual 3D world.;2003
Paper keyboard or mouse-driven systems may not be suitable for data capture because of the hands-busy constraint imposed by an endoscopic examination. A Spoken Dialogue System (SDS) has a number of advantages when compared to keyboard and mouse-driven input modalities particularly with respect to hands free and eyes-free control of a system. However any emerging technology will never deliver improved organizational effectiveness if it is not accepted and used [1]. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) provides a framework that helps explain the determinants of computer acceptance [2]. This study through the application of TAM demonstrates a high level of user acceptance with clinicians wanting to use spoken dialogue technology for recording clinical observations during an endoscopic examination. Clinicians would also prefer to use a SDS for recording endoscopy rather than use a paper-based or keyboard and mouse-driven system. Using a clinical narrative during an endoscopic examination was also perceived to be a natural way to record findings. Relationships between basic TAM variables were confirmed and relationships between quality of dialogue measures and TAM variables were established.;2003
Personal digital assistants (PDAs also known as handheld computers pocket personal computers and Palm Pilots) provide immediate access to vital and clinically relevant infectious diseases information at the point of care. Several infectious diseases applications are available that provide information on pathogens diagnosis medication and treatment. In this article 4 infectious diseases PDA applications are reviewed: ePocrates ID (part of ePocrates Rx Pro) the Johns Hopkins Division of Infectious Diseases Antibiotic Guide the 2002 Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy and Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobials Notes. Drug information including clinical pharmacology dosing in patients with renal insufficiency adverse reactions and drug interactions is evaluated for completeness and accuracy by comparison of each application with the package insert. Treatment recommendations for 6 diseases are compared with current practice guidelines. Each PDA infectious diseases application reviewed has unique advantages and disadvantages. This critical review will help health care professionals select the infectious diseases PDA application best tailored to meet their individual information needs.;2003
Personal digital assistants are lightweight inexpensive and ubiquitous. Furthermore they have desktop class operating systems features supported by industrial strength development tools. These devices provide an ideal platform for deploying a practical platform for I2C bus analysis. In this paper we propose a low-cost highly-portable I2C bus analyzer on a PalmOS based PDA. We describe the hardware interface the supporting libraries and the PalmOS compliant application. The proposed approach is flexible and supports the creation of additional bus analyzer applications by third parties. The example bus analyzer application described here provides three operating modes passive snooping active bus mastering and active slave device emulation. Each mode can function over a number of user-selectable data rates(1).;2003
Practitioners of rheumatology in the 21st century are increasingly recognizing the benefits of computer technology as they relate to point-of-service care delivered in the hospital or in the outpatient setting. Electronic medical records and other computer-driven aids are resources emerging as affordable tools that can greatly enhance the rheumatologist's ability to provide stellar care reduce professional and administrative burdens and improve lifestyle measures. Herein we provide a practical nontechnical introduction to the world of electronic medical records personal digital assistants and other computer-dependent tools with an emphasis placed on how these instruments can be used by the clinical rheumatologist to achieve excellence in medical care.;2003
Purpose: Handheld computer technology provides a unique opportunity for health care professionals to access real time or near real time patient information and evidence-based resources at the point-of-care. The purpose of this study was to assess one physician's experience using acute pain assessment software on a personal digital assistant (PDA) to assess patients on an acute pain management service (APMS). Methods: Using a historical control and a time and motion study design comparisons were made on acute pain assessment time and comprehensiveness when patient assessments are documented on a PDA vs the current paper-based method. Results: The study physician (a PDA-user) reported feeling comfortable with the assessment software after five patient assessments. PDA assessments were more likely to contain documentation regarding pain and side effects (e.g. nausea pruritus hypotension) than the paper assessments. The median time of the assessment only component of the patent encounter was 53 sec longer using the PDA compared to paper (P < 0.00) however the median total encounter (chart review assessment documentation) time was 74 sec shorter using the PDA vs paper (P < 0.00). Discussion: The findings of this preliminary study suggest that the PDA is a reliable tool that meets the data management requirements within an APMS setting. This study found that patient assessments documented using acute pain software developed for use on a PDA were as efficient and content-rich as paper assessments. The PDA may even enhance the efficiency of the patient assessment process through the provision of more comprehensive digital data for research clinical and administrative needs.;2003
Recent technology advances in mobile networking have ushered in a new era of personal communication. Users can ubiquitously access the Internet via many emerging mobile appliances such as portable notebooks personal digital assistants (PDAs) and WAP-enabled cellular phones. While the transcoding proxy is attracting an increasing amount of attention in this environment it is noted that new caching strategies are required for these transcoding proxies. We propose in this paper an efficient cache replacement algorithm for transcoding proxies. Specifically we formulate a generalized profit function to evaluate the profit from caching each version of an object. This generalized profit function explicitly considers several new emerging factors in the transcoding proxy and the aggregate effect of caching multiple versions of the same object. It is noted that the aggregate effect is not simply the sum of the costs of caching individual versions of an object but rather depends on the transcoding relationship among these versions. The notion of a weighted transcoding graph is devised to evaluate the corresponding aggregate effect efficiently. Utilizing the generalized profit function and the weighted transcoding graph we propose in this paper an innovative cache replacement algorithm for transcoding proxies. In addition an effective data structure is designed to facilitate the management of the multiple versions of different objects cached in the transcoding proxy. Using an event-driven simulation it is shown that the algorithm proposed consistently outperforms companion schemes in terms of the delay saving ratios and cache hit ratios.;2003
Recently Zhu et al. proposed an password-based authenticated key exchange protocol based on RSA such that it is efficient enough to be implemented on most of the target low-power devices such as smart cards and low-power Personal Digital Assistants in wireless networks. They claimed that the proposed scheme is secure against dictionary attacks. In this paper we show that the scheme proposed by Zhu et al. is insecure against undetectable on-line password guessing attacks. Furthermore we examine Zhu et al.'s protocol and find that Zhu et al.'s protocol does not achieve explicit key authentication. An improved version is then proposed to defeat the undetectable on-line password guessing attacks and also provide explicit key authentication.;2003
The aim of this study was to achieve one-stage screening for trisomy 21 using a combination of nuchal translucency (NuT) measurement and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) biochemistry levels in the second trimester among a high-risk study population. From January 1998 to June 2001 45 cases of trisomy 21 were prenatally found and confirmed in the hospital-based cytogenetic diagnosis laboratory. A total of 867 normal singleton pregnancies were enrolled as controls from the antenatal care clinics in the hospital. All study and control subjects between 13 weeks and 18 weeks of gestation with a mean age of 15.2 +/- 1.3 weeks underwent one-stage nuchal translucence measurements and maternal serum biochemical screening for Down syndrome. The final logistic model contained beta-hCG (multiples of the gestational median or MoM) maternal age (matA) nuchal translucence (NuT MoM) and AFP (MoM) as covariates. Also the estimated coefficients of the regression were highly significant. This model provided the estimated probability of Down syndrome as follows: Pr (Down syndrome) = exp (Z)/ [1 + exp (Z)] where Z = - 11.18 + 0.64 x (beta-hCG MoM) + 0.25 x matA + 1.32 x NuT MoM -2.23 x AFP MoM. The logistic regression with estimated coefficients was installed in a Palm digital assistant (PDA) equipped with Excel(R) (Microsoft). The risk probability of Down syndrome could be readily calculated after inputting data for all four predictor variables.

The availability of text reading and editing software for Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) makes it timely to consider whether PDAs are useful tools for reading learning materials. This paper describes a study that evaluated the use of PDAs for reading by students on a Masters course run by the UK Open University. The evaluation consisted of pre- and post-questionnaires and follow-up interviews. In addition students discussed their experiences in a computer-based conference. Findings show that while the portability of the device was welcomed by students and the electronic format was advantageous limitations such as the small screen size navigation difficulties and slow and error-prone methods for entering text made it difficult to read and interact with documents on the PDA. The paper recommends that further research consider the value of PDAs as reading devices in the context of other potential ways that PDAs can be used as learning tools.;2003
The future of human-computer interfaces may include systems which are human-like in abilities and behavior. One particularly interesting aspect of human-to-human communication is the ability of some conversation partners to sensitively pick up on the nuances of the other's utterances as they shift from moment to moment and to use this information to subtly adjust responses to express interest supportiveness sympathy and the like. This paper reports a model of this ability in the context of a spoken dialog system for a tutoring-like interaction. The system used information about the user's internal state-such as feelings of confidence confusion pleasure and dependency-as inferred from the prosody of his utterances and the context and used this information to select the most appropriate acknowledgement form at each moment. Although straight-forward rating reveals no significant preference for a system with this ability a clear preference was found when users rated the system after listening to a recording of their interaction with it. This suggests that human-like real-time sensitivity can be of value in interfaces. The paper further discusses ways to discover and quantify such rules of social interaction using corpus-based analysis developer intuitions and feedback from naive judges and further suggests that the technique of evaluation after re-listening is useful for evaluating spoken dialog systems which operate at near-human levels of performance.

The Implicit Association Test (IAT) uses reaction times to measure implicit linkages among concepts or between concepts and attributes. The Palm IAT is a simplified version of the IAT that runs on Palm Pilot or Handspring Visor personal digital assistant devices. The Palm IAT is portable provides precise measurement and allows for efficient data collection inside or outside the laboratory. Three studies were conducted to assess its practical usefulness. Study 1 (N = 12) replicated a previous demonstration of more favorable implicit associations for flowers than for insects. Study 2 (N = 9) found individual differences in linking the self-concept to characteristics of agency and communion. Study 3 (N = 23) found individual differences in linking the self-concept to characteristics of boldness and friendliness. Reliability of the Palm IAT is similar to reliability of the original desktop computer version. Using the Palm IAT one can study hard-to-reach populations in unusual settings.;2003
The known Wizard of Oz method designed for the development of dialogue systems interacting with a user using a natural language is considered. The method is based on the hypothesis on computer speech which states that a human interacts with a computer in a different way to how he/she interacts with other humans. Therefore before simulating a natural dialogue corresponding to the rules and norms of human conversation using a computer one should try to model computer speech that is simpler than human speech in its structure. We describe our experience in the application of the Wizard of Oz method and analyze the dialogues collected by this method with the aim of developing the principles of functioning of the control module of our dialogue system.;2003
The medical procedures at the patient bedside are out of the scope of current HIS/RIS systems which means that patient record and image data access during the medical visit or the execution recording and confirmation of the medicine prescriptions stilt do not enjoy computerized support. As a consequence the necessary inclusion of new data to the patient record stilt needs to be carried out through notations on paper and later typed causes delays on the availability of this information (Mobile computing in a hospital: the Ward-In-Hand project. SAC 2000-ACM Symposium on Applied Computing Marco 2000 Villa Olmo Como Italy). This paper presents a software technology where the medical and nursing staff will be equipped with a handheld computer connected by radio to a central server that provides access to the electronic patient records and that wilt actively inform about tasks pending distribution. The server acts as a database for multimodal electronic patient record information storing patient data from computerized tomography (CT) ultrasonography (US) magnetic resonance (MRI) images and also medical findings observations and prescriptions coded as DICOM Structured Reports (Digital Image and Communications in Medicine). The prototype described in this article implements a medical images and structured reports server that makes the search and recovery of data stored in the DICOM standard possible.

The next generation of mobile systems is expected to support multiple radio access technologies as well as diverse types of terminals including mobile phones personal digital assistants and laptops as well as personal area moving and sensor networks. Thus future wireless systems will not only continue to break technological barriers in terms of new air interface. capabilities higher bit rates mobility security and QoS management but will present new end-to-end scenarios in which applications access services over multiple L2 hops and multiple IP networks. The term alwaysbest connected refers to the concept of defining a set of access selection criteria and mechanisms that allow users to get connected to various services in a nearly optimal manner. Providing QoS in this type of heterogeneous multihop environment is a challenging task because applications may be completely unaware of the scenario and the underlying layer 2 technologies that can be quite different at different hops. For instance some wireless links may. have scarce resources and highly optimized QoS mechanisms others may not support explicit QoS handling at all. In this article we consider the use of IP-level QoS. signaling as a key component to support the end-to-end QoS for various applications. We Propose a small set of application programmer- and wireless-link-friendly IP QoS parameters (wireless hints) and illustrate the use of these in a specific WLAN-to-cellular handover situation. We conclude that the proposed model signaling protocol and wireless information elements can efficiently support QoS in heterogeneous mobile environments.;2003
The next phase of the digital revolution in medicine is taking place through the dissemination of powerful handheld computers. Handheld computers or personal digital assistants (PDAs) are no longer considered either a curiosity or a toy. The current handheld computer has many features (Internet access simple e-mail client software spreadsheet and database programs word processing and digital media) that make it an ideal tool for healthcare providers. Improvements in handwriting recognition display characteristics and wireless networking capabilities provide a platform for real-time review of both large static and dynamic repositories of patient data. Although earlier PDA models lacked the ability to display medical images appropriately current PDAs boast display characteristics that approach low-resolution computer monitors. Although the handheld computer is not yet a reliable option for soft-copy reading it offers many features that can improve work flow and efficiency for the radiologist. These features include improved personal information management decision support via access to educational materials and remote access to radiology-related information systems.;2003
The process of developing and implementing an intranet Web site for clinical intervention documentation is described. An inpatient pharmacy department initiated an organizationwide effort to improve documentation of interventions by pharmacists at its seven hospitals to achieve real-time capture of meaningful bench-marking data. Standardization of intervention types would allow the health system to contrast and compare medication use process improvement and patient care initiatives among its hospitals. After completing a needs assessment and reviewing current methodologies a computerized tracking tool was developed in-house and integrated with the organization's intranet. Representatives from all hospitals agreed on content and functionality requirements for the Web site. The site was completed and activated in February 2002. Before this Web site was established the most documented intervention types were Renal Adjustment and Clarify Dose with a daily average of four and three respectively. After site activation daily averages for Renal Adjustment remained unchanged but Clarify Dose is now documented nine times per day. Drug information and i.v.-to-p.o. intervention types which previously averaged less than one intervention per day are now documented an average of four times daily. Approximately 91% of staff pharmacists are using this site. Future plans for this site include enhanced accessibility to the site with wireless personal digital assistants. The design and implementation of an intranet Web site to document pharmacists' interventions doubled the rate of intervention documentation and standardized the intervention types among hospitals in the health system.;2003
The spread of mobile appliances such as cellular phones and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) and the development of positioning technology based on GPS (Global Positioning System) and base-station information have led to the development of Location Based Services (LBSs). NVML (Navigation Markup Language) is an XML proposed by Fujitsu for describing navigation information such as the position and route of a moving object (e.g. a human or a car) and related information. This paper introduces NVML as an example of an XML for LBSs and describes some NVML systems and applications.;2003
The use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to document pharmacist cognitive services and estimate potential reimbursement was studied. Between September 2001 and February 2002 four pharmacy residents and four clinical pharmacists used PDAs for documenting cognitive services. Interventions recorded on paper during the same six-month period one year earlier were reviewed for comparison. Potential reimbursement for these services was calculated by linking current procedural terminology codes and charges to the electronically documented services. Over the six-month study period pharmacists recorded 7319 interventions with PDAs compared with 5028 documented on paper during the earlier six-month period. Potential claims for pharmacists' cognitive services documented with PDAs amounted to more than $1 million in the six months assuming a 100% reimbursement rate. PDAs provide a simple efficient paperless system for documenting pharmacists' clinical services and generating reimbursement claims.;2003
There is surely no doubt that computers play an important role in our life. The use of computers ranges from convenient tools like calculators to various life saving equipment. They help to save a great amount of human effort in many areas. To accomplish special tasks in different workplaces it would be of great advantage to develop proper devices and to use wearable computers to meet the goals successfully. That is why we use the support of different kinds of computers such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) Digital Bar Code Reader etc. Using a portable or wearable computer we can work outside our offices or even in bed. Thus our work environment has changed considerably. In many new environments computers can help us to increase our perception and interaction abilities. Augmented Reality (AR) is a good example of a tool used to enhance a human's perception and interaction abilities. AR provides a natural method for presenting computer-generated information by overlaying graphics into a view of the real world. This paper describes a personal identity annotation system using a wearable computer for an AR environment which allows its user to recognize unknown persons. For implementing the proposed system uses skin-color pixels coupled with shape and face features to detect and track faces in images taken by a wearable camera. Faces in a view are detected by searching for connected regions of skin color pixels. For each region big enough an elliptic area is determined with the highest image gradient magnitude around the perimeter and the highest number of enclosed skin color pixels. The face regions enclosed by the determined ellipses are then used by the system to recognize multiple faces based on the face similarity. Experimental results show that the proposed system has both quality and performance to be used as a guiding system for visitors in various environments.;2003
This article presents a multiagent simulation environment for studying agents' socio-political attitudes. It departs from a previously proposed concept of agents with socio-political attitudes a high-level theoretical and conceptual model proposed by Petric et al. (2002) that was intended for conversational agents. In contrast our work pursues a bottom-up simulation philosophy where attitudes are grounded in sensory-motor behaviour of spatially distributed autonomous agents modelled in Webots simulation software. The original model was extended by defining an agent's socio-political type by means of weighting the three components found in the Petric et al. (2002) model (neo-liberal alternative and fundamentalist) thus allowing the creation of mixed sociopolitical types. Also in the simulations performed issues were modelled as agents with variable levels of importance. Moreover we introduced inter-agent communication capable of causing changes in socio-political types. Results are presented and discussed with respect to the initial research questions. According to our experimental results the following parameters did not have any significant impact on the simulation outcomes: initial physical position and orientation of the agents positions of the issues the issues' dynamics and inter-agent communication. Experiments with different initial agent types showed that agents with indeterminate socio-political types tended to change to neo-liberal alternative or fundamentalist agents. We conclude by proposing future extensions of the model. Our work is related to a trend in the Artificial Intelligence community which is not primarily task or problem-solving oriented but rather focuses on the study of the embodied and situated nature of social behaviour in humans.;2003
This paper considers design methodologies in order to develop voice-enabled interfaces for tour-guide robots deployed at the Robotics Exposition of the Swiss National Exhibition (Expo.02). Human-robot voice communication presents new challenges for design of fully autonomous mobile robots in that interactivity must be robot-initiated in conversation and within a dynamic adverse environment. We approached these general problems for a voice-enabled interface tailored to limited computational resources of one on-board processor when integrating smart speech signal acquisition automatic speech recognition and synthesis as well as a dialogue system into the multi-modal multi-sensor interface for the expo tour-guide robot. We also focus on particular issues that needed to be addressed in voice-based interaction when planning specific tasks and research experiments for Expo.02 where tour-guide robots had to interact with hundreds of thousands of visitors over 6 months 7 days a week 10 h per day.;2003
This paper describes the author's experiences of using handheld computers within scenario-based formative assessments aimed at developing clinical procedural skills. Previous experiences of using paper in these assessments were problematic. Multiple paper forms were generated and data sets were sometimes incomplete. Forms adapted for use on handheld computers offer significant potential advantages over paper-based versions. These include streamlining the process of data collection entry and retrieval thereby reducing data loss and providing learners with immediate and cumulative feedback on their performance. All participants in this study found the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) forms easy to use. Further adaptation will address users' feedback by providing more space for free text and a larger visual field. Technical expertise is required for the development and delivery of PDA-based forms but their potential for use in formative and summative assessments is considerable.;2003
This paper develops a mobile learning system for scaffolding students learning about bird-watching. The aim is to construct an outdoor mobile-learning activity using up-to-date wireless technology. The proposed Bird-Watching Learning (BWL) system is designed using a wireless mobile ad-hoc network. In the BWL system each learner has a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) with a Wi-Fi-based (IEEE 802.11b) wireless network card. The BWL system offers a mobile learning system which supports the students learning through scaffolding. The aim of a formative evaluation was twofold: to explore the possible roles and scaffolding aids that the mobile learning device offers for bird-watching activities and to investigate whether student learning benefited from the mobility portability and individualisation of the mobile learning device.;2003
This paper introduces Gulliver's Genie a context-aware tourist guide that assists roaming tourists. The approach adopted within this system is the deployment of intelligent agents which collectively determine the user context and retrieve and assemble multi-media presentations that are wirelessly transmitted and displayed on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). As a backdrop we first consider the state of the art in terms of context sensitive tourist guides telecommunications positioning technology and agent technologies. Gulliver's Genie considers user context in terms of position orientation and user profile. System agents are strong intentional agents that base deductions on a mental state comprising of Beliefs Desires and Intentions (BDI). This paper presents the design of the system together with a glimpse of the user experience. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.;2003
This paper presents a vision of the near future in which computer interaction is characterized by natural face-to-face conversations with lifelike characters that speak emote and gesture. These animated agents will converse with people much like people converse effectively with assistants in a variety of focused applications. Despite the research advances required to realize this vision and the lack of strong experimental evidence that animated agents improve human-computer interaction we argue that initial prototypes of perceptive animated interfaces can be developed today and that the resulting systems will provide more effective and engaging communication experiences than existing systems. In support of this hypothesis we first describe initial experiments using an animated character to teach speech and language skills to children with hearing problems and classroom subjects and social skills to children with autistic spectrum disorder. We then show how existing dialogue system architectures can be transformed into perceptive animated interfaces by integrating computer vision and animation capabilities. We conclude by describing the Colorado Literacy Tutor a computer-based literacy program that provides an ideal testbed for research and development of perceptive animated interfaces and consider next steps required to realize the vision.;2003
This paper proposes a new concept of a shared and combined screen for new small devices called GDA (Group Digital Assistant). In the GDA the screens of two PDAs can be shared at a sharing view mode and can be treated just like one screen at a combination mode. The GDA uses a wireless LAN and Bluetooth for radio communication. We have developed application software and experimented in cooperative work for evaluation. We found that functions of the GDA were effective in actual cooperative work. The concept of the GDA can make flexible usage of a cellular phone and a PDA in the next generation.1.;2003
This paper reports on a current project KNOWMOBILE that explores how wireless and mobile technologies in this case how Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) may be useful in medical education and clinical practice particularly to access net-based information. KNOWMOBILE is a research collaboration involving academic and industrial partners which aims to support Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and the integration of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) in medical education reform in Norway. What does 'just-in-time' access to information mean in clinical settings? How can health professionals be helped with access to the most up-to-date medical information? From a preliminary analysis of the problems of Personal Digital Assistants in use - and nonuse - problems regarding information and communication infrastructure discussed that require work from a social historical interpretation of 'infrastructures' in order to enhance design perspectives and directions for future research. It is concluded that the PDAs should not be regarded as Personal Digital Assistants but rather as gateways in complicated webs of interdependent technical and social networks.;2003
This paper reports on an evaluation of the reactions of participants in a computer-controlled telephone conversation system (telephone-linked care TLC) designed to offer nutrition and exercise counseling. After 6 months in the study subjects were asked a series of questions about their opinions of the TLC system including overall satisfaction and the system's helpfulness. One hundred and ninety individuals completed the attitude survey. On a scale of 0-100 respondents rated the overall satisfaction and helpfulness of the system at 63.6 and 62.3. Subjects using the nutrition counseling version of TLC rated it significantly higher on satisfaction (73.0 versus 52.4) and helpfulness (70.3 versus 53.7) than did subjects using the exercise version. Satisfaction and helpfulness were correlated with perceived usability amount of contact realism and credibility (P < 0.01). Multivariate analyses showed that treatment group and number of calls made accounted for the greatest amount of variance in ratings of satisfaction and helpfulness. The findings suggest that the amount of contact with this technology reflected by the number of calls and the treatment group nutrition or exercise were significant predictors of reported satisfaction and perceived helpfulness of the system.

This study explored strengths and limitations of table formatting choices by engaging twenty-eight participants in information searches in online tables presented on a small-screen interface (Palm IIIc). Table length across conditions was held constant at three screens long (24 rows total) but varied from one to three screens wide (approximately 35 70 and 105 characters per-line). Target information was positioned in either the upper left lower left upper right or lower right quadrants. Data collected. were time on task error rate and level of participants' confidence in their answers. Experimenters found that increased horizontal scrolling imposed the heaviest burden on information search. This study supports restricting table widths to one screen on handheld computers. If necessary however tables can go to two screens wide without critical detriment to usability. While ruled line formatting is slightly better than interface characterin providing visual support for the burden of horizontal scrolling neither formatting option adequately compensates for the added burden.;2003
Two recent parallel developments the widespread deployment of wireless networks and increased use of handheld devices like the personal digital assistant (PDA) have contributed to the development of mobile access to the Internet. Recent surveys show that approximately 25% or more of physicians use PDAs. Although used mainly for personal information management and static medical applications PDAs have capabilities to connect to the Internet. We studied the use of handheld devices to access MEDLINE and other knowledge sources in a wireless setting.;2003
Veterinary clinical pharmacology encompasses all interactions between drugs and animals and applies basic and clinical knowledge to improve rational drug use and patient outcomes. Veterinary pharmacology instructors set educational goals and objectives that when mastered by students lead to improved animal health. The special needs of pharmacology instruction include establishing a functional interface between basic and clinical knowledge managing a large quantity of information and mastering quantitative skills essential to successful drug administration and analysis of drug action. In the present study a survey was conducted to determine the extent to which veterinary pharmacology instructors utilize information technology (IT) in their teaching. Several IT categories were investigated including Web-based instructional aids stand-alone pharmacology software interactive videoconferencing databases personal digital assistants (PDAs) and e-book applications. Currently IT plays a largely ancillary role in pharmacology instruction. IT use is being expanded primarily through the efforts of two veterinary professional pharmacology groups the American College of Veterinary Clinical Pharmacology (ACVCP) and the American Academy of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics (AAVPT). The long-term outcome of improved IT use in pharmacology instruction should be to support the larger educational mission of active learning and problem solving. Creation of high-quality IT resources that promote this goal has the potential to improve veterinary pharmacology instruction within and across institutions.;2003
We consider the design and analysis of algorithms that learn from the consequences of their actions with the goal of maximizing their cumulative reward when the consequence of a given action is felt immediately and a linear function which is unknown a priori (approximately) relates a feature vector for each action/state pair to the (expected) associated reward. We focus on two cases one in which a continuous-valued reward is (approximately) given by applying the unknown linear function and another in which the probability of receiving the larger of binary-valued rewards is obtained. For these cases we provide bounds on the per-trial regret for our algorithms that go to zero as the number of trials approaches infinity. We also provide lower bounds that show that the rate of convergence is nearly optimal.;2003
We developed a conversation system which can participate in a group conversation. Group conversation is a form of conversation in which three or more participants talk to each other about a topic on an equal footing. Conventional conversation systems have been designed under the assumption that each system merely talked with only one person. Group conversation is different from these conventional systems in the following points. It is necessary for the system to understand the conversational situation such as who is speaking to whom he is speaking and also to whom the other participants pay attention. It is also necessary for the system itself to try to affect the situation appropriately. In this study we realized the function of recognizing the conversational situation by combining image processing and acoustic processing and the function of working on the conversational situation utilizing facial and body actions of the robot. Thus a robot that can join in the group conversation was realized.;2003
We developed a Japanese-language rapid synthesizing software application for use on a personal digital assistant. It has an unrestricted vocabulary and can synthesize words and sentences within 3s. Eight hundred common sentences and words are preregistered. By touching the first character at the head of a preregistered sentence or word from an on-screen kana (Japanese alphabet) chart the user can select the sentence or word to be spoken. Characters on the Kana chart can also be input sequentially. Two Japanese subjects with speech impairments rated the device highly for its portability and quick response. Whereas communication previously had to be done by writing or sign language it was easy for listeners with or without specialized training in communication with persons with speech impairments to understand the output from this device making conversation easier Which in turn improved the quality of life and social activity of these persons with speech impairments.;2003
We present an automatic speech-to-speech translation system for Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) that helps oral communication between Japanese and English speakers in various situations while traveling. Our own compact large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition engine and compact translation engine based on a lexicalized grammar provided the basis for the Japanese/English bi-directional speech translation system that works with limited computational resources.;2003
We study the offers submitted by consumers to a large Name-Your-Own-Price (NYOP) online retailer. A distinctive feature of this retailer is that it allows consumers to repeatedly submit offers on one and the same product. While consumers could identify the threshold price (the minimum price for which the retailer is willing to sell) by incrementing their offer in small steps in each consecutive round such a strategy would require them to go through many additional online transactions. We define frictional cost as the disutility that the consumer experiences when conducting an online transaction such as submitting an offer. Thus in our setting consumers trade off a direct financial value (lower price) for frictional costs. Based on a consumer choice model capturing this trade-off we use the observed consumer behavior to reconstruct the frictional cost parameters for the consumers in our sample. We show that perhaps contrary to the general wisdom frictional costs in electronic markets are substantial with median values ranging from EUR 3.54 for a portable digital music player (MP3) to EUR 6.08 for a personal digital assistant (PDA). We find that consumers who have gathered experience with the NYOP channel in previous transactions exhibit lower frictional costs than consumers who use the channel for the first time. Surprisingly sociodemographic variables do not help to explain the variation in frictional costs.;2003
Wireless devices such as PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) make it possible for people to communicate between virtually any two places. To identify people in various places biometrics techniques such as fingerprints can be used. For security applications with ubiquitous connections it is necessary to control the FAR (False Acceptance Rate). We therefore propose a method of fingerprint identification for security applications. The method is based on the accidental coincidence probability of the patterns' features. The probability is calculated under the assumption that there is no correlation between the patterns. This approach makes it possible to overcome the difficult problem of estimating the probabilities of features missing and spurious features occurring. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can be used to control the probability of imposter acceptance and therefore this method is suitable for security applications.;2003
A broadband low-cost communication infrastructure based on the Internet hotspots and wireless LAN environments is becoming a reality. Moreover terminals such as cellular phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are evolving very quickly. Against this background a ubiquitous environment that can be accessed at anytime and anywhere through various kinds of terminals is being constructed. However because of the fast pace of change it costs service providers a lot of time and money to provide high-quality services to users and new technological developments are needed to solve this problem. This paper describes the technology requirements for achieving a ubiquitous environment and a Fujitsu middleware product called Realtime Communicator that can meet them. Then this paper describes two typical applications of this middleware.;2004
A telemetric system was designed and constructed to sense pH and ethanol variation in aqueous solutions. The measured signals were transferred by software digitally and transmitted wirelessly by the telemeter personal digital assistant (PDA) through the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) protocol. The pH sensing electrode was designed to measure a chemical potential induced by a proton concentration gradient on the electrode's surface which exhibits internal Donnon diffusion behavior and a linear relationship between the electrical potential and pH was found. The result shows that the wireless sensing system allowed not only long-term usage and long-distance transmission but also with high accuracy (e.g. S.D. less than +/-12%). The telemetric system can also be modified to measure ethanol concentration in aqueous solution amperometrically. It was found that the sensitivity of that ex situ measurements matched those of in field measurements with negligible deviation less than 4%. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2004

A wide-band/dual-band packaged antenna is proposed for wireless local-area network (WLAN) applications in the 5.15-5.35 GHz and 5.725-5.825 GHz frequency range. The antenna is internal to the housing of a personal digital assistant such as a Palm organizer and has the dimensions of 28 by 9 by 3 ram on an FR4 substrate. The antenna meets or exceeds the bandwidth requirements for the dual-band IEEE 802.11a WLAN applications (5.15-5.35 GHz and 5.725-5.825 GHz) within 2:1 voltage standing-wave ratio.;2004

An analysis of the multispectral image-based precision agriculture technology as used in the US cotton belt was undertaken to identify bottlenecks which limit the delivery and use of this technology. One area in particular was identified: the movement of data and information necessary to implement variable rate applications. Solutions to reduce or eliminate this problem were explored. A new technology called wireless local area networking (or WLAN) was explored. A test farm was selected a system was designed and implemented and the resulting implementation was successfully tested. The system wirelessly connected cotton pickers spray equipment variable rate fertilized application equipment and hand-held personal digital assistant computers in the field allowing for rapid bi-directional movement of data and information.

An experimental study is conducted on the cooling of mobile electronic devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and wearable computers using a heat storage unit (HSU) filled with the phase change material (PCM) of n-eicosane inside the device. The high latent heat of n-eicosane in the HSU absorbs the heat dissipation from the chips and can maintain the chip temperature below the allowable service temperature of 50degreesC for 2 h of transient operations of the PDA. The heat dissipation of the chips inside a PDA and the orientation of the HSU are experimentally investigated in this paper. It was found that different orientation of the HSU inside the PDA could affect significantly the temperature distribution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2004

As collaborative computer systems are evolving the use of spatial three-dimensional interfaces for multiplayer games groupware systems and multi-user chat systems for example is increasing rapidly. This paper provides a theoretical underpinning for understanding the relevance of user embodiments and copresence within such three-dimensional collaborative computer interfaces. Firstly the issue of embodiment is traced back through its origins in philosophy and psychology literature and theories are identified potentially helpful in understanding key issues concerning user embodiments in collaborative virtual environments. A hybrid avatar/agent model to achieve permanent user embodiments in such environments is discussed. Since copresence of other users within such environments has been shown to be an important factor for the experience of presence a prototype embodied conversational agent has been designed to simulate copresence. A series of controlled experiments involving the prototype agent is discussed highlighting the effects of simulated copresence on users' experience of presence. Results suggest that despite its shortcomings the prototype agent does seem to have increased participants' experience of presence. Evidence was found that even limited copresence as provided by the current prototype agent is sufficient to help users feel presence in the environment. The results seem to confirm that copresence simulated by agents can complement avatar technology and therefore that a hybrid avatar/agent model can potentially achieve permanent virtual presence of all participants.

As healthcare moves towards the implementation of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Critically Appraised Topics (CATS) become useful in helping physicians to make clinical decisions. A number of academic and healthcare organizations have set up web-based CAT libraries. The primary objective of the presented work is to provide a one-stop search and download site that allows access to multiple CAT libraries. A web-based application namely the CAT Crawler was developed to serve physicians with an adequate access to available appraised topics on the Internet. Important information is extracted automatically and regularly from CAT websites and consolidated by checking the uniqueness and availability. The principle of meta-search is incorporated into the implementation of the search engine which finds relevant topics following keyword input. The retrieved result directs the physician to the original resource page. A full-text article of a particular topic can be converted into a proper format for downloading to Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices. In summary the application provides physicians with a common interface to retrieve relevant CATS on particular clinical topics from multiple resources and thus speeds up the decision making process.;2004
At present there is a growing interest in wireless applications due to the fact that the technology begins to support them at reasonable costs. In this paper we present the technology currently available for use in wireless environments focusing on Geographic Information Systems. As an example we present a newly developed platform for the commercialization of advanced geographical information services for use in portable devices. This platform uses available mobile telephone networks and wireless local area networks but it is completely scalable to new technologies such as third generation mobile networks. Users access the service using a vector map player that runs on a Personal Digital Assistant with wireless access facilities and a Global Positioning System receiver. Before accessing the information the player will request authorization from the server and download the requested map from it if necessary. The platform also includes a system for improving Global Positioning System localization with the Real Time Differential Global Positioning System which uses short GSM messages as the transmission medium.

Background. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are being increasingly used in medical practice. Although they have been touted as having the ability to improve efficiency and safety little is known about pediatricians' use of and attitudes about PDAs. Objective. Our goals were to 1) determine the percentage of pediatricians using PDAs and computers 2) determine perceived strengths and weaknesses of PDAs and 3) explore characteristics associated with beliefs and use. Design/Methods. Pediatricians ( 2130) were selected randomly from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile of US-licensed physicians. All participants were mailed a survey along with a prepaid return envelope and a $1 incentive. Up to 3 mailings were sent per participant. Results. Of eligible participants 63.2% returned a survey. There were no significant differences between respondents and nonrespondents with respect to sex type of practice and present employment. Thirty-five percent of respondents currently use PDAs at work and 40% currently use PDAs for personal use. Of those using PDAs the most commonly used applications were for drug reference (80%) personal scheduling (67%) and medical calculations (61%). Few pediatricians are currently using PDAs for prescription writing (8%) or billing (4%). Users of PDAs were more likely to be male ( adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.29 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64 - 3.19) in an urban community ( AOR: 1.81 95% CI: 1.30 - 2.55) in training ( AOR: 2.64 95% CI: 1.58 - 4.42) not in private practice ( AOR: 1.47 95% CI: 1.03 - 2.11) and a more recent graduate of medical school ( AOR: 1.04 per year 95% CI: 1.02 - 1.06). When controlling for covariates those using PDAs were more likely to believe that PDAs can decrease medical errors ( AOR: 2.22 95% CI: 1.46 3.38) and increase efficiency ( AOR: 2.40 95% CI: 1.56 3.71). When compared with nonusers users were less likely to view the small screen size ( AOR: 0.53 95% CI: 0.37 - 0.77) or system speed ( AOR: 0.47 95% CI: 0.26 - 0.84) as a problem but were significantly more likely to view memory as an issue ( AOR: 3.48 95% CI: 2.30 - 5.25). Conclusions. More than one third of pediatricians are using PDAs in clinical practice. There seems to be a general consensus among users that they have the potential to improve patient safety and streamline care. Future studies should explore means to utilize their potential.;2004
Background. We recently found documentation discrepancies in 60% of resident daily-progress notes with respect to patient weight medications or vascular lines. To what extent information systems can decrease such discrepancies is unknown. Objective. To determine whether a point-of-care personal digital assistant (PDA)-based patient record and charting system could reduce the number of resident progress-note documentation discrepancies in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Design/Methods. We conducted a before-and-after trial in an academic NICU. Our intervention was a PDA-based patient record and charting system used by all NICU resident physicians over the study period. We analyzed all resident daily-progress notes from 40 randomly selected days over 4 months in both the baseline and intervention periods. Using predefined reference standards we determined the accuracy of recorded information for patient weights medications and vascular lines. Logistic and Poisson regression were used in analyses to control for potential confounding factors. Results. A total of 339 progress notes in the baseline period and 432 progress notes in the intervention period were reviewed. When controlling for covariates in the regression there were significantly fewer documentation discrepancies of patient weights in notes written by using the PDA system (14.4%-4.4% of notes odds ratio [OR]: 0.29 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15 - 0.56). When using the PDA system there were no significant changes in the numbers of notes with documentation discrepancies of medications (27.7%-17.1% of notes OR: 0.63 95% CI: 0.35 - 1.13) or vascular lines (33.6% - 36.1% of notes OR: 1.11 95% CI: 0.66 - 1.87). Conclusions. The use of our PDA-based point-of-care patient record and charting system showed a modest benefit in reducing the number of documentation discrepancies in resident daily-progress notes. Further study of PDAs in information systems is warranted before they are widely adopted.;2004
Background: Response rates to postal questionnaires are falling and this threatens the external validity of survey findings. We wanted to establish whether the incentive of being entered into a prize draw to win a personal digital assistant (PDA) would increase the response rate for a national survey of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists. Methods: a randomised controlled trial was conducted. This involved sending a postal questionnaire to all Consultant Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the United Kingdom. Recipients were randomised to receiving a questionnaire offering a prize draw incentive (on response) or no such incentive. Results: The response rate for recipients offered the prize incentive was 64% (461/716) and 62% (429/694) in the no incentive group (relative rate of response. 1.04 95% CI 0.96-1.13). Conclusion: the offer of a prize draw incentive to win a PDA did not significantly increase response rates to a national questionnaire survey of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists.;2004
Background: The Internet has tremendous appeal for conducting randomized clinical trials and may be especially applicable to trials requiring frequent participant contact. Trials of cold sore remedies for example often require daily clinic visits during outbreaks imposing substantial burden on participants. An Intemet-based randomized clinical trial design may reduce this burden permitting frequent symptom reports with considerably less effort. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of a Web-based randomized clinical trial requiring frequent participan interaction using a 6-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial of a topical ointment containing dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS) (Zilex Meditech Pharmaceuticals Inc Scottsdale Arizona USA) intended for treatment of recurrent herpes labialis. A secondary objective was to obtain preliminary data on effectiveness outcomes to assist in planning a fully-powered trial of DSS. Methods: Adults with physician-confirmed herpes labialis were recruited to apply to the trial. Eligible applicants were randomized to DSS or placebo mailed to them upon enrolment with instructions to apply topically every 2 hours for the duration of every cold sore outbreak. Participants were instructed to complete online questionnaires at 2-week intervals and at the initiation of a cold sore daily outbreak questionnaires until outbreak termination. Feasibility outcome measures included trial participant characteristics frequency of cold sores participant retention and adherence (to study medication) and data completeness. Treatment effectiveness outcome measures included outbreak duration days to crust formation and pain. Results: Of the 292 individuals applying 182 screened eligible 32 participants with confirmed herpes labialis enrolled in the trial. 16 were randomized into the verum group and 16 into the placebo group. 29 (91%) participants completed the trial. During the trial 34 outbreaks were reported among 23 (72%) participants resulting in a cold sore incidence rate of 19.8 per 100 person-months of observation. Online data were available for 32 outbreaks the absence of a resolution date made it impossible to accurately calculate the duration of 12 (38%) outbreaks. Although the DSS treatment group had a shorter mean outbreak duration (6.6 vs 7.7 days P =.2) and fewer mean days to crust formation (3.5 vs 4.9 P =. 1) these differences did not reach statistical significance. The DSS group has statistically significant lower mean pain scores (3.1 vs 7.6 P =.04) but participants in this group also consumed more acetaminophen tablets than the placebo group (L I versus 0.5 P=.55). Adherence to medication was similar in both groups: 7 (50%) of the verum group reported using the cream as directed compared to 6 (46.2%) in the placebo group (P =.8). Conclusions: We efficiently recruited participants and achieved high overall retention rates. However participant adherence to the daily outbreak visit schedules was low and only 7 (50%) participants used the cream as directed. These limitations could be addressed in future Internet-based studies by using Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) using reminder devices and providing incentives. By enhancing participant adherence clinical trials requiring frequent participant contact may be feasible over the Internet.;2004
Both teachers and students benefit from an interactive classroom. The teacher receives valuable input about effectiveness student interest and comprehension whereas student participation active learning and enjoyment of the class are enhanced. Cost and deployment have limited the use of existing audience response systems allowing anonymous linking of teachers and students in the classroom. These limitations can be circumvented however by use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) which are cheaper and widely used by students. In this study the authors equipped a summer histology class of 12 students with PDAs and wireless Bluetooth cards to allow access to a central server. Teachers displayed questions in multiple-choice format as a Web page on the server and students responded with their PDAs a process referred to as polling. Responses were immediately compiled analyzed and displayed. End-of-class survey results indicated that students were enthusiastic about the polling tool. The surveys also provided technical feedback that will be valuable in streamlining future trials.;2004
Commercial spoken dialog systems which handle increasingly advanced tasks must deal with three development challenges: how to model the dialog when the user can select from many tasks how to communicate with customers about SDS design and how to develop code for a large SDS when the design will likely require updates throughout development. To develop a commercial phone-based SDS that supplies information to Danish employees about their holiday allowance the authors had to meet all these challenges. Key to this system was their use of the Conceptual Dialog Language which expresses patterns specific to the dialog model while still providing a clear picture of it to domain experts and supporting model updates. CDL captures the specifics of an SDS application while remaining flexible enough to support a range of modeling styles and requirements. To facilitate effective communication with domain experts modelers can translate the dialog model in CDL to an HTML document or they can compile it to a programming language for executable code.;2004
Conversational agents are supposed to combine speech with non-verbal modalities for intelligible multimodal utterances. In this paper we focus on the generation of gesture and speech from XML-based descriptions of their overt form. An incremental production model is presented that combines the synthesis of synchronized gestural verbal and facial behaviors with mechanisms for linking them in fluent utterances with natural co-articulation and transition effects. In particular an efficient kinematic approach for animating hand gestures from shape specifications is presented which provides fine adaptation to temporal constraints that are imposed by cross-modal synchrony.

Despite the high availability of mobile phones and personal digital assistants with online capabilities mobile computer supported cooperative work is still in its infancy. So far only little is known about the distinct attributes of mobile cooperative work in comparison to its stationary counterpart. Across which dimensions does cooperation via mobile devices differ from traditional hard-wired settings and what implications have to be drawn for future research'? To bring more light to this question we conducted an experimental business-case at Frankfurt University With 16 graduate Students and analysed their collaborative behaviour across mobile and non-mobile channels Of communication over a 5 week period. We find that mobile messages differed from stationary messages in terms of size and that the use of mobile emails prevailed over stationary emails Under conditions of stress. Finally we found that the social Structure of mobile communication corresponded with the structure of stationary communication. This indicates that mobile communication technologies support existing communication relations rather than creating new relations. From the perspective of system designers these results may serve as practical insights into the user behaviour of mobile technologies and might support the future development of mobile computer supported cooperative work environments.

Electronic devices such as personal digital assistants have been used successfully as aids for people with memory problems. However limitations of Currently available technology can create difficulties in the day-to-day use of such devices particularly for memory impaired and older users. These limitations are discussed in terms of both the software and hardware issues and are set into the context of challenges raised in the current study which is to design a new interactive memory aid. It is concluded that a specific customisable software interface is needed to meet the dynamic requirements of the user groups. This would also go some way to compensate for the hardware limitations until available technology becomes more usable.;2004
Gentamicin an antibiotic drug can be used in one-sided (unilateral) Meniere's disease to end frequent attacks of spontaneous disabling vertigo. However with incorrect dose treatment it can profoundly damage patients' inner ear and kidney. The dosage of medication and the dosage interval will affect serum concentration that results therapeutic or damage. Pharmacokinetics is the study of managing the relationship between the dosage medication dosing interval and serum concentration. However due to the complicated mathematical equations of pharmacokinetics it is rarely used in clinics. The purpose of this study was to use a pharmacokinetics model to build a prototype of gentamicin CDSS embedded in a PDA. This system was implemented in a district teaching hospital in Chiayi area Taiwan. Empirical data was collected under routine clinical setting with real patients and physicians to validate this CDSS. The research results showed that considering the therapeutic effect the pharmacokinetics-based CDSS outperforms physicians' experience. Regarding the intoxication the pharmacokinetics-based CDSS also performed better than physicians' experience with less intoxication. The physicians using the system revealed a high degree of agreement with the perceived usefulness perceived ease of use and intention to use the pharmacokinetics-based CDSS.;2004
Handheld personal digital assistants (PDA) are increasingly being used by physicians for a variety of information and data management purposes. We evaluated a PDA-based data management system for our acute pain service. A structured questionnaire survey was conducted to assess staff experience and attitude towards the paper system before the introduction of the PDA and three months after introduction of the PDA system. We compared the time taken to conduct the acute pain round before and after the implementation of the PDA. The time saved in data management and the amount of paper saved were estimated. Data from 177patients with a total of 635 acute pain follow-up visits were entered over a three-month period. User satisfaction ease of access to drug reference and clinical guidelines were similar between the two systems. The respondents found that the PDA was easy to use but less so than the paper system (P=0.007) in particular when accessing a patient's cumulative data (P=0.007). There was no missed follow-up or data entry with the use of PDA. The time taken to attend follow-up visits was similar for the two systems (Paper: 8.8 +/- 3.2 compared to PDA: 7.0 +/- 2.0 minutes P=0.151). The estimated annual amount of paper and time saved in data management was 650 sheets and 130 man-hours respectively. Our experience with the use of the PDA in APS was satisfactory. The PDA system can potentially reduce time and paper use and missed data entry and patient follow-up.;2004
Health workers are trained to work in information- rich environments. Nineteen medical students evaluated 2700 patients in four villages in Kenya where there was no power or phone. A model of information support included personal digital assistants ( PDA) electronic medical records ( EMR) satellite telecommunications medical software and solar power. The students promptly found the advantages of PDA over paper. By using software for decision support and interacting with the EMR data for medical expertise very few live telemedicine consults were needed. The cost of this information support was only $ 0.28 per patient visit. We conclude information resources can be provided in remote environments at reasonable cost.;2004
In spoken dialogue systems it is important for the system to know how likely a speech recognition hypothesis is to be correct so it can reject misrecognized user turns or in cases where many errors have occurred change its interaction strategy or switch the caller to a human attendant. We have identified prosodic features which predict more accurately when a recognition hypothesis contains errors than the acoustic confidence scores traditionally used in automatic speech recognition in spoken dialogue systems. We describe statistical comparisons of features of correctly and incorrectly recognized turns in the TOOT train information corpus and the W99 conference registration corpus which reveal significant prosodic differences between the two sets of turns. We then present machine learning results showing that the use of prosodic features alone and in combination with other automatically available features can predict more accurately whether or not a user turn was correctly recognized when compared to the use of acoustic confidence scores alone.

In story-based communication. where a message is conveyed in story form it is important to embody the story with expressive materials. However it is quite difficult for users to create rich multimedia contents using multimedia editing tools. This paper proposes a web-based multimedia environment SPOC (Stream-oriented Public Opinion Channel) aiming at helping non-skillful people to convert their stories into TV-like programs very easily. The system can produce a digital camera work for graphics and video clips as well as generate an agent animation automatically according to a narration text. Findings in evaluation experiments showed that SPOC is easy-to-use and easy-to-learn for novice users. Given a short instruction the subjects not only mastered the operations of the software but also succeeded in creating highly original programs. In subjective evaluation the subjects answered that they enjoyed using the software without feeling difficulty. These results suggest that this system reduces user's cost in making a program and encourages communication in a network community.;2004
In this paper to apply piezoelectric transformer for personal digital assistants (PDA) liquid crystal display (LCD) backlight driving circuits piezoelectric transformer using 0.3 wt.% Nb2O5 added PNW-PMN-PZT ceramics was fabricated as Rosen-type one with the size of 1 mm x 16 mm x 5 mm and their electrical characteristics were investigated with the variations of load resistance and driving frequency. Then the PDA LCD backlight driving circuits was manufactured using piezoelectric transformer two MOSFET connected in series voltage control oscillator (VCO) and one-chip microprocessor. After driving LCD backlight for 25 min using the proposed circuit at driving frequency of 214.4 kHz input voltage of 31.78 V and input current of 21.1 mA were measured at the input part of piezoelectric transformer. Then output voltage of 293.2 V and output current of 2.2 mA were shown at the output part of piezoelectric transformer. At the same time efficiency of 96.2% and temperature rise of 3.6degreesC were appeared at the piezoelectric transformer. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2004
Indian language computing is lagging behind due to several reasons primary amongst them being the unavailability of suitable interfaces for human-computer interaction. Natural Language Conversational Interfaces (NLCIs) play the all important role in improving the usability of interfaces for the Indian masses. In this paper an NLCI incorporating speech and dialog is presented.;2004
Management of diet and exercise is especially significant in preventing lifestyle-related diseases for patients and subclinical cases. This paper introduces a questionnaire survey on diabetic regimens that targets 38 professional users such as physicians and nurses at a diabetic clinic. Based on the results of the questionnaire survey a design concept for a wearable healthcare support system has been developed to provide patients with timely instruction in accordance with their current context. On the basis of this design concept. we developed a prototype of a wearable healthcare Support system called LifeMinder. LifeMinder is composed of a wristwatch-shaped wearable sensor module and a personal digital assistant (PDA). The sensor module measures 3-axis acceleration pulse rate galvanic skin reflex (GSR) and skin temperature. The PDA receives this data via Bluetooth(TM) and recognizes the patient's general behavior such as walking or eating. The recognition of these behaviors reduces the patient's mental and physical burden in daily healthcare and assists in support of medical treatment.;2004
Many appliances already communicate wirelessly and the smart homes of the future will have ubiquitous embedded computation. Unfortunately many computerized features are more of a hindrance than a convenience because their user interfaces are often too complex to intuitively understand. In 1997 researchers from Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute and their colleagues launched the Pebbles project to determine whether a handheld device such as a personal digital assistant or cell phone could serve as a simpler more effective remote control. As part of the project they have been studying the simultaneous use of multiple devices. They have created more than 30 applications to explore novel ways users can apply handhelds as wireless remote controls in offices meeting rooms classrooms homes factories and military command posts.;2004
Many classification algorithms were originally designed for fixed-size vectors. Recent applications in text and speech processing and computational biology require however the analysis of variable-length sequences and more generally weighted automata. An approach widely used in statistical learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is that of kernel methods due to their computational efficiency in high-dimensional feature spaces. We introduce a general family of kernels based on weighted transducers or rational relations rational kernels that extend kernel methods to the analysis of variable-length sequences or more generally weighted automata. We show that rational kernels can be computed efficiently using a general algorithm of composition of weighted transducers and a general single-source shortest-distance algorithm. Not all rational kernels are positive definite and symmetric (PDS) or equivalently verify the Mercer condition a condition that guarantees the convergence of training for discriminant classification algorithms such as SVMs. We present several theoretical results related to PDS rational kernels. We show that under some general conditions these kernels are closed under sum product or Kleene-closure and give a general method for constructing a PDS rational kernel from an arbitrary transducer defined on some non-idempotent semirings. We give the proof of several characterization results that can be used to guide the design of PDS rational kernels. We also show that some commonly used string kernels or similarity measures such as the edit-distance the convolution kernels of Haussler and some string kernels used in the context of computational biology are specific instances of rational kernels. Our results include the proof that the edit-distance over a non-trivial alphabet is not negative definite which to the best of our knowledge was never stated or proved before. Rational kernels can be combined with SVMs to form efficient and powerful techniques for a variety of classification tasks in text and speech processing or computational biology. We describe examples of general families of PDS rational kernels that are useful in many of these applications and report the result of our experiments illustrating the use of rational kernels in several difficult large-vocabulary spoken-dialog classification tasks based on deployed spoken-dialog systems. Our results show that rational kernels are easy to design and implement and lead to substantial improvements of the classification accuracy.;2004
Mobile and desktop-based geospatial technologies now provide a relatively low-cost data acquisition processing analysis and display toolbox to facilitate the rapid collection and extraction of environmental data and information the creation of maps and other visualisations. Both maps and imagery can be downloaded from the internet to the desktop and hand-held PCs and used with global positioning systems (GPS) and palmtop geographic information systems (GIS) software for mobile field mapping and up-dating tasks Georectified aerial photography can be used as raster backdrops to vector data from Digimap and UWBorders to aid infield mapping Uploading data collected in the field with an IR (infrared) port-enabled personal digital assistant (PDA) or laptop equipped with a mobile phone and modem to a desktop server also allows for updating GIS databases. Internet map and image server software together with a hand-held PC and/or WAP-enabled (wireless application protocol) phone provides for access and retrieval of data and information 'on-the fly' in the field from an online internet-based GIS. This article examines the practical use of these geospatial technologies as a means to aid the study of coastal geography in the context of coastal zone management with specific emphasis being placed on their role in education.;2004
Mobile devices are significantly changing the human-computer interaction. In particular the ubiquitous access to remote resources is one of the most interesting characteristics achievable by using mobile devices such as Personal Digital Assistants cellular phones and tablets. This paper presents an architecture that allows users to search and visualize complex 3D models over Personal Digital Assistants. A peer-to-peer network of brokers manages queries for searching objects among several data providers. The object selected for visualization is forwarded to a specialized graphics providers this provider allows the users to investigate the object remotely rendering the scene and sending back to the Personal Digital Assistant the Computed image. The user can interactively analyse objects that Would not be otherwise visualizable locally on the Personal Digital Assistant. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2004
OBJECTIVE. We describe how our radiology department set up integrated and deployed a personal digital assistant-based mobile platform to deliver updated critical departmental and educational material to our residents. CONCLUSION. We have implemented and described a robust mobile solution that maintains a seamless connection with the departmental intranet. Resident feedback regarding the use of the mobile solution program has confirmed our belief that using this mobile technology is a feasible and clinically practical alternative for accessing time-sensitive and educational materials. Furthermore our description can help others deploy such digital products and facilitate the transition to soft copy that is already occurring in radiology education.;2004
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the wireless local area network (WLAN) technology specifically the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) Interferes with implantable cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Various pacemakers and defibrillators were tested in vitro at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn between March 6 and July 30 2003. These cardiac devices were exposed toan HP Compaq iPAQ PDA fitted with a Cisco Aironet WILAN card. Initial testing was designed to show whether the Aironet card radiated energy In a consistent pattern from the antenna of the PDA to ensure that subsequent cardiac device testing would not be affected by the orientation of the PDA to the cardiac device. Testing involved placing Individual cardiac devices in a simulator and uniformly exposing each device at its most sensitive programmable value to the WILAN card set to maximum power. RESULTS: During testing with the Cisco WILAN Aironet card all devices programmed to the unipolar or bipolar configuration single- or dual-chamber mode had normal pacing and sensing functions and exhibited no effects of electromagnetic Interference except for 1 Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). This aberration was determined to relate to the design of the Investigators' testing apparatus and not to the output of the PDA. The ICD device appropriately identified and labeled the electromagnetic aberration as noise. CONCLUSIONS: We documented no electromagnetic Interference caused by the WLAN technology by using In vitro testing of pacemakers and ICDs however testing Ideally should be completed In vivo to confirm the lack of any clinically Important interactions.;2004
Objective: The objective or this study was to estimate patient compliance with oral and vaginal metronidazole treatment of bacterial vaginosis using personal digital assistants (PDAs) and paper diaries. Goal: The goal of this study was to assess a novel compliance documentation approach. Study: After each dose of intravaginal or oral metronidazole 71 subjects recorded the time on a paper diary and answered questions on a PDA. All PDA entries were unknowingly time-date-stamped. Subjects returned for 2- and 6-week posttreatment examinations. Compliance was calculated using a repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Mean patient compliance rates within the oral metronidazole group were greater with the paper diary compared with the PDA (68.3% and 50.0% respectively P = 0.001). The observed rate of compliance agreement for PDA versus paper diary was 69.0% (kappa = 0.4). The majority of noncompliant subjects reported they were compliant with the PDA and paper diary. Conclusions: PDAs could more accurately document true compliance rates and could be reasonable instruments to assess compliance in intravaginal antimicrobial drug or contraceptive trials.;2004
Objective: To assess an assistive-technology intervention for neurobehavioral change coordinated with a Web-based data recording system. Participant: Male mid-thirties with a complex history having verbose speech subsequent to traumatic brain injury. Design: BAB' single-case. Intervention and Measures: The intervention (B and B' trials) was a digital recording of the participant's voice stating be brief delivered at fixed intervals by a personal digital assistant. Utterance start and stop times were monitored with a wireless Web-enabled device and were recorded in a server-side database. Results: Utterance frequency did not change. However the total utterance time was reduced during B trials attributable to the reduced frequency of lengthier utterances. Conclusions: The target behavior was modified successfully. The participant adopted a specific cue-appropriate strategy. Since a variety of alternative response strategies may be required of a person given a range of context-specific social practices and community settings the importance of context-sensitive assistive technology cue repertoires is discussed.;2004
Objectives. The purpose of this paper is to describe the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in a pharmacy school during the first year in which the tool was provided to all students and faculty members. Methods. A survey was developed and administered to students in each year of the curriculum and to full-time faculty members. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Results. After providing PDAs we observed that use of the devices was high by students (95.2%) and faculty members (93.3%). For approximately one third of the survey responders use of pharmacy-related applications accounted for over 50% of usage time although use varied according to individual courses. Conclusions. A high percentage of faculty members and students used the PDA provided to them by the school. Although PDA use across the curriculum has varied the tool was viewed as having a positive impact on student learning.;2004
Objectives: Improvements in electronic technologies have resulted in affordable smaller computers that operate at faster speeds. The personal digital assistant (PDA) is a tool that has the potential to enhance residency education by allowing residents immediate access to an abundance of information. This article assesses the current use of this tool at obstetrics and gynecology residency programs in the state of Florida. Methods: The authors conducted a statewide survey addressing the general question: is the PDA useful in an obstetrics and gynecology residency training program? Specifically the authors asked residents how much time was perceived to be saved weekly with the use of this tool and in what aspect of their training use of this tool was most helpful. Results: At the survey's close five of seven programs had returned the survey for evaluation. These five institutions included both university- and community-based residency programs. Forty percent of obstetrics and gynecology residents at these programs responded to this questionnaire. Resident responses to the survey revealed that most of the perceived benefit was in maintaining procedural statistics logs pharmacology reference manuals and personal clinical protocols. Most responses revealed that only minimal time savings (< 2 h/wk) were gained with using this tool. However many residents felt they were not using this tool to its maximum potential. Nearly 90% of those who responded felt that the PDA should be available at residency programs and anticipated using it after completing residency. Conclusions: This study posed the question of PDA usefulness at obstetric and gynecology residency programs in the state of Florida. Although not all programs provided their residents with a PDA 95% of the respondents revealed that they owned one of these tools. Experience at the authors' institution revealed high expectations for the potential uses of a PDA. Although many residents were not using this tool to its full potential a PDA tutorial session could educate residents on the many applications available for PDAs including applications to maintain on-call schedules and sign-out lists statistics and procedure logs for credentialing and board certification electronic billing and electronic prescriptions.;2004
Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine how personal digital assistants (PDAs) are used on an academic health sciences campus to define the level of training and support the library can provide to the students and faculty. Method: A Web-based questionnaire was developed. A total of 1538 health sciences faculty and residents were sent an email message requesting participation. Data from the returned surveys were analyzed with SPSS. Results: Sixty-one percent of survey respondents used PDAs. The address book date book and calculator were the most common uses reported for PDAs. Residents also reported a high use of drug databases on their PDAs. Most survey respondents indicated they would like to learn more about clinical resources for PDAs. Conclusions: Many opportunities exist for librarians to provide training and support for PDAs in addition to evaluation and promotion of clinical software for PDAs.;2004
One of the most important features provided by personal digital assistants is the ability to synchronize device data with data on a user's PC. Unfortunately current synchronization protocols have significant shortcomings that limit the availability usability and performance of synchronization. We present Edison a service that leverages existing off-the-shelf ORDBMS technology to address these problems. Edison allows large numbers of users to synchronize handheld devices from any point on the internet with subsets of large shared data sets. Edison supports this functionality while transferring the minimal amount of data to and from the device. We describe the implementation of the Edison data server and protocol and show that Edison requires minimal overhead in terms of DBMS storage and additional time per synchronization.;2004
People highlight the intended interpretation of their utterances within a larger discourse by a diverse set of non-verbal signals. These signals represent a key challenge for animated conversational agents because they are pervasive variable and need to be coordinated judiciously in an effective contribution to conversation. In this paper we describe a freely available cross-platform real-time facial animation system RUTH that animates such high-level signals in synchrony with speech and lip movements. RUTH adopts an open layered architecture in which fine-grained features of the animation can be derived by rule from inferred linguistic structure allowing us to use RUTH in conjunction with annotation of observed discourse to investigate the meaningful high-level elements of conversational facial movement for American English speakers.

Personal digital assistant sales are growing exponentially and as medical technology advances the amount of information available becomes staggering making a handheld device with the ability to store a great amount of information progressively more valuable to health care providers. Mobile computing allows for a great deal of knowledge in a small package creating a walking library with a mobile collection of data always accessible. There are many diverse types of PDAs and this article discusses the history of PDAs general purchasing issues general PDA features and the most significant differences between the Palm and the Windows CE operating systems.;2004
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are becoming increasingly popular in the United States and elsewhere. These devices are small lightweight and extremely mobile. One of the biggest drawbacks of PDAs has been the slow speed at which data can be entered. Researchers have studied the rates at which individuals can enter uncorrected text to a PDA using Palm OS software (Graffiti and the virtual keyboard). However this is the first investigation of the speed at which users can enter corrected text to a PDA running Microsoft Windows CE. The results indicate that users are faster with the virtual keyboard than with the letter recognizer. Despite performance differences users did not indicate greater satisfaction with the soft keyboard or the letter recognizer.;2004
Purpose. Core and supplemental drug information databases available for use with personal digital assistants (PDAs) were evaluated. Methods. Ten core (or standalone) databases six drug interaction analyzers and three dietary supplement databases used with the Palm and Pocket PC operating systems were selected for study. The databases were rated for scope (the absence or presence of an answer to a drug information question) completeness (the comprehensiveness of an answer) and ease of use (the number of hypertext links needed to reach the desired answer). A total of 14 weighted categories consisting of 146 and 30 drug questions for the core and supplemental databases respectively were used to determine-the overall scores. Results. The best overall performers were in order of total scores Lexi-Drugs Platinum Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia ePocrates Rx Pro and Clinical Pharmacology OnHand. The databases with the lowest composite scores were Triple i Prescribing Guide and A2Z Drugs. Conclusion. Drug information databases for PDAs varied in scope completeness and ease of used The results may help clinicians find the most appropriate product for their practice setting.;2004
Purpose. The accuracy comprehensiveness and ease of use of drug interaction software used with personal digital assistants (PDAs) were studied. Methods. Each program was assessed for accuracy using 40 clinically important and 40 clinically unimportant drug interaction pairs. Accuracy was scored through the summation of software sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive values. The comprehensiveness of each program was determined by the number of components in the drug interaction monograph. Time needed to identify the management of five important drug interactions defined each program's ease of use. The aggregate scores for accuracy comprehensiveness and ease of use were calculated. Results. Scoring 777 and 756 out of a possible 800 points iFacts and Lexi-Interact respectively provided the most competent complete use-friendly compendia for assessment of drug interactions. Mosby's Drug Consult and Mobile Micromedex ranked third and fourth scoring 688 and 655 points respectively while ePocrates Rx v. 6.0 rated seventh with a score of 559. All drug interaction resources suffer from limitations in the quality or relevance of evidence for the interaction an absence of identifiable patient and medication risk factors and a lack of standardization in assigning significance to the interaction. Consequently clinicians must interpret the importance of the interaction based on all available evidence. Discussion of such evidence was available for only iFacts and Lexi-Interact. Conclusion. Both iFacts and Lexi-Interact excelled as PDA pharmacopoeia for assessing drug interactions. However clinicians should understand the limitations of all current drug interaction resources and exercise vigilance in prevention and recognition of interactions relevant to their patients.;2004
Purpose. The objectives of this study were to track students' use of medical and nonmedical personal digital assistant (PDA) software and to obtain students' ratings of the usefulness of PDAs in a family medicine clerkship. Method. During the academic year 2001-02 third-year clerkship students at the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine were loaned PDAs equipped with company-installed software such as a date book and address book. Additional software was installed (Griffith's 5 Minute Clinical Consult(R) ePocrates qRx(R) ePocrates qID(R) iSilo(R) HanDBase(R) MedCalc(R) and Application Usage(R)). Pre- and postorientation questionnaires and a post-rotation evaluation measured students' comfort level the perceived usefulness and ratings of programs on their PDA. Application Usage tracked the number of minutes and times students used each software program. Results. Eighty-five students completed the study. They rated ePocrates qRx and Griffith's 5 Minute Clinical Consult the most useful medical software programs. PDAs were rated as almost always enhancing the clerkship experience. Students reported the PDA altered the way they accessed clinical information and that every few days it helped them understand a clinical discussion. Experience with computer technology was correlated with PDA use. Conclusions. This study objectively demonstrates clerkship students' use of PDA resources. Students' use mirrors their assessment of the value of the software. Although PDAs and software programs can be an expense it is a worthwhile educational resource as evaluated by the medical student.;2004
Purpose: This study describes the system architecture and user acceptance of a suite of programs that deliver information about newly updated library resources to clinicians' personal digital assistants (PDAs). Description: Participants received headlines delivered to their PDAs alerting them to new books National Guideline Clearinghouse guidelines Cochrane Reviews and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Alerts as well as updated content in UpToDate Harrison's Online Scientific American Medicine and Clinical Evidence. Participants could request additional information for any of the headlines and the information was delivered via email during their next synchronization. Participants completed a survey at the conclusion of the study to gauge their opinions about the service. Results/Outcome: Of the 816 headlines delivered to the 16 study participants' PDAs during the project Scientific American Medicine generated the highest proportion of headline requests at 35%. Most users of the PDA Alerts software reported that they learned about new medical developments sooner than they otherwise would have and half reported that they learned about developments that they would not have heard about at all. While some users liked the PDA platform for receiving headlines it seemed that a Web database that allowed tailored searches and alerts could be configured to satisfy both PDA-oriented and email-oriented users.;2004
Rationale and Objectives. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are gaining widespread use in the medical community. We introduced a PDA-based mobile system that provides departmental and educational information with a seamless connection to the intranet. The objective of this study is to determine the impact a PDA has on educational resources (learning or data reference) brought to work and used at home by a radiology resident based on user surveys. Materials and Methods. Survey was performed on 32 radiology residents in our department before and 6 months after the release of the PDA-based system. We assessed the changes in (1) sources of learning at home and at work and in (2) data reference. The second survey also evaluated the usefulness of each component of the system. Results. After the release of the PDA-based mobile system the use of digital books and references as data references and educational resources that were brought to work every day significantly increased (P = .016 P < .0001 respectively). Traditional books and references remained the most useful source in learning radiology however digital books and references increased as the residents' first choice from 0% to 16% within 6 months of introducing the package (P = .125). Conclusion. The introduction of a PDA-based system consisting of educational and departmental information had a statistically significant impact in increasing the use of digitized information in radiology resident education.

Rationale and Objectives. We describe a simple technique for transmission of a complete set of cranial computed tomography (CT) images to a commercially available wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) for remote teleradiology consultation. Materials and Methods. A complete set of images from the head CT of a trauma patient with subdural hematoma (19 images) was captured from a picture archiving and communication system and transmitted wirelessly as an e-mail attachment after being compressed. The images were retrieved decompressed and reviewed using commercially available software and a PDA with cellular phone capability. Results. A complete head CT was transmitted to a remote radiologist's wireless PDA for consultation. The entire procedure (including image capture transmission and review) took approximately 11.5 minutes. Conclusion. Using the technique described in this article the wireless PDA may function as a robust medium for facilitating care of brain trauma patients by allowing rapid access to trauma radiologists or neurosurgeons.;2004
Recently there have been numerous advances in the treatment of UA/NSTEMI based on large randomized trials. However there are also data from several registries that have shown underutilization of these therapies. National guidelines such as the ACC/AHA Guidelines are designed to provide clinicians recommendations for optimal care. There are some initial data from the TIMI 3 and GUARANTEE registries that publication of such guidelines does appear to help improve compliance with evidence-based optimal care however it appears that critical pathways and specific tools such as standardized orders or checklists are needed to more fully implement the recommendations. One newer type of tool are Palm Pilot programs such as the 3 presented here where it is hoped that their use at the bedside with provide clinicians rapid access to evidence-based medicine ina format that can be useful in a busy practice setting.;2004
Recently new standards have emerged in the telecommunication industry which provide an open global specification that enables mobile devices to access and interact with information and services instantly. These mobile devices are for example laptops and personal digital assistants. These emerging standards generically called wireless x area networks (WxAN) will in the future be frequently operated from inside vehicles as part of the deployment of mobile offices and to support advanced intelligent transportation system services. These wireless networks currently operate between 1-6 GHz although 60 GHz could be used when the technology will be economically viable. These mobile devices are frequently put to use in vehicles. To be ensure that portable equipment left in a jacket pocket somewhere in the trunk can interact with other car equipment or portable objects elsewhere in the car needs some investigation. Thus this paper characterizes radio-frequency propagation inside vehicle bodies with passengers in order to evaluate the effectiveness of such a WxAN in vehicle environments.;2004
Recently wireless LAN systems have been widely deployed for public mobile Internet services. Public wireless LAN systems can provide high speed Internet connectivity using portable devices such as laptop computers personal digital assistants (PDAs) etc. In public wireless LAN systems reliable user authentication and mobility support are essential issues. However reauthentication during handoff procedures causes long handoff latency and this affects the quality of service in real-time multimedia applications. A fast handoff scheme based on mobility. prediction is proposed. In this scheme a mobile host entering the area covered by an access point (AP) performs authentication procedures for multiple APs rather than just the current AP. These multiple APs are selected by a prediction method called the frequent handoff region (FHR) selection algorithm which takes into account users' mobility patterns service classes etc. Since a mobile host is registered and authenticated for an FHR in advance handoff latency resulting from re-authentication can be significantly reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is more efficient than other schemes in terms of handoff delay and buffer requirements.;2004
Research was undertaken to guide development of services for personal digital assistant (PDA) users at the University of Alberta Libraries. A variety of qualitative methods were used to assess user satisfaction with current PDA services and identify potential PDA services for the libraries and resources. The research and needs assessment results demonstrate an emerging interest in PDA technologies supported by the libraries as well as the types of services and resources users would value. Results guided the libraries' direction and encouraged further expansion of services.;2004
Searching for and making decisions about information is becoming increasingly difficult as the amount of information and number of choices increases. Recommendation systems help users find items of interest of a particular type such as movies or restaurants but are still somewhat awkward to use. Our solution is to take advantage of the complementary strengths of personalized recommendation systems and dialogue systems creating personalized aides. We present a system-the ADAPTIVE PLACE ADVISOR - that treats item selection as an interactive conversational process with the program inquiring about item attributes and the user responding. Individual long-term user preferences are unobtrusively obtained in the course of normal recommendation dialogues and used to direct future conversations with the same user. We present a novel user model that influences both item search and the questions asked during a conversation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in significantly reducing the time and number of interactions required to find a satisfactory item as compared to a control group of users interacting with a non-adaptive version of the system.;2004
Shortest path search has important practical applications and is related to optimization problem. This paper discusses a new algorithm time-synchronous heuristic dynamic programming search which combined the pruning and global optimization of DP (Dynamic programming) and the partial search of heuristic strategy and found the shortest path in time O(n/k(d)) (k d greater than or equal to 1). Furthermore the algorithm can be applied to find the K shortest paths between a pair of given nodes or all paths less than a given length within the same steps. Finally this algorithm was applied to the shortest path search on the real map and user could use spoken dialog to query shortcut in real time 90% of the system responses are correct.;2004
The electronic industries have been tried to develop the electronic packaging technology for high-density light weight and miniaturization of mobile personal information terminals such as notebook PC personal digital assistant (PDA) or handheld PC as the performance and the portability of the system have been become important more and more. The generated heat from the CPU of the electronic system should be dissipated effectively for the stability in operation and the long life-time of the system. In the present study micro-heat pipes (MHPs) with cross-section of polygon have been manufactured and tested for operating characteristics and heat transfer limit. An additional process for installing a wick that is an inevitable component of heat pipes is not required for the MHP. For a small-sized heat pipe in the present study a high precision technology is needed in manufacturing process. The MHPs tested in this paper have a triangular cross-section with curved sides and a rectangular cross-section with curved sides. The material of the MHP is copper and the working fluid of it is pure water. The test was performed in a vacuum chamber to minimize heat loss. The operating temperatures of the MHP were considered from 60 to 90 degreesC. From the test results the MHP with triangular cross-section can dissipate up to a thermal load of 7 W.

The evolution from traditional circuit-based networks to packet-based networks is a salient feature of today's telecommunications industry. As new types of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks and endpoints (e.g. 3rd Generation Partnership Project Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem [3GPP IMS] cable public switched telephone network [PSTN] gateways and 802.11-capable personal digital assistant [PDAs]) are introduced SIP extensions are being introduced to solve the problems unique to each of them. As SIP networks mature to support mixed endpoint types interesting issues relating to interoperability among the various endpoints arise. This paper includes a discussion of some of these issues including out-of-band versus in-band call progress information handling early media support of Internet Protocol (IP) and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) transport networks interworking with ISDN User Part (ISUP) and support of different SIP extensions. It also explores issues of performance reliability and service quality that arise as networks serving mixed endpoints are deployed. (C) 2004 Lucent Technologies Inc.;2004
The main purpose of this paper was to present a distributed speech interactive system built on LAN (Local area network) which integrated Automatic speech recognition (ASR) Text to speech (TTS) and Natural language perception (NLP) technologies to allow multiusers to access and converse with it concurrently. During a typical telephone based interaction users could retrieve up-to-date stock information and call for somebody by directly speaking their name. Though there were far too many papers published to describe such system most of them all focused on the algorithm on speech recognition rather than the architecture. Our paper was written to make for it and proposed an efficient and effective dynamic load balancing algorithm with sender active and non-preemptive concepts based on the distributed architecture and multithread concurrency in order to solve the loads allocating when multi-users accessed the system and gave rise to much burden to the servers. This paper was composed of five part: (1) an introduction about why such architecture was built (2) an overview about the system (3) proposed and implemented the algorithm (4) evaluated and tested the system performance based on the architecture and (5) a brief summary.;2004
The paper shows how secure telecommunication services supporting user and terminal mobility and service personalization can be designed using the SCARAB architecture developed within the EU ACTS SCARAB project. The most important aspects of this architecture are the combined use of smart cards and mobile code technologies to solve the mobility and personalization issues and the ability to support different types of terminals ranging from powerful PC terminals to mobile personal digital assistants. These features are illustrated through the design of a demonstrative service. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2004
The personal data assistant is a powerful tool enabling data acquisition analysis and scheduling. The Palm and Windows Pocket PC Operating Systems are available in various personal data assistants that combine bright screens ease of use and compactness. Data that are acquired can be imported into standardized spreadsheets for statistical analysis. Report generation using these data can simplify record keeping facilitate later research and decrease secretarial typing time. The use of a forms manager such as Pendragon Forms enables rapid creation of personal data assistant forms that interface with numerous computer database programs. We currently use theses programs for data acquisition when patients are seen in the office in the operating room and when returning for followup.;2004
the point of patient care. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) or hand-held devices demonstrate great promise as point of care information devices. An earlier study [The Constellation Project: experience and evaluation of personal digital assistants in the clinical environment in: Proceedings of the 19th Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care 1995 678] on the use of PDAs at the point of care found that hardware constraints such as memory capability limited their usefulness however they were used frequently for accessing medical references and drug information [The Constellation Project: experience and evaluation of personal digital assistants in the clinical environment in: Proceedings of the 19th Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care 1995 678]. Since this study was completed in 1995 hand-held computer technology has advanced rapidly and between 26 and 50% of physicians currently use PDAs [Physician's use of hand-helds increases from 15% in 1999 to 26% in 2001: Harris interactive poll results Harris Poll. 8-24-2002 (electronic citation) ACP-ASIM survey finds nearly half of U.S. members use hand-held computers: ACP-ASIM press release American College of Physicians 9-3-2002 (electronic citation)]. This use appears higher among residents with one recent study finding that over two-thirds of family practice residencies use hand-held computers in their training programs [J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 9 (1) (2002) 80]. In this study we systematically evaluate PDA usage by residents in our institution using quantitative and qualitative methods. Our evaluation included a brief on-line survey of 88 residents in seven residency programs including primary care and specialty practices. The surveys were completed between 26 October 2001 and 30 April 2002. Follow-up interviews with 15 of the surveyed residents were then conducted between 24 April 2002 and 13 May 2002. The original contributions of this study are the evaluation of residents in primary and specialty programs and evaluation of both medical application software and the conventional personal organizational software (such as calendars and to-do lists). This evaluation was also conducted using significantly advanced hardware and software compared with previous studies (The Constellation Project: experience and evaluation of personal digital assistants in the clinical environment in: Proceedings of the 19th Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care 1995 678].;2004
The present study evaluates user preferences for personalized information access through mobile devices. The research focuses on text search operations in three simulated devices on a PC screen (cellular telephone Personal Digital Assistant [PDA] and Interactive TV [ITV] as control) through continuous search. The adaptation process implemented explicit user feedback regarding the relevance of the retrieved information. The results show that users preferred the adaptive information access system to the non-adaptive one for all the devices (PDA cellular phone and ITV). Moreover adaptation neutralizes the consisient preference for ITV (big screen easy manipulation) upon other devices for textual information manipulation tasks.;2004
The proliferation of mobile computing devices including laptops personal digital assistants (PDAs) and wearable computers has created an enormous demand for wireless personal area networks (WPANs). WPANs originally enabled convenient interconnection of devices around an individual person or computer. From this starting point a broad variety of new wireless appliances has been developed allowing proximal devices to share information and resources. Major fields of application are industrial scientific and medical (ISM) but also consumer electronics and smart home appliances. However for this short-range wireless connectivity some additional challenges must be resolved. They are: (i) topology issues i.e. self-organising ad hoc and mesh networking (ii) device issues i.e. efficient modular low-cost and power-saving implementation and (iii) security issues. The paper gives an overview of the challenges and suggests different solutions especially in the field of security. In addition it reports on working experience with two protocols: Bluetooth and IEEE802.15.4.;2004
The understanding module of a spoken dialogue system must extract from the speech recognizer output the kind of request expressed by the caller (the call type) and its parameters (numerical expressions time expressions or proper-names). Such expressions are called Named Entities and their definitions can be either generic or linked to the dialogue application domain. Detecting and extracting such Named Entities within a mixed-initiative dialogue context like How May I Help You?(smtm) (HMIHY) is the subject of this study. After reviewing standard methods based on hand-written grammars and statistical tagging we propose a new approach combining the advantages of both in a 2-step process We also propose a novel architecture which exploits understanding to improve recognition accuracy: the output of the Automatic Speech Recognition module is now a word lattice and the understanding module is responsible for transcribing the word strings which are useful to the Dialogue Manager. All the methods proposed are trained and evaluated on a corpus comprising utterances from live customer traffic. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2004
This article describes a speech-based user interface to a wide range of entertainment navigation and communication applications in mobile environments by means of human-machine dialogues. The system has been developed in the framework of the EU-project SENECA. It uses noise reduction speech recognition and dialogue processing techniques. One interesting aspect relies in the fact that low speech recognition confidence and word-level ambiguities are compensated by engaging flexible clarification dialogues with the user. The SENECA system demonstrator has been evaluated by means of user tests. With speech input road safety especially for complex tasks is significantly improved. Compared to manual input the feeling of being distracted from driving is less important with speech. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2004
This article describes an application for capturing delivering and tracking urgent radiology exam results. Urgent exam findings are entered using a Web form embedded within the Picture archiving and communication system (PACS) display station. The findings are then accessible via soft copy using the PACS display stations hospital information system (HIS) terminals or wireless-enabled personal digital assistants (PDAs) or via hard copy printouts that are generated automatically or on demand. Additionally quality control is performed on those findings entered by radiology residents and fellows the results of which are used for both performance tracking and educational activities. The application was developed using Sun Microsystems' Java programming language. The Java Message Service (JMS) was used to manage the delivery of findings. JMS provides a robust flexible framework for exchanging messages between disparate applications. The application is now used for all urgent exams completely replacing the original paper-based system. The use of JMS provides the necessary level of reliability needed by this application.;2004
This article describes children's use of networked technology in three branches of an urban public library. Direct observations of their use of computers and data gathered from brief interviews with them were recorded using personal digital assistants (PDAs). Findings suggest that (1) the largest proportion of children's use of computers is for access to games (2) use of computers for communication purposes (e.g. chat e-mail and word processing) is minimal and (3) repeat use of the computers varies by branch. Grade level analysis reveals that middle school students access games less than elementary students do at two branches and that middle school students use the computers more than elementary students do for communication purposes. Overall girls and boys use games chat and e-mail in comparable proportions. In other categories of use there are gender differences but no consistent pattern emerges across branches. This investigation provides a first view of children's unmediated use of technology in the public library their reasons for using library computers and provides baseline data for assessing the outcomes of technology programs and services developed by the library to serve the needs of this user group.

This article reports on one aspect of a Laser Foundation-funded research project that tested different models of e-book delivery and offered guidelines for developing e-book collections in UK public libraries. An e-book collection was offered to library users (primarily users relying on a mobile library service) on Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices at Essex County Libraries. The article considers reaction from both library users and staff. A number of positive and negative reactions to e-books were noted and the indicative results point to the conclusion that dedicated PDA collections still offer questionable benefits for use in public libraries.;2004
This case study explores how educational training and clinical practice that uses personal computers (PCs) and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to access Internet-based medical information affects the engagement modes of students flow experience components and IT-competence. A questionnaire assessing these variables was administered before and after a training course. A follow-up interview investigated the contextual factors related to the use of PDAs. There were significant increases in IT-competence and in the positive and negative modes of engagement except for the Ambition/Curiosity mode. The overall flow experience did not change significantly over time. The PDA users showed an increase in negative modes across time larger than PC users due to technical emotional and motivational factors. This study concludes that a student's interaction with PCs and in particular PDAs produces positive and negative engagement modes and flow experiences that can be better understood by using the Engagement Modes model (EM-model).;2004
This paper addresses the quality of telephone services which rely on spoken dialogue systems enabling the spoken interaction between a human user and a speech technology device over the phone. During the interaction parameters are collected which characterize the behavior of both interaction partners. These parameters are used to calculate an estimation of different quality aspects perceived by the user or of global user satisfaction. On the basis of own experimental data the most well-known estimation algorithm - the PARADISE model - is analyzed in detail with respect to its input parameters the estimated quality indices as well as its internal algorithmic structure. New approaches to improve the genericness of the underlying structure are presented following a classification of quality aspects described in [1]. It turns out that current modelling approaches are still very limited in their predictive power. Cross-laboratory data collection and new interaction parameters are necessary to overcome the observed limitations.;2004
This paper describes a generic model for personality mood and emotion simulation for conversational virtual humans. We present a generic model for updating the parameters related to emotional behaviour as well as a linear implementation of the generic update mechanisms. We explore how existing theories for appraisal can be integrated into the framework. Then we describe a prototype system that uses the described models in combination with a dialogue system and a talking head with synchronized speech and facial expressions.

This paper examines the effects of spoken vs. written dialogue modalities on the effectiveness of information search with a computerized retrieval system. Forty-eight adults familiar with the use of computers were asked to carry out six information retrieval tasks engaging with the system using either spoken or written communication. The written modality was more efficient with regard to the number of dialogue turns length of interaction with the system and mental workload. Even though the turns lasted longer in the written mode they appeared to yield less mental workload. Moreover spoken and written dialogues did not differ as regards the use of pronouns and articles. The implications for the development of natural-language dialogue systems are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2004
This paper presents our work in the ADVICE (IST-1999-11305 Information Societies Technology Programme V Framework Programme of the European Commission) project an on-going European Commission research project of the IST Programme. The overall objective of this project is to design and implement an advice-giving system for E-commerce supporting a move from the cur-rent catalogue-based customer services to a customer adapted intelligent assistance emulating in some way the performance of a human seller. With this aim the main elements of the ADVICE approach include an agent-based architecture with an Interface Agent to manage the multimedia presentation the Interaction Agent to support an advanced user-system interaction and the Intelligent Agent incorporating a knowledge-based model of the e-business for the pilot domain that supports the reasoning for advise-giving according with the user needs and the dialogue evolution.

This paper proposes a mobile patient monitoring system which integrates current personal digital assistant (PDA) technology and wireless local area network (WLAN) technology. At the patient's location a wireless PDA-based monitor is used to acquire continuously the patient's vital signs including heart rate three-lead electrocardiography and SpO(2). Through the WLAN the patient's biosignals can be transmitted in real-time to a remote central management unit and authorized medical staffs can access the data and the case history of the patient either by the central management unit or the wireless devices. A prototype of this system has been developed and implemented. The system has been evaluated by technical verification clinical test and user survey. The evaluation of performance yields a high degree of satisfaction (mean = 4.64 standard deviation-SD = 0.53 in a five-point Likert scale) of users who used the PDA-based system for intrahospital transport. The results also show that the wireless PDA model is superior to the currently used monitors both in mobility and in usability and is therefore better suited to patient transport.;2004
This study evaluated personal digital assistant (PDA) microbial colonization before and after cleaning with alcohol. Samples from 75 PDAs were processed. Before cleaning 96% of the samples were culture positive. After cleaning 75% became culture negative. PDAs cleaned with an alcohol swab demonstrated significant reduction in colonization.;2004
This study investigated the effects of the type of menu (scrolling or hierarchy) and the stage of usage (whether the current usage is the first second. third fourth fifth or eighth day of usage) on the users' performance in operating a menu displayed in the first second or third layers of personal digital assistant (PDA) display. Experimental results demonstrate that neither operating time nor number of clicks differed significantly between the subjects' adoption of either the scrolling or the hierarchical menu displayed in the first layer. Significant differences were observed however when subjects adopted the menu displayed in the second layer. The hierarchical menu was more effective than the scrolling menu. When subjects adopted a menu displayed in the third layer only the operating time differed significantly. The amount of previous use significantly affected users' operating performance only of menus displayed in the second and third layers. The operating performance increased as the usage time increased.

Today Internet-based appliances can allow a user to interact with the server-side services and information using different kinds of computing platforms including traditional office desktops palmtops as well as a large variety of wireless devices including mobile telephones Personal Digital Assistants and Pocket Computers. This technological context imposes new challenges in user interface software engineering. as it must run on different computing platforms accommodating the capabilities of various devices and the different contexts of use. Challenges are triggered also because of the universal access requirements for a diversity of users. The existing approaches of designing a single user interface using one computing platform do not adequately address the challenges of diversity cross-platform consistency universal accessibility and integration. Therefore there is an urgent need for a new integrative framework for modeling designing and evaluating multi-device user interfaces for the emerging generation of interactive systems. This paper begins by describing a set of constraints and characteristics intrinsic to multi-device user interfaces and then by examining the impacts of these constraints on the specification design and validation processes. Then it discusses the research opportunities in important topics relevant to multi-device user interface development including task and model-based pattern-driven and device-independent development. We will highlight how research in these topics can contribute to the emergence of an integrative framework for Multiple-User Interface design and validation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Two studies of spoken telephone number transfers-in which one participant communicates a number to the other-are reported. The data comprised transcripts of telephone conversations between callers and operators for the second corpus audio recordings were also available. In most cases the caller was giving the number to the operator and in these dialogues a chunked echo protocol was found to be very common with the operator repeating each chunk of one or more digits to the caller for confirmation before the next chunk was given. Errors in speaking and in recognition were corrected efficiently within this protocol. The observations support a model of dialogue in which a single utterance unit can perform multiple dialogue acts and in which discourse units can have hierarchical structure. Examination of the audio recordings showed that there was usually very little silence and sometimes a slight overlap between conversational turns.

We attach in inexpensive pressure sensor to the side of a personal digital assistant and use it as three input devices at once. Users can squeeze the device to provide near-continuous input to applications. At the same time the drivers interpret a sudden full squeeze as the push of a virtual button. A user's Sudden pressure release while squeezing is detected as the push of a second virtual button. We briefly describe our hardware and signal processing techniques. The remainder of the writing describes an experiment that explores whether users can cope cognitively with the 3-in-1 control. We compare against a three-control setup consisting of a jog wheel and two physical buttons. We show that the three-in-one control enables a 13% faster reaction time over the three-control one but that the three-in-one control suffers a 4% penalty in the accuracy of users choosing between the two buttons in response to cues from an application. We show that a good choice of application cue is more important for assuring accuracy in the 3-in-1 than in the more traditional set of separate controls. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We explore a voice user interface for human-machine communication that uses a dialogue structure personalized to an individual user subject to the constraints of the system's resources. Conventional dialogue systems typically use architectures that create a set of predefined speech objects or subdialogues by combining several static components such as grammars and other language components. Such systems are limited because most databases are dynamic and users have different preferences for topical content and presentation format. Ideally a dialogue would combine a user's intentions encoded in a profile with information and services available in a dynamic and distributed external environment. We use a modular architecture where a centralized Application Generator (AG) interacts with two managers. A user's preferences are stored in a profile handled by a Profile Manager. An Information Manager uses these preferences when accessing external databases and extracting filtering or presenting information in a form customized to that particular user. The AG then builds an anticipated dialogue allowing a user to navigate between a personalized set of services each of which presents information and services in a manner customized for that user. Therefore the AG generates in a uniform and consistent manner a finite state dialogue for any task described by a set of specifications residing on a distributed network. Finally a dialogue manager uses a set of protocols to carry out an actual dialogue session with the user. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2004
We present a framework to measure empirically the size of indirect network effects in high-technology markets with competing incompatible technology standards. These indirect network effects arise due to inter-dependence in demand for hardware and compatible software. By modeling the joint determination of hardware sales and software availability in the market we are able to describe the nature of demand inter-dependence and to measure the size of the indirect network effects. We apply the model to price and sales data from the industry for personal digital assistants (PDAs) along with the availability of software titles compatible with each PDA hardware standard. Our empirical results indicate significant indirect network effects. By July 2002 the network effect explains roughly 22% of the log-odds ratio of the sales of all Palm O/S compatible PDA-s to Microsoft O/S compatible PDA-s where the remaining 78% reflects price and model features. We also use our model estimates to study the growth of the installed bases of Palm and Microsoft PDA hardware with and without the availability of compatible third party software. We find that lack of third party software negatively impacts the evolution of the installed hardware bases of both formats. These results suggest PDA hardware firms would benefit from investing resources in increasing the provision of software for their products. We then compare the benefits of investments in software with investments in the quality of hardware technology. This exercise helps disentangle the potential for incremental hardware sales due to hardware quality improvement from that of positive feedback due to market software provision.;2004
We present an approach to human-robot interaction through gesture-free spoken dialogue. Our approach is based on passive knowledge rarefication through goal disambiguation a technique that allows a human operator to collaborate with a mobile robot on various tasks through spoken dialogue without making bodily gestures. A key assumption underlying our approach is that the operator and the robot share a common set of goals. Another key idea is that language vision and action share common memory structures. We discuss how our approach achieves four types of human-robot interaction: command goal disambiguation introspection and instruction-based learning. We describe the system we developed to implement our approach and present experimental results.;2004
When people en-age in conversation they tailor their utterances to their conversational partners whether these partners are other humans or computational systems. This tailoring or adaptation to the partner takes place in all facets of human language use and is based on a mental model or a user model of the conversational partner. Such adaptation has been shown to improve listeners' comprehension their satisfaction with an interactive system the efficiency with which they execute conversational tasks and the likelihood of achieving higher level goals such as changing the listener's beliefs and attitudes. We focus on one aspect of adaptation namely the tailoring of the content of dialogue system utterances for the higher level processes of persuasion argumentation and advice-giving. Our hypothesis is that algorithms that adapt content for these processes according to a user model will improve the usability efficiency and effectiveness of dialogue systems. We describe a multimodal dialogue system and algorithms for adaptive content selection based on multi-attribute decision theory. We demonstrate experimentally the improved efficacy of system responses through the Use Of user models to both tailor the content of system utterances and to manipulate their conciseness.

Whereas existing learning environments on the Web lack high level interactivity we have developed a human tutor-like tutorial conversation system for the Web that enhances educational courseware through mixed-initiative dialog with natural language processing. The conversational tutoring agent is composed of an animated tutor a Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) module a database with curriculum scripts and a dialog manager. As in the case of human tutors the meaning of learner's contributions in natural language are compared with the content of expected answers to questions or problems specified in curriculum scripts. LSA is used to evaluate the conceptual matches between learner input and tutor expectations whereas the dialog manager determines how the tutor adaptively responds to the learner by selecting content from the curriculum script. The integration of available courseware with the tutorial dialog system guarantees the reusability of existing Web tutorials with minimal effort in the modification of the curriculum script and LSA module. This development thereby simplifies the change into more valuable Web based training courseware. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2004
Wireless handheld technology provides new ways to deliver and present information. As with any technology its unique features must be taken into consideration and its applications designed accordingly. In the clinical setting availability of needed information can be crucial during the decision-making process. Preliminary studies performed at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) determined that there are inadequate access to information and ineffective communication among clinicians (potential proximal causes of medical errors). In response to these findings the authors have been developing extensions to their Web-based clinical information system including PalmCIS an application that provides access to needed patient information via a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA). The focus was on achieving end-to-end security and developing a highly usable system. This report discusses the motivation behind PalmCIS design and development of the system and future directions.;2004
Wireless information technologies are providing new ways to communicate and are one of several information and communication technologies touted as an opportunity to reduce society's overall environmental impacts. However rigorous system-wide environmental impact comparisons of these technologies to the traditional applications they may replace have only recently been initiated and the results have been mixed. In this paper the environmental effects of two applications of wireless technologies are compared to those of conventional technologies for which they can substitute. First reading newspaper content on a personal digital assistant (PDA) is compared to the traditional way of reading a newspaper. Second wireless teleconferencing is compared to business travel. The results show that for both comparisons wireless technologies create lower environmental impacts. Compared to reading a newspaper receiving the news on a PDA wirelessly results in the release of 32-140 times less CO2 several orders of magnitude less NOx and SOx and the use of 26-67 times less water. Wireless teleconferencing results in 1-3 orders of magnitude lower CO2 NOx and SO2 emissions than business travel.;2004
Wireless LAN have spread very quickly over the past few years. Demand for wireless access to LANs has raised due to new mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants and a desire for seamless and permanent connections to networks. Nevertheless a lot of security issues remain and stop its deployment in corporations. One of the most important issues is the authentication of a terminal to an Access Point. We propose an interface to integrate the Extensible Authentication Protocol into smart cards and will show that smart cards could constitute the de-facto device for authentication in Wireless LAN as they are for GSM and will be for UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System).;2004
With the technical advances and market growth in the field the issues of evaluation and usability of spoken language dialogue systems unimodal as well as multimodal are as crucial as ever. This paper discusses those issues by reviewing a series of European and US projects which have produced major results on evaluation and usability. Whereas significant progress has been made on unimodal spoken language dialogue systems evaluation and usability the emergence of among others multimodal mobile and domain-oriented systems continues to pose entirely new challenges to research in evaluation and usability.

A four-element diversity-antenna array using four dielectric-loaded folded-loop antennas in a personal digital assistant (PDA) terminal operating at 5.2 GHz for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) application is introduced. The S-parameters and the radiation patterns of the antennas are assessed using a finite-integration technique (FIT) simulation and experimental measurements. The diversity performance is also evaluated by calculating the envelope-correlation coefficients and the mean effective gain (MEG) of the antennas. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2005
A fundamental requirement of any task-oriented dialogue system is the ability to generate object descriptions that refer to objects in the task domain. The subproblem of content selection for object descriptions in task-oriented dialogue has been the focus of much previous work and a large number of models have been proposed. In this paper we use the annotated coconut corpus of task-oriented design dialogues to develop feature sets based on Dale and Reiter's (1995) incremental model Brennan and Clark's (1996) conceptual pact model and Jordan's (2000b) intentional influences model and use these feature sets in a machine learning experiment to automatically learn a model of content selection for object descriptions. Since Dale and Reiter's model requires a representation of discourse structure the corpus annotations are used to derive a representation based on Grosz and Sidner's (1986) theory of the intentional structure of discourse as well as two very simple representations of discourse structure based purely on recency. We then apply the rule-induction program ripper to train and test the content selection component of an object description generator on a set of 393 object descriptions from the corpus. To our knowledge this is the first reported experiment of a trainable content selection component for object description generation in dialogue. Three separate content selection models that are based on the three theoretical models all independently achieve accuracies significantly above the majority class baseline (17%) on unseen test data with the intentional influences model (42.4%) performing significantly better than either the incremental model (30.4%) or the conceptual pact model (28.9%). But the best performing models combine all the feature sets achieving accuracies near 60%. Surprisingly a simple recency-based representation of discourse structure does as well as one based on intentional structure. To our knowledge this is also the first empirical comparison of a representation of Grosz and Sidner's model of discourse structure with a simpler model for any generation task.;2005
A novel approach to the task of verifying the uttered topic for simple dialogue systems is presented. Confidence measures generated by in-parallel topic-adapted automatic speech recognisers are used. Recognition performance identification of user intention and detection of user-initiated topic change are greatly enhanced most particularly for difficult topics such as proper names or confirmations.;2005
A novel mobile system has been developed for use by radiologists in managing Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image data. The system consists of a mobile DICOM server (MDS) and personal digital assistants (PDAs) including a Linux PDA with a video graphics array (VGA) display (307200 pixels 3.7 inches). The MDS weighs 410 g has a 60-GB hard disk drive and a built-in wireless local area network (LAN) access point and supports a DICOM server (Central Test Node). The Linux-based MDS can be accessed with personal computers (PCs) and PDAs by means of a wireless or wired LAN and client-server communications can be established at any time. DICOM images can be displayed by using any PDA or PC by means of a Web browser. Simultaneous access to the MDS is possible for multiple authenticated users. With most PDAs image compression is necessary for complete display of DICOM images however the VGA screen can display a 512 x 512-pixel DICOM image almost in its entirety. This wireless system allows efficient management of heavy loads of lossless DICOM image data and will be useful for collaborative work by radiologists in education conferences and research.

A novel thin internal planar antenna for GSM/DCS/PCS/UMTS quad-band operation in a PDA (personal digital assistant) phone is presented. The proposed internal antenna has a small thickness of only 3 mm. Yet it is capable of providing two wide operating bands at about 0.9 and 2 GHz so as to meet the bandwidth requirements of the GSM/DCS/PCS/UMTS systems. Details of the design considerations of the proposed antenna are described and the experimental results of the constructed prototype are presented. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2005
A small electronic nose (E-Nose) system has been developed using an 8-channel vapor detection array and personal digital assistant (PDA). The sensor array chip integrated on a single microheater-embedded polyimide substrate was made of carbon black-polymer composites with different kinds of polymers and plasticizers. We have successfully classified various volatile organic compounds such as methanol ethanol i-propanol benzene toluene n-hexane n-heptane and c-hexane with the aid of the sensor array chip and have evaluated the resolution factors among them quantitatively. To achieve a PDA-based E-Nose system we have also elaborated small sensor-interrogating circuits simple vapor delivery components and data acquisition and processing programs. As preliminary results show the miniaturized E-Nose system has demonstrated the identification of essential oils extracted from mint lavender and eucalyptus plants.;2005
Although syntactic structure has been used in recent work in language modeling there has not been much effort in using semantic analysis for language models. In this study we propose three new language modeling techniques that use semantic analysis for spoken dialog systems. We call these methods concept sequence modeling two-level semantic-lexical modeling and joint semantic-lexical modeling. These models combine lexical information with varying amounts of semantic information using annotation supplied by either a shallow semantic parser or full hierarchical parser. These models also differ in how the lexical and semantic information is combined ranging from simple interpolation to tight integration using maximum entropy modeling. We obtain improvements in recognition accuracy over word and class N-gram language models in three different task domains. Interpolation of the proposed models with class N-gram language models provides additional improvement in the air travel reservation domain. We show that as we increase the semantic information utilized and as we increase the tightness of integration between lexical and semantic items we obtain improved performance when interpolating with class language models indicating that the two types of models become more complementary in nature.

An efficient algorithm for rotational skew correction of business card images acquired in a PDA (personal digital assistant) camera is presented. The proposed method is composed of four parts: block adaptive binarisation (BAB) stripe generation skew angle calculation and image rotation. In BAB an input image is binarised block by block so as to lessen the effects of irregular illumination and shadow over the input image. In stripe generation character string clusters are generated merging adjacent characters and their strings and then only clusters useful for skew angle calculation are output as stripes. In skew angle calculation the direction angles of the stripes are calculated using their central moments and then the skew angle of the input image is determined averaging the direction angles. In image rotation the input image is rotated by the skew angle. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields root mean square error of 0.44 degrees for test images of several types of business cards acquired by a PDA under various surrounding conditions.;2005
As large-scale deployments of spoken dialog systems in call centers become more common a wealth of information is gathered about the call center business as well as the operation of these systems from their daily logs. This paper describes the VoiceTone Daily News data mining tool for analyzing this information and presenting it in a readily comprehensible and customizable form that is suitable for use by anyone from system designers to call center businesses. Relevant business and dialog features are extracted from the speech logs of caller-system interactions and tracked by trend analysis algorithms. We describe novel techniques for generating alerts on multiple data streams while avoiding redundant knock-on alerts. Some initial experiments with automated measures of dialog success are described as possible additional features to track. Features that move outside their expected bounds on a given day generate headlines as part of a website generated completely automatically from each day's logs. A drill-down facility allows headlines to be investigated all the way to viewing logs of individual interactions behind the headline and listening to the audio for individual turns.;2005
As the limited resolution and small screen restrict the amount of information to be displayed on PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) compressed display techniques can be effectively used. This paper presents the development of an intelligent compressed display system for 240x320 resolution PDAs which are most commonly used model. The proposed system. automatically generates compressed documents fit to the 240x320 resolution from any size input data. Through experiments with extensive real world dataset the proposed compression system has been shown to be promising(1).;2005
As we know the performance of the elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) deeply depends on the computation of scalar multiplication. Thus how to speed up the computation of the elliptic curve scalar multiplication is a significant issue. In 1994 Lim and Lee proposed a more flexible precomputation method used in wireless networks environments for speeding up the computation of exponentiation. This method can be also used for speeding up the scalar multiplication of elliptic curves. We call it LLECC method. However the less storage is equipped with the computing devices the less efficient it is. For this reason we propose a more efficient algorithm than LLECC's in this paper. First we modify LLECC method to reduce the storage of precomputed values and then propose an efficient algorithm based on the nonadjacent form (NAF) representation and multidoubling method. Furthermore the proposed algorithm can be also used for speeding up the multi-point multiplication of elliptic curves. According to the simulation results the proposed algorithm can reduce 11% and 21% in the aspect of the computational complexity and storage cost respectively in an elliptic curve of size 160-bit over finite fields with characteristic greater than 3 as compared with LLECC's. Finally we implement the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm-like (ECDSA-like) system in the personal digital assistant (PDA) using the proposed algorithms to improve the scalar multiplication.

Automatic dynamic displays e.g. scrolling displays are frequently used to present text information on small screens. This study examined the effects of three dynamic displays [leading scrolling and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)l and three presentations speeds [171 250 and 305 wpm (words per minute)] on subjects' reading comprehension for different types of small screens for laptops personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones. 12 college students who were native speakers of Chinese (4 men and 8 women between the ages of 19 and 36 years) participated. Scores for reading comprehension indicated (1) for laptops both leading displays and RSVP at speeds of about 250 wpm comprehension was highest (2) for PDAs and mobile phones scrolling displays and RSVP speeds of about 305 wpm were more suitable for presenting information in Chinese text (3) consequently RSVP appeared to be the most viable dynamic display on small screens and led to the highest reading comprehension for these Chinese readers.;2005
AutoTtitor simulates a human tutor by holding a conversation with the learner in natural language. The dialogue is augmented by an animated conversational agent and three-dimensional (3-D) interactive simulations in order to enhance the learner's engagement and the depth of the learning. Grounded in constructivist learning theories and tutoring research AutoTbtor achieves learning gains of approximately 0.8 sigma (nearly one letter grade) depending on the learning measure and comparison condition. The computational architecture of the system uses the.NET framework and has simplified deployment for classroom trials.;2005
Background - Recent data highlight a vital link between well-performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and survival after cardiac arrest however the quality of CPR as actually performed by trained healthcare providers is largely unknown. We sought to measure in-hospital chest compression rates and to determine compliance with published international guidelines. Methods and Results - We developed and validated a handheld recording device to measure chest compression rate as a surrogate for CPR quality. A prospective observational study of adult cardiac arrests was performed at 3 hospitals from April 2002 to October 2003. Resuscitations were witnessed by trained observers using a customized personal digital assistant programmed to store the exact time of each chest compression allowing offline calculation of compression rates at serial time points. In 97 arrests data from 813 minutes during which chest compressions were delivered were analyzed in 30-second time segments. In 36.9% of the total number of segments compression rates were < 80 compressions per minute (cpm) and 21.7% had rates < 70 cpm. Higher chest compression rates were significantly correlated with initial return of spontaneous circulation ( mean chest compression rates for initial survivors and nonsurvivors 90 +/- 17 and 79 +/- 18 cpm respectively P = 0.0033). Conclusions - In-hospital chest compression rates were below published resuscitation recommendations and suboptimal compression rates in our study correlated with poor return of spontaneous circulation. CPR quality is likely a critical determinant of survival after cardiac arrest suggesting the need for routine measurement monitoring and feedback systems during actual resuscitation.;2005
Background and Objectives: It is not yet known if personal digital assistant (PDA)-assisted evidence-based medicine (EBM) courses in postgraduate training enhance knowledge of common clinical problems. This study's objective was to determine if PDA-assisted EBM training would improve clinical knowledge. Methods: In a controlled trial intervention group residents received InfoRetriever on a PDA coupled with an EBM course integrated within clinical rotations in family medicine. The effect of the intervention and the rate of use of InfoRetriever on a written test of knowledge were evaluated after adjusting for baseline knowledge scores. The test measured knowledge of primary care management of hypertension and diabetes as well as estimation of disease probability. Results: There was no effect on first posttest knowledge scores of the intervention overall or of the rate with which participants had used InfoRetriever during the intervention. However when intervention group residents retook the test with access to InfoRetriever while taking the knowledge test scores increased 74% (+2.4 correct test questions). Access to InfoRetriever Clinical Prediction Rules on a PDA however had an unclear effect on residents' ability to estimate disease probability. Conclusions: There was no effect of a PDA-assisted EBM course on knowledge test scores although using the PDA during the test results in higher scores. It is unclear if using PDA Clinical Prediction Rules can improve residents' estimates of disease probability.;2005
Background and Objectives: This study's objective was to evaluate the acceptability effect and use of handheld computers (also known as personal digital assistants or PDAs) as a reward for undergraduate rural community-based family medicine preceptors. Methods: All rural undergraduate family physician teachers who accepted an undergraduate student for a 1-month placement were offered the choice between a PDA that carried medical software or a monetary payment of an equivalent value. Approximately 1 year later different surveys were sent to both groups of preceptors to collect data on their use of PDAs and computer technology. Results: The most commonly reported reason for choosing a PDA in lieu of payment was that it provided a good opportunity to learn about PDA technology. Of those who accepted a PDA however 10% had not yet used it and another 44% of recipients had difficulty in getting started using the PDA. There were more reported problems with the software than the hardware. When surveyed 1 year later those who received a PDA and were still using it reported satisfaction with the medical software ranging from 31% for Epocrates qid to 71% for the 5-Minute Medical Consult. More than 90% of those using their PDA 1 year later reported that they used it in clinical settings with 68% feeling their PDA had some or a significant effect on patient care. Conclusions: Rural family physicians appeared to find PDAs an acceptable reward for teaching based on the reported use and utility of their PDA but many had technical difficulties. Recipients of the PDA reported using their PDA primarily in the clinical setting with the feeling that the PDA had a positive effect on their patient care. Many users had difficulty with technical aspects of PDA use. To support PDA recipients technical assistance should be provided.;2005
Background: Although urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common nosocomial infection active UTI surveillance is often not feasible for infection control departments. Methods: As part of an ongoing urinary catheter evaluation we investigated the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of using handheld personal digital assistants (PDA) and computer-based UTI surveillance in comparison with traditional surveillance of UTIs among medical intensive care unit (MICU) patients. From September 22 2000 to October 22 2000 an infection control practitioner (ICP) actively surveyed all MICU patients who had a urinary catheter to determine criteria for a nosocomial UTI as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Research assistants visited the unit each day to determine which patients had urinary catheters and this information was uploaded to a database designed for laboratory-based UTI surveillance. Patients with a urinary catheter were included if admitted to the MICU for >48 hours and excluded if symptoms developed <48 hours after admission. Results: Both data collection methods identified 8 UTIs within the 1-month period with 3 UTIs meeting inclusion criteria. Traditional surveillance required 8 hours weekly whereas the PDA-computer surveillance required 1-and-a-half hours weekly. Traditional surveillance correctly attributed all 3 UTIs to the MICU. The PDA-computer surveillance incorrectly attributed the location of 2 of the UTIs. In both cases the UTI occurred less than 48 hours after the patient was transferred from the MICU. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that PDA surveillance detects nosocomial UTIs efficiently and is a novel timesaving technique that realizes a cost savings in the first year.;2005
Background: Increasing use of self reported health status in clinical practice and research as well as patient appreciation of monitoring fluctuations of health over time suggest a need for more frequent collection of data. Electronic use of health status measures in the follow up of patients is a possible way to achieve this. Objective: To compare self reported health status measures in a personal digital assistant (PDA) version and a paper/pencil version for test - retest reliability agreement between scores and feasibility. Methods: 30 patients with stable rheumatoid arthritis ( mean age 61.6 years range 49.8 to 70.0 mean disease duration 16.7 years 63% female 67% rheumatoid factor positive 46.6% on disease modifying antirheumatic drugs) completed self reported health status measures ( pain fatigue and global health on visual analogue scales ( VAS) rheumatoid arthritis disease activity index modified health assessment questionnaire SF-36) in a conventional paper based questionnaire version and on a PDA ( HP iPAQ model h5450). Completion was repeated after five to seven days. Results: Test - retest reliability was similar as evaluated by the Bland - Altman approach the coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation coefficients. The scores showed acceptable agreement but with a slight tendency to higher scores on VAS with the PDA than the paper/pencil version. No significant differences were seen for measures of feasibility ( time to complete satisfaction score) but 65.5% preferred PDA 20.7% preferred paper and 13.8% had no preference. Conclusions: The clinimetric performance of paper/pencil versions of self reported health status measures was similar to an electronic version using an inexpensive PDA.;2005
BACKGROUND: Internal medicine residents are deficient in their knowledge about familial colorectal cancer (CRC) and thus unable to comply with appropriate screening guidelines. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a mixed educational program that incorporates both a didactic lecture (DL) and interactive case-based seminar (ICBS) plus distribution of a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based risk assessment tool. METHODS: Internal medicine resident continuity care teams were randomly assigned to an intervention (9 teams 43 residents) or control (11 teams 39 residents) arm. Both groups participated in a DL addressing the current status of CRC screening for average moderate and high-risk groups. Intervention teams also participated in a 1-h pre-clinic ICBS that included vignettes about patients at moderate or high risk of CRC because of family history following which they received the risk assessment tool by e-mail. Knowledge and clinical risk assessment skills were evaluated using pre/posttests patient exit interviews and chart audits. RESULTS: Baseline test scores were similar for both groups (intervention 51% vs control 54% p = 0.35). Immediate post-ICBS scores (intervention group only) significantly increased to 82% (p < 0.001). Six-month post-ICBS scores declined for the intervention group but remained significantly higher than 6-month control group scores (63% vs 56% p = 0.002) which were unchanged from baseline. No significant differences were observed with respect to family history-taking or documentation skills. CONCLUSION: A mixed educational program that incorporates both a DL and ICBS is more effective that the DL alone for increasing knowledge about familial CRC risk but may have limited influence on clinical risk assessment skills.;2005
Background: The gastric stasis that commonly accompanies migraine headache may impair absorption of conventional oral tablets in the stomach. A fastdisintegrating/rapid-release formulation of sumatriptan has been developed to enhance tablet disintegration and drug dispersion and potentially improve absorption. Objective: Two studies were conducted comparing the time to onset of relief from moderate or severe migraine pain with the fast-disintegrating/rapid-release formulation of sumatriptan tablets 50 and 100 mg and placebo. Methods: These were 2 identically designed randomized double-blind parallel-group studies. Sumatriptan 50 or 100 mg or placebo was taken on an outpatient basis to treat a single moderate or severe migraine attack. Using a personal digital assistant patients recorded the time of dosing and the time at which pain severity reached none or mild (le pain relief) or none (le pain free) in real time so that the time to onset of relief could be measured as a continuous variable. Onset of relief was defined as the earliest time point at which a statistically significant difference in pain relief compared with placebo was achieved and maintained through 2 hours after dosing. Before dosing and at predetermined time points after dosing patients also provided an assessment of migraine pain as none mild moderate or severe. At a clinic visit within 1 week after treatment of the migraine attack patients were queried about adverse events. For each adverse event investigators recorded whether study medication was considered the cause. Data analyses were undertaken for each study individually and in post hoc analyses of the primary and key secondary end points on pooled data from both studies. Results: The 2 studies comprised 2696 patients: 902 received sumatriptan 50 mg 902 received sumatriptan 100 mg and 892 received placebo. Patients' mean age ranged from 40.2 to 40.8 years across treatment groups and most patients were female (83%87%) and white (92%-93%). In the analysis of pooled data sumatriptan tablets provided significantly more effective pain relief compared with placebo as early as 20 minutes after dosing with the 100-mg dose and as early as 30 minutes after dosing with the 50-mg dose (P <= 0.05). Similar results were observed for the individual studies: in study 1 sumatriptan tablets were significantly more effective than placebo at 25 minutes with the 100-mg dose and at 50 minutes with the 50-mg dose in study 2 sumatriptan tablets were significantly more effective than placebo at 17 minutes for the 100-mg dose and at 30 minutes for the 50-mg dose (P <= 0.05). In the pooled data the cumulative percentages of patients with pain relief by 2 hours after dosing were 72% for the 100-mg dose and 67% for the 50-mg dose compared with 42% for placebo (P <= 0.001 both sumatriptan doses vs placebo). The cumulative percentages of patients with a pain-free response by 2 hours were 47% for the 100-mg dose 40% for the 50-mg dose and 15% for placebo (P <= 0.001 both sumatriptan doses vs placebo). In the individual studies significantly more patients receiving either sumatriptan dose were migraine free 2 hours after dosing and had sustained pain relief and a sustained pain-free response over 24 hours compared with placebo (P <= 0.001 both sumatriptan doses vs placebo). The only drug-related adverse events reported in > 2% of patients in any treatment group in either study were nausea (both studies: 3% sumatriptan 100 mg 2% sumatriptan 50 mg 1% placebo) and paresthesia (study 1: < 1% sumatriptan 100 mg < 1% sumatriptan 50 mg 0% placebo study 2: 3% sumatriptan 100 mg 1% sumatriptan 50 mg < 1% placebo). Conclusions: In these studies sumatriptan tablets in a fast-disintegrating/rapid-release formulation were effective for the acute treatment of moderate to severe migraine pain were generally well tolerated and achieved an onset of pain relief as early as 20 minutes for 100 mg and as early as 30 minutes for 50 mg.

Background: The on call service for health protection in most parts of the UK is provided by general public health consultants registrars and nurses as the first tier of response backed up by medical consultants in health protection. The first tier responder usually carries a large bag of papers containing both local and national guidance on the management of common cases/incidents. An electronic on call pack may provide a suitable practical alternative to large paper based systems and help professionals deliver out of hours health protection advice and response to incidents. Methods: We developed and piloted an electronic on call pack in Hertfordshire for use at the health protection unit level containing key local and national guidelines contact information and useful references. The on-call pack was initially piloted using a laptop and more recently using a personal digital assistant (PDA). The use of the on-call pack was evaluated. Results: Key advantages of the electronic system include reduced size faster access to information that is clearly indexed and the relative ease of updating information. As part of the pilot the electronic on call pack was presented to a local and regional training meeting with good response from participants using qualitative and quantitative methods. Conclusion: It is anticipated that with suitable evaluation this system can be adapted and utilised by other health protection practitioners. This system provides a fast reliable and easily maintained source of information for the public health on-call team.;2005
Background: The use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) by health care workers is increasing. Increasing rates of infection in our institution led to the question of whether PDAs were colonized with pathogenic organisms Methods: Specimens for culture were obtained from PDAs used at our institution and surveys were distributed to the users to determine factors predisposing to colonization. Results: Forty percent of PDAs had growth on culture. The most common organism detected on 27 of 82 PDAs was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (82%). No isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant enterococci were detected. Colonization was more common on PDAs that had undergone previous cleaning. No other predisposing factors to colonization were found. Conclusions: PDAs are frequently colonized with typical skin organisms and less commonly with pathogenic organisms. Whether PDAs used in the health care setting serve as vectors for nosocomial infection is not determined.;2005
Background: The utility of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in basic science medical education is uncertain. Description: Student outcomes on an epidemiology course final examination for academic years 2003 and 2004 were examined. Students were given permission to use PDAs on the final examination and self-selected whether these instruments were used. Performance on the examination based on use of a PDA and whether students thought it was useful for the examination was compared. Evaluation: A total of 389 students took the final examination with an 88% response rate to the survey questions. No statistically significant differences were found on final examination scores. No trends toward significance were found on analyses of the total examination specific topical domains or on specific questions where a PDA might be expected to be especially useful. Conclusions: From this study it can be concluded that use of PDAs and whether students thought they might be helpful had no measurable effect on performance on an epidemiology final examination. Further delineation of the possible use of PDAs in a basic science course and on the final examination is indicated.;2005
Cardiac auscultation is an important skill for medical students to master but students' exposure to cardiac auscultation is often unmonitored. The objective of this study was to gather data at the point of care about students' cardiac auscultation experience on a required medicine rotation using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) 'murmur form'. During an eight-month period 120 M3 students used the authors' PDA-based learning tool to record information on 940 heart sounds and murmurs. Some 93% of all heart sounds/murmurs reported by students were verified by either a faculty member (56%) or a supervising resident (43%). A PDA can be a useful tool to monitor students' experiences of cardiac auscultation and to track direct observation of such skills by faculty or residents. Medical students are eager to use technology at the point of care to practice their clinical skills.;2005
Construction project control aims to effectively obtain real-time information and enhance dynamic control by utilizing information sharing and connecting involved participants of the projects to reduce construction conflicts and project delays. However extending the construction project control system to job sites is not considered efficient because using notebooks in a harsh environment like a construction site is not particularly a conventional practice. Meanwhile paper-based documents of the site processes are ineffective and cannot get the quick response from the office and project control center Integrating promising information technologies such as personal digital assistants (PDA) bar code scanning and data entry mechanisms can be extremely useful in improving the effectiveness and convenience of information flow in construction supply chain control systems. Bar code scanning is appropriate for several construction applications providing cost savings through increased speed and accuracy of data entry. This article demonstrates the effectiveness of a bar-code-enabled PDA application called the mobile construction supply chain management (M-ConSCM) System that responds efficiently and enhances the information flow between offices and sites in a construction supply chain environment. The advantage of the M-ConSCM system lies not only in improving the efficiency of work for on-site engineers but also providing the Kanban-like visual control system for project participants to control the whole project. Moreover this article presents a generic system architecture and its implementation.;2005
Context The educational environment affects the outcomes of medical education including the characteristics and distribution of medical school graduates. Objective To report the status of variables related to medical education that represent areas that recently have been in flux or have potential impact on health care delivery. Design Setting and Participants Descriptive survey study comparing selected results of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education Annual Medical School Questionnaire between 2004-2005 and 1994-1995. The questionnaire was sent to the deans of all 125 LCME-accredited medical schools. Response rate was 100% in both years. Main Outcome Measures Overall trends between 1994-1995 and 2004-2005 in the size and composition of the medical school faculty the numbers of medical school applicants and students requirements for passage of the US Medical Licensing Examination medical student work hours the use of computers in the educational program the geographic pipeline from entry to medical school to entry to graduate medical education and the educational background of medical school deans. Results The number of full-time faculty members increased from 90016 in 19941995 to 119025 in 2004-2005 (a 32% increase) while the number of medical students remained constant at about 67 000. In 2004-2005 11 % of medical school deans held MID and PhD degrees 6% held MID and MBA degrees 4% held MID and MPH degrees and 2% held an MID and another degree (such as JD). In 2004-2005 68% of all first-year medical students were residents of the state in which the medical school is located and a mean of 43% of 2005 graduates remained in the same state as the medical school for graduate medical education results were similar in 1995. In 20042005 58 schools (46%) required students to have their own computers and 35 (28%) to have their own personal digital assistants. In 2004-2005 night call was less common in the family medicine internal medicine pediatrics and psychiatry clerkships compared with 1994-1995. Conclusions Although most students remain in their home state for medical school most students leave the medical school state for residency. Factors external to the medical school such as funding mechanisms and regulations from the public and private sectors may be having an impact on faculty size and composition and on the geographic pipeline of students into medical school and residency training.;2005
Context-awareness can be used to decrease the need for interaction with a mobile device. This is increasingly important since the functionality of mobile devices and personal digital assistants gets more and more complex while the input and output capabilities remain restricted. An important aspect of context-awareness is to present the current context to the user. We propose a model for visualizing contextual information on the mobile terminal screen. The model is a refinement of a well-known visualization reference model it takes into account the specific characteristics of mobile use and context information. We present the design of the model in detail and discuss its applicability for a variety of contexts and tasks by providing a full-fledged use case.;2005
Current user interfaces for automated patient and consumer health caresystems can be improved by leveraging the results of several decades of research into effective patient-provider communication skills. A research project is presented in which several such relational skills - including empathy social dialogue nonverbal immediacy behaviors and other behaviors to build and maintain good working relationships over multiple interactions - are explicitly designed into a computer interface within the context of a longitudinal health behavior change intervention for physical activity adoption. Results of a comparison among 33 subjects interacting near-daily with the relational system and 27 interacting near-daily with an identical system with the relational behaviors ablated each for 30 days indicate that the use of relational behaviors by the system significantly increases working alliance and desire to continue working with the system. Comparison of the above groups to another group of 31 subjects interacting with a control system near-daily for 30 days also indicated a significant increase in proactive viewing of health information.

Direct data entry using handheld computers may simplify and streamline data management especially in remote settings. We compared the accuracy of data entry using the current standard practice (a paper-based case report form with double data entry) with that using a personal digital assistant (PDA) in a clinical study in rural Gabon. The rate of discrepant entries was 1.7%. Categorical data (presented in pull down menus on the PDA) were more commonly discrepant than were continuous typed in data (2.4% versus 1.2% P = 0.001). Both systems functioned smoothly and no data were lost. The clinicians involved in this study preferred the handheld computers and their use will be considered in future studies in an African clinical research network.;2005
Electromagnetic interference produced by wireless communication can affect medical devices and hospital policies exist to address this risk. During the transfer of ventilated patients these policies may be compromised by essential communication between base and receiving hospitals. Local wireless networks (e.g. Bluetooth (R)) may reduce the 'spaghetti syndrome' of wires and cables seen on intensive care units but also generate electromagnetic interference. The aim of this study was to investigate these effects on displayed and actual ventilator performance. Methods: Five ventilators were tested: Drager Oxylog 2000 BREAS LTV-1000 Respironics BiPAP VISION Puritan Bennett 7200 and 840. Electromagnetic interference was generated by three devices: Simoco 8020 radio handset Nokia 7210 and Nokia 6230 mobile phone Nokia 6230 communicating via Bluetooth with a Palm Tungsten T Personal Digital Assistant. We followed the American National Standard Recommended Practice for On-Site Ad Hoc Testing (ANSI C63) for electromagnetic interference. We used a ventilator tester to simulate healthy adult lungs and measure ventilator performance. The communication device under test was moved in towards each ventilator from a distance of 1 m in six axes. Alarms or error codes on the ventilator were recorded as was ventilator performance. Results: All ventilators tested except for the Respironics VISION showed a display error when subjected to electromagnetic interference from the Nokia phones and Simoco radio. Ventilator performance was only affected by the radio which caused the Puritan Bennett 840 to stop functioning completely. The transfer ventilators' performance were not affected by radio or mobile phone although the mobile phone did trigger a low-power alarm. Effects on intensive care ventilators included display reset with the ventilator restoring normal display function within 2 s and low-power/low-pressure alarms. Bluetooth transmission had no effect on the function of all the ventilators tested. Conclusion: In a clinical setting high-power-output devices such as a two-way radio may cause significant interference in ventilator function. Medium-power-output devices such as mobile phones may cause minor alarm triggers. Low-power-output devices such as Bluetooth appear to cause no interference with ventilator function.;2005
Electronic memory aids have been used successfully to give reminders to individuals with memory problems. These aids usually present short action reminders that are acknowledged by the user. The recent enhancement of handheld computers with wireless technology has rendered them multi-functional and presents an opportunity to be exploited to meet the demands of the user. This paper describes the architecture of an electronic memory aid system we have developed and are currently evaluating with memory-impaired participants. In addition to providing action prompts the developed system allows data entry not only on the device itself but also from other stations. Hence the memory-impaired user and third parties can remotely enter data into the device depending on the skills of the user. The system also remotely monitors users' acknowledgements of reminders and allows third parties to initiate further actions where appropriate.;2005
Face recognition on mobile devices such as personal digital assistants and cell phones is a big challenge owing to the limited computational resources available to run verifications on the devices themselves. One approach is to transmit the captured face images by use of the cell-phone connection and to run the verification on a remote station. However owing to limitations in communication bandwidth it may be necessary to transmit a compressed version of the image. We propose using the image compression standard JPEG2000 which is a wavelet-based compression engine used to compress the face images to low bit rates suitable for transmission over low-bandwidth communication channels. At the receiver end the face images are reconstructed with a JPEG2000 decoder and are fed into the verification engine. We explore how advanced correlation filters such as the minimum average correlation energy filter [Appl. Opt. 263633 (1987)] and its variants perform by using face images captured under different illumination conditions and encoded with different bit rates under the JPEG2000 wavelet-encoding standard. We evaluate the performance of these filters by using illumination variations from the Carnegie Mellon University's Pose Illumination and Expression (PIE) face database. We also demonstrate the tolerance of these filters to noisy versions of images with illumination variations. (C) 2005 Optical Society of America.;2005
Field education programs have been conducted throughout the world because learning through experience is an important process in environmental and forest education. We developed a support system for forest education that consists mainly of a Global Positioning System (GPS) and personal digital assistant (PDA). Moreover field experiments were conducted to evaluate educational efficacy as well as usability of the developed system. Through a post-questionnaire the developed system was highly evaluated in terms of educational efficacy and enjoyment. On the other hand the questionnaire revealed the need for technical improvements. For example the drawing function which involves the use of a stylus pen was the most poorly evaluated because a drawing could not be partially erased as with an eraser and representation was not sufficiently accurate. In addition positions where information on nature appeared were sometimes inaccurate due to positional errors caused by using the autonomous GPS. Some participants answered that walking with the developed system was also troublesome due to its shape and size. In tact they did not feel comfortable about the cables connecting the GPS to the PDA and GPS to its antenna. Although there were some problems with the system we believe that the field education program was successful because 95% of the participants answered that they would join a similar program again.;2005
For years people have sought more natural means of communicating with their computers. Many have suggested that interaction with a computer should be as easy as interacting with other people taking advantage of the multimodal nature of human communication. While users should in theory gravitate to such anthropomorphic embodiments quite the contrary has been experienced users generally have been dissatisfied and abandoned their use. This suggests a disconnect between factors that make human-human communication engaging and those used by designers to support human-agent interaction. This paper discusses a set of empirical studies that attempted to replicate human-human non-verbal behaviour. The focus revolved around behaviours that portray a credible facade thereby helping embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to form a successful cooperative dyad with users. Based on a review of the non-verbal literature a framework was created that identified trustworthy and credible non-verbal behaviours across five areas and formed design guidelines for character interaction. The design suggestions for those areas emanating from the facial region were experimentally supported but there was no concordant increase in perceived trust when bodily regions (posture gesture) were added. In addition in examining the importance of demographic elements in embodiment it was found that users prefer to interact with characters that match their ethnicity and are young looking. There was no significant preference for gender. The implications of these results as well as other interesting consequences are discussed.;2005
Handheld computers are widely used in clinical practice and their use in both human medical education and veterinary medical education is increasing especially for the former in activities involving point-of-care access. This article references the insights that can be obtained from the usage and activities that are gaining a strong foothold in human medical education. Handheld computer technology gives students access to a large and changing knowledge base for clinical practice especially when they are geographically dispersed. Differences in use between education and practice largely relate to the importance clinicians place on patient information. Student use focuses on progress mapping and ready access to clinical reference material. Suggestions are made for future use in medical education.;2005
Humans tend to attribute human qualities to computers. It is expected that people when using their natural communicational skills can perform cognitive tasks with computers in a more enjoyable and effective way. For these reasons human-like embodied conversational agents (ECAs) as component if user interfaces have received a lot of attention. It has been shown that the style of the agent's look and behaviour strongly influences the user's attitude. In this paper we discuss our GESTYLE language making it possible to endow ECAs with style. Style is defined in terms of when and how the ECA uses certain gestures and how it modulates its speech (e.g. to indicate emphasis or sadness). There are also GESTYLE tags to annotate text which has to be uttered by an ECA to prescribe the usage of hand head and facial gestures accompanying the speech in order to augment the communication. The annotation ranges from direct low level (e.g. perform a specific gesture) to indirect high level (e.g. take turn in a conversation) instructions which will be interpreted with respect to the style defined. Using style dictionaries and defining different aspects like age and culture of an ECA it is possible to tune behaviour of an ECA to suit a given user or target group the best. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2002 Zhu et al. proposed a password authenticated key exchange protocol based on RSA such that it is efficient enough to be implemented on most of the target low-power devices such as smart cards and low-power Personal Digital Assistants in imbalanced wireless networks. Recently YEH et al. claimed that Zhu et al.'s protocol not only is insecure against undetectable on-line password guessing attack but also does not achieve explicit key authentication. Thus they presented an improved version. Unfortunately we find that YEH et al.'s password guessing attack does not come into existence and that their improved protocol is vulnerable to off-line dictionary attacks. In this paper we describe our observation in details and also comment for the original protocol on how to achieve explicit key authentication as well as resist against other existent attacks.;2005
In comparison with the conventional foaming process microcellular foaming by injection molding has the advantage of forming small bubbles of consistent size. Because of the reduction in the cycle time the removal of sink marks scale reliability and weight lightening microcellular foaming by injection molding is widely applied to electrical products such as automotive parts office automation equipment and laptops. When microcellular foaming by injection molding is used with a resin such as polycarbonate acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or PC/ABS micro-bubbles form. This enables the manufacture of cell phones notebooks and personal digital assistants (PDAs) which are impossible to produce with the conventional foaming technique because these products require a thin wall. For most thin-wall products spray and labeling processes are added. Therefore research into the spray and labeling characteristics of injected foamed parts should come before applications. In this article we analyze the swelling phenomenon that results from labeling on microcellular foamed parts. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2005
In human-computer interaction people often interpret the interaction with the computer as interactions with humans. The social agency theory suggests that social cues like the face and voice of the agent motivate this interpretation. In two off-line experiments in which comprehension scores and liking ratings were collected we found that participants preferred natural agents with natural voices as predicted by the social-cue hypothesis. Although female agents with male voices formed an exception this was explained by a stereotype effect. These findings support the social-cue hypothesis and the social agency theory that human characteristics are applied in the perception of computational animated conversational agents.

In the last few years schools and universities have incorporated personal digital assistants (PDAs) into their teaching curricula in an attempt to enhance students' learning experience and reduce instructors' workload. One of the most common uses of PDAs in the classroom is as a test administrator. This study compared the usability effectiveness efficiency and satisfaction of a PDA-based quiz application to that of standard paper-and-pencil quizzes in a university course. Effectiveness was measured as students' quiz scores and through a mental workload questionnaire efficiency was the time it took students to complete each quiz and satisfaction was evaluated using a subjective user satisfaction questionnaire. The study showed the PDA-based quiz to be more efficient that is students completed it in less time than they needed to complete the paper-and-pencil quiz. No differences in effectiveness and satisfaction were found between the two quiz types. Computer anxiety was not affected by the quiz type. For these reasons as well as other advantages to both students (e.g. real-time scoring) and teachers (e.g. less time spent on grading) PDAs are an attractive test administration option for schools and universities.

In this letter Bayes-based confidence measure (BBCM) in speech recognition is proposed. BBCM is applicable to any standard word feature and makes use of information about the speech recognition engine performance. In contrast to ordinary confidence measures BBCM is a probability which is interesting itself from the practical and theoretical point of view. If applied with word density confidence measure (WDCM) BBCM dramatically improves the discrimination ability of the false acceptance curve when compared to WDCM itself.;2005
In this paper we discuss methods for creating avatars that use knowledge cards which are used in the EgoChat system. These avatars are agents acting in place of their creators capable of holding conversations with other users. In the method we propose the avatar's conversational content is structured in the form of what we call knowledge cards which are semantically tagged text fragments by handling both avatar statements and user statements as knowledge cards that can be handled in the same way the person behind an avatar can easily predict the content of a conversation conducted between another user and the agent also simplifying the task of producing content for conversational production. This is because a conversation in the form of knowledge cards is essentially a matter of combining existing text fragments. In order for a conversational agent to be used in real life it would need to be continuously updated in its conversational content in response to the reactions of other users changing circumstances and so on. The system we propose maintains a log of conversations the avatar holds with users assisting in the task of updating the conversational contents. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2005
In this paper we investigate the usability of speech-centric multimodal interaction by comparing two systems that support the same unfamiliar task viz. bathroom design. One version implements a conversational agent (CA) metaphor while the alternative one is based on direct manipulation (DM). Twenty subjects 10 males and 10 females none of whom had recent experience with bathroom (re-)design completed the same task with both systems. After each task we collected objective measures (task completion time task completion rate number of actions performed speech and pen recognition errors) and subjective measures in the form of Likert Scale ratings. We found that the task completion rate for the CA system is higher than for the DM system. Nevertheless subjects did not agree on their preference for one of the systems: those subjects who were able to use the DM system effectively preferred that system mainly because it was faster for them and they felt more in control. We conclude that for multimodal CA systems to become widely accepted substantial improvements in system architecture and in the performance of almost all individual modules are needed.

In this paper a systematic framework for Internet-based interaction of humans robots and environments is proposed by using agent technology. The framework is validated by proposing the concept of slave agents- a virtual directory facilitator (VDF) to control the slave agents and a responsive multiagent environment. It creates a robot control system in which humans robots and environments can interact withoutmuch prior knowledge. Finally a number of experiments have been conducted successfully by adopting JadeLeap middleware and Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) standard under the environment composed of a personal digital assistant (PDA) a home service robot-intelligent sweeping security assistant companion (ISSAC) and a video camera network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework increases the availability of whole system decreases the time for Internet connection of robots and user devices such as PDAs and provides the responsiveness of environments.;2005
In this paper the authors propose a technique for generating creative conversations between users and multiple agents to support knowledge creation in a community. First they describe self-expressing alter-ego agents as user proxies. An alter-ego agent accumulates statements that were originated by the user in past conversations as self-expressions and converses with other alter-ego agents by outputting these again in a manner adapted to the circumstances. Next the authors describe the EgoChat system which is an environment for conversations between alterego agents and users and a framework for supporting knowledge creation by using EgoChat. Finally they examine and discuss methods of evaluating this technique based on conversation examples using EgoChat. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2005
In this paper the speech understanding problem in the context of a spoken dialogue system is formalized in a maximum likelihood framework. Off-line adaptation of stochastic language models that interpolate dialogue state specific and general application-level language models is proposed. Word and dialogue-state n-grams are used for building categorical understanding and dialogue models respectively. Acoustic confidence scores are incorporated in the understanding formulation. Problems due to data sparseness and out-of-vocabulary words are discussed. The performance of the speech recognition and understanding language models are evaluated with the Carmen Sandiego multimodal computer game corpus. Incorporating dialogue models reduces relative understanding error rate by 15%-25% while acoustic confidence scores achieve a further 10% error reduction for this computer gaming application.;2005
In this paper we present a game of dice that combines multi-party communication with a tangible interface. The game has been used as a testbed to study typical conversational behavior patterns in interactions between human users and synthetic agents. In particular we were interested in the question to what extent the interaction with the agent can be considered as natural. As an evaluation criterion we propose to investigate whether the communicative behaviors of humans differ when conversing with an agent as opposed to conversing with other humans.;2005
In virtue of great progress in computer graphics technologies CG movies have been getting popular. However cinematography techniques which contribute to improving the contents' comprehensibility need to be learned from professional experiences and not easily acquired by non-professional people. This paper focuses on film cutting as one of the most important cinematography techniques in conversational scenes and presents a system that automatically generates shot transitions to improve comprehensibility of CG contents. First we propose a cognitive model of User Involvement serving as constraints on selecting shot transitions. Then to examine the validity of the model we analyze shot transitions in TV programs and based on the analysis we implement a CG contents creation system. Results of our preliminary evaluation experiment show the effectiveness of the proposed method specifically in enhancing contents' comprehensibility.;2005
Integrating and embedding passive components like resistors capacitors and inductors into a single system module is an attractive way of achieving downsizing cost reduction and higher performance in RF wireless communication products such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants (PDA). The aerosol deposition (AD) method can be used to produce modules with passive components by incorporating different materials with appropriate electrical properties. Our tentative goal is to use the AD method to develop a compact microwave filter that can be incorporated into a single RF module for frequencies of more than 10 GHz with low loss. Since bulk Ba(Zn1/3Ta2/3)O-3 has a high Q value at high frequencies it is a promising candidate for use as a filter dielectric. In this paper we present the results of our experiments and offer discussions regarding the microstructure internal stress and dielectric properties of Ba(Zn1/3Ta2/3)O-3 AD films deposited under a range of conditions.

Introduction: In recent years there has been an increasing need for a reliable and practical tool for assessing fatigue-related impairment in the field. This study investigated the sensitivity of one potential tool a 5-min version of the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) specifically designed for use on personal digital assistants (PDA) to 28 h of sustained wakefulness. Methods: There were 15 participants who slept in the laboratory overnight then remained awake from 08:00 (Day 1) to 12:00 (Day 2). During every second hour they completed a 10-min PVT a sustained attention task that is sensitive to the effects of sleep loss and fatigue and a 5-min PDA-PVT. Results. While performance on both tasks significantly varied as a function of hours of wakefulness responses on the PDA-PVT were typically slower than on the PVT. When performance scores were standardized the negative impact of increasing hours of wakefulness on performance on the 5-min PDA-PVT and 10-min PVT did not significantly differ. Discussion: The findings suggest that the 5-min PDA-PVT may provide a reasonable substitute for the 10-min PVT particularly in circumstances where a shorter testis required and/or the standard PVT is not as practical.;2005
Mobile handheld devices are becoming evermore affordable and commonplace in society. When they are involved in a security incident or crime forensic specialists require tools that allow proper extraction and speedy examination of any digital evidence present. This paper gives an overview of forensic software tools for Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). A set of generic scenarios was devised to simulate evidentiary situations and applied to a set of target devices to gauge how selected tools react under various situations. The paper summarizes those results giving a snapshot of the capabilities and limitations of present day tools and also provides background information on PDA hardware and software.

Obesity is often cited as the most prevalent chronic health condition and highest priority public health problem in the United States. There is a limited but growing body of evidence suggesting that mobile eHealth behavioral interventions if properly designed may be effective in promoting and sustaining successful weight loss and weight maintenance behavior changes. This paper reviews the current literature on the successes and failures of public health provider-administered and self-managed behavioral health interventions for weight loss. The prevailing theories of health behavior change are discussed from the perspective of how this knowledge can serve as an evidence base to inform the design of mobile eHealth weight loss interventions. Tailored informational interventions which in recent years have proven to be the most effective form of conventional health behavior intervention for weight loss are discussed. Lessons learned from the success of convenfional tailored informational interventions and the early successes of desktop computer-assisted self-help weight management interventions are presented as are design principles suggested by Social Cognitive Theory and the Social Marketing Model. Relevant computing and communications technology convergence trends are also discussed. The recent trends in rapid advancement convergence and public adoption of Web-enabled cellular telephone and wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) devices provide timely opportunities to deliver the mass customization capabilities reach and interactivity required for the development administration and adoption of effective population-level eHealth tailored informational interventions for obesity.;2005
OBJECTIVE. This article describes the use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) as a projection device for PowerPoint presentations. CONCLUSION. Advances in hardware and software have made PDA devices capable of storing accessing retrieving and sharing data and their use is becoming increasingly evident in the health care arena. In this article I describe a use for the PDA that will further increase its value and efficiency in daily academic and teaching activities.;2005
OBJECTIVE: Assessment of fetal growth used in clinical decision making for managing pregnancies is based on percentiles relative to normal values for gestational age. Most clinicians utilize visual interpolation of look-tip tables or graphs which is neither accurate nor convenient. Calculation of growth percentile by numerical integration formulas requires digital computers with advanced computational capabilities and/or the storage of large data tables. STUDY DESIGN: Using established ultrasound measurement formulas and published fetal weight/gestational age tables mean weights and standard deviations for gestational ages from 10 to 44 weeks were determined. Front this Z-scores were calculated for the gestational ages. Z-scores plotted against 1st through 50th percentiles resulted in a curve. A polynomial equation was derived to fit the curve resulting in an expression for converting the Z-score to percentile: Percentile = 0.0994 * Z score(2) - 0.44 * Z score + 0.5026. RESULTS: Comparing calculated values from this equation against standard percentiles front a Z-score to percentile table all calculated values varied front the table value by <1 percentile for Z-scores ranging from 0 to 2.33. Values >2.33 are assigned to the 99th percentile. The equation performed to the goal of calculating percentile to an accuracy of percentile. CONCLUSION: A method whereby the estimated fetal weight can be used to calculate a percentile using two simple equations and only standard math functions allows implementation on a standard personal digital assistant device commonly available for clinical use. This implementation gives the needed accuracy ease of interpretation and portability making it a useful tool in clinical practice.;2005
OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on the handheld electronic resources for evidence-based practice (EBP) in the community setting. DATA SOURCES: Electronic resources for EBP in the community setting were identified by compiling the commonly used well-established resources and by searching MEDLINE and other Internet sites. Search terms included evidence-based medicine evidence-based practice resources and abstraction. Only sources available for personal digital assistants were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Three databases were identified that provided abstraction and evaluation of the medical literature for the handheld platform. Content features ease of use system requirements and costs of each resource were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: FIRSTConsult InfoRetriever and UpToDate were evaluated and the utility of each in the community pharmacy setting was evaluated by tracking a clinically relevant example through each system. FIRSTConsult provides evidence-based information organized by diagnosis but is not searchable on the handheld platform. InfoRetriever focuses on searchable evidence-based summaries while UpToDate includes comprehensive topic reviews. The latter 2 platforms have large system memory requirements. All 3 sources provide evidence-based abstraction of the medical literature for the PDA platform convenient for use at the point of care in community pharmacy. CONCLUSIONS: While users may select a particular resource based on unique features each provides evidence-based abstraction of the medical literature that is a practical approach to EBP in the community pharmacy setting.;2005
OBJECTIVE: To review the common general drug information applications and specialty drug information applications available for personal digital assistants (PDAs). DATA SOURCES: The literature was accessed through MEDLINE (2003-June 2004). Other information was obtained through secondary sources such as Web sites describing common PDA applications as well as actual product trials. The key search terms used were handheld PDA personal digital assistants drug information pharmacokinetics medical information and medical applications. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles or studies that provided a review of drug information references for the PDA since 2002 were included. Data pertaining to cost and application size were obtained from product or vendor Web sites. DATA SYNTHESIS: There are numerous medical applications available for the PDA including general drug information references specialty drug information references (eg pediatrics cardiology infectious diseases oncology psychology herbals) diagnostic applications medical calculators nursing references and patient tracking databases. Due to the huge array of programs as well as factors such as cost and memory requirements the healthcare provider must be selective in the medical applications that are placed on the PDA. CONCLUSIONS: There are many excellent PDA drug information applications that provide fast and accurate drug information and other features that assist the healthcare provider.;2005
Objective: Study objectives were to assess the accuracy of a food record delivered on a personal digital assistant (PDA) and to examine sources of error from the PDA-based food record. Methods: Thirty-nine adults recruited with a newspaper advertisement were trained to record food intake using DietMatePro a dietary assessment program delivered on a PDA. After 3 d of use subjects returned for a follow-up visit in which a 24-h recall was conducted. Subjects also were timed while recording an observed weighed lunch. Recalled and actual food intakes were compared with estimates recorded by the subjects when using the PDA. Paired sample t tests and Pearson's correlations assessed means and measurements of association between DietmatePro data compared with the 24-h recall data and observed meal data. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess bias in food recording. Sources of error were quantified by using calories as the unit for comparison. Results: There were no significant differences in daily totals for calories and macronutrients between DietMatePro data and comparison measurements. Pearson's correlations of associations between DietMatePro data and the comparison measurement ranged from 0.505 to 0.797 (P &LT 0.005 n = 28) for the 24-h recall and from 0.419 to 0.786 (P &LT 0.005 n = 33) for the observed lunch depending on the nutrient measured. The largest source of absolute error in caloric estimation was attributable to portion size estimation error (49%). Conclusions: DietMatePro a PDA-based dietary. assessment program provides a method of assessing energy and macronutrient intakes comparable to the 24-h recall in samples lacking dietary restrictions. &COPY 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to pilot test an intervention to enhance the adherence of study participants to the hemodialysis dietary regimen. Design: A single case study design was used to examine the potential effectiveness of the intervention over a 4-month period of time. Setting: A dialysis center in southwestern Pennsylvania. Patients: Of the five individuals entered into the study one was male and four were female four were black and one was white. Participants were 63 to 70 years of age and had been receiving dialysis for a median of 36 months (range 18 to 84 months). Intervention: The intervention included counseling to enhance self-efficacy by a renal dietitian paired with personal digital assistant-based dietary self-monitoring. Participants met twice per week with interventionists during the first 6 weeks weekly during the second 6-week period and biweekly in the final 4-week period. Main outcome measures: Monthly laboratory data regarding serum albumin potassium and phosphorus levels Kt/V and data on average monthly interdialytic weight gain were abstracted from the participants' medical records. C-reactive protein level was determined at baseline and at 4 months. Results: Four of five study participants had an increase in serum albumin level from baseline to their final measurement and one participant maintained a stable albumin level. Four of five participants also experienced a small increase in serum phosphorus level. Mixed results were obtained with regard to serum potassium and average monthly interdialytic weight gain. Conclusions: Because of the small sample and single case study design caution must be used in drawing firm conclusions from this study. Data suggest that the intervention may result in improved dietary intake and improved serum albumin levels. With increased dietary intake serum phosphorus levels may increase. Additional research is needed to determine the potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this intervention for improving dietary adherence. (c) 2005 by the National Kidney Foundation Inc.;2005
Objectives: This research was conducted to provide new insights on clinical nurses' and nursing students' current use of health resources and libraries and deterrents to their retrieval of electronic clinical information exploring implications from these findings for health sciences librarians. Methods: Questionnaires interviews and observations were used to collect data from twenty-five nursing students and twenty-five clinical nurses. Results: Nursing students and clinical nurses were most likely to rely on colleagues and books for medical information while other resources they frequently cited included personal digital assistants electronic journals and books and drug representatives. Significantly more nursing students than clinical nurses used online databases including CINAHL and PubMed to locate health information and nursing students were more likely than clinical nurses to report performing a database search at least one to five times a week. Conclusions and Recommendations: Nursing students made more use of all available resources and were better trained than clinical nurses but both groups lacked database-searching skills. Participants were eager for more patient care information more database training and better computer skills therefore health sciences librarians have the opportunity to meet the nurses' information needs and improve nurses' clinical information-seeking behavior.;2005
Objectives: This study compared the potential for personal digital assistant (PDA)-based drug information sources to minimize potential medication errors dependent on accurate and complete drug information at the point of care. Methods: A quality and safety framework for drug information resources was developed to evaluate 11 PDA-based drug information sources. Three drug information sources met the criteria of the framework: Eprocrates Rx Pro Lexi-Drugs and mobileMICROMEDEX. Medication error types related to drug information at the point of care were then determined. Forty-seven questions were developed to test the potential of the sources to prevent these error types. Pharmacists and physician experts from Creighton University created these questions based on the most common types of questions asked by primary care providers. Three physicians evaluated the drug information sources rating the source for each question: 1 = no information available 2 some information available or 3 = adequate amount of information available. Results: The mean ratings for the drug information sources were: 2.0 (Eprocrates Rx Pro) 2.5 (Lexi-Drugs) and 2.03 (mobileMICROMEDEX). Lexi-Drugs was significantly better (mobileMICROMEDEX t test P 0.05 Eprocrates Rx Pro t test P = 0.01). Conclusion: Lexi-Drugs was found to be the most specific and complete PDA resource available to optimize medication safety by reducing potential errors associated with drug information. No resource was sufficient to address the patient safety information needs for all cases.;2005
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) have become a constant companion to most professional people. The increase in processing power and wireless connectivity have made these devices useful tools for data collection quick reference and diary-keeping. In this article we discuss the specific features and benefits for orthopaedic surgeons and trainees with a view to future developments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2005
Purpose To identify specific learning activities (and teaching methods) that students associate with high-quality teaching in the inpatient setting. Method For ten months in 2003-04 170 third-year medical students recorded data on learning/feedback activities and teaching quality via personal digital assistants during the inpatient portion of a required two-month medicine clerkship at four sites affiliated with the Medical College of Wisconsin. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the association between learning/feedback activities and students' perceptions of high-quality teaching. Results A total of 2671 teaching encounters were rated by 170 students during their required inpatient medicine rotations. Bedside teaching was reported in almost two-thirds of teaching/learning encounters. Feedback on case presentation and differential diagnosis were the inpatient feedback activities most often provided by faculty. The univariate analysis revealed that students' perceptions of high-quality teaching was associated with receiving mini-lectures developing short presentations on relevant inpatient topics bedside teaching case-based conferences learning electrocardiogram and chest X-ray interpretation teaching with other team members present (p < .001) and receiving feedback on history and physical examination on case presentation at the bedside on differential diagnosis and on daily progress notes. Results from the regression analysis revealed that giving mini-lectures on inpatient topics teaching electrocardiogram and chest X-ray interpretation providing feedback on case presentation and at the bedside were predictors of overall high-quality teaching. Conclusions Aspects of feedback giving mini-lectures and learning test-interpretation skills were the learning and feedback activities associated with students' perceptions of high-quality teaching. In an increasingly time-pressured inpatient environment clinical educators should understand which activities students value.;2005
Purpose. A scalable multiuser personal digital assistant (PDA)-based documentation tool for pharmacist collection of data on drug-related problems (DRPs) is described. Summary. A PDA-based tool for documenting DRPs and pharmacist interventions was developed with database software. Data fields were based on the pharmaceutical care model. PDA synchronization stations were configured to transmit encrypted data from three hospital sites to a central server. Pharmacists in a multisite health care organization were trained to use the documentation tool. Data were analyzed with commercially available software. Users' opinions about the tool were solicited in a survey. Twenty-eight PDAs containing a 15-field database were issued to 39 pharmacists in 31 service areas. Data were successfully transmitted from all hospital sites over the existing corporate local area network. During a two-month period 5084 DRPs were documented 90% of them were resolved at the time of data entry. The most frequent types of DRPs were the need to add a drug (31%) and the ordering of an unnecessary drug (15%). Most pharmacists reported that the tool was easy to use was well integrated with the workflow and required less than 30 minutes per day for documenting DRPs. Conclusion. A PDA-based documentation tool was successfully used in a multisite health care organization to collect data on DRPs and document pharmacist interventions.;2005
Purpose. The utility and limitations of the number needed to treat (NNT) are described and compared with those of alternative descriptors of therapeutic yield. Summary. Pharmacists physicians and patients are more likely to launch interventions based on relative measures of therapeutic yield. The NNT is a simple way to express the absolute therapeutic yield of an intervention. It is essential to take baseline risk and length of follow-up into account when calculating and interpreting absolute or relative measures of therapeutic yield. Patients may have difficulty understanding what the NNT tells them about the benefits and harms associated with an intervention and confidence intervals for the NNT can be difficult to interpret. Relative measures of benefits are advantageous for comparing benefits across populations with different risks. The use of absolute measures to describe therapeutic options leads to more conservative decision-making and is potentially more useful. Among the absolute measures the absolute risk reduction may be easier to understand than the NNT. These measures are most helpful when the best options are not clear or when patient input is needed. Personal digital assistants and Web-based tools can assist with calculations. Conclusion. The NNT is a useful measure but is influenced by numerous variables and may not be easily understood by patients.;2005
Purpose: The aim of this study was to demonstrate that many older adults can share in the potential benefits of using a personal digital assistant (PDA) including using the device as a memory aid for addresses and appointments to improve medication adherence and as a useful organizational tool and communication device. Design and Methods: A curriculum designed specifically for older adults was developed that provided the necessary information and practice to use the technology. The degree to which the curriculum improved user skills was measured by testing participants on basic and advanced features of each of the standard PDA programs. Results: Participants were successful in using the technology and indicated satisfaction with the medication-reminder program specifically designed to accommodate the needs of older adults. Implications: The PDA supported with well-designed software and well-executed training can provide unique benefits to older adults.;2005
Purpose: This study examined how frequently attending physicians and physicians in training used personal digital assistants (PDAs) for patient care and explored physicians' perceptions of the impact of PDA use on several areas of clinical decision making. Setting/Subjects: The 108 participants included 59 attending physicians and 49 physicians in training from teaching hospitals in Tennessee Florida Alabama Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Methodology: Respondents completed a questionnaire designed to explore PDA use in a clinical setting. Results: Eighty-seven percent of the respondents reported PDA use for patient encounters. Fifty-five percent of respondents reported frequent use and 32% reported occasional use of a PDA for patient care. Of the frequent PDA users 85% said PDA use had influenced their overall clinical decision making and 73% mentioned treatment alterations specifically. Approximately 60% of the participants reporting occasional PDA use indicated that the PDA had influenced their overall clinical decision making while 54% specifically mentioned a change to their patient's treatment plan. Discussion/Conclusion: Attending physicians and physicians in training who used a PDA during patient encounters perceived that even occasional PDA use had an impact on their clinical decision making and treatment choices. Health sciences librarians are perfectly positioned to provide PDA training and assistance not only to physicians who are frequent PDA users but also to those who are occasional users.;2005
Purpose: To review the different data collection options available to school-based researchers and to present the preliminary findings on the use of audio-enhanced personal digital assistants (APDA) for use in school-based data collection. Methods: A newly developed APDA system was used to collect baseline data from a sample of 645 seventh grade students enrolled in a school-based intervention study. Evaluative measures included student response time to completion and data quality (e.g. missingness internal consistency of responses). Differences in data administration and data quality were examined among three groups of students: students newer to the United States speaking English as a second language special education students and students not newer to the United States receiving regular education. Results: The APDA system was well received by students and was shown to offer improvements in data administration (increased portability time to completion) and reduced missing data. Although time to completion and proportion of missing data were similar across the three groups of students psychometric properties of the data varied considerably. Conclusions: The APDA system offers a promising new method for collecting data in the middle school environment. Students with cognitive deficits and language barriers were able to complete the survey in a similar amount of time without additional help however differences in data quality suggest that limitations in comprehension of the questions remained even though the questions were read to the respondents. More research on the use of APDA is necessary to fully understand the effect of data collection mode with special populations. (c) 2005 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.;2005
Real-time 3D Graphics rendering consumes significant power because of its very high computation and memory access rate. Due to variation in workload and perceptual tolerance power-awareness can optimize this power consumption significantly thus facilitating migration to future power-constrained devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) tablets wearables phones etc. This work proposes such a low power system based on Approximate Graphics Rendering (AGR). The AGR system supports various algorithms and incremental changes to the computational mechanism based on certain pre-specified parameters. The knowledge available apriori about the signal and noise models of graphic images and Human Visual Perception (HVP) are used to select the configuration that meets the quality needs at the lowest power consumption. The power savings using the AGR system are examined for two power hungry stages of the 3D graphics rendering system namely shading and texture mapping. Besides supporting various algorithms two novel parameterizable computation schemes are proposed. First iterative COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm based units are incorporated for certain computations. Second a scheme for dynamically enhancing the perceived image spatial correlation for reduced computations is presented. A hardware synthesis and estimation methodology based on realistic graphics content from the well-known 3D graphics benchmarks and the game Quake2 [1] is used for estimation of power savings. Significant power savings of 75.1% 73.8% and 72% are demonstrated in the shading texture mapping function blocks and CORDIC based 3D vector interpolator respectively.;2005
Recent advances in automatic speech recognition and related technologies allow computers to carry on conversations by telephone. We developed an intelligent dialogue system that interacts with hypertensive patients to collect data about their health status. Patients thus avoid the inconvenience of traveling for frequent face to face visits to monitor the clinical variables they can easily measure at home the physician is facilitated in acquiring patient information and cardiovascular risk which is evaluated from the data according to noted guidelines. Controlled trials to assess the clinical efficacy are under way. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2005
Relative changes in specific absorption rates owing to perturbing metallic spectacles in proximity to the face are investigated. A representative electrical property biological matter model with twenty five distinct tissue types based on images of an adult male is used with the FDTD method. Both plane wave and dipole source stimuli are investigated and are used to represent a mobile cellular-enabled personal digital assistant held in front of the face. Results show that metallic spectacles may alter significantly specific absorption rate (SAR) level distributions within the head. The frequency range investigated is 1.5-3.0GHz. Specific attention is given to energy interactions with the eyes. Results are given for several common spectacle frame shapes in addition to whole head energy absorption comparisons. Whole head and single mirrored half head sensitivity data are also presented. A Pareto ranked genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search for the spectacles that cause the highest and lowest SAR in the eye.;2005
Results of a field study of an open-access collaborative virtual environment in actual use suggested that awareness of others significantly increases the level of presence experienced by participants. Given the importance of copresence this paper argues that in the absence of other human collaborators in a collaborative virtual environment copresence can potentially be simulated using agent technology. A controlled experiment deploying a prototype embodied conversational agent was conducted to investigate the potential of such agents to simulate copresence. This paper briefly introduces the concepts of presence and copresence summarizes experiences drawn from the field study reports on the controlled experiment and discusses its results. Results suggest that even limited copresence as provided by the current prototype agent is sufficient to help users feel presence in the environment.;2005
Signature files and inverted files are well-known index structures. In this paper we undertake a direct comparison of the two for searching for partially-specified queries in a large lexicon stored in main memory. Using n-grams to index lexicon terms a bit-sliced signature file can be compressed to a smaller size than an inverted file if each n-gram sets only 14 one bit in the term signature. With a signature width less than half the number of unique n-grams in the lexicon the signature file method is about as fast as the inverted file method and significantly smaller. Greater flexibility in memory usage and faster index generation time make signature files appropriate for searching large lexicons or other collections in an environment where memory is at a premium.

It then compares several economic aspects of these businesses including their industry evolution pricing structures and degrees of integration.;2005
The ability to build and control exposure through a seamless synergy of interaction and narration is a strongly required feature of a new type of immersive-VR training and therapy system. This paper presents a practical approach for immersive-VIR training and therapy applications based on interactive storytelling. It provides detailed description of a working implementation of the Interactive Narration Space (INS) this approach combines and satisfies both interaction and narration requirements through the use of high-level social interaction. By introducing the Social Channel we aim at minimizing the contradictions between control over the story required by the trainer/therapist and interaction required by the trainee/patient. These concepts and their practical realization have been investigated in the context of emergency-situation training and psychotherapeutic exposure and could validate the usability of mediated interaction with a virtual assistant.;2005
The aim of this study is to determine if network-enabled personal digital assistants (PDAs) can be used to facilitate the timely delivery of urgent radiological exam results by reducing the interval from when the radiologist's initial interpretation is available to when it is first viewed by an emergency department (ED) physician. A web- and Java message service (JMS)-based application was built to replace the original fax-based wet-read procedure. The new system allows radiologists to enter wet-reads from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) display station and to track discrepancies between the wet-read and final report. It also notifies the ED physicians when exam results are available via the PDAs and permits them to view the full text of the wet-read and final reports from the devices. The new system is compared to the original procedure with the results showing improvements with the wireless method. Furthermore feedback from a qualitative survey of PDA users was positive suggesting that PDAs may provide one means for accessing urgent clinical data at the point of care.;2005
The aim of this study was to empirically evaluate an embodied conversational agent called GRETA in an effort to answer two main questions: (1) What are the benefits (and costs) of presenting information via an animated agent with certain characteristics in a 'persuasion' task compared to other forms of display? (2) How important is it that emotional expressions are added in a way that is consistent with the content of the message in animated agents? To address these questions a positively framed healthy eating message was created which was variously presented via GRETA a matched human actor GRETA's voice only (no face) or as text only. Furthermore versions of GRETA were created which displayed additional emotional facial expressions in a way that was either consistent or inconsistent with the content of the message. Overall it was found that although GRETA received significantly higher ratings for helpfulness and likability presenting the message via GRETA led to the poorest memory performance among users. Importantly however when GRETA's additional emotional expressions were consistent with the content of the verbal message the negative effect on memory performance disappeared. Overall the findings point to the importance of achieving consistency in animated agents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2005
The grid has been developed to support large-scale computer simulations in a diverse range of scientific and engineering fields. Consequently the increasing availability of powerful distributed computing resources is changing how scientists undertake large-scale modelling/simulation. Instead of being limited to local computing resources scientists are now able to make use of supercomputing facilities around the world. These grid resources comprise specialized distributed three-dimensional visualization environments through to massive computational systems. The scientist usually accesses these resources from reasonably high-end desktop computers. Even though most modern desktop computers are provided with reasonably powerful three-dimensional graphical hardware not all scientific applications require high-end three-dimensional visualization because the data of interest is essentially numerical or two-dimensional graphical data. For these applications a much simpler two-dimensional graphical displays can be used. Since large jobs can take many hours to complete the scientist needs access to a technology that will allow them to still monitor and control their job while away from their desks. This paper describes an effective method of monitoring and controlling a set of chained computer simulations by means of a lightweight steering client based on a small personal digital assistant (PDA). The concept of using a PDA to steer a series of computational jobs across a supercomputing resource may seem strange at first but when scientists realize they can use these devices to connect to their computation wherever there is a wireless network (or cellular phone network) the concept becomes very compelling. Apart from providing a much needed easy-to-use interface the PDA-based steering client has the benefit of freeing the scientist from the desktop. It is during this monitoring stage that the hand-held PDA client is of particular value as it gives the application scientist greater freedom to leave his or her desk but still communicate with their simulation with the proviso that they remain within the range of a wireless network.;2005
The importance of automatically recognizing emotions from human speech has grown with the increasing role of spoken language interfaces in human-computer interaction applications. This paper explores the detection of domain-specific emotions using language and discourse information in conjunction with acoustic correlates of emotion in speech signals. The specific focus is on a case study of detecting negative and non-negative emotions using spoken language data obtained from a call center application. Most previous studies in emotion recognition have used only the acoustic information contained in speech. In this paper a combination of three sources of information-acoustic lexical and discourse-is used for emotion recognition. To capture emotion information at the language level an information-theoretic notion of emotional salience is introduced. Optimization of the acoustic correlates of emotion with respect to classification error was accomplished by investigating different feature sets obtained from feature selection followed by principal component analysis. Experimental results on our call center data show that the best results are obtained when acoustic and language information are combined. Results show that combining all the information rather than using only acoustic information improves emotion classification by 40.7% for males and 36.4% for females (linear discriminant classifier used for acoustic information).;2005
The increased use of the Web and the Mobile Internet as a platform for geospatial applications necessitates development of improved interoperability between computing systems and underscores the need to apply standardized network technologies in processes dealing with spatial data. The generalization approach applicable in network-based spatial data services may be based on different technologies compared with traditional cartographic generalization. Here the use of Extensible Markup Language (XML) techniques in data transformations with special emphasis on cartographic generalization is presented. The research presented in the paper is focused on the Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) process as a means to generalize XML-encoded spatial data in real time. The prototype system for real-time generalization developed at the Finnish Geodetic Insitute (FGI) applies Geography Markup Language (GML) as spatial data encoding and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images for map visualization. The data-access interface conforms with the Open GIS Consortium's (OGC) Web Feature Service specification. The implemented generalization operators include selection building simplification and aggregation and were processed during the request-response dialogue in the network. The generalization process was tested on topographic datasets and results visualized on the Web and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Although XML-based computing processes are generally understood to yield poor performance ratings the work shows that intelligent XSLT generalization processes can be introduced without degrading the performance of a mobile map service.;2005
The isolation performances of GSM/DCS and WLAN antennas embedded in a PDA phone for cellular/WLAN dual-network operations are studied. The two (GSM/DCS and WLAN) antennas are printed PIFAs with compact sizes and art mounted perpendicularly along the boundary of the system circuit board in order to per or as internal antennas for the PDA phone. It is found that the isolation between the two antennas is greatly dependent on their relative position inside the PDA phone. The measured and simulated results are presented and the isolation performances are analyzed. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2005
The management of channel relations has a significant impact on a firm's operational competitiveness however there is a lack of published research to better understand the linkages between channel relationships and channel power noncoercive influence strategies as well as channel climate and channel solidarity. This paper develops a model showing the linkages among these dimensions of channel relationships. Using linear structural relations (LISREL) a model of the Taiwanese personal digital assistant industry is developed to illustrate these interactions. The corresponding empirical test results indicate that channel climate has a significant impact on channel solidarity however this impact may be mitigated by both channel power and the use of noncoercive influence strategies. In addition both mutual trust among channel members and continuity of the relationship have a positive influence on channel solidarity. Channel members with relatively more power appear able to determine the degree of channel solidarity through the use of effective noncoercive influence strategies. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The new advances in sensor technology personal digital assistants (PDAs) and wireless communications favor the development of a new type of monitoring system that can provide patients with assistance anywhere and at any time. Of particular interest are the monitoring systems designed for people that suffer from heart arrhythmias due to the increasing number of people with cardiovascular diseases. PDAs can play a very important role in these kinds of systems because they are portable devices that can execute more and more complex tasks. The main questions answered in this paper are whether PDAs can perform a complete electrocardiogram beat and rhythm classifier if the classifier has a good accuracy and if they can do it in real time. In order to answer these questions in this paper we show the steps that we have followed to build the algorithm that classifies beats and rhythms and the obtained results which show a competitive accuracy. Moreover we also show the feasibility of incorporating the built algorithm into the PDA.;2005
The out-of-box experience (OOBE) has been identified as a significant factor contributing to user perception and acceptance of products and technologies. Whilst there has been considerable emphasis placed on formalising methodological procedures for evaluating the OOBE and on the creation of positive user experiences through appropriate interfaces and applications relatively little work has been undertaken examining how the OOBE is impacted when the experience itself covers a range of (possibly interconnected) devices. In this paper we report the results of an empirical study which examined the OOBE when a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and Head Mounted Device (HMD) were configured and then connected for inter-operability purposes. Our findings show that type of device has a considerable impact on the OOBE with the ask of interconnecting devices having a detrimental effect on the OOBE. The OOBE however is in main unaffected by user type and gender.;2005
The Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) while in use in the mainstream population is not generally utilized by individuals with disabilities. Using a multiple-baseline design across settings we tested effectiveness of using a PDA to increase the independence of an adolescent with Asperger Syndrome (AS). Results indicated use of the PDA was effective in decreasing the student's reliance on adults to complete tasks at home and at school.;2005
The present article describes a portable version of the go/no-go association task (GNAT) that runs on Palm Pilot and Handspring personal digital assistant (PDA) devices. The PDA version of the GNAT was modeled after a portable version of the Implicit Association Test (Dabbs Bassett & Dyomina 2003) and was designed to facilitate measurement of implicit social cognition in field settings and among difficult-to-reach populations. The PDA version of the GNAT was used to assess implicit attitudes about smoking among 11 smokers and 28 nonsmokers. Support for the validity of the PDA version of the GNAT was provided by findings that smokers showed less negative implicit attitudes toward smoking as measured by the GNAT than did nonsmokers and that these implicit attitudes were positively correlated with self-reported smoking attitudes among both groups.;2005
The use of boosting for call classification in spoken language understanding is described in this paper. An extension to the AdaBoost algorithm is presented that permits the incorporation of prior knowledge of the application as a means of compensating for the large dependence on training data. We give a convergence result for the algorithm and we describe experiments on four datasets showing that prior knowledge can substantially improve classification performance.;2005
There has been widespread adoption of personal digital assistants (PDAs) within medicine in recent years. However information on the prevalence and usage of these devices among radiologists is limited. A survey was designed and mailed to randomly selected members of the Radiological Society of North America to determine the percentage of PDA users their use patterns and the types of applications that they would like to see in the future. The use patterns of attending radiologists were compared with those of trainees ( residents and fellows). Overall usage was also compared with the relevant findings in two surveys of internal medicine users. It was found that slightly less than one-half of respondents used PDAs on a daily basis a finding that was comparable to that in the internal medicine surveys. However less than one-quarter of PDA users had radiology-specific applications installed on their devices whereas a greater percentage of internal medicine users had software such as drug databases and clinical references on their PDAs. Radiology trainees had a higher rate of both PDA ownership and radiology application usage than did attending radiologists. It is likely that as PDA hardware becomes more powerful with higher display resolution better wireless networking capabilities and greater memory capacity PDA ownership as well as radiology application usage will increase.

There is a strong relationship between evaluation and methods for automatically training language processing systems where generally the same resource and metrics are used both to train system components and to evaluate them. To date in dialogue systems research this general methodology is not typically applied to the dialogue manager and spoken language generator. However any metric for evaluating system performance can be used as a feedback function for automatically training the system. This approach is motivated with examples of the application of reinforcement learning to dialogue manager optimization and the use of boosting to train the spoken language generator.;2005
This article focuses on the service providers of the future: virtual assistants on the Internet. Recent technological developments supported by intensive research on artificial intelligence have enabled corporations to construct 'virtual employees' who can interact with their online customers. The number of virtual assistants on the Internet continues to grow and most of these new service providers are human-like and female. In this article I profile virtual employees on the Internet - who they are what they do and how they present themselves. I demonstrate that the Internet suffers from the same gender stereotyping characteristic of customer services in general and that the unreflective choice of female images is at the minimum a symbolic reinforcement of the real circumstances of gender divisions in customer service.;2005
This article outlines how a Palm- or Newton-based PDA (personal digital assistant) system for online event recording was used to record and analyze concurrent events. We describe the features of this PDA-based system called the FIT-System (flexible interface technique) and its application to the analysis of concurrent events in complex behavioral processes-in this case anesthesia work processes. The patented FIT-System has a unique user inter-face design allowing the user to design an interface template with a pencil and paper or using a transparency film. The template usually consists of a drawing or sketch that includes icons or symbols that depict the observer's representation of the situation to be observed. In this study the FIT-System allowed us to create a design for fast intuitive online recording of concurrent events using a set of 41 observation codes. An analysis of concurrent events leads to a description of action density and our results revealed a characteristic distribution of action density during the administration of anesthesia in the operating room. This distribution indicated the central role of the overlapping operations in the action sequences of medical professionals as they deal with the varying requirements of this complex task. We believe that the FIT-System for online recording of concurrent events in complex behavioral processes has the potential to be useful across a broad spectrum of research areas.;2005
This article provides an overview of the capabilities that we are developing as part of the Pebbles research project for wireless handheld devices such as mobile phones and palm-size computers like Palm Organizers and PocketPCs. Instead of just being used as a phone or organizer handheld devices can also be used as remote controls for computers and household and office appliances. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This article relates to the construction of a portable low cost thermal-regulating light-emitting diode (LED)-based handheld fluorometer. This regulated fluorometer is based on both a low thermal mass infrared heater and an orthogonal geometry LED-based filter fluorometer. Power is supplied through an external power supply and data is collected in real time through standard serial interfaces of personal computers or personal digital assistants. Thermal regulation is automatically maintained using temperature sensor feedback control. Optical excitation relies on LED light source(s) and optical detection is made through an adjustable integrating photodetector. With such a handheld system applications requiring temperature sensitive photometric measurements for real-time analyte detection can be more easily performed in the field.

This Chapter describes the process and outcomes of the evaluation of a user interface prototype running on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). The prototype was developed in the context of the IST-funded project WardInHand and implements a PDA version of a ward information system. The evaluation was based on a usage scenario comprising mock-ups and textual descriptions of the typical tasks of the system. Although the evaluation revealed a broad range of usability problems in this Chapter we consider only those which feature prominently in the vast majority of PDA-based applications such as adaptability individualisation user profiling alternative dialogue styles localisation etc. and propose design solutions of general purpose as a basis for improved design practice.;2005
This paper discusses the introduction of a wireless network of personal digital assistants into a specialist unit of a hospital in Edinburgh. All of the technology has been used 'off-the-shelf' and 'out-of-the-box'. While we are able to report that the heterogeneous elements of this implementation have been integrated work well together and that the users of the system are happy with it the hospital context itself introduced a number of significant practical issues. Hospitals are understandably very concerned about the security and confidentiality of patient records and with the potential for mutual interference between the wireless PDAs and other sensitive wireless telemetric medical systems. Having dealt with these ultimately tractable infrastructural issues we also note the importance of identifying the 'killer application' of the PDAs in achieving a critical mass of end users and indicate areas for further work.;2005
This paper explores the validity of a rule-based inference method of selected independent activities of daily living (ADLs). An inexpensive ADL monitoring system was installed in the community for 37 days to monitor a middle-aged healthy individual living alone. The subject was given a personal digital assistant (PDA) running custom activity diary software and asked to record activities in real-time. Rule-based activity inference algorithms were refined on data from 17 days and data from the remaining 20 days were used for validation. The chi-square statistic was computed for 2 x 2 contingency tables comparing activities detected by the algorithms to user-logged activities. The phi (r(phi)) and Cohen's kappa (kappa) coefficients were computed as measures of correlation. After correcting for subject noncompliance in logging activities the kappa correlation between the meal detection algorithm and the PDA record was 0.84 with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Similarly the kappa correlation between the shower detection algorithm and the PDA record is 0.69 with 67% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The detection algorithms and the sensory data did not miss any main meals or showering activities recorded on the PDA. The results suggest that rule-based algorithms can successfully detect meal preparation and showering activities using simple low-cost detectors. The sensors and detection algorithms reported events not recorded by the occupant on the PDA attributed to reporting noncompliance. Overall the PDA activity journal was a compromise between paper diaries which are more time consuming to keep and may result in higher noncompliance errors and video recording which is considered intrusive.;2005
This paper investigates prosodic aspects of turn-taking in conversation with a view to improving the efficiency of identifying relevant places at which a machine can legitimately begin to talk to a human interlocutor. It examines the relationship between interaction control the communicative function of which is to regulate the flow of information between interlocutors and its phonetic manifestation. Specifically the listener's perception of such interaction control phenomena is modelled. Algorithms for automatic online extraction of prosodic phenomena liable to be relevant for interaction control such as silent pauses and intonation patterns are presented and evaluated in experiments using Swedish map task data. We show that the automatically extracted prosodic features can be used to avoid many of the places where current dialogue systems run the risk of interrupting their users as well as to identify suitable places to take the turn.;2005
This paper is an attempt to design and to evaluate the platform-independent computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system which can expand the diversity of CAT-administering platforms. By using extensible markup language (XML) to describe the item bank one might find the implementation of CAT on a different platform such as a personal computer (PC) a personal digital assistant (PDA) and other handheld devices more convenient. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of a CAT administration platform on precision and efficiency. Fifty senior high school students were selected to take an English vocabulary CAT both on PC and PDA which enabled them to compare the relevant advantages with the disadvantages of the two different administration platforms firsthand. Both tests used the same-size well-calibrated item bank ability estimation algorithm and item selection strategy. The results indicate that the platforms on which examinees take CAT do not affect the performance of CAT. The responses of the questionnaire on the testing environment also show that most examinees prefer to take the test on PDA. It is concluded that using a PDA to administer CAT is both as precise and effective as a PC and more enjoyable and convenient.;2005
This paper overviews recent progress in the development of corpus-based spontaneous speech recognition technology. Although speech is in almost any situation spontaneous recognition of spontaneous speech is an area which has only recently emerged in the field of automatic speech recognition. Broadening the application of speech recognition depends crucially on raising recognition performance for spontaneous speech. For this purpose it is necessary to build large spontaneous speech corpora for constructing acoustic and language models. This paper focuses on various achievements of a Japanese 5-year national project Spontaneous Speech: Corpus and Processing Technology that has recently been completed. Because of various spontaneous-speech specific phenomena such as filled pauses repairs hesitations repetitions and disfluencies recognition of spontaneous speech requires various new techniques. These new techniques include flexible acoustic modeling sentence boundary detection pronunciation modeling acoustic as well as language model adaptation and automatic summarization. Particularly automatic summarization including indexing a process which extracts important and reliable parts of the automatic transcription is expected to play an important role in building various speech archives speech-based information retrieval systems and human-computer dialogue systems.;2005
This paper presents a new recognition confidence scoring method for unsupervised training of statistical language models in spoken language dialogue systems. Based on the proposed confidence scoring the speech recognition results for untranscribed user utterances are selected for training the statistical language models of speech recognizers. The method uses features that can only be obtained after the dialogue session in addition to other features such as the acoustic scores of recognition results. Experimental results show that the proposed confidence scoring improves correct/incorrect classification of recognition results and that using the language models obtained through our approach results in better recognition accuracy than that achieved by conventional methods.

This paper presents a technique for exploiting input statistics forenergy and performance optimization of embedded software. The proposed technique is based on the fact that the computational complexities of programs or subprograms are often highly dependent on the values assumed by input and intermediate program variables during execution. This observation is exploited in the proposed software synthesis technique by augmenting the program with optimized versions of one or more subprograms that are specialized to and executed under specific input subspaces. We propose a methodology for input space-adaptive software synthesis that consists of the following steps: 1) control and value profiling of the input program 2) application of compiler transformations in a preprocessing step 3) identification of subprograms and corresponding input subspaces that hold the highest potential for optimization and 4) an iterative application of known compiler transformations to realize performance and energy savings. We propose novel metrics based on the entropies of program variables to characterize subprograms and input subspaces that hold significant potential for optimization. The chosen subprograms are optimized by translating the input subspaces into value constraints on their variables and iteratively applying known compiler transformations (that were not applicable in the context of the original program). We have evaluated input space-adaptive software synthesis by compiling the resulting optimized programs to two commercial embedded systems: an embedded system based on the Fujitsu SPARClite processor and the Compaq iPAQ personal digital assistant (PDA) [64 MB memory 206 MHz Intel StrongARM central processing unit (CPU)]. The energy and execution-time savings were calculated using energy-aware instruction-level simulators as well as through direct-current measurement on the iPAQ. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique can reduce energy by up to 54.5% (average of 30.6% and 25.6% for the SPARClite-based system and the iPAQ respectively) while simultaneously improving performance by up to 59.6% (average of 31.3% and 31.5% for the SPARClite-based system and the iPAQ respectively). In effect improvements in the energy-delay product of up to 81.1% (average of 51.0% and 47.7% for the SPARClite-based system and the iPAQ respectively) were observed. The energy savings resulting from our technique are fairly processor independent and complementary to conventional compiler optimizations.;2005
This paper presents Tagged Sub-optimal code (TSC) a new coding technique to speed up string matching over compressed databases on personal digital assistants (PDA). TSC is a variable-length sub-optimal code that supports minimal prefix property. It always determines its codeword boundary without traversing a tree or lookup table. TSC technique may be beneficial in many types of applications: speeding up string matching over compressed text and speeding decoding process. This paper also presents two algorithms for string matching over compressed text using TSC (SCTT) and the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) technique (SCTB). Several experiments were conducted to compare the performance of TSC Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and Huffman code. Several PDA databases with different record sizes were used: the well-known Calgary dataset and a set of small-sized PDA databases. Experimental results show that SCTT is almost twice as fast as the Huffman-based algorithm. SCTT has also the same performance in search time as the search in uncompressed databases and is faster than the SCTB algorithm. For frequently updated PDA databases such as phone books to-do list and memos SCTT is the recommended method regardless of the size of the average record length since the time required to compress the updated records using BPE poses significant delays compared to TSC.;2005
This paper proposes two methods to incorporate semantic information into word and concept level confidence measurement. The first method uses tag and extension probabilities obtained from a statistical classer and parser. The second method uses a maximum entropy based semantic structured language model to assign probabilities to each word. Incorporation of semantic features into a lattice posterior probability based confidence measure provides significant improvements compared to posterior probability when used together in an air travel reservation task. At 5% False Alarm (FA) rate relative improvements of 28 % and 61 % in Correct Acceptance (CA) rate are achieved for word level and concept level confidence measurements respectively.;2005
This paper reports an exploration of the concept of social intelligence in the context of designing home dialogue systems for an Ambient Intelligence home. It describes a Wizard of Oz experiment involving a robotic interface capable of simulating several human social behaviours. Our results show that endowing a home dialogue system with some social intelligence will: (a) create a positive bias in the user's perception of technology in the home environment (b) enhance user acceptance for the home dialogue system and (c) trigger social behaviours by the user in relation to the home dialogue system.

This study investigated the effects of the type of menu (WinCE and Palm) and the stage of usage (whether the current usage is the first second third fourth fifth or eighth day of usage) on the users' performance in operating a menu displayed in the first second or third layers of a PDA display. The findings of this study indicated that the subjects performed significantly differently in response to Palm and WinCE menus displayed in the first and second layers. The Palm menu resulted in better operating performance. However the Palm and WinCE menus displayed in the third layer did not result in significantly different operating performance. In addition the amount of previous use significantly affected users' operating performance only with menus displayed in all the layers. The operating performance improved as the usage time increased. Regarding the subjects' subjective preferences using the Palm-menu design was initially favored more than the WinCE-menu however their preferences for using both menus increased with the usage time.

This study reports on personal digital assistants (PDAs) as a means to prepare nurse professionals who value and seek current information. An interdisciplinary team of nursing and library faculty information technology and bookstore staff students and educational consultants developed this project. A pre-post and comparative group design of second-degree students in the accelerated and traditional baccalaureate nursing degree (BSN) options was used to examine students' information-seeking behaviors and the effectiveness and cost of innovation strategies associated with incorporation of PDAs into students' clinical practice. Results of this study support PDAs as an effective student learning resource especially for reference materials. The student group with PDAs had increasing numbers of questions associated with clinical situations and a greater recognition of the need to use current resources. Students made substantial use of their PDAs and health team members while decreasing reliance on textbooks and clinical faculty. Students' use of and satisfaction with this technology is linked to access speed and readability. Providing faculty with PDAs is recommended to enhance their comfort with and incorporation of PDAs into clinical teaching.;2005
This work presents an approach to modeling speech acts and verifying spontaneous speech with disfluency in a spoken dialogue system. According to this approach semantic information syntactic structure and fragment class of an input utterance are statistically encapsulated in a proposed speech act hidden Markov model (SAHMM) to characterize the speech act. An interpolation mechanism is exploited to re-estimate the state transition probability in SAHMM to deal with the problem of disfluency in a sparse training corpus. Finally a Bayesian belief model (BBM) based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) is adopted to verify the potential speech acts and output the final speech act. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed approach using a spoken dialogue system for providing air travel information. A testing database from 25 speakers with 480 dialogues that include 3038 sentences was established and used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach identifies 95.3% of speech act at a rejection rate of 5% and the semantic accuracy is 4.2% better than that obtained using a keyword-based system. The proposed strategy also effectively alleviates the disfluency problem in spontaneous speech.;2005
Two internal antennas for GSM/DCS and WLAN operations printed and integrated on a dielectric substrate for application in a dual-network PDA phone are presented. The two integrated antennas are printed PIFAs mounted at the top edge of the main circuit board of the PDA phone and the isolation behavior of the two antennas with various possible arrangements is studied. The optimized isolation between the two antennas is analyzed. Over the GSM DCS and WLAN bands good isolation (less than -20 dB) between the two integrated antennas can be obtained.

Two purposes motivated this study: (a) to quantify the difficulty in learning various symbols of the alphabet used to enter data into a personal digital assistant (PDA) and (b) to investigate the interaction of item difficulty with practice conditions that promote varying levels of cognitive effort. Levels of compatibility between members of the PDA alphabet and English were quantified through introspective ratings in Experiment 1 and objective performance measures in Experiment 2. Three levels of item compatibility were learned under conditions of proactive or retroactive augmented information in Experiment 3. Contrary to expectations the item similarity effect did not interact with practice schedules-a retroactive augmented information condition resulted in degraded levels of acquisition performance but superior retention levels compared to the proactive condition. These findings are discussed in terms of the relative merits of cognitive effort in skill acquisition. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2005
We address the issue of appropriate user modeling to generate cooperative responses to users in spoken dialogue systems. Unlike previous studies that have focused on a user's knowledge we propose more generalized modeling. We specifically set up three dimensions for user models: the skill level in use of the system the knowledge level about the target domain and the degree of urgency. Moreover the models are automatically derived by decision tree learning using actual dialogue data collected by the system. We obtained reasonable accuracy in classification for all dimensions. Dialogue strategies based on user modeling were implemented on the Kyoto City Bus Information System that was developed at our laboratory. Experimental evaluations revealed that the cooperative responses adapted to each subject type served as good guides for novices without increasing the duration dialogue lasted for skilled users.;2005
We proposed a novel fringe field switching (FFS) liquid crystal (LC) mode with a 3-partition pixel slit. In this mode a pixel branch is partitioned into 3 areas namely two edges and a center where the edge slit angle is larger than the center slit angle. Thus the reverse twist region in the pixel edge is reduced and the LC dynamics in this region becomes very stable. Also when an external pressure is applied to the panel at the operating voltage the disclination line is barely extended into the active area. Consequently this mode exhibits a high external pressure resistance with a wide viewing angle and is attractive for pen-based touch panels such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and tablet personal computers (PCs).;2005
We report an email questionnaire survey of Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) use amongst members of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists (ASA). PDAs are becoming increasingly popular and they have many applications within the healthcare community. Seventy-eight per cent of members of the ASA have an email address (1870/2385) although only 38% (900/2385) of members are regular uses of email. We surveyed 1870 members of the ASA and received 215 responses (11% response rate). We found that 91% of anaesthetists answering the survey used a PDA and of these 72% use a Palm operating system which reflects current market trends. Anaesthetists use PDAs for a wide range of facilities: appointments drug reference contact details and tasks to do being the most utilized. The most common software programs added to the operating system were pharmacopoeias contact managers and database programs.;2005
While many successful spoken dialog systems have been deployed over telephone networks in recent years the high cost of developing such applications has led to limited adoption. Despite large research efforts in user-initiative and mixed-initiative systems most commercial applications follow a system initiative approach because they are simpler to design and are found to work adequately. Yet even designing such system-initiative spoken dialog systems has proven costly when compared with simpler touchtone systems. To address this issue we describe in this paper our efforts in building diagnostics tools to let nonexperienced speech developers write usable applications without the need for transcribing calls. Our approach consists of two steps. In the first step we cluster calls based on Question/Answer (QA) states and transitions analyze the success rates associated with each QA state and transition and identify the most problematic QA states and transitions based on a criterion we call Arc Cut Gain in Success Rate (ACGSR). In the second step we cluster calls associated with problematic QA transitions through an approach we term Interactive Clustering (IC). The purpose of this step is to automatically cluster calls that are similar to those already labeled by the developers to maximize productivity. Experiments on an internal auto-attendant application show that our approach can significantly reduce the time and effort needed to identify problems in spoken dialog applications.;2005
With the mobility and computability of personal digital assistants (PDAs) they should play an important role in the post-PC era. Currently PDA applications are still limited to service business. In this project an attempt was made to extend the content of mobile applications to industrial use. This paper is a feasibility study on the factory-to-business (F2B) practice with a programmable logic controller (PLC) a PDA and a PC-based platform for a driller. A PDA is a hand-held human-machine interface (hhHMI) which operates on a compact flash Ethernet card and embedded VB 3.0 program while a host PC connected to the PLC and AP (access point) station that conforms to IEEE 802.11b. Experimental results show that the PDA and PC-based platforms are able to control and monitor a PLC-controlled manufacturing system promptly for a F2B practice.;2005
A common way of storing spatio-temporal information about mobile devices is in the form of a 3D (2D geography + time) trajectory. We argue that when cellular phones and Personal Digital Assistants become location-aware the size of the spatio-temporal information generated may prohibit efficient processing. We propose to adopt a technique studied in computer graphics namely line-simplification as an approximation technique to solve this problem. Line simplification will reduce the size of the trajectories. Line simplification uses a distance function in producing the trajectory approximation. We postulate the desiderata for such a distance-function: it should be sound namely the error of the answers to spatio-temporal queries must be bounded. We analyze several distance functions and prove that some are sound in this sense for some types of queries while others are not. A distance function that is sound for all common spatio-temporal query types is introduced and analyzed. Then we propose an aging mechanism which gradually shrinks the size of the trajectories as time progresses. We also propose to adopt existing linguistic constructs to manage the uncertainty introduced by the trajectory approximation. Finally we analyze experimentally the effectiveness of line-simplification in reducing the size of a trajectories database.;2006
A low-cost prototyping environment for experimenting with embodied conversational agents is discussed. The platform allows modeling and experimenting with different agent constructs and protocols prior to significant investment in the construction of the agent environment. Problems in the design of such a platform include the substantial number of agent controls needed and the flexibility required to represent the constructs of different theories protocols and target environments as they are introduced and developed. These problems are addressed by augmenting a movie clip manager With a general drawing palette as a design tool. The result is a prototyping environment Which simulates multiple agents on a desktop while allowing arbitrary notational conventions. The current version does not render multiple agents in a shared virtual environment but the protocol-based architecture is amenable to such extensions. In the meantime valuable results regarding the social character Of multiple agent interaction call be explored with the existing tool. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;2006
A multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system using three EMC (electromagnetic compatible) chip antennas ill a personal digital assistant (PDA) phone is demonstrated. The three EMC chip antennas art mounted at three corners of the system ground plane of the PDA phone and all generate a wide bandwidth covering the wireless local area network (WLAN) operation in the 2.4-GHz band (2400-2484 MH7). By adding a T-shaped shorted strip in the proposed MIMO antenna system large improvements in the isolation (S-12 S-13 and S-23 all less than -20 dB) between any V two antennas of the MIMO system tire achieved. Detailed effects of the T-shaped shorted strip on the isolation improvement in the proposed MIMO antenna system are analyzed. Radiation characteristics of the three antennas are also studied.

A novel internal dual-band patch antenna with a small thickness of 3 min for application in Global System for Mobile Communication/Digital Communication System (GSM/DCS) mobile terminals such as the mobile phone or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) phone is presented. The patch antenna occupies an area of 15 x 60 mm(2) with its top patch embedded with a simple T-shaped slit which separates the top patch into two resonant paths to generate two resonant modes for 900/1800 MHz operation. Then by extending a small portion of the top patch beyond the top edge of the system ground plane of the mobile terminal the antenna can provide two wide bandwidths covering the GSM/DCS bands. The proposed antenna is experimentally studied and effects of the extended top-patch portion and the ground-plane length on the obtained bandwidths are discussed.;2006
A novel internal global system for mobile communication/digital communication system (GSM/DCS) antenna suitable for application in mobile devices such as the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) phone is presented. The antenna has two radiating strips designed to operate at about 900 and 1800 MHz for GSM/DCS operation and is backed by and short circuited to a step-shaped ground plane. With the use of the step-shaped ground plane which is to be placed at the top edge of the system ground plane of a PDA phone the antenna can be employed in very close proximity to the possible RF shielding metal cases for battery and associated RF module/circuitry with almost no degradation in the antenna performances. In addition the antenna almost occupies no board space in the system ground plane and is with a very small protruded length (3 turn only in this study) over the top edge of the system ground plane. The antenna is thus very promising to operate as an internal antenna and in addition shows an attractive electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) property with nearby conducting or RF elements inside a mobile device.;2006
A novel surface-mountable monopole chip antenna having an electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) property is presented. In addition to the radiating strip on the chip base of the antenna a ground portion is added on the side surfaces of the chip base. The antenna ground portion is to be grounded to the system ground plane of the mobile device for practical applications. The antenna ground portion can function as an effective shielding wall between the antenna and the nearby electronic components in the device. In this case the nearby components can be placed in close proximity to the antenna with small effects on the antenna performances. That is the proposed antenna is EM compatible with the nearby components. In addition the proposed antenna is surface-mountable onto the system circuit board of the mobile device which reduces the packaging cost of the device. The proposed antenna applied to a smart phone or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) phone for WLAN operation in the 2.4 GHz band is studied in the paper.;2006
A solution to the problem of speech recognition with signals distorted by low-bit rate coders is presented in this paper. A model for the coding-decoding distortion a HMM compensation method to include this model and an EM-based adaptation algorithm to estimate this distortion are proposed here. Medium vocabulary continuous-speech speaker-independent recognition experiments with 8 kbps G.729(CS-CELP) 13 kbps RPE-LTP (GSM) 5.3 kbps G723.1 4.8 kbps FS- 1016 and 32 kbps G.726(ADPCM) coders show that the approach described in this paper is able to dramatically reduce the effect of the coding distortion and in some cases gives a word accuracy higher than the baseline system with uncoded speech. Finally the EM estimation algorithm requires only one adapting utterance and the approach described is certainly suitable for dialogue systems where just a few adapting utterances are available.;2006
A wireless sensor module with several air quality monitoring sensors was developed for indoor environment monitoring system in home networking. The module has various enlargements for various kinds of sensor such as humidity sensor temperature sensor. CO2 sensor. flying dust sensor etc. The developed wireless module is very convenient to be installed on the wall of a room or office and the sensors in the module can be easily replaced due to well-designed module structure and RF Connection method To reduce the system cost only one RF transmission block was used for sensors' signal transmission to 8051 microcontroller board in time-sharing method. in this home networking system various indoor environmental parameters could be monitored in real time from RF wireless sensor module. Indoor vision was transferred to client PC or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) from surveillance camera installed indoor or desired site. Web server using Oracle DB was used for saving the visions from web-camera and various data from wireless sensor module (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2006
After the establishment of web-based image distribution three challenges for image distribution can be identified today. Firstly PACS (picture archiving and communication system) and the distribution of radiological images and reports need to be integrated with the emerging electronic medical record. Secondly report and image data should be available on mobile devices like PDAs (personal digital assistants) or smartphones in the future. Thirdly future systems must be available not only to transmit sectional images but also to allow access to three- and four-dimensional data that are produced by multidetector CT and modern MR scanners.;2006
Aim: This paper reports a study exploring nurses' perceptions of adopting an information system using handheld computers (personal digital assistants) in their daily practice. Background: Handheld computers have recently been used in nursing information systems for patient care but few studies have explored their impact on users. By understanding clinicians' experiences of using this technology strategies can be implemented to smooth the change process in adopting their use thus achieving optimal patient outcomes. Method: A descriptive exploratory approach was used to study nurses' perceptions of using personal digital assistants as part of a hospital information system. A purposive sample of 15 nurses participated in one-to-one in-depth interviews from February to March 2004. Nurses' perceptions of the adoption process were analysed using Lewin's force field theory of change as a framework. Findings: Nurses initially resisted using the personal digital assistant system (unfreezing stage) then came around to using it (moving stage) and finally adopted the system in their daily practice (re-freezing stage). However an anticipatory stage also occurred and this could serve as a feedback mechanism to improve the system for current and future use. Conclusion: Educational programmes should be provided and strategic planning should be done in the early stage of implementing a policy to adopt new technology. In addition the adoption process and learning period could be shortened by improving the system's content design. During this transition stage dual charting should be used as a backup only for a limited time to avoid adding extra work to nurses' already heavy workload. Finally the concept of confidentiality should be reinforced and stressed early in the educational programme to protect patient data which can easily be accessed in computerized systems.;2006
As new technological innovations are rapidly introduced and changed identifying an individual characteristic that has a persistent effect on the acceptance decisions across multiple technologies is of substantial value for the successful implementation of information systems. Augmenting prior work on individual innovativeness within the context of information technology we developed a new measure of adopter category innovativeness (ACI) and compared its effectiveness with the existing measure of personal innovativeness in IT (PIIT). Further we examined two alternative models in which the role of individual innovativeness was theorized differently-either as a moderator of the effects the perceived innovation characteristics of usefulness ease of use and compatibility have on future use intention (moderator model) or as a direct determinant of the innovation characteristics (direct determinant model). To ensure the generalizability of the study findings two field studies (N = 634) were conducted each of which examined the two models (moderator and direct determinant) and measured individual innovativeness using the two measures (ACI and PIIT). Study 1 surveyed the online buying practices of 412 individuals and Study 2 surveyed personal digital assistant adoption of 222 healthcare professionals. Across the markedly different adoption contexts the study results consistently show that individual innovativeness is a direct determinant of the innovation characteristics and the two measures share many commonalities. The new measure offers some additional utilities not found in the PIIT measure by allowing individuals to be directly classified and mapped into adopter categories. Implications are drawn for future research and practice.;2006
Automated dialogue systems delivered over the telephone offer a promising approach to delivering health-related interventions to populations of individuals at low-cost. Over the past two decades an automated telephone system called Telephone-Linked Care or TLC has been successfully designed and evaluated by the authors and their colleagues. This work has resulted in over twenty systems for various health-related conditions and lifestyle behaviors. This paper describes our approach to developing and writing dialogue for these automated telephone systems including determining the program objectives defining the target population and selecting a theory of behavior change to guide the intervention. Both macro and micro issues are considered in constructing dialogue systems that are engaging for the target population easy to use and effective at promoting positive health behaviors and outcomes.

Background This survey assessed and compared National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Third Adult Treatment Panel lipid treatment goal achievement for men versus women undergoing treatment of dyslipidemia. Methods Patients receiving treatment for dyslipidemia from physicians (N = 376) in the United States who were high prescribers of lipid medications were enrolled in the NCEP Evaluation Project Utilizing-Novel E-Technology (NEPTUNE) II. Data from a single office visit were collected and entered into the NEPTUNE software on a personal digital assistant and uploaded to a central database via the Internet. Results Of the 4885 patients evaluated 2103 (43%) were women. NCEP Third Adult Treatment Panel low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal achievement was similar between women and men with 0 or 1 risk factor (89% and 88% respectively) and 2 or more risk factors (75% and 76% respectively). However fewer women than men achieved goal in the coronary heart disease and risk equivalents (CHD + CHD RE) category (50% vs 60% respectively P <.001). Logistic regression analyses examining the association between sex and LDL-C treatment goal achievement and evaluating potential confounding by other predictors of treatment success indicated an age-adjusted odds ratio of 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.56-0.77 P <.001) and a multivariate odds ratio of 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.62-0.93 P=.009) for women compared with men in the CHID + CHD RE category. Conclusions Female sex was associated with lower likelihood of LDL-C goal achievement among patients with CHD + CHD RE. This relationship remained significant after adjustment for other significant predictors of treatment success.;2006
Background. Assessing the physical demands of the heterogeneous jobs in hospitals requires appropriate and validated assessment methodologies. Methods: As part of an integrated assessment we adapted Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) using it in a work sampling mode facilitated by a hand-held personal digital assistant expanding it with selected items from the UC Computer Use Checklist and developed a scoring algorithm for ergonomics risk factors for the upper (UB) and lower body (LB). Results: The inter-rater reliability kappa was 0.54 for UB and 0.66 for LB. The scoring algorithm demonstrated significant variation (ANOVA p < 0.05) by occupation in anticipated directions (administrators ranked lowest support staff ranked highest on both scores). A supplemental self-assessment measure of spinal loading correlated with high strain LB scores (r = 0.30 p < 0.001). Conclusion: We developed and validated a scoring algorithm incorporating a revised REBA schema adding computer use items appropriate for ergonomics assessment across a range of hospital jobs.

Background. During 2000-03 Qualidigm a US Quality Improvement Organization conducted a project to improve the care received by elderly Medicare patients with coronary artery disease or cardiovascular risk factors. Methods. We recruited primary care physicians in private practice in the state of Connecticut. Then we identified approximately 30-50 patients per physician from the periods 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000 and 1 November 2001 to 31 October 2002. We abstracted medical records to assess processes and outcomes of care and we provided the physicians with performance data and a variety of practice-enhancing materials. The physicians utilized those materials that they perceived to be most helpful. Results. We identified and recruited 974 primary care physicians to participate. Of these 103 (10.6%) committed to participate and 85 of the 103 completed the project. Among the intervention tools physicians and their office personnel utilized personal digital assistants (PDAs) (36.5%) and patient education materials (34.1%) most commonly. Overall quality of care improved for most physicians (mean quality score 62.0 to 67.8% P < 0.001). However not all improved and most improvements were modest [mean absolute improvement in quality score 5.8% standard deviation (SD) 6.8%]. Conclusions. Quality Improvement Organizations and others interested in improving outpatient quality of care face significant challenges in recruiting self-employed primary care physicians to quality improvement projects and in bringing about transformational change. Future primary care quality improvement projects should include careful assessments of practice-specific barriers interventions that are linked to these barriers and support of the practices on implementation.;2006
BACKGROUND. Medication management is a complex multifaceted system. Prescribing errors occur upstream in the process and as such their effects can be perpetuated and sometimes even exacerbated in subsequent steps. These errors place patients at risk of adverse drug events. Children especially young infants are at particular risk because of their size unique physiology and immature ability to metabolize drugs. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to reduce the risk of harm to children resulting from prescribing errors. METHODS. We sequentially implemented patient safety initiatives over a 1-year time frame at a pediatric tertiary care academic facility. The initiatives included an educational Web site with competency examination distribution of a personal digital assistant-based standardized dosing reference a zero-tolerance policy for incomplete or incorrect medication orders prescriber performance feedback and presentation of outcome data at citywide grand rounds. A total of 8718 orders were collected and analyzed to assess the impact of these initiatives. RESULTS. The absolute risk reduction from prescribing errors was 38 per 100 orders with a relative risk reduction of 49%. Web-based education with point-of-care drug references and a zero-tolerance policy for incomplete or incorrect orders were most effective in decreasing potential adverse drug events. Documentation of appropriate weight-based dosing and indication for therapy increased by 24% and 42% respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Process-improvement initiatives focusing on prescriber education and behavior modification can reduce the risk of harm to pediatric patients from prescribing errors.;2006
Background: A real-time assessment of patients' experiences is an important methodology for studies in health care quality of life behavioral sciences and new drug and treatment development. Ecological momentary assessment is a methodology that allows for real-time assessment of experience and behavior in a subject's natural environment. Recently electronic data collection techniques have been introduced including systems utilizing interactive voice response. Objective: The objective of this project was evaluation of spoken dialogue methodology for real-time data collection of information from patients for health behavioral and lifestyle studies and monitoring. While the management of the data collection process was Internet-based this additional eHealth communication channel was based on over-the-phone natural language conversation with a dialogue system utilizing automated speech recognition technology. For this study we implemented a dialogue system for patients' assessment and monitoring of chronic pain. Methods: Experimental evaluation of usability of the Pain Monitoring Voice Diary was performed with 24 volunteers. The volunteers were asked to contribute 10 sessions with the system over a period of 2 weeks in practice the number of sessions per subject ranged from 1 to 20. The subjects. were asked to either relate to pain episodes in their past while answering the system's questions or use as a guidance one of nine provided medical scenarios compiled by a pain specialist ranging from migraines and back pain to post-surgical pain (knee injury) and cancer- and chemotherapy-related afflictions. Results: From 24 volunteers we collected a total of 177 dialogue sessions: 171 sessions were completed while the caller hung up in the other 6 sessions. There were a total of 2437 dialogue turns where a dialogue turn corresponds to one system prompt and one user utterance. The data capture rate measuring the percentage of slots filled automatically was 98% while the other 2% were flagged for transcription Among the utterances sent to transcription where the user had opted for the none of those option 70% corresponded to the type of pain slot 20% to the symptoms slot and 10% to the body part slot indicating that those are the grammars with the highest out-of-vocabulary rate. Conclusions: The results of this feasibility study indicated that desired accuracy of data can be achieved with a high degree of automation (98% in the study) and that the users were indeed capable of utilizing the flexible interface the sessions becoming more and more efficient as users' experience increased both in terms of session duration and avoidance of troublesome dialogue situations.;2006
Background: At the University Hospital Giessen an anesthesia information management system (AIMS) is used for online record keeping of perioperative patient care but preoperative anaesthesia assessments were stilt being recorded on paper and subsequently entered into the AIMS. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) seem to be useful instruments to establish a seamless digital anesthesiological documentation. Objectives: We decided to implement a solution for direct integration of data gathered during the preoperative assessment into the existing data management infrastructure. Parallel to the development of the system we surveyed the future users to match their wishes and needs as far as possible. System description: A C program embedding the preoperative AIMS' data fields was developed. Data alignment with the Hospital information system (HIS) is controlled by a Java desktop software. The anaesthesiologist completes the available fields at the patient's bedside following the same algorithm and integrity check as the PC version. Status report: Overall 68% of the surveyed physicians supported the implementation of the system. The PDA solution has been available since May 2002. Data replication into the handheld and integration of mobile collected data into the AIMS generally work without problems. The HIS interconnection software converts the PDA file into the AIMS format for further processing. Discussion: The preoperative anaesthetic assessment is a standardised task well suitable for conversion to an electronic data storage medium. Changing from redundant data entry in the OR to direct electronic recording at the patient's bedside seems simply logical. Handheld computers are inexpensive flexible gadgets to realize this.

Background: Epidemiological and dietary intervention studies suggest that a low-glycemic index (GI) diet is beneficial for blood glucose control however long-term clinical utility of the low GI diet has not been fully investigated. Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a nutritionist-delivered low-GI dietary intervention with the support of a personal digital assistant (PDA) for adult patients with poorly controlled type II diabetes. Method: The low-GI intervention consisted of six counseling sessions and the use of a PDA-based food database with GI scores for 6 months. Study outcomes included feasibility measures glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) GI and glycemic load (GL) score of self-reported dietary intake body weight depression and quality of life (QOL). Measures were obtained at baseline 3 and 6 months. Results: Of 31 adult patients approached 15 met study eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study. Thirteen patients (87%) completed all study assessments. Findings included decreases in average HbA1c (-0.5% P = 0.02) body weight hip circumference blood pressure dietary GI and daily caloric intake. Diabetes impact scores also decreased. All but one participant completed all components of the intervention. There were mixed reports regarding the usefulness of the PDAs however participants offered helpful suggestions for further development. Conclusions: Results of this pilot study support the feasibility of implementing a nutritionist-delivered PDA-assisted low-GI dietary intervention for patients with poorly controlled type II diabetes. Encouraging initial efficacy data require further testing in the context of a randomized clinical trial.;2006
Background: Naps during extended work shifts are effective in reducing fatigue in other industries but the use of a nap as a countermeasure to prevent fatigue in residents is uncertain. Objective: To assess the effects of a call-night nap on resident sleep and fatigue. Design: 1-year within-participant paired trial with crossover at midmonth. Setting: Academic teaching hospital. Participants: 38 of 40 internal medicine interns. Measurements: Sleep was measured by using wristwatch actigraphy. By using the experience sampling method on a personal digital assistant random alerts prompted interns to rate fatigue on the 7-point Stanford Sleepiness Scale (7 is most tired). Hospital paging logs and structured interviews provided information on use of coverage. Intervention: For 2 weeks of every month interns were assigned to the nap schedule which provided coverage to on-duty interns from midnight to 7:00 a.m. so that they could finish their work and take a nap. The other 2 weeks of the month constituted a standard schedule. Results: Interns received 41 more minutes of sleep while on call with the nap schedule (185 minutes vs. 144 minutes P < 0.001). When interns with the nap schedule used coverage they received 68 more minutes of sleep (210 minutes vs. 142 minutes P < 0.001). Despite these small increases in sleep interns reported less overall fatigue while on the nap schedule than while on the standard schedule (1.74 vs. 2.26 P = 0.017). Postcall fatigue with the nap schedule was lower by nearly 1 point (2.23 vs 3.16 P = 0.036) which is almost equivalent to the difference between oncall and postcall fatigue with the standard schedule (2.06 vs. 3.16). However use of coverage by interns on the nap schedule was impaired by their desire to care for their patients and concerns about discontinuity of care. Limitations: This was a single-institution study that did not have the power to examine outcomes related to intern or patient wellbeing. Conclusions: Coverage to allow a nap during an extended duty-hour shift can increase sleep and decrease fatigue for residents.;2006
BACKGROUND: Practice audit is an important component of continuing professional development that may more readily be undertaken if it were less complex. This qualitative study assessed the use of personal digital assistants to facilitate data collection and review. METHODS: Personal digital assistants programmed with standard questionnaires related to upper gastrointestinal endoscopies (Practice Audit in Gastroenterology-Endoscopy ['PAGE-Endo']) and colonoscopies (PAGE-Colonoscopy ['PAGE-Colo']) were provided to Canadian gastroenterologists surgeons and internists. Over a three-week audit period participants recorded indications and the expected (E) and reported (R) findings for each procedure. Thereafter participants recorded compliance with reporting the ease of use and value of the PAGE program and their willingness to perform another audit. RESULTS: Over 15 to 18 months 173 participants completed PAGE-Endo (6168 procedures) and 111 completed PAGE-Colo (4776 procedures). Most respondents noted that PAGE was easy to use (99%) beneficial (88% to 95%) and that they were willing undertake another audit (92% to 95%). In PAGE-Endo alarm features were prevalent (55%) but major reported findings were less common than expected: esophagitis (E 29.9% R 14.8%) esophageal stricture (E 8.3% R 3.6%) gastric ulcer (E 17.0% R 4.7%) gastric cancer (E 4.3% R 1.0%) and duodenal ulcer (E 11.5% R 5.7%). In PAGE-Colo more colonoscopies were performed for symptom investigation (55%) than for screening (25%) or surveillance (20%). There were marked interprovincial variations with respect to sedation biopsies and technical aspects of colonoscopy. CONCLUSION: Secure real-time data entry with review of aggregate and individual data in the PAGE program provided an acceptable straightforward methodology for accredited practice audit activities. PAGE has considerable potential for continuing professional development in gastroenterology and other specialties.;2006
BACKGROUND: The United States' National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III and the Canadian Working Group oil Hypercholesterolemia and Other Dyslipidemias (CWG) have each issued guidelines for the treatment of dyslipidemia. OBJECTIVE: The present analysis compared the percentage of patients reaching target lipid levels according to NCEP and CWG guidelines among participants of the NCEP Evaluation ProjecT Utilizing Novel E-technology (NEPTUNE) II a survey performed in the United States. METHODS: American physicians who were high prescribers of lipid-modifying medications (n=376) each enrolled 10 to 20 consecutive patients from February to September 2003. Medical information laboratory Measurements and treatment plans associated with a single office visit were entered into a personal digital assistant and uploaded to a central database via the Internet. RESULTS: Under both sets of guidelines treatment Success was strongly related to risk category (P < 0.001). Treatment goal achievement in the low-risk (zero or one risk factor) and moderate-risk (two or more risk factors) categories was not substantially different between NCEP and CWG guidelines however in the high-risk category (coronary artery disease [CAD] and risk equivalents [RE]) CWG treatment goals were met less frequently than NCEP goals. NCEP combined low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goals were met by 39% of hypertriglyceridemic patients (27% in the CAD + CAD RE category). CWG combined lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio treatment goals were met by 38% of hypertriglyceridemic patients (19% in the CAD + CAD RE category). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate substantial underachievement of treatment goals by patients at high risk under both the CWG and NCEP guidelines. The lower frequency of treatment Success in high-risk patients according to the CWG definition indicates that more aggressive treatment is needed to reach CWG goals.;2006
Background: We developed a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based program to assess compliance with our medical student work hours policy and to correlate work hours with sleep and performance. Methods: Medical students on surgery clerkship logged real-time work and sleep hours for I week. Estimated work hours clinical evaluations and score on the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) surgery examination were recorded. Results: Thirty-seven students logged work hours which correlated poorly with estimated work hours and sleep hours. The majority of students overestimated work hours by a mean of 19.5 hours. Twenty-four students transgressed written policy. Increased in-hospital study hours correlated with improved clinical ratings but poorer NBME examination scores. Increased operating room hours correlated with higher NBME examination scores. Conclusions: Medical students inaccurately estimate work hours a PDA-based log facilitates hours monitoring. Unenforced work hour policies are frequently transgressed. Work activity patterns but not total work hours correlated with outcomes on standardized written tests and clinical ratings.

Because of their minimal cost size and weight handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs) are appealing as a means for administering response time tasks in the field or to participants in longitudinal studies who need repeated access to the testing equipment. We have developed a software package that allows investigators to author simple scripts on their desktop computers and administer the compiled tasks on PDAs. MiniCog presents instructions practice trials with auditory feedback and visual stimuli in random or fixed sequential orders with fixed or variable durations and intertrial intervals and records single-button responses and response times. Data from each trial are stored with a user ID user-entered demographics and notes and a time-and-date stamp for later upload to a desktop computer. MiniCog performs automatic calculations of mean response time and error rate available to users with a password and stored with the other data for upload.;2006
Both the hardware and software available for digital geological mapping (DGM) have advanced considerably in recent years. Mobile computers have become cheaper lighter faster and more power efficient. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have become cheaper smaller and more accurate and software specifically designed for geological mapping has become available. These advances have now reached a stage where it is effective to replace traditional paper-based mapping techniques with those employing DGM methodologies. This paper attempts to assess and evaluate two currently available DGM systems for geological outcrop mapping: one based on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) running ESRI ArcPad and the second based on a Tablet PC running Map IT software. Evaluation was based on field assessment during mapping of a well-exposed coastal section of deformed Carboniferous and Permian rocks at N. Tynemouth in NE England. Prior to the field assessment several key criteria were identified as essential attributes of an effective DGM system. These criteria were used as the basis for the assessment and evaluation process. Our findings suggest that the main concerns presented by sceptics opposed to DGM have largely been resolved. In general DGM systems using a Tablet PC were found to be most suitable for a wide range of geological data collection tasks including detailed outcrop mapping. In contrast systems based on a PDA due to small screen and limited processing power were best suited for more basic mapping and simple data collection tasks. In addition PDA-based systems can be particularly advantageous for mapping projects in remote regions in situations where there is a limited power supply or where total weight of equipment is an important consideration.

Call-routing is the technology of automatically classifying the type of a telephone call from a customer to a business or an institution in order to transmit the call onward to the correct destination. Making transcriptions of calls to provide training data for automatic routing in a particular application requires considerable human effort and it would be highly advantageous for the system to be able to learn how to route calls from training utterances that were not transcribed. This paper introduces several techniques that can be used to build call routers from an untranscribed training set and also without any prior knowledge of the application vocabulary or grammar. The techniques concentrate on identifying sequences of decoded phones that are salient for routing and introduces two methods for doing this using language models that are specifically tailored for the routing task. Despite the fact that the phone recognition error-rate on the calls is over 70% the best system described here achieves a routing error of 13.5% on an 18 route task. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Context The administration of an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) using paper checklists presents problems such as illegible handwriting missing student names and/or numbers and lost checklists. Calculating and entering results is not only time-consuming but is subject to human errors and feedback to students is rarely available. To rectify these problems personal digital assistants (PDAs) and HaPerT software were acquired to replace paper checklists and provide automated results and feedback. This study sought to determine the usability of the PDA assessment system. Methods The usability of the PDA system was evaluated according to effectiveness efficiency and user satisfaction. Effectiveness was judged by comparing the results of an OSCE conducted in 2003 (paper-based method) and repeated in 2004 and 2005 (PDA method). Efficiency was determined by calculating the amount of time required to organise the logistics for 2 consecutive PDA OSCEs and deliver results and grades compared with the time required for the paper-based OSCE. User satisfaction was established by using questionnaires to obtain feedback on the assessors' experiences during their first assessments. Results An independent groups t-test used to compare the means of scores achieved by students in the PDA and paper-based OSCEs respectively showed that the difference in effectiveness was not significant. In terms of efficiency 77% less time was used for the PDA OSCE in 2004 and 93% less in 2005. Assessor feedback on PDA assessment was overwhelmingly positive. Assessment by PDA was found to be just as effective as and more efficient than paper-based assessment in practical examinations and was highly rated by assessors.;2006
Currently people gain easy access to an increasingly diverse range of mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) smart phones and handheld computers. As dynamic content has become dominant on the fast-growing World Wide Web [ 24] it is necessary to provide effective ways for the users to access such prevalent Web content in a mobile computing environment. During a course of browsing dynamic content on mobile devices the requested content is first dynamically generated by remote Web server then transmitted over a wireless network and finally adapted for display on small screens. This leads to considerable latency and processing load on mobile devices. By integrating a novel Web content adaptation algorithm and an enhanced caching strategy we propose an adaptive scheme called MobiDNA for serving dynamic content in a mobile computing environment. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed MobiDNA system we construct an experimental testbed to investigate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that this scheme can effectively improve mobile dynamic content browsing by improving Web content readability on small displays decreasing mobile browsing latency and reducing wireless bandwidth consumption.;2006
Daily dairies also known as experience sampling methods (ESM) or everyday experience methods are a common methodology utilized to provide insight into momentary psychological processes. Traditionally such studies often have utilized paper-and-pencil surveys administered several times each day over a span of several days or weeks. However advances in technology now allow these studies to be conducted using palmtop computers (i.e. personal digital assistants PDAs). Three software packages for running these studies on the Palm operating system were explored and compared on a number of features. Specifically ESP (Experience Sampling Program by Feldman Barrett & Barrett 2001) iESP Version 3.2 (Intel Experience Sampling Program by Intel Research Seattle & the University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering Department) and PMAT Version 2.0 (Purdue Momentary Assessment Tool by the Military Family Research Institute at Purdue University) were examined with their key features compared. These advances in software for running diary studies include a number of features that provide researchers with methods and information previously unavailable in diary studies and may expand the range of possibilities in diary study designs.;2006
Dialogue systems for health communication hold out the promise of providing intelligent assistance to patients through natural interfaces that require no training to use. But in order to make the development of such systems cost effective we must be able to use generic techniques and components which are then specialized as needed to the specific health problem and patient population. In this paper we describe Chester a prototype intelligent assistant that interacts with its user via conversational natural spoken language to provide them with information and advice regarding their prescribed medications. Chester builds on our prior experience constructing conversational assistants in other domains. The emphasis of this paper is on the portability of our generic spoken dialogue technology and presents a case study of the application of these techniques to the development of a dialogue system for health communication.

Digital video decoding enabled by the MPEG-2 video standard is an important future application for embedded systems particularly personal digital assistants and other information appliances. Many such systems require portability and wireless communication capabilities and thus face severe limitations in size and power consumption. This places a premium on integration and efficiency and favors software solutions for video functionality over specialized hardware. Apart from computation an equally important problem in video decoding is the data bandwidth and the need to insure adequate data supply. MPEG data sets are very large and generate significant amounts of excess memory traffic for standard data caches up to 100 times the amount required for decoding. Yet MPEG data has locality which caches can exploit if properly optimized providing fast flexible and automatic data supply. We propose a set of enhancements which target the specific needs of the heterogeneous types within the MPEG decoder working set. These optimizations significantly improve the efficiency of small caches reducing cache-memory traffic by almost 70% and can make an enhanced 4-kB cache perform better than a standard 1 MB cache. This performance improvement can enable high-resolution full frame rate video playback in cheaper smaller systems than would otherwise be possible.;2006
Domestic appliances have replaced much human labor in the home. But how human do we want these devices to be and how much autonomy do we want to give them? To throw some light on these questions first the use and limitations of conversational agents (natural language interfaces) are discussed. Then some aspects of the experience of families living in a smart house are described and compared with that of employers of servants in 19th-century Britain. On the basis of this research it appears that people do not want household devices to be very human and do not want to give them much autonomy. Designers are recommended to observe two rules: Smart domestic devices should put people firmly in control and should as far as possible be unseen and unheard.;2006
During the past few years personal digital assistants (PDAs) have become widespread commodities like computers and mobile phones. Many health-care providers particularly physicians routinely use PDAs in their everyday work. Accessing guidelines and clinical decision-based support tools such as the downloadable version of the Italian SPREAD Guidelines represents one of the most important and common clinical applications. The current experience suggests that the need for best evidence models at the time of decision making is strong and that portable accessibility is critical: including just-in-time information systems that allow physicians to retrieve the best evidence at the point of care and a standardized electronic health record (EHR) easily integrating into daily practice and is affordable to most family physicians.;2006
For handheld electronic applications such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) repeated key strokes could result in considerable flexure of the printed circuit board (PCB) mounted inside the housing. In this study a standardized four-point bend test including test board design test setup and test input level has been developed. The S-N curve has been obtained by plotting the reliability at all deflection levels as a function of solder joint strain energy density. The effect of test frequency has also been evaluated. The reliability model prediction of three-point bend reliability matches the experimental data extremely well. The transfer function between reliability stressing and field condition is a strain-energy-density-based power law relationship. Finite-element simulation has been conducted for the worst case cell phone subjected to key presses. The use condition data including strain profiles and frequency have been incorporated in the field life prediction. The four-point bend performance can be converted into the component reliability during cell phone field use conditions. This study establishes the correlation between the use conditions and reliability tests. The cyclic four-point bend test will be implemented in the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) bend test standard for handheld components.;2006
From 1975 through 2003 because of the use of safety belts an estimated 180000 deaths from traffic crashes have been prevented. In order to assess the gains that have been made in safety belt use across the U.S. in individual states and in communities belt use surveys are conducted at regular intervals to determine use rates. The most valid method for surveying safety belt use is through direct observation. Direct observation surveys are conducted along roadways by trained researchers looking into passing vehicles and recording safety belt use. This method of data collection has been effective in the past through the use of paper-and-pencil data recording yet it could be improved through the use of electronic and communication technology. Reported here is a study designed to compare electronic data collection using personal digital assistants (PDAs) with collection using the traditional paper-and-pencil method during the annual statewide survey of safety belt use in Michigan that we have been conducting since 1984. The goals of the study were to develop a PDA database program for data entry in the field to directly compare the PDA data collection process with the paper-and-pencil method on both accuracy and speed and to assess mechanical and environmental factors such as battery life screen visibility and reaction to adverse weather that may act as limitations to the PDA method in comparison with the paper-and-pencil method. In a direct comparison of methods two observers collected data at the same roadway intersections one using paper and a pencil and one using a PDA equipped with our custom software. The study showed that the PDA method was as fast and as accurate as the paper-and-pencil method. There were no adverse effects on the PDA caused by environmental conditions. The PDA was superior to the paper-and-pencil method in rainy weather and for data collector supervision. In addition the use of the PDA obviated the need for entry of paper-recorded data into an electronic format. We conclude that the use of PDAs for safety belt field data collection is superior to the paper-and-pencil method. A Web address is given where the custom PDA safety belt data collection software can be obtained free of charge.;2006
Genres embody typified discursive activity that is situated in an ecology of texts people and tools. Within these settings genres help writers compose recognizable information artifacts. Increasingly however many professions are becoming mobile and mobile technologies (e.g. personal digital assistants [PDAs])are creating problems of translation as writers attempt to snake genres work across contexts. Mobile devices uproot genres from their native contexts undercutting their ability to mediate discursive activity. The semantically reduced design of PDA-accessible information magnifies these problems by obscuring but not erasing genre characteristics that tie information to its native context. Readers must assume the burden of composing meaningful information artifacts work otherwise offloaded to genres. The author explores the nature of this composition burden in a case study of veterinary students. He finds that context and the degree of mobility both influence student perception of this composition burden.;2006
Hospitalised patients who suffer cardiac arrest and require unanticipated intensive care unit (ICU) admission or die often exhibit premonitory abnormatities in vital signs. Sometimes the deterioration is well documented though there is little discernable evidence of intervention. In other cases monitoring and recording of vital signs is infrequent or incomplete. Healthcare providers have introduced track and trigger systems to allow early identification of patients with physiological abnormalities and rapid response teams to facilitate rapid and appropriate management. However even when track and trigger systems are used the recording of vital. signs patient chart completion and team activation remain sub-optimal. We have developed a system for collecting routine vital signs data at the bedside using standard personal digital assistants (PDA). The PDAs act as thin clients linked by a wireless local area network (W-LAN) to the hospital's intranet system where raw and derived data are integrated with other patient information e.g. name hospital number laboratory results. It is possible for raw physiology data early warning scores (EWS) vital signs charts and oxygen therapy records to be made instantaneously available to any member of the hospital healthcare team via the WLAN or hospital intranet. Early and direct contact with members of the patient's primary clinical team or rapid response team can be made through an automated alerting system triggered by the EWS data. The ability to capture physiological data at the bedside and to make these available to anyone with appropriate access rights at any time and in any place should provide previously unattainable clinical and administrative benefits. Analysis of the raw physiological data and patient outcomes will also make it possible to validate existing and future track and trigger systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In 1997 and 2003 the Joint National Committee on Prevention Detection Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VI and JNC VII) gave beginning dose recommendations for antihypertensive drugs that were lower than those found in drug package inserts and the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR). Popular handheld Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) programs recommended the JNC starting dose only 35% of the time and standard textbooks 34% of the time. Prescribing patterns at an academic medical center reflected PDR guidelines for the thiazide diuretics and a calcium channel blocker but they were closer to JNC guidelines for beta adrenergic blockers. The higher thiazide doses recommended by the PDR were associated with hypokalemia. The PDR gives 2.4 mg of clonidine daily as the maximum effective dose twice the maximum dose recommended by the JNC. High clonidine doses were used 14% of the time in inpatients and in 9% of outpatient prescriptions at an academic medical center even though high doses of clonidine raise rather than lower blood pressure. When recommendations for high doses of antihypertensive medications in the package insert conflict with JNC recommendations the package insert recommendations carry through to the PDR  textbooks PDAs and to some physician prescriptions.;2006
In this paper we address the problem of temporal alignment applied to capture communicative gestures conveying different styles. We propose a representation space that may be considered as robust to the spatial variability induced by style. By extending a multilevel dynamic time warping algorithm we show how this extension can fulfil the goals of time correspondence between gesture sequences While preventing jerkiness introduced by standard time warping methods.

In this paper we consider practical issues such as memory efficiency and fast decoding to make continuous density hidden Markov model (CDHMM)-based large vocabulary speech recognition system work on resource limited mobile devices. Particularly we focus on memory efficient acoustic modeling and fast state likelihood computation. The proposed techniques are implemented in a speaker-independent Korean speech recognition system running on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) with a 32-bit fixed-point processor operating at 400MHz. The system uses 0.5MB memory for representing 28448 Gaussians and it runs at 2.54xRT without serious degradation of accuracy on 10k phonetically optimized words recognition task domain.;2006
In this paper we describe a new interface for a barge-in free spoken dialogue system combining multichannel sound field control and beamforming in which the response sound from the system can be canceled out at the microphone points. The conventional method inhibits a user from moving because the system forces the user to stay at a fixed position where the response sound is reproduced. However since the proposed method does not set control points for the reproduction of the response sound to the user the user is allowed to move. Furthermore the relaxation of strict reproduction for the response sound enables us to design a stable system with fewer loudspeakers than those used in the conventional method. The proposed method shows a higher performance in speech recognition experiments.;2006
In this paper we describe design of a simple taste analyzing system using sensory system based on a multi-array chemical sensor (MACS) and personal digital assistant (PDA) for visual and quantitative analysis of different tastes using pattern recognition techniques. The sensory system is communicated with PDA which has several interesting benefits for data analysis and display via wireless using the Bluetooth. A various pattern recognition techniques are adapted including spider map principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm to classify visually data patterns detected by the sensory system. The proposed techniques can be determined the cluster centers and membership grade of patterns through the unsupervised way. The membership grade of an unknown pattern which does not shown previously can be visually and analytically determined. Throughout the experimental trails the taste analyzing system is demonstrated robust performance through data acquisition via wireless communication and visual and quantitative analysis of different tastes for the liquids. The system which is implemented as a simple hand-held taste analyzing instrument can be applicable to on-site taste monitoring. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2006
In this paper we describe our experience with the design and implementation of an embodied conversational agent (ECA) that converses with users to change their dietary behavior. Our intent is to develop a system that dynamically models the agent and the user and adapts the agent's counseling dialog accordingly. Towards this end we discuss our efforts to automatically determine the user's dietary behavior stage of change and attitude towards the agent on the basis of unconstrained typed text dialog first with another person and then with an ECA controlled by an experimenter in a wizard of Oz study. We describe how the results of these studies have been incorporated into an algorithm that combines the results from simple parsing rules together with contextual features using a Bayesian network to determine user stage and attitude automatically.

In this paper we evaluate mass knowledge acquisition using modified ALICE chatterbots. In particular we investigate the potential of allowing subjects to modify chatterbot responses to see if distributed learning from a web environment can succeed. This experiment looks at dividing knowledge into general conversation and domain specific categories for which we have selected telecommunications. It was found that subject participation in knowledge acquisition can contribute a significant improvement to both the conversational and telecommunications knowledge bases. We further found that participants were more satisfied with domain-specific responses rather than general conversation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2006
In this paper we present a complete platform for the semiautomatic and simultaneous generation of human-machine dialog applications in two different and separate modalities (Voice and Web) and several languages to provide services oriented to obtaining or modifying the information from a database (data-centered). Given that one of the main objectives of the platform is to unify the application design process regardless of its modality or language and then to complete it with the specific details of each one the design process begins with a general description of the application the data model the database access functions and a generic finite state diagram consisting of the application flow. With this information the actions to be carried out in each state of the dialog are defined. Then the specific characteristics of each modality and language (grammars prompts presentation aspects user levels etc.) are specified in later assistants. Finally the scripts that execute the application in the real-time system are automatically generated. We describe each assistant in detail emphasizing the methodologies followed to ease the design process especially in its critical aspects. We also describe different strategies and characteristics that we have applied to provide portability robustness adaptability and high performance to the platform. We also address important issues in dialog applications such as mixed initiative and over-answering confirmation handling or providing long lists of information to the user. Finally the results obtained in a subjective evaluation with different designers and in the creation of two full applications that confirm the usability flexibility and standardization of the platform and provide new research directions.

In this small pilot study the authors examined the use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) to electronically self-monitor the dietary and fluid intake of individuals receiving hemodialysis. The purpose of this study was to describe intake patterns of fluid sodium potassium phosphorus protein and calories over a 3-month period as recorded using a PDA. Mean weekly intake values were plotted on line graphs to examine trends of intake. The patients' mean weekly intakes of sodium potassium phosphorus and fluid were dynamic and fluctuating. Protein and caloric intakes were significantly below the recommendations of the K/DOQI guidelines. Standard methods to assess intake may not adequately capture intake patterns on a daily basis.;2006
In this study we developed a wireless monitoring system for outpatients equipped with a moving-actuator type pulsatile bi-ventricular assist device AnyHeart (TM). The developed monitoring system consists of two parts a Bluetooth-based short-distance self-monitoring system that can monitor and control the operating status of a VAD using a Bluetooth-embedded personal digital assistant or a personal computer within a distance of 10 meters and a cellular network-based remote monitoring system that can continuously monitor and control the operating status of AnyHeart (TM) at any location. Results of in vitro experiments demonstrate the developed system's ability to monitor the operational status of an implanted AnyHeart (TM).;2006
Introduction Rapid retrieval of information including drug treatment options is critical to emergency department practice. Objectives To assess feasibility and patient acceptance of personal digital assistants and to determine the scope of management changes. Methods Emergency medicine residents (EMRs n = 18) and emergency medicine attending (EMAs n = 12) used personal digital assistants with drug database and clinical references. Text versions were also available in the emergency department. We did a prospective random cross-over time-motion study recording retrieval time source and changes to patient care for 16 and 8 h for EMRs and EMAs respectively. We surveyed patients for confidence in EMRs and EMAs with personal digital assistants and perceived efficiency. Results EMRs accessed paper (n = 131) or personal digital assistant (n = 181) information on 92.3% of patients (n = 17 both). They accessed personal digital assistant on 61.4% of patients vs. 44.5% with texts (odds ratio 1.99 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.80). Mean access times were 9.3 and 9.4 s respectively +1.4 for both. Personal digital assistant access was 75%/25% between pharmacopeia and clinical resource. Personal digital assistants changed drug choice in 39/181 patients (21.5%) and other management (diagnosis treatment or disposition) in 15/181 patients (8.3%). Odds ratio for change in management for personal digital assistant vs. paper was 2.00 (95% confidence interval 1.11-3.60). We surveyed patient perception for 198 of 295 patients (67.1%). Fifty percent reported more confidence in their EMRs and EMAs with a personal digital assistant while 5% reported less confidence. Sixty percent agreed strongly that there is too much medical information to remember. Conclusions Personal digital assistants are feasible in an academic emergency department and change management more often than texts. EMRs accessed personal digital assistants more often than paper texts. Patient perceptions of physicians who use personal digital assistants are neutral or favorable.

Introduction: This article reports results of a National Institutes of Health/National Library of Medicine Small Business Innovation Research-funded research grant comparing paper-based and automated Palm handheld computer disaster triage documentation. Objectives: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of automated handheld computer triage and compare it to handwritten triage. Methods: A paired t test was used in an intraindividual blinded crossover study to compare the 2 methods of disaster triage by 2 objective measures-time and accuracy. A total of 57 experienced licensed first responders participated. Results are from analysis of 8 disaster scenarios with a total of 400 patients triaged using the 2 methods of documentation crossed over blinded and paired per participant. Results: The study demonstrated the feasibility of using TriageDoc a Palm personal digital assistant (PDA) program as a viable alternative to current manual disaster triage. Furthermore the PDA program gave advantage to bioterrorist agent identification. Conclusions: The feasibility of an automated Palm (Palm Inc. Sunnyvale CA) PDA triage program was demonstrated in this study. Study limitations by the number of participants and the fact it is feasibility research are acknowledged. Nevertheless the research demonstrated TriageDoc was as accurate or more accurate as the manual method of triage with a tendency to require less time. Also there was no statistically significant difference between research sites with respect to accuracy or time to completion when the TriageDoc system was used. The program provided consistency and had flexibility in adapting to the various differences in triage methods at different locations. Hence PDA programs such as TriageDoc may have potential advantages over handwritten documentation for disaster triage. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2006

Mobile Agent technology is an interesting concept for large network-based system structures. In this paper we describe a Java-based agent environment which integrates agent execution platforms into World Wide Web servers promoting a world wide infrastructure for Mobile Agents. This system has been developed within the framework of MEMPHIS IST project which involves the definition development and validation of a new system for commercially significant multilingual premium services focused on thin clients such as mobile phones Personal Digital Assistants etc. The concept relies on the extraction of multilingual information from various web-based content sources in different formats. The system is composed by three different Modules namely the Acquisition the Transformation and the Distribution Module. The content acquisition is based on dynamic user profiles. The acquired content is transformed into a meta-representation which enables content storage independent both of source and destination format and language. The output format is based on the requirements of employed thin client terminals and the output document is distributed via the appropriate networks. The end-user receives the required information as premium services via the chosen output medium. The system supports both pull and push services. An evaluation of the system is also presented.

Mobile computers such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) have dramatically increased in sophistication. At the same time the desire of consumers for portability limits battery size. As a result many researchers have targeted hardware and software energy optimization. However most of these techniques focus on compute-intensive applications rather than interactive applications which are dominant in mobile computers. These systems frequently use graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to handle human-computer interaction. This paper is the first to explore how GUIs can be designed to improve system energy efficiency. We investigate how GUI design approaches should be changed to improve system energy efficiency and provide specific suggestions to mobile computer designers to enable them to develop more energy-efficient systems. We demonstrate that energy-efficient GUI (E(2)GUI) design techniques can improve the average system energy of three benchmarks (text-viewer personnel viewer and calculator) by 26.9 45.2 and 16.4 percent respectively. Average performance is simultaneously improved by 23.7 34.6 and 19.3 percent respectively.;2006
Mobile computing devices such as personal digital assistants and mobile phones are becoming increasingly popular smaller and more capable. We argue that mobile systems should be able to adapt to changing requirements and execution environments. Adaptation requires the ability to reconfigure the deployed code base on a mobile device. Such reconfiguration is considerably simplified if mobile applications are component-oriented rather than monolithic blocks of code. We present the SATIN (System Adaptation Targeting Integrated Networks) component metamodel a lightweight local component metamodel that offers the flexible use of logical mobility primitives to reconfigure the software system by dynamically transferring code. The metamodel is implemented in the SATIN middleware system a component-based mobile computing middleware that uses the mobility primitives defined in the metamodel to reconfigure both itself and applications that it hosts. We demonstrate the suitability of SATIN in terms of lightweightedness flexibility and reusability for the creation of adaptable mobile systems by using it to implement port and evaluate a number of existing and new applications including an active network platform developed for satellite communication at the European Space Agency. These applications exhibit different aspects of adaptation and demonstrate the flexibility of the approach and the advantages gained.;2006
Most areas of the cognitive and social sciences assume that knowledge representations are constructed and used during communication and that much of its content is social. Those of us who build computer models of comprehension and conversation are forced to be explicit about the nature of these knowledge representations and affiliated processes. There are some conditions when knowledge is not sufficiently social and other conditions when knowledge is overly grounded in social mechanisms. The argument is advanced that constraints coherence and precision are very much at the heart of an explanation of the nature and amount of social knowledge. Asocial content reigns supreme when the referential world knowledge is highly constrained coherently structured and precisely specified. The social context of knowledge construction becomes progressively more influential to the extent to that world knowledge is vague open-ended imprecise underspecified and fragmentary.;2006
Most existing multi-modal prototypes enabling users to combine 2D gestures and speech input are task-oriented. They help adult users solve particular information tasks often in 2D standard Graphical User Interfaces. This paper describes the NICE Andersen system which aims at demonstrating multi-modal conversation between humans and embodied historical and literary characters. The target users are 10-18 years old children and teenagers. We discuss issues in 2D gesture recognition and interpretation as well as temporal and semantic dimensions of input fusion ranging from systems and component design through technical evaluation and user evaluation with two different user groups. We observed that recognition and understanding of spoken deictics were quite robust and that spoken deictics were always used in multi-modal input. We identified the causes of the most frequent failures of input fusion and suggest possible improvements for removing these errors. The concluding discussion summarises the knowledge provided by the NICE Andersen system on how children gesture and combine their 2D gestures with speech when conversing with a 3D character and looks at some of the challenges facing theoretical solutions aimed at supporting unconstrained speech/2D gesture fusion.

Much of the work on embodied conversational agents is concerned with building computational models of nonverbal behaviors that can generate the right behavior in the appropriate context. In this paper we discuss from a linguistic and a conversation theoretic point of view how nonverbal behaviors in conversations work. We look particularly at gaze and head movements. These play a variety of functions in face-to-face interactions. We show how these functions are structured by general principles governing cooperative actions and symbolic communication.;2006
Multimodal conversational interfaces provide a natural means for users to communicate with computer systems through multiple modalities such as speech and gesture. To build effective multimodal interfaces automated interpretation of user multimodal inputs is important. Inspired by the previous investigation on cognitive status in multimodal human machine interaction we have developed a greedy algorithm for interpreting user referring expressions (i.e. multimodal reference resolution). This algorithm incorporates the cognitive principles of Conversational Implicature and Givenness Hierarchy and applies constraints from various sources (e.g. temporal semantic and contextual) to resolve references. Our empirical results have shown the advantage of this algorithm in efficiently resolving a variety of user references. Because of its simplicity and generality this approach has the potential to improve the robustness of multimodal input interpretation.;2006
Nurses must be prepared to participate in the evolving National Health Information Infrastructure and the changes that will consequently occur in health care practice and documentation. Informatics technologies will be used to develop electronic health records with integrated decision support features that will likely lead to enhanced health care quality and safety. This paper provides a summary of the National Health Information Infrastructure and highlights electronic health records and decision support systems within the context of evidence-based practice. Activities at the Columbia University School of Nursing designed to prepare nurses with the necessary informatics competencies to practice in a National Health Information Infrastructure-enabled health care system are described. Data are presented from electronic (personal digital assistant) encounter logs used in our Women's Health Nurse Practitioner program to support evidence-based advanced practice nursing care. Implications for nursing practice education and research in the evolving National Health Information Infrastructure are discussed.;2006
OBJECTIVE. There are no accepted and practical measures of the relative clinical and educational activities of pediatricians who work in an academic health science center. Such measures are necessary for justification of existing and future human resource plans and evaluation of the activities and performance of physicians. The limited literature on the measurement of physician workload usually focuses on a specific subspecialty group and does not account for such issues as indirect patient care such as telephone calls or e-mail consultations variables that affect the delivery of clinical care including patient acuity and complexity and the presence of students during the patient care activities. After completing a pilot study that assessed the educational workload of faculty members we adapted existing personal digital assistant technology and software to document clinical and educational activities. METHODS. Twenty full-time physicians from 4 subspecialty pediatric divisions participated in a 2-week evaluation project in May through June 2005. Clinical activities with and without trainees and educational activities were collected with the use of personal digital assistants. Software allowed an individualized division-specific drop-down menu. Information that was collected included clinical (location of activity diagnosis and time requirement) and educational activities. After completion of a 2-week data collection period each physician was asked to complete a 5-question evaluation form. RESULTS. The project was completed successfully with capture of additional clinical and educational activities. A 5-question evaluation form was completed by 70% of the participants at the end of the 2-week data collection. Data on clinical and educational activities were analyzed qualitatively and graphed. CONCLUSIONS. This method of workload data collection added significant information in capturing activities that are not measured in traditional workload evaluations for either clinical activities such as e-mail telephone and patient information review or educational endeavors including mentoring and educational lectures and presentations.;2006
Objective With the aim of developing a new dietary instrument for assessing an individual's usual intakes we evaluated a hand-held personal digital assistant with camera and mobile telephone card called Wellnavi (Matsushita Electric Works Ltd Osaka Japan). Subjects/setting Twenty-eight college students majoring in food and nutrition in Okayama University of Japan voluntarily participated in this study. Design Applying a cross-sectional study design participants were asked to keep 1-day weighed food records. Digital images of all recorded foods were obtained simultaneously and sent to registered dietitians by a mobile telephone card. The following day a 24-hour recall was obtained. These procedures were repeated after 6 months. Participants' opinions about the three methods were determined using a questionnaire. Statistical analysis Differences in estimated median nutrient intake among the three methods were compared by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Relationships among the nutrient estimates by each method were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Results We found no significant differences between the Wellnavi method when compared with food records for most nutrients except zinc manganese vitamin E saturated fatty acid polyunsaturated fatty acid and dietary fiber. The median correlation coefficients for the nutrient estimates were 0.66 between the Wellnavi method and the food records. The survey showed that 57.1% of subjects considered the Wellnavi method the least burdensome of the three methods and the least time consuming (16 minutes) to-record daily diet. About half of participants indicated that they would be willing to use the Wellnavi for 1 month to record their diet. Conclusions This study suggests that a hand-held digital assistant may be a valid and convenient instrument for evaluating dietary intake.;2006
Objective. To assess the reporting of critical incidents by anaesthetic trainees using personal digital assistants. The project also identified the reporting of 'near miss' incidents by anaesthetic trainees. Design. Comparison of electronic incident reporting with retrospective case note review of cases in which no incident was reported. Setting. A 400-bed university teaching hospital in Victoria. Participants. Fourteen accredited Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) registrars and their training supervisors. Interventions. Registrars and supervisors underwent initial training for 1 hour and were provided with ongoing support. The cases and incidents reported to the database using the portable digital assistants were analysed. Main outcome measures. These were the total number of anaesthetics reported to the database the number of incidents reported to the database the outcome severity of incidents reported and the number of incidents detected in the case note review that were not reported to the database. Results. An incident was reported for 156 (3.5%) of 4441 anaesthetic procedures reported to the database. Of these incidents 72 (46.2%) were 'near misses'. One incident was identified in a review of 208 case notes which had no incidents reported electronically and was not reported to the database electronically. This gives a reporting rate of 99.52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 96.9-100%]. Conclusions. ANZCA trainees in routine anaesthetic practice can reliably use mobile computing technology to report critical incidents and 'near miss' incident data.;2006
Objective: The authors developed and evaluated a rating scale the Attitudes toward Handheld Decision Support Software Scale (H-DSS) to assess physician attitudes about handheld decision support systems. Design: The authors conducted a prospective assessment of psychometric characteristics of the H-DSS including reliability validity and responsiveness. Participants were 82 Internal Medicine residents. A higher score on each of the 14 five-point Likert scale items reflected a more positive attitude about handheld DSS. The H-DSS score is the mean across the fourteen items. Attitudes toward the use of the handheld DSS were assessed prior to and six months after receiving the handheld device. Statistics: Cronbach's Alpha was used to assess internal consistency reliability. Pearson correlations were used to estimate and detect significant associations between scale scores and other measures (validity). Paired sample t-tests were used to test for changes in the mean attitude scale score (responsiveness) and for differences between groups. Results: Internal consistency reliability for the scale was alpha = 0.73. In testing validity moderate correlations were noted between the attitude scale scores and self-reported Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) usage in the hospital (correlation coefficient = 0.55) and clinic (0.48) p < 0.05 for both. The scale was responsive in that it detected the expected increase in scores between the two administrations (3.99 (s.d. = 0.35) vs. 4.08 (s.d. = 0.34) p < 0.005). Conclusion: The authors' evaluation showed that the H-DSS scale was reliable valid and responsive. The scale can be used to guide future handheld DSS development and implementation.;2006
Objective: This article describes the various administrative and clinical applications for PDA use in psychiatric care and review the process for implementation in an academic medical center. Method: The authors reviewed the psychiatric literature and tested various hardware and software products. Results: The literature describes various uses of the PDA as a reference tool in clinical care and in training documentation. Conclusions: The PDA is capable of numerous vital roles in medical education.;2006
Objective: This article provides a brief overview of important issues for educators regarding medical education and technology. Methods: The literature describes key concepts prototypical technology tools and model programs. A work group of psychiatric educators was convened three times by phone conference to discuss the literature. Findings were presented to and input was received from the 2005 Summit on Medical Student Education by APA and the American Directors of Medical Student Education in Psychiatry. Results: Knowledge of skills in and attitudes toward medical informatics are important to life-long learning and modern medical practice. A needs assessment is a starting place since student faculty institution and societal factors bear consideration. Technology needs to fit into a curriculum in order to facilitate learning and teaching. Conclusion: Learning about computers and applying computer technology to education and clinical care are key steps in computer literacy for physicians.;2006
Objective: This article provides an overview of how trainees faculty and institutions use technology for acquiring knowledge skills and attitudes for practicing modern medicine. Method: The authors reviewed the literature on medical education technology and change and identify the key themes and make recommendations for implementing technology in medical education. Results: Administrators and faculty should initially assess their own competencies with technology and then develop a variety of teaching methods that use technology to improve their curricula. Programs should decrease the general knowledge-based content of curricula and increase the use of technology for learning skills. For programs to be successful they must address faculty development change management and funding. Conclusions: Willingness for change collaboration and leadership at all levels are essential factors for successfully implementing technology.;2006
Objective: This pilot study provides firsthand feedback from medical students and residents in training regarding their perceptions of technology in medicine. Method: The authors distributed an e-mail invitation to an anonymous Web-based survey to medical students and residents in two different U. S. training institutions. Results: Respondents unanimously expressed that technology skills were important in medical training and felt it most important to learn about electronic medical records and accessing scientific information on the Internet. At the point of patient care trainees' preferred reference sources were the Internet and PDA in that order. Most clinical trainees felt PDAs were critical in patient care and met their clinical needs and they were most likely to use them for medication reference. The majority of trainees preferred printed media over digital media for initial learning but the converse for referencing. Instructor-led small groups were viewed as the best environment in which to receive instruction. Conclusions: Trainees in medical education are technologically savvy and provide invaluable feedback regarding initiation development and refinement of technological systems in medical training.;2006
Objective: To describe the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in documenting pharmacists' clinical interventions. Setting: Evans Army Community Hospital (EACH) a 78-bed military treatment facility in Colorado Springs. Participants: Pharmacists on staff at EACH. Practice Description: All pharmacists at EACH used PDAs with the pilot software to record interventions for 1 month. The program underwent final design changes and then became the sole source for recording pharmacist interventions. The results of this project are being evaluated every 3 months for the first year and yearly thereafter. Practice Innovation: Visual CE (Syware Inc. Cambridge Mass.) software was selected to develop fields for the documentation tool. This software is simple and easy to use and users can retrieve reports of interventions from both inpatient and outpatient sections. The software needed to be designed so that data entry would only take a few minutes and ad hoc reports could be produced easily. Main Outcome Measures: Number of pharmacist interventions reported time spent in clinical interventions and outcome of clinical intervention. Results: Implementing a PDA-based system for documenting pharmacist interventions across ambulatory inpatient and clinical services dramatically increased reporting during the first 6 months after implementation (August 2004-February 2005). After initial fielding clinical pharmacists in advanced practice settings (such as disease management clinic anticoagulation clinic) recognized a need to tailor the program to their specific activities which resulted in a spin-off program unique to their practice roles. Conclusion: A PDA-based system for documenting clinical interventions at a military treatment facility increased reporting of interventions across all pharmacy points of service. Pharmacy leadership used these data to document the impact of pharmacist interventions on safety and quality of pharmaceutical care provided.;2006
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescribing safety in the outpatient setting. Design: The design was a randomized controlled trial conducted in a university-based resident clinic. Internal medicine residents received a PDA-based CDSS suite. For intervention residents the CDSS included a prediction rule for NSAID-related gastrointestinal risk assessment and treatment recommendations. Unannounced standardized patients (SPs) trained to portray musculoskeletal symptoms presented to study physicians. Safety outcomes were assessed from the prescriptions given to the SPs. Each prescription was reviewed by a committee of clinicians blinded to participant intervention group assignment and baseline or follow-up status. Measurements: Prescriptions were judged as safe or unsafe. The main outcome measure was the differential change in unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs for the intervention versus the control group. Results: At baseline the mean proportion of cases per physician with unsafe prescriptions for the two groups was similar (0.27 vs. 0.29 p > 0.05). Controlling for baseline performance intervention participants prescribed more safely than controls after receiving the CDSS (0.23 vs. 0.45 [F = 4.24 p < 0.05]). With the CDSS intervention participants documented more complete assessment of patient gastrointestinal risk from NSAIDs. Conclusion: Participants provided with a PDA-based CDSS for NSAID prescribing made fewer unsafe treatment decisions than participants without the CDSS.;2006
Objective: To explore the impact of hand-held computers on patient care by identifying: (i) how often clinical staff accessed resources on hand-held computers to inform their clinical decision making (ii) Which hand-held resources were thought to be most useful in the clinical setting (iii) the barriers to using hand-held resources to support patient care. Design: A descriptive study comparing aspects of Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) resource use in two phases between August 2002 and December 2003. There was variability in the way that resources were accessed between the two studies. Setting: University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust an acute teaching hospital and one primary care practice. Participants: A purposive sample of 14 clinical and librarian staff participated in phase one and 14 in phase two of the study. Participants consisted of consultants nurses pharmacist junior doctors clinical librarians and a general practitioner. Main outcome measures: Baseline Data Questionnaire to identify the participants' level of knowledge and use of hand-helds on entering the study. End-of-phase questionnaire with self-reported measures of use of the hand-held and PDA resources during the study. Results: All of the participants used hand-helds in their clinical setting to support evidence-based practice and education but with varying frequency. More staff reported using the hand-held to answer specific patient questions in phase two than phase one of the study. UK resources were preferred to American resources. The 'plug-in and go' method using Secure Digital (SD) cards was preferred to downloading resources from the Internet. Conclusions: Hand-held technology is emerging as an effective clinical tool to aid evidence-based practice and support the educational needs of clinical staff. The hand-held can provide a critical mass of information that is relevant quickly accessible and in a coherent format: delivering clinical information at the point of need with a resulting benefit to patient safety.;2006
One of the challenges of designing virtual humans is the definition of appropriate models of the relation between realistic emotions and the coordination of behaviors in several modalities. In this paper we present the annotation representation and modeling of multimodal visual behaviors occurring during complex emotions. We illustrate our work using a corpus of TV interviews. This corpus has been annotated at several levels of information: communicative acts emotion labels and multimodal signs. We have defined a copy-synthesis approach to drive an Embodied Conversational Agent from these different levels of information. The second part of our paper focuses on a model of complex (superposition and masking of) emotions in facial expressions of the agent. We explain how the complementary aspects of our work on corpus and computational model is used to specify complex emotional behaviors.;2006
Participants from two samples (n = 31 human resources staff n = 36 teachers) rated the extent to which they believed varying levels of a pre-defined stressor influenced positive affect negative affect and work performance. Participants then carried personal digital assistants for five working days and provided data on levels of the pre-defined stressor and on momentary negative and positive affect. For both samples momentary negative affect was more strongly associated with stressors for those participants who believed stressors caused them to feel greater negative affect. For both samples too the association between participants' momentary negative affect and average levels of stressors across the working week was moderated by beliefs concerning stressors' impact on work performance.;2006
Patient clinical data are distributed and often fragmented in heterogeneous systems and therefore the need for information integration is a key to reliable patient care. Once the patient data are orderly integrated and readily available the problems in accessing the distributed patient clinical data the well-known difficulties of adopting a mobile health information system are resolved. This paper proposes a mobile clinical information system (MobileMed) which integrates the distributed and fragmented patient data across heterogeneous sources and makes them accessible through mobile devices. The system consists of four main components: a smart interface an HL7 message server (HMS) a central clinical database (CCDB) and a web server. The smart interface and the HMS work in concert to generate HL7 messages from the existing legacy systems which essentially send the patient data in HL7 messages to the CCDB to be stored and maintained. The CCDB and the web server enable the physicians to access the integrated up-to-date patient data. By proposing the smart interface approach we provide a means for effortless implementation and deployment of such systems. Through a performance study we show that the HMS is reliable yet fast enough to be able to support efficient clinical data communication.;2006
Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices are widely available in both horizontal and vertical formats. This study investigates user preferences for the PDA format and defines an optimal screen layout for each format in terms of the relative positioning of the image and the vocabulary item. The experimental results indicate that there is no significant difference in the user preference for the PDA format. In the vertical format PDA it is found that the vocabulary term should ideally be positioned below the image. Meanwhile in the horizontal format PDA the vocabulary item should be positioned to the right of the image. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2006
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) were incorporated into the six-week Family Medicine Clerkship in 2002 to achieve two major goals: tracking students' outpatient encounters at preceptor sites and providing opportunities to use PDAs during medical visits. Each student collects information on each patient seen. Data are then retrieved and presented to students individually and as a group twice during the rotation. Each PDA also contains several clinical resources that students use during both small group didactic sessions and real clinical encounters. These results are based on data collected from 85 students who completed the clerkship over the course of one year who recorded information on demographics presenting problems procedures and type of precepting for a total of 11146 patient encounters. The cumulative results have allowed clerkship faculty and administrators to set standard expectations of individual students and preceptors with respect to numbers of patients seen and type of precepting received. This PDA project is manageable in terms of costs as well as effort on the part of both students and faculty and has numerous benefits to the clerkship one of which is the ability to provide real-time feedback to clerkship students and thus promote adult learning skills.;2006
Power has become a major concern for mobile computing systems such as laptops and handhelds on which a significant fraction of software usage is interactive instead of compute-intensive. For interactive systems an analysis shows that more than 90 percent of system energy and time is spent waiting for user input. Such idle periods provide vast opportunities for dynamic power management (DPM) and voltage scaling (DVS) techniques to reduce system energy. In this work we propose to utilize user interface information to predict user delays based on human-computer interaction history and theories from the field of psychology. We show that such a delay prediction can be combined with DPM/DVS for aggressive power optimization. We verify the effectiveness of our methodologies with usage traces collected on a personal digital assistant (PDA) and a system power model based on accurate measurements. Experiments show that using predicted user delays for DPM/DVS achieves an average of 21.9 percent system energy reduction with little sacrifice in user productivity or satisfaction.;2006
Purpose - To report on initial work carried out on a Metadata Options Appraisal undertaken for the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park in the context of plans to create and manage complex digital objects called Interpretive journeys PDA-based multimedia guides to Park tours. Design/methodology/approach - After some initial work a phased approach was adopted. In Phase I (reported here) metadata schema for managing structurally complex digital objects were researched to provide a range of appropriate options. Their characteristics were then matched against the Park's general requirements as determined through discussions with staff and an examination of relevant documentation. Findings - It was determined that the METS metadata schema met Park requirements for managing Interpretive Journeys at a general level and could be used both to inform the development of the planned Digital Asset Management System (an early priority) and to act as the main basis of a framework for determining a detailed metadata solution for the Park. Research limitations/implications - Further work is required in Phase II to determine the detailed metadata requirement for the Park. Practical implications - A useful guide to dealing with a range of management and metadata issues associated with managing complex digital objects and to managing projects where guidance on metadata requirements is needed before the objects to be described are available. Originality/value - This paper offers an introduction to the management and metadata issues raised by Interpretive journeys and digital composites of similar complexity and an indication of how METS addresses these at a general level.;2006
Purpose of review Effective communication is essential to patient safety. Although radio pagers have been the cornerstone of medical communication new devices such as cellular telephones personal digital assistants (PDAs) and laptop or tablet computers can help anesthesiologists to get information quickly and reliably. Anesthesiologists can use these devices to speak with colleagues access the medical record or help a colleague in another location without having to leave a patient's side. Recent advances in communication technology offer anesthesiologists new ways to improve patient care. Recent findings Anesthesiologists rely on a wide variety of information to make decisions including vital signs laboratory values and entries in the medical record. Devices such as PDAs and computers with wireless networking can be used to access this information. Mobile telephones can be used to get help or ask for advice and are more efficient than radio pagers. Voice over Internet protocol is a new technology that allows voice conversations to be routed over computer networks. It is widely believed that wireless devices can cause life-threatening interference with medical devices. The actual risk is very low and is offset by a significant reduction in medical errors that results from more efficient communication. Summary Using common technology like cellular telephones and wireless networks is a simple cost-effective way to improve patient care.;2006
PURPOSE Surprisingly little is known about the causes and implications of night sweats. This study was designed to clarify further the associations between night sweats and sleep-related symptoms. METHODS We undertook a cross-sectional study of consecutive adult patients seen in 10 primary care physicians' offices. Data were collected and transmitted by a personal digital assistant. Information included demographic variables height weight and blood pressure occurrence of a variety of sleep-related symptoms and occurrence and severity of night sweats day sweats and hot flashes in the past month. For women information about menstrual status was also obtained. RESULTS Thirty-four percent of the 363 patients interviewed reported night sweats one half of whom reported saturating their bedclothes. In the multivariate model night sweats were associated with daytime tiredness (OR = 1.99 95% CI 1.12-3.53) waking up with a bitter taste in the mouth (OR = 1.94 95% CI 1.19-3.18) legs jerking during sleep (OR = 1.78 95% CI 1.05-3.00) and awakening with pain in the night (OR = 1.87 95% CI 1.16-2.99). CONCLUSIONS Night sweats are associated with several sleep symptoms. Both night sweats and sleep disturbances are commonly experienced by adult primary care patients. When their patients report night sweats clinicians should consider asking about sleep quality and sleep-related symptoms.;2006
Purpose. Innovations in information technology application of personalized tailored feedback strategies for improving dietary adherence. We developed and tested a real-time diet-monitoring and feedback. system using hand-held computers. The goals were to increase diet self-monitoring reduce the burden of monitoring food intake and increase adherence to dietary goals within a clinical trial. Methods. Participants were 33 women. in the Diet. Modification arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). After using focus groups to determine system features women used the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)-based system for 1 month and received immediate and weekly tailored feedback. The process and outcomes were evaluated using real-time food records collected through the PDAs surveys and self-reported food frequency questionnaires. Results. Participants significantly increased self-monitoring improved their attitudes toward self-monitoring and met their dietary goals more often. Reported total fat intake and percent energy from fat decreased significantly. There was a modest decrease in mean caloric intake.. Discussion. The pilot study findings support the largely untapped potential of handheld computers for improving diet monitoring and diet adherence particularly within a clinical trial.;2006
Purpose: The in-training evaluation and final in-training evaluation are the mainstay format for evaluation summaries in Canadian residency training programs. This study investigates the feasibility of a clinical work sampling (CWS) approach to evaluation in radiology residency with the aid of personal hand-held computing devices Methods: This study was conducted over a 1-year period with 14 radiology residents spanning 4 postgraduate years. Residents were provided with a hand-held device to enter evaluation data with entries assessing 9 categories of resident performance. Results from the CWS entries were compared with standard in-training evaluations completed at the end of the residents' rotations as well as with an established annual objective evaluation tool. Results: The overall reliability of the CWS approach according to the observed 7 forms per resident was 0.62 suggesting that a minimum of 20 forms would be required to achieve a reliability of 0.80. For the in-training evaluation report (ITER) internal consistency was 0.98 reflecting very high correlations between categories and indicating that the individual categories are not discriminating. Correlation across rotations was 0.36 which is low for summative evaluation. Correlation between the 2 measures was 0.47 (P = 0.09) neither measure was correlated with the American College of Radiology evaluation. Conclusion: The CWS strategy is feasible for adaptation to radiology residency although compliance with voluntary entries was less than expected. It is not clear whether this reflects the additional burden of using the hand-held device the fact that entries were voluntary rather than mandatory or the many demands on both residents and evaluators. The added potential of this evaluation format includes the opportunity to discuss performance at the time of data entry rather than resorting to the usual end-of-rotation evaluation. Nevertheless the study has shown that the ITER remains only of marginal value for summative evaluation the addition of the CWS would require at least 20 forms for acceptable reliability and might not justify the additional cost and complexity.;2006
Purpose: To determine the speed accuracy ease of use and user satisfaction of various electronic data entry platforms for use in the collection of mammography clinical trials data. Method and materials: Four electronic data entry platforms were tested: standalone personal digital assistant (PDA) Tablet PC digitizer Tablet/PDA Hybrid (DTP Hybrid) and digital pen (d-pen). Standard paper data entry was used as control. Each of five radiologist readers was assigned to enter interpretations for 20 screening mammograms using three out of the five data entry methods. Assistants recorded both start and stop data entry times of the radiologists and the number of help requests made. Data were checked for handwriting recognition accuracy for the d-pen platform using handwriting verification software. A user satisfaction survey was administered at the end of each platform reading session. Results: Tablet PC and d-pen were statistically equivalent to conventional pen and paper in initial data entry speed. Average verification time for d-pen was significantly less than secondary electronic data entry of paper forms (p-value < 0.001). The number of errors in handwriting recognition for d-pen was less than secondary electronic data entry of the paper forms data. Users were most satisfied with Tablet PC d-pen and conventional pen and paper for data entry. Conclusions: Tablet PC and d-pen are equally fast and easy-to-use data entry methods that are well tolerated by radiologist users. Handwriting recognition review and correction for the d-pen is significantly faster and more accurate than secondary manual keyboard and mouse data entry. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Recent work in argumentation theory (Walton and Krabbe 1995 Walton 2005) and artificial intelligence (Bench-Capon 1992 2003 Cawsey 1992 McBurney and Parsons 2002 Bench-Capon and Prakken 2005) uses types of dialogue as contexts of argument use. This paper provides an analysis of a special type called examination dialogue in which one party questions another party sometimes critically or even antagonistically to try to find out what that party knows about something. This type of dialogue is most prominent in law and in both legal and non-legal arguments based on expert opinion. It is also central to dialogue systems for questioning and answering in expert systems in artificial intelligence. Examples studied are: (1) exegetical analyses and criticisms of religious and philosophical texts and (2) legal examinations and cross-examinations conducted in a trial setting.

Researchers are generally trained to administer informed consent by studying approved guidelines but still can fail to satisfactorily answer questions from potential participants. An application using a virtual character allowed novice participants to practice administering informed consent. This character was designed to behave as a potential participant for a study and asked many of the questions research participants typically ask such as queries about the study itself the sponsor timing selection procedures confidentiality voluntariness benefits and risks and contact information. The user responded to the character's queries as if speaking with a true potential research participant. The application was effective even after only brief usage. In a laboratory experiment novice participants who practiced with the virtual character were later more effective in conducting informed consent interviews with a human interviewee than those who were trained only with written materials. Thus simulated learning-by-doing improved informed consent skills. Implications for related health dialog applications are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2006
Security is becoming an everyday concern for a wide range of electronic systems that manipulate communicate and store sensitive data. An important and emerging category of such electronic systems are battery-powered mobile appliances such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones which are severely constrained in the resources they possess namely processor battery and memory. This work focuses on one important constraint of such devices - battery life - and examines how it is impacted by the use of various security mechanisms. In this paper we first present a comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of a wide range of cryptographic algorithms that form the building blocks of security mechanisms such as security protocols. We then study the energy consumption requirements of the most popular transport-layer security protocol: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). We investigate the impact of various parameters at the protocol level ( such as cipher suites authentication mechanisms and transaction sizes etc.) and the cryptographic algorithm level ( cipher modes strength) on the overall energy consumption for secure data transactions. To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of SSL. For our studies we have developed a measurement-based experimental testbed that consists of an iPAQ PDA connected to a wireless local area network (LAN) and running Linux a PC-based data acquisition system for real-time current measurement the OpenSSL implementation of the SSL protocol and parameterizable SSL client and server test programs. Based on our results we also discuss various opportunities for realizing energy-efficient implementations of security protocols. We believe such investigations to be an important first step toward addressing the challenges of energy-efficient security for battery-constrained systems.;2006
Sentence similarity measures play an increasingly important role in text-related research and applications in areas such as text mining Web page retrieval and dialogue systems. Existing methods for computing sentence similarity have been adopted from approaches used for long text documents. These methods process sentences in a very high-dimensional space and are consequently inefficient require human input and are not adaptable to some application domains. This paper focuses directly on computing the similarity between very short texts of sentence length. It presents an algorithm that takes account of semantic information and word order information implied in the sentences. The semantic similarity of two sentences is calculated using information from a structured lexical database and from corpus statistics. The use of a lexical database enables our method to model human common sense knowledge and the incorporation of corpus statistics allows our method to be adaptable to different domains. The proposed method can be used in a variety of applications that involve text knowledge representation and discovery. Experiments on two sets of selected sentence pairs demonstrate that the proposed method provides a similarity measure that shows a significant correlation to human intuition.;2006
Speech interface may be the first choice as a user interface for robots or hand-held devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and portable multimedia players (PMPs). However those devices have the limitation of the memory space and the computation power. The hidden Markov model (HMM)-based speech synthesis is presently considered to be suitable for the embedded systems. In this paper our HMM-based Korean speech synthesis system is described. Statistical HMM models for Korean speech units are trained with the hand-labeled speech database including the contextual information about phoneme word phrase and multilevel break strength. Mel-cepstrum and line spectrum pair (LSP) are compared for the spectrum modeling and two-band excitation based on the harmonic plus noise speech model is utilized for the mixed excitation source. The developed small-size Korean synthesis system produced considerably high quality speech with a fairly good prosody.;2006
Spoken dialogue systems can be considered knowledge-based systems designed to interact with users using speech in order to provide information or carry out simple tasks. Current systems are restricted to well-known domains that provide knowledge about the words and sentences the users will likely utter. Basically. these systems rely oil ail input inter-face comprised of speech recogniser and semantic analyser. a dialogue manager and an output interface comprised of response generator and speech synthesiser. As an attempt to enhance the performance (if the input interface this paper proposes a technique based on a new type of speech recogniser comprised of two modules. The first one is a standard speech recogniser that receives the sentence uttered by the user and generates a graph of words. The second module analyses the graph and produces the recognised sentence using the context knowledge provided by the current prompt of the system. We evaluated the performance of two input interfaces working in a previously developed dialogue system: the original interface of the system and a new one that features the proposed technique. The experimental results show that when the sentences uttered by the users are out-of-context analysed by the new interface the word accuracy and sentence understanding rates increase by 93.71 and 77.42% absolute respectively. regarding the original interface. The price to pay for this clear enhancement is a little reduction in the scores when the new interface analyses sentences in-context. as they decrease by 2.05 and 3.41% absolute respectively. in comparison with the original interface. Given that in real dialogues sentences may be out-of-context analysed. specially when they are uttered by inexperienced users. the technique can be very useful to enhance the system performance.

Spoken language understanding (SLU) aims at extracting meaning from natural language speech. Over the past decade a variety of practical goal-oriented spoken dialog systems have been built for limited domains. SLU in these systems ranges from understanding predetermined phrases through fixed grammars extracting some predefined named entities extracting users' intents for call classification to combinations of users' intents and named entities. In this paper we present the SLU system of VoiceTone((R)) (a service provided by AT&T where AT&T develops deploys and hosts spoken dialog applications for enterprise customers). The SLU system includes extracting both intents and the named entities from the users' utterances. For intent determination we use statistical classifiers trained from labeled data and for named entity extraction we use rule-based fixed grammars. The focus of our work is to exploit data and to use machine learning techniques to create scalable SLU systems which can be quickly deployed for new domains with minimal human intervention. These objectives are achieved by 1) using the predicate-argument representation of semantic content of an utterance 2) extending statistical classifiers to seamlessly integrate hand crafted classification rules with the rules learned from data and 3) developing an active learning framework to minimize the human labeling effort for quickly building the classifier models and adapting them to changes. We present an evaluation of this system using two deployed applications of VoiceTone((R)).;2006
Students rated 16 tutorial statements on negative politeness (i.e. how much the tutor allows me freedom to make my own decisions) and positive politeness (i.e. how much the tutor was working with me). Consistent with an adaptation of Brown and Levinson's [1987. Politeness: Some Universals in Language Use. Cambridge University Press New York] politeness theory (a) students rated direct commands and commands attributed to machines as lowest in negative and positive politeness (b) students rated guarded suggestions and guarded questions as highest in negative politeness and guarded suggestions and statements expressing a common goal as highest in positive politeness and (c) the pattern of results was stronger for students with low rather than high computing experience. Results have implications for designing polite conversational agents in educational software. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2006
The adoption of information technology in patient care has become a trend in healthcare organizations. The impact of this technology on end users has been widely studied but little attention has been given to its influence from a management perspective. The purpose of this study was to explore nurse managers' perceived experiences in implementing a policy to adopt personal digital assistant technology. A descriptive exploratory qualitative approach (one-on-one in-depth interviews) was used to collect data from 16 nurse managers of inpatient units at a medical center in Taiwan Interview data were analyzed according to Miles and Huberman's data reduction data display and conclusion verification process. The results revealed that nurse managers experienced the limitations of technology training issues doctors' obstructive influence role conflict and improvement of future personal digital assistant use. These results can be used to improve strategic organizational planning and in-service training programs to implement information systems.;2006
The aim of this paper is to present a certain kind of argumentation against the idea of the Turing test (we call it CCSC-Complete Conversation System Claim) and to discuss the issue of its first formulation. Ned Block with his idea of Aunt Bubbles argument is thought of as a founding father of CCSC but we present the results of our bibliographical researches which clearly show that the first formulation of CCSC should be ascribed to Polish writer and philosopher Stanislaw Lem.;2006
The Cute-1.7 was launched successfully in February 2006 as a piggyback satellite of the Astro-F mission. The Cute-1.7 dimensions are 10 x 10 x 20 cm(3) box with a total mass of 3.6kg. It is the second pico-satellite to have been developed completely by students of the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech.) after the successful launch of the CUTE-I in June 2003. The goals of the Cute-1.7 mission are two-fold: (1) to validate high-performance commercially available products for the first time in space. We particularly use personal digital assistants (PDAs) as a main computer in orbit (2) to demonstrate new potential uses for small satellites in various space studies as proposed by the satellite-core concept. For the Cute-1.7 mission we will carry avalanche photo diodes (APDs) as a high-count particle monitor in low-Earth orbit. Here we present details of various ground tests and pre-flight performance of the Cute-1.7 immediately before the launch. Results of the Cute-1.7 mission will provide quick feedback for space applications of APDs in Japan's future X-ray astronomy mission NeXT. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2006
The design of Spoken Dialog Systems cannot be considered as the simple combination of speech processing technologies. Indeed speech-based interface design has been an expert job for a long time. It necessitates good skills in speech technologies and low-level programming. Moreover rapid development and reusability of previously designed systems remains uneasy. This makes optimality and objective evaluation of design very difficult. The design process is therefore a cyclic process composed of prototype releases user satisfaction surveys bug reports and refinements. It is well known that human intervention for testing is time-consuming and above all very expensive. This is one of the reasons for the recent interest in dialog simulation for evaluation as well as for design automation and optimization. In this paper we expose a probabilistic framework for a realistic simulation of spoken dialogs in which the major components of a dialog system are modeled and parameterized thanks to independent data or expert knowledge. Especially an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system model and a User Model (UM) have been developed. The ASR model based on articulatory similarities in language models provides task-adaptive performance prediction and Confidence Level (CL) distribution estimation. The user model relies on the Bayesian Networks (BN) paradigm and is used both or user behavior modeling and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modeling. The complete simulation framework has been used to train a reinforcement-learning agent on two different tasks. These experiments helped to point out several potentially problematic dialog scenarios.;2006
The effectiveness of interaction with mobile devices can be impacted by handedness however support for handedness in the interface is rarely provided. The goal of this article is to demonstrate that handedness is a significant interface consideration. that should not be overlooked. Four studies were conducted to explore left-handed user interaction with right- or left-aligned scrollbars on personal digital assistants. Analysis of the data shows that left-handed users are able to select targets significantly faster using a left-aligned scrollbar when compared to a right-aligned scrollbar. User feedback also indicated that a left-aligned scrollbar was preferred by left-handed users and provided more natural interaction.;2006
The electronic environment of the 21st century includes a wide array of smart phones wireless internet devices personal digital assistants and iPods as well as more sophisticated imaging and medical therapy technology. The end result is a growing potential for dangerous interactions between devices that produce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and implanted cardiac devices.;2006
The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is an ecologically valid time-sampling of self-reports developed to study the dynamic process of person-environment interactions. ESM with digital wristwatch and booklets (paper-based ESM ESMp) has been used extensively to study schizophrenia. The present study is designed to test the feasibility and validity of using Computerized ESM (ESMc) among individuals with schizophrenia. ESMc is advantageous in allowing for recording of precise time-stamps of responses. We used PDAs ('' Personal Digital Assistant '' Palm handheld computers) to collect data on momentary psychotic symptoms mood and thoughts over a one day period among 10 hospitalized schizophrenia patients and 10 healthy controls. ESMc was equally acceptable to both groups with similar ratings of comfort carrying the PDAs and operating them interference with daily activities as well as response rates. The schizophrenia patients reported significantly higher ratings of auditory and visual hallucinations suspiciousness sense of unreality lack of thought control fear of losing control difficulty expressing thoughts as well as depression/sadness loneliness and less cheerfulness. Significant inverse relationships were found among both groups between ratings of feeling cheerful and being stressed irritated and sad/depressed. Among the schizophrenia subjects the correlation between ratings of suspiciousness on ESMc and Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) approached significance as well as the link between suspiciousness and stress. Our results support the feasibility and validity of using ESMc for assessment of momentary psychotic symptoms mood and experiences among individuals with schizophrenia. The authors discuss the potential applications of combining ESMc with ambulatory physiological measures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2006
The Hidden Vector State (HVS) Model is an extension of the basic discrete Markov model in which context is encoded as a stack-oriented state vector. State transitions are factored into a stack shift operation similar to those of a push-down automaton followed by the push of a new preterminal category label. When used as a semantic parser the model can capture hierarchical structure without the use of treebank data for training and it can be trained automatically using expectation-maximization (EM) from only-lightly annotated training data. When deployed in a system the model can be continually refined as more data becomes available. In this paper the practical application of the model in a spoken language understanding system (SLU) is described. Through a sequence of experiments the issues of robustness to noise and portability to similar and extended domains are investigated. The end-to-end performance obtained from experiments in the ATIS domain show that the system is comparable to existing SLU systems which rely on either hand-crafted semantic grammar rules or statistical models trained on fully annotated training corpora. Experiments using data which have been artificially corrupted with varying levels of additive noise show that the HVS-based parser is relatively robust and experiments using data sets from other domains indicate that the overall framework allows adaptation to related domains and scaling to cover enlarged domains. In summary it is argued that constrained statistical parsers such as the HVS model allow robust spoken dialogue systems to be built at relatively low cost and which can be automatically adapted as new data is acquired both to improve performance and extend coverage.

The incidence of plagiarism intentional or unintentional in the professional nursing arena has increased in recent years as has the occurrence of plagiarism among nursing students. Strategies for cheating have become very sophisticated with the use of aids such as personal digital assistants camera phones and instant messaging. Cheating on written papers has also increased. The Internet provides students with ready-made research and academic papers and access to Web sites on a plethora of topics. In this article I describe my experience with plagiarism of ethics papers during students' final semester before graduation. How I discovered the plagiarized work and used the A-B-CD-E ethical decision-making model in determining the student consequences for the event are presented.;2006
The naming task one of the most important tasks for screening essential language function is widely used in awake surgery. We employed personal digital assistants (PDA) for the display of objects in three patients performing the naming task during awake surgery for gliomas adjacent to the language area in the left hemisphere. The compact light-weight self-illuminated instrument can easily be held close to the patient's face. None had difficulty seeing the screen despite the presence of the surgical drape around the face. The examiner could easily change the displayed objects with a click. However the PDA screen is too small for use in auditory comprehension tasks such as the Token Test.;2006
The objective was to determine if a personal digital assistant (PDA) diabetes management system improves processes and outcomes of diabetes care in a primary care setting. Outcomes and processes of care were compared between and within 2 groups of patients with type H diabetes. The intervention group of 58 patients was managed for 16 months with the aid of a PDA diabetes management system. The control group of 115 patients from the same clinic was managed by 1 of 5 physicians not using the diabetes management system. PDA use improved 2 processes of care: annual number of foot and eye examinations (P < .0001 for both). PDA use did not have significant effect on outcomes of care. This PDA disease management system can improve providers' ability to meet practice guidelines for processes of care. However like other recent studies there was no improvement in outcomes of diabetes care.;2006
The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the availability and usage of drug information (DI) resources in Alabama pharmacy facilities licensed by the Alabama State Board of Pharmacy. A survey consisting of questions regarding accessible DI resources and their usage was mailed to 1430 pharmacy facilities of which 604 (42%) were returned. The survey also consisted of other questions concerning personal data/digital assistant (PDA) usage computer resources types of DI questions answered and other DI-related questions. Drug Facts and Comparisons was the most available and used resource for all pharmacy types the PDR (Physician's Desk Reference) and OTC (over the-counter) references were second and third respectively. PDA usage was relatively low (19.5%) among all pharmacies but hospital/mental health pharmacies had the highest usage (32.4%). The primary drug questions answered by pharmacists for all pharmacy types concerned drug interaction adverse reactions and OTC questions.;2006
The purpose of this study was to determine residents' perception of the utility of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and their influence on clinical practice at two teaching hospitals one of which subsidized resident purchase of a PDA. A total of 21 residents in the unsubsidized group (32%) and 24 residents in the subsidized group (96%) owned a PDA. Medical residents who were provided with PDAs perceived them to be less useful than residents who were not provided with them. Palm owners in both groups responded that they used these devices to organize their record keeping and the most frequently used programs were pharmacopoeias medical reference and clinical calculators. Residents quickly adapted PDA to clinical care and further research is needed to assess their impact on resident education and patient outcomes.;2006
The purpose of this study was to evaluate a portable tool for use by first responders in documenting triage of victims in a mass casualty incident (MCI) more effectively. The tool presented in this study allows first responders to gather patients vital signs injuries and triage status in a prompt and accurate way and enables first responders to wirelessly communicate vital health information throughout the entire care continuum. The architecture infrastructure for the portable device is called Triage and Casualty Informatics Technology (TACIT) and can expedite triage transport and treatment procedures within an MCI. TACIT was developed by integrating handheld devices wireless networks global positioning system (GPS) digital cameras and bar code scanners with customized triage software. Two MCI initial field trials verified that the TACIT software battery life data accuracy and wireless transmission met the emergency response system requirements. Initial field trials also demonstrated robustness of operation reduced triage collection time and improved collection accuracy. The TACIT system could work as an efficient prehospital response tool and platform.;2006
The purpose of this study was to identify trends in the utilization and acceptance of handheld computers (personal digital assistants) among medical students during preclinical and clinical training. We surveyed 366 medical students and collected information on computer expertise current handheld computer use predicted future use and user acceptance. Handheld computers were primarily used for personal applications by students during their preclinical training and as drug references and clinical calculators during their clinical training. In the future all participants predicted they would use handheld computers at significantly higher rates and on a broader range of medical applications. The adoption of handheld computing was independent of user satisfaction. Those with more clinical experience were less satisfied with handheld computers suggesting that the expectations of the more experienced users were not met. The lack of institutional support was seen as. a key limitation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2006
The use of the electronic spreadsheet as a modeling and simulation tool in the engineering fields is increasingly popular with an increasing number of tertiary institutions including spreadsheet as a teaching resource in the core curriculum of these fields. Concurrently the dramatic improvement in Internet speed allows certain course material to be delivered online facilitating electronic-learning (E-learning). E-learning frees students from the restriction of time although they are still largely constrained by space to the nearest wired computer. However the boundary of computing has expanded with the advance in wireless communication now numerous handheld mobile devices (e.g. personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cellular phones) are available that will allow computing to be accomplished on the move. In turn this wireless trend has contributed to move E-learning toward mobile learning (M-learning). Based on the previously mentioned trends this paper presents the development implementation and evaluation of a mobile spreadsheet-based Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control simulation system that aims to enhance the learning of the student in the field of control engineering. The system has been used in an industrial control system course at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Singapore. The mobile spreadsheet system developed is able to work with most handheld mobile devices including the cellular phone. The methods and difficulties (e.g. limited storage space and small screen display of a cellular phone) involved in the development of the system will be duly discussed. Feedback from students that is used to assess the usefulness of the system will be released to share the benefits of such an M-learning system.;2006
The way we see the objects around us determines speech and gestures we use to refer to them. The gestures we produce structure our visual perception. The words we use have an influence on the way we see. In this manner visual perception language and gesture present multiple interactions between each other. The problem is global and has to be tackled as a whole in order to understand the complexity of reference phenomena and to deduce a formal model. This model may be useful for any kind of human-machine dialogue system that focuses on deep comprehension. We show how a referring act takes place in a contextual subset of objects. This subset is called 'reference domain' and is implicit. It can be deduced from a lot of clues. Among these clues are those which come from the visual context and those which come from the multimodal utterance. We present the 'multimodal reference domain' model that takes these clues into account and that can be exploited in a multimodal dialogue system when interpreting. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

There has been a great deal of interest over the past 20 years in developing metrics and frameworks for evaluating and comparing the performance of spoken-language dialogue systems. One of the results of this interest is a potential general methodology known as the PARADISE framework. This squib highlights some important issues concerning the application of PARADISE that have up to now not been sufficiently emphasized or have even been neglected by the dialogue-system community. These include considerations regarding the selection of appropriate regression parameters normalization effects on the accuracy of the prediction the influence of speech-recognition errors on the performance function and the selection of an appropriate user-satisfaction measure. In addition it gives the results Of an evaluation of data from two Wizard-of-Oz experiments. These evaluations include different dependent variables and examination of individual user-satisfaction measures.;2006
This article evaluates the use of handheld computers for systematic observation of the social and physical environments. Handheld computers also known as personal digital assistants (PDAs) make the advantages of computer-assisted data collection (CADC) more accessible to field-based researchers. In particular CADC with handheld computers may improve data quality reduce turnaround time and enhance research capacity for community-academic partnerships. Here we describe our experiences using handheld computers for the Healthy Environments Partnership's Neighborhood Observational Checklist an instrument for systematic observation of the social and physical environments. We discuss hardware and software considerations observer training and implementation strategies and observer attitudes toward using handhelds in the field. We conclude that handheld computers are a feasible alternative to pen-and-paper forms and we identify ways that future researchers can maximize the advantages of CADC with handheld computers to advance our understanding of how neighborhood context relates to individual-level outcomes.;2006
This article focuses on the analysis and prediction of corrections defined as turns where a user tries to correct a prior error made by a spoken dialogue system. We describe our labeling procedure of various corrections types and statistical analyses of their features in a corpus collected from a train information spoken dialogue system. We then present results of machine-learning experiments designed to identify user corrections of speech recognition errors. We investigate the predictive power of features automatically computable from the prosody of the turn the speech recognition process experimental conditions and the dialogue history. Our best-performing features reduce classification error from baselines of 25.70-28.99% to 15.72%.;2006
This article investigates a novel multi-stage approach for spoken language understanding (SLU) with an application to a pioneering Thai spoken dialogue system in a hotel reservation domain. Given an input word string the system determines a goal and concept-values by three-stage processing concept extraction goal identification and concept-value recognition. The concept extraction utilizes weighted finite state transducers (WFST) to extract concepts from the word string. Given the extracted concepts a goal of the utterance is identified using a pattern classifier. Within a particular goal the necessary concept-values are recognized from the WFST outputs produced in the concept extraction stage. A new logical N-gram model which strategically combines the conventional N-gram parser with a regular grammar is evaluated for concept extraction and concept-value recognition. Several classifiers are optimized and compared for goal identification. An advantage of the proposed SLU model is that it can be trained by a partially annotated corpus where only the relevant keywords and the goal of each training utterance are required. Although the proposed model is evaluated only on the Thai hotel reservation system the SLU itself is general and it is expected to be applicable for other languages once training data is available.

This paper addresses the manual and automatic labelling from spontaneous speech of a particular type of user affect that we call the cognitive state in a tutorial dialogue system with students of primary and early middle school ages. Our definition of the cognitive state is based on analysis of children's spontaneous speech which is acquired during Wizard-of-Oz simulations of an intelligent math and physics tutor. The cognitive states of children are categorized into three classes: confidence puzzlement and hesitation. The manual labelling of cognitive states had an inter-transcriber agreement of kappa score 0.93. The automatic cognitive state labels are generated by classifying prosodic features text features and spectral features. Text features are generated from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system features include indicator functions of keyword classes and part-of-speech sequences. Spectral features are created based on acoustic likelihood scores of a cognitive state-dependent ASR system in which phoneme models are adapted to utterances labelled for a particular cognitive state. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on both manually and automatically transcribed speech and the test yielded very high correctness: 96.6% for manually transcribed speech and 95.7% for automatically recognized speech. Our study shows that the proposed spectral features greatly outperformed the other types of features in the cognitive state classification experiments. Our study also shows that the spectral and prosodic features derived directly from speech signals were very robust to speech recognition errors much more than the lexical and part-of-speech based features.

This paper addresses the problem posed by the current split between the two opposed hypotheses in the growing literature on the fallacy of begging the question the epistemic hypothesis based on knowledge and belief and the dialectical one based on formal dialogue systems. In the first section the nature of split is explained and it is shown how each hypothesis has developed. To get the beginning reader up to speed in the literature a number of key problematic examples are analyzed illustrating how both approaches can be applied. Useful tools are brought to bear on them including the automated argument diagramming system Araucaria and profiles of dialogue used to represent circular argumentation in a dialogue tableau format. These tools are used to both to model circular reasoning and to provide the contextual evidence needed to properly determine whether the circular reasoning in a given case is better judged fallacious or not. A number of technical problems that have impeded the development of both hypotheses are studied. One central problem is the distinction between argument and explanation. It is concluded that the best way to move forward and solve these problems is to reformulate the two hypotheses in such a way that they might be able to co-exist. On this basis a unified methodology is proposed that allows each hypothesis to move forward as a legitimate avenue for research using the same tools.;2006
This paper computationalizes two linguistic concepts contrast and focus for the extraction of pragmatic and semantic salience from spontaneous speech. Contrast and focus have been widely investigated in modern linguistics as categories that link intonation and information/discourse structure. This paper demonstrates the automatic tagging of contrast and focus for the purpose of robust spontaneous speech understanding in a tutorial dialogue system. In particular we propose two new transcription tasks and demonstrate automatic replication of human labels in both tasks. First we define focus kernel to represent those words that contain novel information neither presupposed by the interlocutor nor contained in the precedent words of the utterance. We propose detecting the focus kernel based on a word dissimilarity measure part-of-speech tagging and prosodic measurements including duration pitch energy and our proposed spectral balance cepstral coefficients. In order to measure the word dissimilarity we test a linear combination of ontological and statistical dissimilarity measures previously published in the computational linguistics literature. Second we propose identifying symmetric contrast which consists of a set of words that are parallel or symmetric in linguistic structure but distinct or contrastive in meaning. The symmetric contrast identification is performed in a way similar to the focus kernel detection. The effectiveness of the proposed extraction of symmetric contrast and focus kernel has been tested on a Wizard-of-Oz corpus collected in the tutoring dialogue scenario. The corpus consists of 630 non-single word/phrase utterances containing approximately 5700 words and 48 minutes of speech. The tests used speech waveforms together with manual orthographic transcriptions and yielded an accuracy of 83.8% for focus kernel detection and 92.8% for symmetric contrast detection. Our tests also demonstrated that the spectral balance cepstral coefficients the semantic dissimilarity measure and part-of-speech played important roles in the symmetric contrast and focus kernel detections.

This paper describes an experiment on the effects of learning mode of interaction (written vs. spoken) and transfer mode on user performance and discourse organization during interaction with a natural language dialogue System. Forty-eight participants took part in a series of 12 dialogues with an information retrieval system presented either in the written or the spoken mode during the first six dialogues. The next six dialogues were then presented either in the same interaction mode or in another mode. The analysis of the results showed that performance (time number of effective turns) improved throughout the dialogues whatever the mode of interaction. Nevertheless performance was higher in the written mode. Moreover mode-specific characteristics were observed. These consisted in greater use of subject pronouns and articles in the spoken mode. Similarly in the spoken mode the users found it easier to reuse the formulations presented in the system speech than in the written mode. Furthermore the analysis also revealed a positive transfer effect on performance and discourse organization when the individuals first interacted in the spoken mode and then in the written mode. Both positive and negative transfer effects were observed when the individuals interacted first in the written mode followed by the spoken mode. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of direct and indirect consequences of modality effects on natural language dialogue interaction. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes four experiments which have been carried out to evaluate the speech output component of the INSPIRE spoken dialogue system providing speech control for different devices located in a smart home environment. The aim is to quantify the impact of different factors oil the quality of the system when addressed either in the home or from a remote location (office car). Factors analyzed ill the experiments include the characteristics of the machine agent during the interaction (voice personality) the physical characteristics of the usage environment (acoustic user interface background noise electrical transmission path) as well as task-related characteristics (listening-only vs. interaction Situation parallel tasks). The results show a significant impact of agent and environmental factors but not of task factors. Potential reasons for this finding are discussed. They serve as a basis for design decisions which have been taken for the final system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2006
This paper describes the process of review design and delivery of a course in modern embedded systems an international collaborative teaching project involving the University of New South Wales (Australia) Manchester University and Imperial College London University (United Kingdom).

Such collaborations are important in both reducing development costs in developing up-to-date and increasingly sophisticated courses and in addressing pedagogical issues that are common between computer and electrical engineering programs in all academic institutions. To assist students' learning experience the course is supported with purpose built state-of-the-art programmable hardware and software development platforms carefully planned laboratory experiments lecture notes weekly online quizzes tutorials and a companion CD-ROM as a learning tool. Since the introduction of this complete package students' satisfaction assessment results and skills obtained through evaluation and assessment methods have improved markedly.;2006
This paper describes the results of a Web survey on the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) by physicians across Canada involved with the delivery of palliative medicine in different settings. Seventy-two physicians responded to the survey from April to July 2005. The survey revealed 58.3% of respondents currently use PDAs on a daily basis mostly to organize their practice and to look up medical references. Some use their PDAs to store patient information and to access a central electronic patient record (EPR). In terms of potential PDA use in palliative medicine six thematic areas are suggested: medical references EPR staying connected personal productivity clinical research and issues/concerns. For implications healthcare organizations should consider mobile technology as part of their information systems strategy. The feasibility of a portable EPR for palliative medicine should be explored and an information-based approach can help advance palliative medicine research in Canada.;2006

This paper presents a new technique to enhance the performance of the input interface of spoken dialogue systems based on a procedure that combines during speech recognition the advantages of using prompt-dependent language models with those of using a language model independent of the prompts generated by the dialogue system. The technique proposes to create a new speech recognizer termed contextual speech recognizer that uses a prompt-independent language model to allow recognizing any kind of sentence permitted in the application domain and at the same time uses contextual information (in the form of prompt-dependent language models) to take into account that some sentences are more likely to be uttered than others at a particular moment of the dialogue. The experiments show the technique allows enhancing clearly the performance of the input interface of a previously developed dialogue system based exclusively on prompt-dependent language models. But most important in comparison with a standard speech recognizer that uses just one prompt-independent language model without contextual information the proposed recognizer allows increasing the word accuracy and sentence understanding rates by 4.09% and 4.19% absolute respectively. These scores are slightly better than those obtained using linear interpolation of the prompt-independent and prompt-dependent language models used in the experiments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents an efficient buffer management scheme to support heterogeneous resolution display in home VOD services. The proposed scheme provides different quality services for various home appliances such as digital TV home theater and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Specifically the proposed scheme exploits the reference popularity of video objects as well as the interarrival time between two consecutive requests on the same object. The scheme also considers the different streaming rate of video objects to provide QoS adaptive VOD service for heterogeneous appliances. Experiments with real world VOD traces show that the proposed scheme improves the performance of home VOD systems significantly.(1);2006
This paper presents some research undertaken as part of the EU-funded HOMEY project into the application of intelligent dialogue systems to healthcare systems. The work presented here concentrates on the ways in which knowledge of underlying task structure (e.g. a medical guideline) can be combined with ontological knowledge (e.g. medical semantic dictionaries) to provide a basis for the automatic generation of flexible and re-configurable dialogue. This approach is next evaluated via a specific application that provides decision support to general practitioners to help determine whether or not a patient should be referred to a cancer specialist. The competence of the resulting dialogue application its speech recognition performance and dialogue performance are all evaluated to determine the applicability of this approach.

This paper proposes a dialogue strategy for clarifying and constraining queries to document retrieval systems with speech input interfaces. It is indispensable for spoken dialogue systems to interpret user's intention robustly in the presence of speech recognition errors and extraneous expressions characteristic of spontaneous speech. In speech input moreover users' queries tend to be vague and they may need to be clarified through dialogue in order to extract sufficient information to get meaningful retrieval results. In conventional database query tasks it is easy to cope with these problems by extracting and confirming keywords based on semantic slots. However it is not straightforward to apply such a methodology to general document retrieval tasks. In this paper we first introduce two statistical measures for identifying critical portions to be confirmed. The relevance score (RS) represents the matching degree with the document set. The significance score (SS) detects portions that affect retrieval results. With these measures the system can generate confirmations to handle speech recognition errors prior to and after the retrieval respectively. Then we propose a dialogue strategy for generating clarifications to narrow down the retrieved items especially when many documents are matched because of a vague input query. The optimal clarification question is dynamically selected based on information gain (IG) - the reduction in the number of matched items. A set of possible clarification questions is prepared using various knowledge sources. As a bottom-up knowledge source we extract a list of words that can take a number of objects and potentially causes ambiguity using a dependency structure analysis of the document texts. This is complemented by top-down knowledge sources of metadata and hand-crafted questions. Our dialogue strategy is implemented and evaluated against a software support knowledge base of 40 K entries. We demonstrate that our strategy significantly improves the success rate of retrieval.

This paper proposes a new technique to test the performance of spoken dialogue systems by artificially simulating the behaviour of three types of user (very cooperative cooperative and not very cooperative) interacting with a system by means of spoken dialogues. Experiments using the technique were carried out to test the performance of a previously developed dialogue system designed for the fast-food domain and working with two kinds of language model for automatic speech recognition: one based on 17 prompt-dependent language models and the other based on one prompt-independent language model. The use of the simulated user enables the identification of problems relating to the speech recognition spoken language understanding and dialogue management components of the system. In particular in these experiments problems were encountered with the recognition and understanding of postal codes and addresses and with the lengthy sequences of repetitive confirmation turns required to correct these errors. By employing a simulated user in a range of different experimental conditions sufficient data can be generated to support a systematic analysis of potential problems and to enable fine-grained tuning of the system.;2006
This research aims to use personal digital assistant (PDA) to monitor falls of stroke patients and the elderly. With the combination of micro sensor digital data access application and wireless transmission this research has developed this PDA based wearable system for real-time monitoring of human falls. The sensor of unique monitoring system equipped with real-time automatic responsive function can be loaded in user's clothing and wearable. When the user falls down the system will detect the position of falls and automatically sends the warning signal out. In the near end detected signals are sent to PDA for analysis via wireless Bluetooth (BT) technology and at the same time signals for help stored in the speech database inside PDA are also initiated to inform the nearby personnel of the emergency. The user is able to send user's information to the computer in the far end monitoring station and when the possible fall occurs the system automatically informs designated subject via MSM for proper crisis management. Through this system for real-time monitoring of human falls home helpers and families are able to save some time and energy for inspection and have a good command of safety information of users.;2006
This study proposes a submenu window as a navigation aid for mobile Internet access on a cellular phone. The submenu window presents child-level menu items along with their upper-level menu. The effectiveness of the submenu window was investigated in an experiment. The factors manipulated in the experiment include the types of submenu window age of participants and timing of presenting the submenu. Task completion time number of button clicks and subjective preference were measured while the participants were performing target search tasks. The results showed that they preferred the separate submenu. window. The best performance was obtained when the submenu immediately followed the selection of its parent menu. In addition the participants in their 20s found a target menu item with fewer button clicks than did the teenagers. The separate submenu window with no delay was recommended in terms of both performance and subjective preference. The design guidelines for submenu windows on a small-screen device are also provided. The results of this study are expected to be applicable to menu-driven interfaces of many small-screen devices such as digital cameras and personal digital assistants.;2006
This study was an attempt to control and monitor Computerized Numerical Controller (CNC) machines anywhere and anytime for the development of a ubiquitous machine (u-machine). With a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) phone the machine status and machining data of CNC machines can be monitored in wired and wireless environments including the environments of IMT2000 and Wireless LAN. Moreover CNC machines call be controlled anywhere and anytime. The concept of the anywhere-anytime controlling and monitoring of a manufacturing system was implemented in this study for the purpose of u-manufacturing and u-machines. In this concept the communication between the CNC controller and the PDA phone was successfully performed anywhere and anytime for the real-time monitoring and control of CNC machines. In addition the interface between the CNC controller and the developed application module was implemented by Object linking and embedding for Process Control (OPC) and shared CNC memory. For communication the design of a server contents module within the target CNC was based on a TCP/IP. Furthermore the client contents module within the PDA phone was designed with the aid of embedded c++ programming for mobile communication. For the interface the monitoring data Such as the machine status the machine running state the name of the Numerical Control (NC) program the alarm and the position of the stage axes were acquired in real time from real machines with the aid of the OPC method and by sharing the CNC memory. The control data such as the start hold emergency stop reserved start and reserved stop were also applied to the CNC domain of the real machine. CNC machines can therefore be controlled and monitored in real time anywhere and anytime. Moreover prompt notification from CNC machines to mobile phones including cellular phones and PDA phones can be automatically realized in emergencies.;2006
To assist in the early detection of critical illness many hospitals now use a track and trigger system that allocates points to routine vital signs measurements on the basis of their derangement from an arbitrarily agreed normal range. These points are summed to provide an early warning score (EWS). Little is known about the accuracy with which EWS are calculated and charted. We compared the speed and accuracy of charting the weighted value attributed to each vital. sign and of calculating the EWS using the traditional pen and paper method with that using a specially programmed personal digital assistant (VitalPAC (TM)). Incorrect entries or omissions occurred in 24 (29%) of 84 EWS computed using pen/paper compared to 8 (10%) computed using the VitalPAC (TM) method. Fewer incorrect clinical actions were indicated using EWS derived via the VitalPAC (TM) method (4/84 5%) than from those calculated using pen/paper (12/84 14%). The mean time (+/- S.D.) taken for participants to calculate and chart a set of weighted values and EWS using the pen/paper method was 67.6 +/- 35.3 s (n = 84). The corresponding time taken to enter a set of physiological data using the VitalPAC (TM) was 43.0 +/- 23.5 s (n = 84). By comparison with the conventional pen/paper method the use of VitalPAC (TM) was on average 1.6-times faster. The use of a device such as VitalPAC (TM) offers significant advantages both in speed and accuracy of recording of EWS. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2006
To facilitate the development of spoken dialog systems and speech enabled applications we introduce SGStudio (Semantic Grammar Studio) a grammar authoring tool that enables regular software developers with little speech/linguistic background to rapidly create quality semantic grammars for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU). We focus on the underlying technology of SGStudio including knowledge assisted example-based grammar learning grammar controls and configurable grammar structures. While the focus of SGStudio is to increase productivity experimental results show that it also improves the quality of the grammars being developed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2006
Two experiments are reported in which university students translated visually presented English words into German while German distractor words were simultaneously presented. Distractors were morphologically related merely form-related or unrelated to the German translations (target words). The transparency of the semantic relation between target words and morphological distractors was also varied. Morphological distractors facilitated word-translation latencies irrespective of their semantic transparency replicating results obtained with other tasks. Thus in German word production effects of morphological complexity seem to be largely independent of semantics. Morphological facilitation is also not due to mere form relatedness since phonological distractors had no impact on translation latencies relative to unrelated distractors. Our data corroborate the usefulness of word-translation for investigating spoken word production in particular for morphological processing.;2006
Underreporting of energy intake is a pervasive problem and resistant to improvement especially among people with overweight and obesity. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) for dietary self-monitoring would reduce underreporting prevalence and improve the validity of self-reported energy intake. Adults with overweight and obesity (n=61 92% women mean age 48.2 years mean body mass index 32.3) were provided with a PalmZire 21 (Palm Inc Sunnyvale CA) loaded with Calorie King's Diet Diary software (version 3.2.2 2002 Family Health Network Costa Mesa CA). Subjects participated in a 24-week in-person behavioral weight control program and were asked to self-monitor their diet and exercise habits using the PDA. Basal metabolic rate and physical activity level were estimated at baseline. Energy intake from 7-day electronic food records were collected within the first month of the weight-control program. As subjects were actively losing weight Bandini's adjustments were used to correct self-reported energy intake for weight loss. In this group where 41% of the subjects were categorized as low-energy reporters the use of a PDA did not improve validity of energy reporting when compared to what is reported in the literature.;2006
Virtual memory is considered to be an unlimited resource in desktop or notebook computers with high storage capabilities. However in wireless mobile devices like palmtops and personal digital assistants (PDAs) storage memory is limited or absent due to weight size and power constraints so that swapping over remote memory devices can be considered as a viable alternative. However power-hungry wireless network interface cards (WNICs) may limit the battery lifetime and application performance if not efficiently exploited. In this paper we study performance and energy of network swapping in comparison with swapping on local micro-drives and flash memories. We report the results of extensive experiments conducted on different WNICs and local swapping devices using both synthetic and natural benchmarks. Our study points out that remote swapping over power- manageable WNICs can be more efficient than local swapping especially in bursty workload conditions. Such conditions can be forced where possible by reshaping swapping requests to increase energy efficiency and performance.;2006
We are interested in the problem of robust understanding from noisy spontaneous speech input. With the advances in automated speech recognition (ASR) there has been increasing interest in spoken language understanding (SLU). A challenge in large vocabulary spoken language understanding is robustness to ASR errors. State of the art spoken language understanding relies on the best ASR hypotheses (ASR 1-best). In thispaper we propose methods for a tighter integration of ASR and SLU using word confusion networks (WCNs). WCNs obtained from ASR word graphs (lattices) provide a compact representation of multiple aligned. ASR hypotheses along with word confidence scores without compromising recognition accuracy. We present our work on exploiting WCNs instead of simply using ASR one-best hypotheses. In this work we focus on the tasks of named entity detection and extraction and call classification in a spoken dialog system although the idea is more general and applicable to other spoken language processing tasks. For named entity detection we have improved the F-measure by using both word lattices and WCNs 6-10% absolute. The processing of WCNs was 25 times faster than lattices which is very important for real-life applications. For call classification we have shown between 5% and 10% relative reduction in error rate using WCNs compared to ASR 1-best output. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2006

In this paper we evaluate the educational feasibility of our web-based education system and discuss the novel communication methodology of medical education in diagnostic radiology using open source CMS. We conclude that our next generation web-based application system had advantages of attractive merits time-saving and low costs compared with conventional paper-based education system of diagnostic radiology.;2006
We have conducted a preliminary evaluation of the use of a code division multiple access (CDMA)-based emergency telemedicine system to be used by emergency rescuers providing first-aid treatment for patients. The prototype system included five instrumentation modules for measuring non-invasive arterial blood pressure (NIBP) arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) Six-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) blood glucose concentration and body temperature. The patient data were transferred to a doctor's PC through CDMA and TCP/IP networks using an embedded personal digital assistant (PDA) phone. Performance tests in the laboratory showed that the system provided reliable values with error ranges within +/- 1% for heart rate +/- 5 mmHg for NIBP +/- 2% for SpO(2) and +/- 1% for glucose. The feasibility of the prototype system was then evaluated with 15 real emergency patients on Jeju Island over a two-month period. Measured data were transmitted from a moving ambulance to the emergency medical centre without significant CDMA connection loss or transmission errors. The average transfer time was 8 min. Four emergency doctors and 11 rescuers completed a questionnaire. There were favourable reviews from the users.;2006
We present and evaluate a robust method for the interpretation of spoken input to a conversational computer game. The scenario- of the game is that of a player interacting with embodied fairy-tale characters in a 3D world via spoken dialogue (supplemented by graphical pointing actions) to solve various problems. The player himself cannot directly perform actions in the world but interacts with the fairy-tale characters to have them perform various tasks and to get information about the world and the problems to solve. Hence the role of spoken dialogue as the primary means of control is obvious and natural to the player. Naturally this means that robust spoken language understanding becomes a critical component. To this end the paper describes a semantic representation formalism and an accompanying parsing algorithm which works off the output of the speech recogniser's statistical language model. The evaluation shows that the parser is robust in the sense of considerably improving on the noisy output of the speech recogniser. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2006
We prospectively evaluated the effect of antibiotic treatment on infection-related symptoms in patients with advanced cancer in addition to assessing infection characteristics. Methods: A questionnaire was completed for enrolled patients using a personal digital assistant. Pre-antibiotic and post-antibiotic treatment Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) scores were evaluated. Patient and the patient's physician identified infection-related symptoms experienced by the patient which were documented under the other category on the ESAS. Pre-antibiotic and post-antibiotic scores of the patient and physician for the identified infection-related symptoms were evaluated. Results: Twenty-six patients on a tertiary palliative care unit with 31 episodes of infection were included for analysis. Patients' pre- and post-antibiotic ESAS scores revealed a small improvement in all variables except anxiety. Patient assessment of symptoms related to infection showed a small improvement in all symptoms with dsyuria being statistically significant. Physician assessment revealed a slight improvement for all the symptoms although only cough was statistically significant. A general comparative physician assessment of patient outcome following antibiotic treatment suggested symptom improvement in 48.4% of patients. However 50% of patients died within a week of antibiotic discontinuation. Conclusions: Antibiotic treatment appears to offer a mild improvement in infection-related symptoms. Patients reported the greatest improvement in dysuria and physicians in cough. Despite this symptomatic improvement one quarter of the patients died within one week of antibiotic administration. Further comparative studies to evaluate symptomatic benefit patient burden and cost/benefit of antibiotic therapy in the treatment of infections in advanced cancer patients are required.;2006
While human tutors respond to both what a student says and to how the student says it most tutorial dialogue systems cannot detect the student emotions and attitudes underlying an utterance. We present an empirical study investigating the feasibility of recognizing student state in two corpora of spoken tutoring dialogues one with a human tutor and one with a computer tutor. We first annotate student turns for negative neutral and positive student states in both corpora. We then automatically extract acoustic-prosodic features from the student speech and lexical items from the transcribed or recognized speech. We compare the results of machine learning experiments using these features alone in combination and with student and task dependent features to predict student states. We also compare our results across human-human and human-computer spoken tutoring dialogues. Our results show significant improvements in prediction accuracy over relevant baselines and provide a first step towards enhancing our intelligent tutoring spoken dialogue system to automatically recognize and adapt to student states.

Wireless Grid computing extends the traditional Grid computing paradigm to include a diverse collection of mobile devices enabled to communicate using radio frequency infrared optical and other wireless mechanisms. Among the devices coming into use in wireless grid implementations are tiny sensors Radio Frequency Identification tags (RFID). Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and paging devices cellular phones hand-held or wearable computers laptop computers and special purpose computers embedded into many modern appliances [8 26 29]. Though many of these devices were initially developed to serve a specific autonomous purpose their potential for cooperation through the sharing of resources and capabilities and the massive amounts of resources available due to their numbers is quickly leading to applications resembling traditional Grid computing. This paper presents a survey of the current state of wireless grid computing. This includes a discussion of the cooperation between wired and wireless grids including ways in which wireless grids extend the capabilities of existing wired grids. It also discusses many of the new capabilities and resources available to wireless grid devices and a sampling of several applications of these new resources. It provides a sampling of many current research endeavors in the wireless grid arena and an examination of a number of the potential challenges resulting from the unique characteristics of wireless grid devices.;2006
With the growing popularity of personal digital assistant devices and smart phones: consumers have become increasingly enthusiastic to watching videos from these mobile devices. However when browsing videos in mobiles users often feel that the display resolution greatly affects their perceptual experience with the limited screen size. In this paper an attention based spatial video adaptation scheme is proposed to overcome the display constraints by producing and displaying the region of interest. According to the size of the target display we automatically detect and crop the informative region in each frame to generate a smooth sequence. To avoid costly full encoding operations we develop a set of transcoding techniques based on the H.264 standard. Experimental results show that this approach not only improves the perceptual quality but also saves the bandwidth and computation especially for the videos which have not been well edited.;2006
With the wide use of digital multimedia equipment exchange of image data has become prevalent. Images and video data are exchanged through personal computers mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Since the resolutions of each image display are different it is necessary to change the image size accordingly. An image-resizing algorithm in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain is known to be fast for a compressed image. Most of the DCT domain methods truncate the high-frequency components during image downsampling and they are assumed to be zero to upsample images. We estimate the high-frequency parts using the correlation between the low- and the high-frequency components and compare the peak SNR (PSNR) performances. We verify that the use of correlation is the best linear estimation in the mean square error sense. (c) 2006 SPIE and IS&T.;2006
A barge-in free spoken dialogue interface using sound field control and microphone array is proposed. In the conventional spoken dialogue system using an acoustic echo canceller it is indispensable to estimate a room transfer function especially when the transfer function is changed by various interferences. However the estimation is difficult when the user and the system speak simultaneously. To resolve the problem we propose a sound field control technique to prevent the response sound from being observed. Combined with a microphone array the proposed method can achieve high elimination performance with no adaptive process. The efficacy of the proposed interface is ascertained in the experiments on the basis of sound elimination and speech recognition.;2007
A block adaptive binarisation method using a modified quadratic filter (MQF) to binarise business card images having ill conditions of very poor resolution weak and irregular illumination shadow and noise acquired in hand-held personal digital assistant cameras is proposed. In the proposed method a business card image is first partitioned into blocks of 8 x 8 among which character blocks (CBs) are extracted based on their block activity in DCT domain. Each C13 is next enhanced by the MQF that is a result of modifying the quadratic filter (QF) to be proper for locally adaptive enhancement. The enhanced CB is then binarised with the same threshold used in the enhancement so that the enhancement and binarisation are associated consistently with each other. All the remaining blocks are next classified as background blocks and binarised as background. A binarised image is finally obtained by tiling each binarised block at its original position. Experimental results show that the quality of binarised images obtained by the proposed method is much better than that by the conventional global binarisation (GB) using QF and that by Rodtook and Rangsanseri's (2001) pixel adaptive binarisation. It is also better than that by Sativola and Pietikainen's (2000) pixel adaptive binarisation and that by Yang and Yan's (2000) adaptive logical level binarisation. In addition the proposed method yields about 32 28.2 5.6 and 6.4% improvement of character recognition rate over GB using QF (GB-QF) Rodtook and Rangsanseri's method Sauvola and Pietikdinen's method and Yang and Yan's method respectively.;2007
A promising application of the electromagnetic compatible (EMC) internal patch antenna centered at the top portion of the thin smart phone or personal digital assistant (PDA) phone is presented. The EMC antenna in this study is encircled by an L-shaped shielding wall which also serves as part of the antenna's ground plane and is centered above the top edge of the system ground plane. This arrangement is different from the general case of the internal patch antenna mounted on one side of the system ground plane. In this case with the LCD monitor battery and associated electronic components generally mounted on both sides of the system ground plane the required housing thickness for the PDA phone can be decreased. This makes it easy to achieve a thin PDA phone of thickness about 10 mm only. In addition the studied antenna uses a simple radiating metal pattern of a long folded strip and a short spiral strip for generating two wide bands for GSM/DCS operation. This simple radiating metal pattern makes it easy to control the antenna's two excited resonant modes for GSM/DCS operation. Also. effects of the user's hand holding the thin PDA phone with the studied antenna are analyzed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2007
A simple technique is presented for testing a C99 compiler by comparing its output with the output from pre-existing tools. The advantage to this approach is that new test cases can be added in bulk from existing sources reducing the need for in-depth investigation of correctness issues and for creating new test code by hand. This technique was used in testing the PalmSource Palm OS (R) Cobalt ARM C/C++ cross-compiler for Palm-Powered personal digital assistants primarily for standards compliance and the correct execution of generated code. The technique described here found several hundred bugs mostly in our in-house code but also in longstanding high-quality front- and back-end code from Edison Design Group and Apogee Software. It also found 18 bugs in the GNU C compiler as well as a bug specific to the Apple version of GCC a bug specific to the Suse version of GCC and a dozen bugs in versions of GCC for the ARM processor several of which were critical.

A surface-mount loop antenna very suitable for application in the mobile devices such as the PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) phone for quad-band operation is presented. The antenna comprises of a loop metal pattern for generating two wideband resonant modes at about 900 and 1800 MH: to cover the AMPS/GSM/DCS/PCS bands and a central coupling stub as the feed structure. Although quad-band operation is obtained the antenna occupies a small volume of 7 x 8 x 60 171113 or about 3.4 cm(3) only and is easy to be embedded inside the PDA phone as nn internal antenna. Details of the proposed surface-mount loop antenna are presented and discussed. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2007
A thin dual-band internal patch antenna for Global System for Mobile Communication 890-960 MHz/Digital Communication System 1710-1880 MHz (GSM/DCS) operation in a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) phone is presented. The antenna can generate two wide resonant modes for GSM (890-960 MHz) and DCS (1710-1880 MHz) operation yet it requires an air-layer substrate of thickness 4 mm only which is among the thinnest internal mobile phone antennas that have been reported. The antenna's top patch comprises a resonant narrow strip supporting a longer resonant path for GSM operation and a resonant subpatch supporting a shorter resonant path for DCS operation. By including a suitable widened end portion for the narrow strip and a suitable tapered end portion for the subpatch increased bandwidths for the proposed thin internal mobile phone antenna are obtained. Detailed design considerations of the proposed antenna are described. In addition the user's hand effects on the performances of the proposed antenna are studied.;2007
Ad hoc networks can be used not only as data carriers for mobile devices but also as providers of a new class of services specific to ubiquitous computing environments. Building services in ad hoc networks however is challenging due to the rapidly changing operating contexts which often lead to situations where a node hosting a certain service becomes unsuitable for hosting the service execution any longer. We propose a novel model of service provisioning in ad hoc networks based on the concept of context-aware migratory services. Unlike a regular service that executes always on the same node a migratory service can migrate to different nodes in the network in order to accomplish its task. The migration is triggered by changes of the operating context and it occurs transparently to the client application. We designed and implemented a framework for developing migratory services. We built TJam a proof- of- concept migratory service that predicts traffic jams in a given region of a highway by using only car- to- car short- range wireless communication. The experimental results obtained over an ad hoc network of personal digital assistants ( PDAs) show the effectiveness of our approach in the presence of frequent disconnections. We also present simulation results that demonstrate the benefits of migratory services in large- scale networks compared to a statically centralized approach.;2007
Aim To describe a simple technical evaluation of the access security issues and uses of wireless networked PDAs in a dental clinic and report a pilot study investigating students' educational use of PDAs to access a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) in a dental clinic. Objectives To undertake a technical evaluation of wireless networking to PDAs focusing on security issues robustness of the system and accessibility particularly to educational resources. To evaluate the impact of using a PDA on undergraduate students in the dental clinic and at home. Design Part II describes the technical and educational evaluation of PDAs used by one group of 12 undergraduate fourth year students in the Primary Dental Care clinic. A cross over trial of six students with PDAs and six without was carried out during one semester of 12 weeks. Methods Technical issues such as secure internet access using wireless connectivity were addressed. An assessment of the general and educational use and the students' attitudes towards using PDAs was undertaken using online questionnaires and focus group discussions. Results Over 90% of participants wanted PDAs as part of their dental kit. The potential of PDA use in dental training was demonstrated by a good to excellent response by over 75% of participants to having access to online support materials particularly videos being able to make notes for individual study and to keep a diary of their commitments to teaching sessions. Recreational use included a 100% good to excellent response to playing games and keeping a diary. Conclusion The PDA proved to be a convenient and versatile mode of access to online education. Technical solutions enabled a substantial proportion of the functionality of WebCT ( Web Course Tools) to be accessed by the students in a clinical environment. Both novice and experienced users were able to appreciate the use of the PDA and the less able considered that their ICT skills had improved. However further research is needed to determine how students use a range of new technologies in their undergraduate programmes. The Dental Institute plans to recommend that all students will use this device in the future throughout their five-year curriculum and the scoping of the implications of this recommendation is underway.;2007
Aim To provide a basic understanding of the features of a portable digital assistant (PDA) and how it may be useful for the general dental practitioner. Objectives To outline the various types functions and applications of a PDA and suggest its use for the dental professional now and in the future. To enable appreciation of the technology and educational evaluation carried out in the pilot study reported in Part II. Design Part I is a descriptive account of the use and function of the PDA in dentistry and its potential for the future. Method A review of the literature was carried out drawing on evidence from general healthcare and assessments of portable computing aids evaluated in a dentally related setting. Results Choosing a PDA for use in dental practice is complex but should be based on the user's needs mapped to key features size and cost of the device. Conclusion No ideal customisable mobile digital solution currently exists but evidence from general healthcare use suggests that there are valuable features that can aid the general dental practitioners such as personal management and point of source assistance.;2007
An effective networked knowledge delivery platform is one of the Holy Grails of Web computing. Knowledge delivery approaches range from the heavy and narrow to the light and broad. This paper explores a lightweight and flexible dialog framework based on the ALICE system and evaluates its performance in chat and knowledge delivery using both a conversational setting and a specific telecommunications knowledge domain. Metrics for evaluation are presented and the evaluations of three experimental systems (a pure dialog system a domain knowledge system and a hybrid system combining dialog and domain knowledge) are presented and discussed. Our study of 257 subjects shows approximately a 20% user correction rate on system responses. Certain error classes (such as nonsense replies) were particular to the dialog system while others (such as mistaking opinion questions for definition questions) were particular to the domain system. A third type of error wordy and awkward responses is a basic system property and spans all three experimental systems. We also show that the highest response satisfaction results are obtained when coupling domain-specific knowledge together with conversational dialog. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2007
An experience-sampling study of 124 undergraduates pretested on complex memory-span tasks examined the relation between working memory capacity (WMC) and the experience of mind wandering in daily life. Over 7 days personal digital assistants signaled subjects eight times daily to report immediately whether their thoughts had wandered from their current activity and to describe their psychological and physical context. WMC moderated the relation between mind wandering and activities' cognitive demand. During challenging activities requiring concentration and effort higher-WMC subjects maintained on-task thoughts better and mind-wandered less than did lower-WMC subjects. The results were therefore consistent with theories of WMC emphasizing the role of executive attention and control processes in determining individual differences and their cognitive consequences.;2007
As access to information becomes more intensive in society a great deal of that information is becoming available through diverse channels. Accordingly users require effective methods for accessing this information. Conversational agents can act as effective and familiar user interfaces. Although conversational agents can analyze the queries of users based on a static process they cannot manage expressions that are more complex. In this paper we propose a system that uses semantic Bayesian networks to infer the intentions of the user based on Bayesian networks and their semantic information. Since conversation often contains ambiguous expressions the managing of context and uncertainty is necessary to support flexible conversational agents. The proposed method uses mixed-initiative interaction (MII) to obtain missing information and clarify spurious concepts in order to understand the intention of users correctly. We applied this to an information retrieval service for websites to verify the usefulness of the proposed method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2007
As interest grows in creating computerized versions of established paper-and-pencil (P&P) questionnaires it becomes increasingly important to explore whether changing the administration modes of questionnaires affects participants' responses. This study investigated whether mode effects exist when administering the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale by a personal digital assistant (PDA) versus the classic P&P mode. The Differential Functioning of Items and Tests (DFIT) procedure identified mode effects on the overall test and individual items. A mixed-effects regression model summarized the mode effects in terms of CES-D scores and identified interactions with covariates. When the P&P questionnaire was administered first scores were higher on average (2.4-2.8 points) than those of the other administrations (PDA second PDA first and P&P second) and all 20 questionnaire items exhibited a statistically significant mode effect. Highly educated people and younger people demonstrated a smaller difference in scores between the two modes. The mode-by-order effect influenced the interpretation of CES-D scores especially when screening for depression using the established cut-off scores. These results underscore the importance of evaluating the cross-mode equivalence of psychosocial instruments before administering them in non-established modes.;2007
At the inception of the Internet the websites were only textual. Now with the graphic possibilities more and more websites integrate visual aspects essentially to access and to visualize information. The goal of this paper is to examine the use of some visual techniques in city websites. More particularly we will examine the metaphor of virtual cities hypermaps and geography-based accesses news magazines etc. In the last part of this paper we will examine the implications of using those metaphors for small screens and overall for Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) of Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). We will essentially argue that as the syntactic transformations i.e. the syntactic adaptations are one face of the problem the semantic adaptation i.e. the transformation or the adaptation of the metaphors is a very challenging issue.

Background: In clinical and research practice linked to prostate cancer treatment frequent monitoring of patient health-related quality of life ( HRQOL) is essential. Practical and analytic limitations of paper questionnaire data capture may be overcome with the use of self-administered personal digital assistant ( PDA) data collection. The objective of this study was to assess the reliability validity and feasibility of using PDA in place of paper versions of the International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS) the Patient Oriented Prostate Cancer Utility Survey ( PORPUS) and the International Index of Erectile Function-5 ( IIEF-5) in a prostate cancer clinic setting. Methods: 152 participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) paper followed by PDA survey 2) PDA followed by paper survey or 3) PDA followed by PDA survey. Evaluation included an assessment of data quality ( internal consistency test-retest reliability response correlation completeness of data) and feasibility ( participation rates time to completion preference and difficultly/ease of using PDA). Results: Internal consistency was similar for both PDA and paper applications. Test-retest reliability was confirmed for PDA repeated administration. Data from paper and PDA questionnaires were strongly correlated. Lower missed item rates were found in PDA administration. 82.8% of participants preferred using the PDA or had no preference. Mean difficulty/ease ratings indicated that participants found the PDA easy to use. Age did not significantly correlate with preference or difficulty. Conclusion: The results confirm the adaptability of the IPSS IIEF-5 and the PORPUS to PDA administration. Similarly the findings of this study support the feasibility of using PDA technology for HRQOL serial data capture in the prostate cancer patient population.;2007
Background: Online drug information databases are used to assist in enhancing clinical decision support. However the choice of which online database to consult purchase or subscribe to is likely made based on subjective elements such as history of use familiarity or availability during professional training. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical decision support tools for drug information by systematically comparing the most commonly used online drug information databases. Methods: Five commercially available and two freely available online drug information databases were evaluated according to scope (presence or absence of answer) completeness (the comprehensiveness of the answers) and ease of use. Additionally a composite score integrating all three criteria was utilized. Fifteen weighted categories comprised of 158 questions were used to conduct the analysis. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square were used to summarize the evaluation components and make comparisons between databases. Scheffe's multiple comparison procedure was used to determine statistically different scope and completeness scores. The composite score was subjected to sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of the choice of percentages for scope and completeness. Results: The rankings for the databases from highest to lowest based on composite scores were Clinical Pharmacology Micromedex Lexi-Comp Online Facts & Comparisons 4.0 Epocrates Online Premium RxList.com and Epocrates Online Free. Differences in scope produced three statistical groupings with Group 1 (best) performers being: Clinical Pharmacology Micromedex Facts & Comparisons 4.0 Lexi-Comp Online Group 2: Epocrates Premium and RxList.com and Group 3: Epocrates Free (p < 0.05). Completeness scores were similarly stratified. Collapsing the databases into two groups by access (subscription or free) showed the subscription databases performed better than the free databases in the measured criteria (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Online drug information databases which belong to clinical decision support vary in their ability to answer questions across a range of categories.;2007
Background: The Internet can facilitate diary monitoring (experience sampling ecological momentary assessment) and behavioral coaching. Online digital assistance (ODA) is a generic tool for mobile Web-based use intended as an adjuvant to face-to-face or Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment. current ODA application was designed to support home-based training of behavioral attack prevention in chronic migraine focusing on the identification of attack precursors and the support of preventive health behaviour. Objective: The aim was to establish feasibility of the ODA approach in terms of technical problems and participant compliance and ODA acceptability on the basis of ratings of user-friendliness potential burden and perceived support of the training for behavioral attack prevention in migraine. Methods: ODA combines mobile electronic diary monitoring with direct human online coaching of health behavior according to the information from the diary. The diary contains three parts covering the following: (1) migraine headache and medication use (2) attack precursors and (3) self-relaxation and other preventive behavior in addition menstruation (assessed in the evening diary) and disturbed sleep (assessed in the morning diary) is monitored. The pilot study consisted of two runs conducted with a total of five women with chronic migraine without aura ODA was tested for 8.5 days -12 days) per (range 4 participant. The first test run with three participants tested 4-5 diary prompts per day. The second run with another three participants (including one subject who participated in both runs) tested a reduced prompting scheme (2-3) and minor adaptations to the diary. Online coaching was executed twice daily on workdays. Results: ODA feasibility was established on the basis of acceptable data loss (1.2% due to the personal digital assistant 5.6% due to failing Internet transmission) and good participant compliance (86.8% in the second run). Run 1 revealed some annoyance with the number of prompts per day. Overall ODA acceptability was evident by the positive participant responses concerning userfriendliness absence of burden and perceived support of migraine attack prevention. The software was adapted to further increase the flexibility of the application. Conclusions: ODA is feasible and well accepted. Tolerability is a sensitive issue and the balance a sensitive issue and the balance between benefit and burden must be considered with care. ODA offers a generic tool to combine mobile coaching with diary monitoringindependently of time and space. ODA effects on improvement of migraine remain to be established.;2007
Background: The installation of drug databases on personal digital assistants (PDAs) allows for rapid detection of adverse drug interactions at the point of care. Aim: To test the ability of a drug interaction database (ePocrates RX) to correctly identify clinically significant adverse drug interactions in an out-patient setting. Design: Retrospective file review of 1801 drug prescriptions in out-patients consulting a medical walk-in clinic. Methods: Each prescription was assessed independently by a clinical pharmacologist using drug-drug interaction compendia and by a general internist using the drug interaction database. Discrepant results were systematically reviewed by both using published literature and a consensus was then reached. This consensus was used as the criterion against which the PDA drug interaction database was judged. Results: The prevalence of potential adverse drug interactions was 23. When compared to the opinion of the clinical pharmacologist and drug-drug interaction compedia the sensitivity of the drug interaction database to correctly identify clinically relevant adverse drug interactions was 81 (95CI 7785) and the specificity was 88 (95CI 8689). The positive predictive value was poor (67 95CI 6271) but the negative predictive value was excellent (94 95CI 9295). Discussion: The database was an efficient tool for rapidly checking for potentially harmful drug interaction but also flagged up several clinically non-significant interactions. When used appropriately this drug interaction database could help physicians decrease prescription error by ruling out the risk of clinically relevant adverse drug interactions for newly prescribed drugs and thereby increase patient safety.;2007
Background: To identify individual differences in physicians' needs for the presentation of evidence resources and preferences for mobile devices. Methods: Within-groups analysis of responses to semi-structured interviews. Interviews consisted of using prototypes in response to task-based scenarios. The prototypes were implemented on two different form factors: a tablet style PC and a pocketPC. Participants were from three user groups: general internists family physicians and medicine residents and from two different settings: urban and semi-urban. Verbal protocol analysis which consists of coding utterances was conducted on the transcripts of the testing sessions. Statistical relationships were investigated between staff physicians' and residents' background variables self-reported experiences with the interfaces and verbal code frequencies. Results: 47 physicians were recruited from general internal medicine family practice clinics and a residency training program. The mean age of participants was 42.6 years. Physician specialty had a greater effect on device and information-presentation preferences than gender age setting or previous technical experience. Family physicians preferred the screen size of the tablet computer and were less concerned about its portability. Residents liked the screen size of the tablet but preferred the portability of the pocketPC. Internists liked the portability of the pocketPC but saw less advantage to the large screen of the tablet computer ( F[ 244] = 4.94 p =.012). Conclusion: Different types of physicians have different needs and preferences for evidence-based resources and handheld devices. This study shows how user testing can be incorporated into the process of design to inform group-based customization.;2007
Biometric identity verification is a reality today. However this relatively new field still requires a large amount of user-centred studies before becoming commonly used. This paper presents a user-centred analysis of a multimodal authentication system for secure Internet access where users can choose freely between three different biometric modalities (fingerprint voice and signature) to enrol verify their identity and act as impostors in an unsupervised manner aided only by an automated embodied conversational agent. Objective and subjective information was collected to analyse relevant relationships between authentication performance ergonomic issues and user preconceptions and impressions. Particular attention has been paid to analyse also the evolution of users' choices of modality. From the results of our study we infer usability insights for the design of multimodal biometric security systems and point towards directions of further inquiry.;2007
Computers personal digital assistants ( PDA) and the Internet are widely used as resources in medical education and clinical care. Educators who intend to incorporate these resources effectively into residency education programmes can benefit from understanding how residents currently use these tools their skills and their preferences. The researchers sent questionnaires to 306 US family medicine residency programmes for all of their residents to complete. Respondents were 1177 residents from 125 ( 41%) programmes. Access to a computer was reported by 95% of respondents. Of these 97% of desktop and 89% of laptop computers could access the Internet. Residents accessed various educational and clinical resources. Half felt they had 'intermediate' skills at Web searches 23% had 'some skills' and 27% were 'quite skilled.' Those under 30 years of age reported higher skill levels. Those who experienced a Web- based curriculum in medical school reported higher search skills and greater success in finding clinical information. Respondents preferred to use technology to supplement the didactic sessions offered in resident teaching conferences. Favourable conditions exist in family medicine residency programmes to implement a blend of traditional and technology-based learning experiences. These conditions include residents' experience skills and preferences.;2007
Consumer access networks are low bandwidth especially in the up-stream direction. This asymmetry is heightened for real-time multimedia applications. The web wait is not acceptable when in a conversational interface. We describe the use of KPM a protocol for transporting user stimulus. We illustrate the application of KPML to a typical consumer activity accessing information sources over the telephone. We include results measuring KPML against other protocols for transporting user stimulus.;2007
Continuous recording of ruminal pH in cannulated cattle has been practiced to study rumen metabolism. However most systems reported did not permit animal mobility during pH recording. Therefore the objective of this study was to develop a continuous rumen pH data acquisition system that permitted animal mobility during data acquisition. A further objective was to compare the pH readings obtained using the continuous recording system to readings obtained at the same time using spot sampling. The continuous recording system was composed of a heavy-duty electrode and a data logger. The electrode was attached to a 0.5-kg weight to help maintain the electrode in the ventral sac of the rumen. The electrode was connected via a 0.5-m cable to a lightweight data logger that was mounted on the animal's back using a belt wrapped around the girth. The data logger was battery powered and could hold over 13000 pH data values. A personal digital assistant was used to configure and download data from the data logger during the experiment. Ruminal pH was continuously recorded ( every 10 s) using a dry Holstein cow fed alfalfa hay ad libitum in a 3-d experiment to compare the performance of the continuous system to spot samples taken from the ventral sac of the rumen the same location as the continuous electrode. The spot samples were collected 3 times per d for 3 d. At every sampling time 3 replicate samples were collected pH was determined immediately using a handheld pH meter and readings were averaged (n = 3) and compared with the average of the 3 pH readings recorded using the continuous system at the same time. The pH recorded by spot sampling (6.63 +/- 0.04) was greater ( P = 0.009) than that of the continuous system (6.56 +/- 0.03) with a correlation of r = 0.88 ( P = 0.002). The continuous recording system has the potential to facilitate measurement of ruminal pH in free-roaming cattle.;2007
Control in spoken dialog systems is challenging largely because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a principled mathematical framework for planning and control in this context however POMDPs face severe scalability challenges and past work has been limited to trivially small dialog tasks. This paper presents a novel POMDP optimization technique-composite summary point-based value iteration (CSPBVI)-which enables optimization to be performed on slot-filling POMDP-based dialog managers of a realistic size. Using dialog models trained on data from a tourist information domain simulation results show that CSPBVI scales effectively outperforms non-POMDP baselines and is robust to estimation errors.;2007
Currently personal mobile communication devices have become quite common and the applications of such devices have expanded quickly. Remote communication systems might be employed for the telemonitoring of patients or the operating status of their medical devices. In this article we describe the development of a mobile-based artificial heart telemanagement system for use in a wearable extracorporeal pneumatic biventricular assist device which is capable of telemonitoring and telecontrolling the operating status of the ventricular assist device from any site. The system developed herein utilized small mobile phones for the client device and adopted a standard transmission control protocol/Internet protocol communication protocol for the purposes of telecommunication. The results of in vitro and animal experiments showed that the telemanagement system developed herein operated in accordance with the desired parameters.;2007
DiamondHelp is a generic collaborative task guidance system motivated by the current usability crisis in high-tech home products. It combines an application-independent conversational interface (adapted from online chat programs) with an application-specific direct-manipulation interface. DiamondHelp is implemented in Java and uses Collagen for representing and using task models.;2007
Dietary self-monitoring is considered the core of behavioral weight control programs. As software for personal digital assistants (PDA) has become more available this study investigated whether the use of a PDA would improve dietary self-monitoring frequency and subsequent weight loss over the use of traditional paper diaries. One-hundred-seventy-six adults (BMI 25-39.9) participated in a 6-month behavioral weight control program. Treatment subjects (n = 61) were provided with a PalmZire 21 with Calorie King's Diet Diary software installed. Their self-monitoring habits and weight loss were compared with the results from a previous program (n = 115) which followed the same protocol using paper diaries for self-monitoring. No significant differences in weight loss or dietary self-monitoring were found. More frequent self-monitoring correlated with weight loss in both groups ( p < .001). People seeking to lose weight should be encouraged to self-monitor and be matched with a mode of self-monitoring that is fitting to their lifestyle and skills.;2007
Experiential learning is the process of creating knowledge through the transformation of experience and has been adopted in an increasing number of areas. This paper investigates the possibility of technological support for experiential learning. A learning activity flow (or script) and a mobile technology system were designed to facilitate students in experiential learning. An experiment was conducted on two fifth-grade classes at an elementary school one class using personal digital assistants (PDAs) and the other working without them. The results indicate that mobile technologies are effective in improving knowledge creation during experiential learning. The interplay between the mobile technology affordances and the proposed learning flow for experiential learning is thoroughly discussed.;2007
Field survey is a very important step in the process of land consolidation and rehabilitation. Traditional methods of field survey take much time and effort and it is difficult to locate facilities of projects to measure area or length and to spot and record problems quickly and accurately. A global positioning system (GPS)-based field survey system is introduced. Firstly the framework of the system is described. Secondly the key technologies are shown including data preparation locating accurately coordinate transformation field measuring and field editing. Finally further applications are discussed. The major result of this study is a GPS-based field survey system which will promote the application of GPS-personal digital assistant (PDA) technology in the field of land consolidation and rehabilitation creating an effective method for improving field survey. In this paper the authors analyse the demands of field survey and introduce the basic ideas of system design and the major functions of the system. This paper also focuses on the implementation of key technologies which are expressed by unified modelling language (UML) figures and tables such as data preparation field positioning coordinate registration field measurement and recording. It has been shown that the GPS-based field survey system can greatly enhance the quality and efficiency of field survey help solve many technical problems and make field survey more straightforward. Widespread adoption of GPS-PDA technology is important to improving land and resource management.;2007
Head pose and gesture offer several conversational grounding cues and are used extensively in face-to-face interaction among people. To accurately recognize visual feedback humans often use contextual knowledge from previous and current events to anticipate when feedback is most likely to occur. In this paper we describe how contextual information can be used to predict visual feedback and improve recognition of head gestures in human-computer interfaces. Lexical prosodic timing and gesture features can be used to predict a user's visual feedback during conversational dialog with a robotic or virtual agent. In non-conversational interfaces context features based on user-interface system events can improve detection of head gestures for dialog box confirmation or document browsing. Our user study with prototype gesture-based components indicate quantitative and qualitative benefits of gesture-based confirmation over conventional alternatives. Using a discriminative approach to contextual prediction and multimodal integration performance of head gesture detection was improved with context features even when the topic of the test set was significantly different than the training set.

Heart rate (HR) variability derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) can be used to assess the function of the autonomic nervous system. HR exhibits various characteristics during different physical activities attributed to the altered autonomic mediation where it is also beneficial to reveal the autonomic shift in response to physical-activity change. In this paper the physical-activity-related HR behaviors were delineated using a portable ECG and body acceleration recorder based on a personal digital assistant and the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution. The results based upon eighteen subjects performing four sequential 5-min physical activities (supine sitting standing and spontaneous walking) showed that the high-frequency heartbeat fluctuations during supine and sitting were significantly larger than during standing and that the ratio of low- to high-frequency fluctuation during standing was significantly higher than during supine and sitting. This could be linked with the parasympathetic predominance during supine and sitting and a shift to sympathetic dominance while standing. During spontaneous walking the high-frequency fluctuation was significant lower than during supine. The low- to high-frequency ratio decreased significantly from standing to spontaneous walking which may imply an increased vagal predominance (autonomic effect) or an increased respiratory activity (mechanical effect).;2007
High Resolution Production Management describes the approach to set up a network of sensors for online order identification and localisation in production consisting of new and existing information technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). It is intended to establish a new order optimisation principle between the interlaced planning levels which allows an improved real-time decision making. Finally a software architecture is proposed which allows for a consistent interaction of the heterogeneous planning and control systems. The paper introduces the approach and first concepts of High Resolution Production Management and presents first experiences of application to industrial cases.;2007
Humans are known to use a wide range of non-verbal behaviour while speaking. Generating naturalistic embodied speech for an artificial agent is therefore an application where techniques that draw directly on recorded human motions can be helpful. We present a system that uses corpus-based selection strategies to specify the head and eyebrow motion of an animated talking head. We first describe how a domain-specific corpus of facial displays was recorded and annotated and outline the regularities that were found in the data. We then present two different methods of selecting motions for the talking head based on the corpus data: one that chooses the majority option in all cases and one that makes a weighted choice among all of the options. We compare these methods to each other in two ways: through cross-validation against the corpus and by asking human judges to rate the output. The results of the two evaluation studies differ: the cross-validation study favoured the majority strategy while the human judges preferred schedules generated using weighted choice. The judges in the second study also showed a preference for the original corpus data over the output of either of the generation strategies.;2007
In a spoken dialog system determining which action a machine should take in a given situation is a difficult problem because automatic speech recognition is unreliable and hence the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Much of the research in spoken dialog systems centres on mitigating this uncertainty and recent work has focussed on three largely disparate techniques: parallel dialog state hypotheses local use of confidence scores and automated planning. While in isolation each of these approaches can improve action selection taken together they currently lack a unified statistical framework that admits global optimization. In this paper we cast a spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show how this formulation unifies and extends existing techniques to form a single principled framework. A number of illustrations are used to show qualitatively the potential benefits of POMDPs compared to existing techniques and empirical results from dialog simulations are presented which demonstrate significant quantitative gains. Finally some of the key challenges to advancing this method - in particular scalability - are briefly outlined. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2007
In order to design a haptic zoom in this fundamental study we compare two scaling methods by focusing on the strategies adopted by subjects who are using a sensory substitution device. Method I consists of a reduction of the sensor size and of its displacement speed. Speed reduction is obtained by a human movement adjustment (hand speed reduction). Method 2 consists of a straightforward increase in the dimensions of the image. The experimental device used couples a pen on a graphics tablet with tactile sensory stimulators. These are activated when the sensor impinges on the outline of the figure on the computer screen. This virtual sensor (a square matrix composed of 16 elementary fields) moves when the pen guided by human hand movements moves on the graphics tablet. The results show that the recognition rate is closely dependent on the size of the figure and that the strategies used by the subjects are more suitable for method 2 than for method 1. In fact half of the subjects found that method I inhibited their movements and the majority of them did not feel the scaling effect whereas this was clearly felt in method 2. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In order to understand land use changes it is useful to provide communities with visions of how their landscape may change. For this purpose we have developed an envisioning system which can help communities contemplate alternative land use configurations. This system links a geographic information system virtual reality mobile computing devices and environmental process models into a platform that allows visual exploration and evaluation of future landscape scenarios. Alternative land use configurations can be suggested using the GIS interface which can be viewed via an immersive 3D environment permitting immediate evaluation. Using personal digital assistants opinions on visible changes can be expressed by a choice of responses. These are fed back to the system where they are collected. People can then determine if the probable changes accord with their judgements and values and adjust the extent or nature of the changes accordingly. The aim of the envisioning system is to help communities learn about their local landscape to examine the consequences of applying different values and to support informed decisions on land use planning issues. We tested the portable envisioning system platform in two public workshops in the Cudgewa Valley of northeastern Victoria Australia. It is expected that the current land use will diversify under economic pressures from predominantly cattle farming as neighbouring valleys have done already. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years the concept of autonomous mental development (AMD) has been applied to the construction of artificial systems such as conversational agents in order to resolve some of the difficulties involved in the manual definition of their knowledge bases and behavioral patterns. AMD is a new paradigm for developing autonomous machines which are adaptive and flexible to the environment. Language development a kind of mental development is an important aspect of intelligent conversational agents. In this paper we propose an intelligent conversational agent and its language development mechanism by putting together five promising techniques: Bayesian networks pattern matching finite-state machines templates and genetic programming (GP). Knowledge acquisition implemented by finite-state machines and templates and language learning by GP are used for language development. Several illustrations and usability tests show the usefulness of the proposed developmental conversational agent.;2007
In the advent of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) the total wait time of passengers for buses may be reduced by disseminating real-time bus arrival times for the next or series of buses to pre-trip passengers through various media (e.g. internet mobile phones and personal digital assistants). A probabilistic model is desirable and developed in this study while realistic distributions of bus and passenger arrivals are considered. The disseminated bus arrival time is optimized by minimizing the total wait time incurred by pre-trip passengers and its impact to the total wait time under both late and early bus arrival conditions is studied. Relations between the optimal disseminated bus arrival time and major model parameters such as the mean and standard deviation of arrival times for buses and pre-trip passengers are investigated. Analytical results are presented based on Normal and Lognormal distributions of bus arrivals and Gumbel distribution of pre-trip passenger arrivals at a designated stop. The developed methodology can be practically applied to any arrival distributions of buses and passengers.;2007
In the present paper we investigate the validity and reliability of de-facto evaluation standards defined for measuring or predicting the quality of the interaction with spoken dialogue systems. Two experiments have been carried out with a dialogue system for controlling domestic devices. During these experiments subjective judgments of quality have been collected by two questionnaire methods (ITU-T Rec. P.851 and SASSI) and parameters describing the interaction have been logged and annotated. Both metrics served the derivation of prediction models according to the PARADISE approach. Although the limited database allows only tentative conclusions to be drawn the results suggest that both questionnaire methods provide valid measurements of a large number of different quality aspects most of the perceptive dimensions underlying the subjective judgments can also be measured with a high reliability. The extracted parameters mainly describe quality aspects which are directly linked to the system environmental and task characteristics. Used as an input to prediction models the parameters provide helpful information for system design and optimization but not general predictions of system usability and acceptability.

In this paper the semantic and pragmatic modules of a spoken dialogue system development platform are presented and evaluated. The main goal of this research is to create spoken dialogue system modules that are portable across applications domains and interaction modalities. We propose a hierarchical semantic representation that encodes all information supplied by the user over multiple dialogue turns and can efficiently represent and be used to argue with ambiguous or conflicting information. Implicit in this semantic representation is a pragmatic module consisting of context tracking pragmatic analysis and pragmatic scoring submodules which computes pragmatic confidence scores for all system beliefs. These pragmatic scores are obtained by combining semantic and pragmatic evidence from the various submodules (taking into account the modality of input) and are used to rank-order attribute-value pairs in the semantic representation as well as identifying and resolving ambiguities. These modules were implemented and evaluated within a travel reservation dialogue system under the auspices of the DARPA Communicator project as well as for a movie information application. Formal evaluation of the semantic and pragmatic modules has shown that by incorporating pragmatic analysis and scoring the quality of the system improves for over 20% of the dialogue fragments examined.;2007
In this paper the task and user interface modules of a multimodal dialogue system development platform are presented. The main goal of this work is to provide a simple application-independent solution to the problem of multimodal dialogue design for information seeking applications. The proposed system architecture clearly separates the task and interface components of the system. A task manager is designed and implemented that consists of two main submodules: the electronic form module that handles the list of attributes that have to be instantiated by the user and the agenda module that contains the sequence of user and system tasks. Both the electronic forms and the agenda can be dynamically updated by the user. Next a spoken dialogue module is designed that implements the speech interface for the task manager. The dialogue manager can handle complex error correction and clarification user input building on the semantics and pragmatic modules presented in Part I of this paper. The spoken dialogue system is evaluated for a travel reservation task of the DARPA Communicator research program and shown to yield over 90% task completion and good performance for both objective and subjective evaluation metrics. Finally a multimodal dialogue system which combines graphical and speech interfaces is designed implemented and evaluated. Minor modifications to the unimodal semantic and pragmatic modules were required to build the multimodal system. It is shown that the multimodal system significantly outperforms the unimodal speech-only system both in terms of efficiency (task success and time to completion) and user satisfaction for a travel reservation task.;2007
In this paper we propose an intelligent TV interface using a voice-enable dialogue system. This paper rests on the both directions: a new type of dialogue management model and its use for practical systems to commercialize. We devise a practical dialogue management model based on statistical learning methods. To analyze discourse context we utilize statistical learning techniques for anaphora resolution and discourse history management. Contrary to the rule-based system we develop an incremental learning method to construct dialogue strategies from the training corpus. Several dialogue service models equipped with the proposed TV interface are explained. To evaluate our model and its impact on an application task we apply the stand-alone model to an TV settop box called eDi-TV.;2007
Increased availability of mobile computing such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) creates the potential for constant and intelligent access to up-to-date integrated and detailed information from the Web regardless of one's actual geographical position. Intelligent question-answering requires the representation of knowledge from various domains such as the navigational and discourse context of the user potential user questions the information provided by Web services and so on for example in the form of ontologies. Within the context of the SmartWeb project we have developed a number of domain-specific ontologies that are relevant for mobile and intelligent user interfaces to open-domain question-answering and information services on the Web. To integrate the various domain-specific ontologies we have developed a foundational ontology the SmartSUMO ontology on the basis of the DOLCE and SUMO ontologies. This allows us to combine all the developed ontologies into a single SmartWeb Integrated Ontology (SWIntO) having a common modeling basis with conceptual clarity and the provision of ontology design patterns for modeling consistency. In this paper we present SWIntO describe the design choices we made in its construction illustrate the use of the ontology through a number of applications and discuss some of the lessons learned from our experiences.

Initial tests indicate that personal and occupational use of personal digital assistants (PDAs or palm-held wireless units) produce high intensity bursts of extremely-low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF). These emissions could result in comparatively high ELF-EMF exposure in persons that carry a PDA close to the body (i.e. in a pocket or on a belt) or held to the head for cell phone conversations. ELF-EMF emissions of 10 mu T were recorded on PDAs during normal office use over a 24 h test period. Results of ELF-EMF measurements show that email transmit and receive functions produce rapid short-duration ELF-EMF spikes in the 2-10 mu T range each lasting several seconds to over a minute apparently depending on file download size. Some units produced spikes as high as 30-60 mu T during email activities. Cell phone activity on PDAs produced continuously elevated ELF-EMF readings in the 0.5-1 mu T range as opposed to the rapid spiking pattern for email receipt and transmission. Switching the PDA unit from OFF to ON position resulted in single ELF-EMF pulses of over 90 mu T on two units. Email downloads into the PDA can occur randomly throughout the day and night when the unit is ON thus the user who wears the PDA maybe receiving high-intensity ELF-EMF pulses throughout the day and night. The frequency of email traffic on the PDA and the power switching unit (battery unit) may affect the frequency and intensity of ELF-EMF emissions.;2007
Integrated switching power supplies with multimode control are gaining popularity in state-of-the-art portable applications like cellular phones personal digital assistants (PDAs) etc. because of their ability to adapt to various loading conditions and therefore achieve high efficiency over a wide load-current range which is critical for extended battery life. Constant-frequency pulsewidth modulated (PWM) switching converters for instance have poor light-load efficiencies because of higher switching losses While pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) control in discontinuous-conduction mode (DCM) is more efficient at light loads because the switching frequency and associated switching losses are scaled down with load current. This paper presents the design and integrated circuit prototype results of an 83% power efficient 0.5-V 50-mA CMOS PFM buck (step-down) dc-dc converter with a novel adaptive on-time scheme that generates a 27-mV output ripple voltage from a 1.4- to 4.2-V input supply (battery-compatible range). The output ripple voltage variation and steady-state accuracy of the proposed supply was 5 mV (22-27 mV) and 0.6% whereas its constant on-time counterpart was 45 mV (10-55 mV) and 3.6% respectively. The proposed control scheme provides an accurate power supply while achieving 2%-10% higher power efficiency than conventional fixed on-time schemes with little circuit complexity added which is critical during light-loading conditions where quiescent current plays a pivotal role in determining efficiency and battery-life performance.;2007
INTRODUCTION: Educational technologies have had an important role in respiratory care. Distance learning via postal correspondence has been used extensively in respiratory care and Internet-based distance learning is now used in the training of respiratory therapists (RTs) clinical continuing education and in baccalaureate degree and higher programs for RTs and educators. OBJECTIVES: To describe the current scope of respiratory care educational technology integration including distance learning. To investigate online research potential in respiratory care. METHODS: A probabilistic online survey of United States respiratory care program directors was conducted on educational technology practices and attitudes including distance learning. A parallel exploratory study of United States respiratory care managers was conducted. RESULTS: One-hundred seventy-seven (53%) program directors participated. One-hundred twenty-eight respiratory care managers participated. For instructional purposes the respiratory care programs heavily use office-productivity software the Internet e-mail and commercial respiratory care content-based computer-based instruction. The programs use or would use online resources provided by text publishers but there is a paucity. Many program directors reported that their faculty use personal digital assistants (PDAs) often in instructional roles. 74.6% of the programs offer no fully online courses but 61.0% reported at least one course delivered partially online. The managers considered continuing education via online technologies appropriate but one third reported that they have not/will not hire RTs trained via distance learning. Neither group considered fully online courses a good match for RT training nor did they consider training via distance learning of comparable quality to on-campus programs. Both groups rated baccalaureate and higher degrees via distance learning higher if the program included face-to-face instruction. Online distance-learning participatory experience generally improved attitudes toward distance learning. There was a good match between manager RT expectations in office-productivity software and program instructional practices. CONCLUSIONS: Educational technologies have an important role in respiratory care. Online distance learning for baccalaureate and higher degrees in respiratory care is promising. Online distance learning in respiratory care must include face-to-face instruction. Distance-learning deploy- ment in respiratory care will require resources. A follow-up probabilistic survey of United States respiratory care managers is needed. Online surveys conducted for respiratory care are promising but neither less expensive nor easier than conventional means.;2007
Introduction: As the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) grows the value of reflection of learning and practice draws increased attention from policymakers and evaluators. To learn more about the use of PDAs in practice and learning the present study describes use of (1) PDAs in patient care and (2) a PDA version of the Virginia Board of Medicine Continuing Competency and Assessment Form (CCAF) a learning portfolio intended to encourage documentation of reflection on practice and medical education. Methods: A purposive sample of 10 practicing physicians (6 male 7 primary care) was recruited from geographic regions throughout Virginia. Five participants were previous users of a PDA. Three sources of data were analyzed: (1) a questionnaire describing PDA usage (2) transcripts from telephone interviews and (3) CCAF written comments. A study team member installed the PDA system and conducted individualized training on the basis of current equipment software and skills of the learner. Telephone interviews were completed 4-6 months after training. Results: All physicians accessed the system after training. Use of the PDA was associated with the value of information for making clinical decisions. Information accessed by PDA was used not only for clinical decisions but also for patient education and for teaching medical students. Use of the CCAF prompted physicians to reflect on changes in clinical practice. Discussion: Training on the handheld equipment and applications should include assessment of systems connectivity and integration access authority existing skills and previous use. Proponents of PDA use for clinical decisions should assure access to information that is useful to physicians for reflection on learning and practice.;2007
Introduction: Healthcare organisations are nowadays expecting the support of IT in the daily routines. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are in use in some healthcare organisations but in an irregular and unplanned way. The aim of the present study was to describe nurses' and nurse students' demands of functions and usability in a PDA. Methods: Interviews were made with 12 nurses at the County Hospital of Kalmar and a questionnaire was given to nurse students (n = 84) in their last i.e. third year at the Department of Health and Behavioural Sciences University of Kalmar. Results: There was a need for nurses to make the information in general more rich and efficient by means of a PDA. In a PDA the nurses and nurse students expected access to information about the patients knowledge resources and functions for their daily work. Conclusions: The nurses and nurse students had high expectations of a PDA for information retrieval. A PDA has the potential to be accepted as a supportive tool in healthcare organisations if it contains the demanded content which must be adapted to the users' needs and the general IT-system used and the PDA must have a user friendly design.

Introduction: There is little known about the learning that is undertaken by physicians who graduate from a World Health Organization-listed medical school outside Canada and who migrate to Canada to practice. What do physicians learn and what resources do they access in adapting to practice in Alberta a province of Canada? Methods: Telephone interviews with a theoretical sample of 19 IMG physicians were analyzed using a grounded theory constant comparative approach to develop categories central themes and a descriptive model. Results: The physicians described two types of learning: learning associated with studying for Canadian examinations required to remain and practice in the province and learning that was required to succeed at clinical work in a new setting. This second type of learning included regulations and systems patient expectations new disease profiles new medications new diagnostic procedures and managing the referral process. The physicians settled into their new setting with the help of colleagues the Internet personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers reading and continuing medical education programs. Patients both stimulated learning and were a resource for learning. Discussion: Settling into Alberta Canada physicians accommodated and adjusted to their settings with learning activities related to the clinical problems and situations that presented themselves. Collegial support in host communities appeared to be a critical dimension in how well physicians adjusted. The results suggest that mentoring programs may be a way of facilitating settlement.;2007
It is necessary for modern-day laboratory specialists (clinical biochemists microbiologists etc) to be able to access current scientific information at anytime and anywhere without difficulty. Even though there have been dazzling advances in informatics accessing the necessary information in existing databases requires remarkable amount of effort and time. Commercial softwares for personal digital assistants seem to provide an effective solution to this problem. In this study the effectiveness of 11 selected commercial software products (Uptodate ePocrates Inforetrive Pepid eMedicine FIRST Consult and 5 laboratory e-books released by Skyscape and/or Isilo) and the benefits of their use were examined by seven laboratory experts. The following items regarding the content considered while evaluating the software: How many tests were included in for example does the software contain detailed information for each test on process method interpretation of results reference ranges critical values interferences equations pathophysiology supplementary technical details such as sample collection and additional information such as linked references evidence based data price etc. In terms of technique the following items are considered: how much memory required to run the software? Is the graphical user interface user friendly? What is the frequency of new and/or up-date releases? It is obvious that there is no single unique software product that can provide solution to all of the above mentioned problems. Interpretation of laboratory results requires not only easy-to-use software (such as ePocrates and Skyscape e-books) but an integrated software (such as Uptodate Pepid Inforetrieve etc). Methodological information is mostly not included in the software evaluated. However it seems likely these shortcomings will be fixed in the near future and personal digital assistants and relevant medical applications will become indispensable for all physicians including laboratory specialists in education and in patient care.;2007
Manual transcription inaccuracies have been reported to be a frequent occurrence in clinical practice which has been confirmed in my institution. I explored alternative methods of obtaining data directly from the Puritan Bennett ventilator. The aim of this project was to record all of the ventilator settings and monitored data with wireless technology. I evaluated 2 data-capture methods: on-demand data capture into a personal digital assistant and continuous ventilator networking with a stand-alone computer. I was successful in both the intensive care unit and laboratory environment in transferring ventilator data for up to several days and with a data-capture interval as short as 60 seconds.;2007
Mechanisms are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of ever-increasing technological resources for nursing student use. The authors tracked the use of personal digital assistants versus textbook resources by junior-level baccalaureate nursing students throughout I semester. The authors discuss the results of that activity and provide a starting point for the evaluation of the use of personal digital assistants by nursing students.;2007
Mobile commerce generally defined as conducting information inquiries and/or business transactions by using mobile devices via wireless communications is considered the next big wave of investment and application of information technology. Mobile commerce is estimated to account for a sizable portion of the US$6.9 trillion e-commerce revenue by 2004. Although abundant research on the technology side of mobile commerce has been published there exists very limited research on the strategies and applications of M-commerce [A. Gunasekaran E. Ngai Call for papers: special issue on mobile commerce: strategies technologies and applications Decision Support Systems 35 (2003) 187-188. (15)]. We propose and validate a modified task-technology fit model to explore the factors affecting the effective adoption of mobile commerce in the insurance industry. In particular we study: (1) if the mobile commerce system based on personal digital assistant (PDA) technology is applicable for the insurance industry (2) whether individual differences will impact the cognitive fit of insurance agents' use of PDA mobile commerce system (3) which of the three major insurance tasks is better suited for the PDA technology and (4) which PDA technology characteristic is best for which type of insurance tasks. Our research finds that the PDA mobile commerce system is indeed suitable for the insurance industry. In terms of the impact of individual differences we discover that position experience cognitive style and computer self-efficacy are major factors that can predict the fit of applying PDA technology for insurance tasks. Counter conventional wisdom other demographic variables such as gender and age are found to be non-significant. Among three major insurance tasks we find that the PDA mobile technology provides the highest level of assistance in post-contract customer services followed by recruiting new insurance contracts and tax and legal information services.

Mobile devices such as Personal Digital Assistants Tablet PCs and cellular phones have greatly enhanced user capability to connect to remote resources. Although a large set of applications are now available bridging the gap between desktop and mobile devices visualization of complex 3D models is still a task hard to accomplish without specialized hardware. This paper proposes a system where a cluster of PCs equipped with accelerated graphics cards managed by the Chromium software is able to handle remote visualization sessions based on MPEG video streaming involving complex 3D models. The proposed framework allows mobile devices such as smart phones Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and Tablet PCs to visualize objects consisting of millions of textured polygons and voxels at a frame rate of 30 fps or more depending on hardware resources at the server side and on multimedia capabilities at the client side. The server is able to concurrently manage multiple clients computing a video stream for each one resolution and quality of each stream is tailored according to screen resolution and bandwidth of the client. The paper investigates in depth issues related to latency time bit rate and quality of the generated stream screen resolutions as well as frames per second displayed.;2007
Mobile working provides a portal whereby people who work away from the office are able to transfer information and photos to and from the office. Morrison Utility Services has a number of current mobile working initiatives all delivered through a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) that can send and receive data and photos via the mobile network.;2007
Multimedia services like television programs and live streaming of mobile videos can he delivered to mobile terminals via different access technologies. The question is - how do users perceive such services oil mobile terminals? The objective Of this study is to find the correlation between video quality thresholds and the user COMM. Our Study reveals the thresholds of user's quality of experience (QoE) in a mobile environment by using different categories of content types in relation to different access technologies and terminal capability. The mobile terminals used are: - (i) 3G Mobile Phone (ii) Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and (iii) Laptop. We argue that quality of service (QoS) management should be driven by (lie user perception of quality rather than resulting from raw engineering parameters such as latency jitter bandwidth etc. Our results will be ofreal interest to network operators. service providers terminal Manufacturers and researchers working in the area of quality of service management.;2007
New mobile information and communication technologies are of special interest to researchers seeking to understand the problematic of boundaries between work and personal-life. This study examines how workers used and interpreted the personal digital assistant (PDA) as a boundary management resource. Using a protocol that combined structured closed-ended questions with open-ended questions 42 users were interviewed. The data were analyzed to examine individuals' practices in using this technology the interpretive resources they drew upon and the ways in which the spirit of the device's design intersected with their practices and interpretations. Results suggest that the spirit of the device is control and that users interpreted their technological practices as expressions of personal agency using the PDA to control the work-life boundary through both integration and segmentation of work and personal-life.;2007
OBJECTIVE: To explore the use of web and palm digital assistant (PDA)-based patient logs to facilitate reflective learning in an ambulatory medicine clerkship. DESIGN: Thematic analysis of convenience sample of three successive rotations of medical students' patient log entries. SETTING: Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. PARTICIPANTS: MS3 and MS4 students rotating through a required block ambulatory medicine clerkship. INTERVENTIONS: Students are required to enter patient encounters into a web-based log system during the clerkship. Patient-linked entries included an open text field entitled Learning Need. Students were encouraged to use this field to enter goals for future study or teaching points related to the encounter. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The logs of 59 students were examined. These students entered 3051 patient encounters and 51 students entered 1347 learning need entries (44.1% of encounters). The use of the Learning Need field was not correlated with MS year gender or end-of-clerkship knowledge test performance. There were strong correlations between the use of diagnostic thinking comments and observations of therapeutic relationships (Pearson's r=.42 p < 0.001) and between diagnostic thinking and primary interpretation skills (Pearson's r=.60 p < 0.001) but not between diagnostic thinking and factual knowledge (Pearson's r =.10 p=.46). CONCLUSIONS: We found that when clerkship students were cued to reflect on each patient encounter with the electronic log system student entries grouped into categories that suggested different levels of reflective thinking. Future efforts should explore the use of such entries to encourage and track habits of reflective practice in the clinical curriculum.;2007
Objective. Chronic pain is a common and costly syndrome which affects approximately one in three US adults. Factors such as shortened length of the medical visit increased availability of technological approaches to care and a more informed patient all suggest that a new paradigm is required for chronic pain management. Although much has been written about the use of electronic diaries in clinical trials little has been presented about the use of these diaries in clinic practice and their potential for changing pain behavior. The intent of this preliminary study is to measure accessibility and usability of a software program designed for use on a personal digital assistant and to discuss how the software program may impact clinic practice and patient behavior. Methods. We present the results of a preliminary randomized comparison crossover trial of 36 chronic pain patients who were asked to monitor their pain mood activity interference medication use and pain location on either a paper or electronic diary for 2 weeks. Patients in the electronic diary condition were able to observe changes in their ratings over time and view them on a secure web site. Results. No differences were found between paper and electronic tracking on pain descriptors pain interference mood or helpfulness of medication. Similar to past findings patients found the electronic diary easier to use (P < 0.0001) and would continue using it (P < 0.05) over paper if given the choice. Importantly patients using the electronic diary reported more frequently that a provider suggested medication change (P < 0.05) based on feedback from the electronic diary. One trend requiring further investigation is that electronic diary users reported that the diary enabled them and their doctor to make care adjustments according to changes in pain status. Conclusion. This study goes beyond previous research on preference and data quality to investigate how the information provided may affect patient and physician perspectives toward pain management. Although not the initial intent of this study findings indicate that electronic tracking may provide information which can affect management decisions. A follow-up study is ongoing to investigate these initial results. If found to be true electronic monitoring may have broad implications for health care policy and improvement in quality of care for chronic pain sufferers in the future.;2007
Objective. The patient perspective workshops at the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials have included daily measures of health status (patient diary) and use of electronic tools for data collection in the research agenda. The objective of this study was to compare daily and weekly registrations of self-reported health status measures between personal digital assistant (PDA) and paper-pencil (PP) format regarding scores variation and feasibility. Methods. Thirty-eight patients with stable rheumatoid arthritis recorded their health status during 84 days in a repeated crossover design using PDA or PP format during four 21-day periods. Visual analog scales (VAS) for pain fatigue and global disease and the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index were scored daily the Short Form 36 and Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire were scored weekly. Results. The average scores and measures of variation of the 4 daily health status measures over 21 days did not differ significantly between PDA and PP formats in either of the 2 crossover periods. The values for the average range between the maximum and minimum values for daily measures were similar between the 2 formats but showed considerable variation (e.g. range for pain VAS was 19-28 mm over each 21-day period). The time to complete the instruments was similar between the 2 formats. Missing daily data entries were generally low for both periods and somewhat higher for PDA. The majority of patients (82.9%) preferred using PDA. Conclusion. Daily assessments with PDA may be efficiently used for frequent data collection because this format performs similarly to the traditional PP format.;2007
Objective.-To evaluate prospectively the efficacy and safety of almotriptan 12.5 mg as compared to placebo when administered within 1 hour of headache pain onset for the acute treatment of 3 migraine headaches. Background.-Although clinical trials have reported improved outcomes when triptans were used early or to treat mild pain acceptance of this treatment strategy has been hampered by both efficacy and tolerability issues. Methods.-In this multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group trial patients with IHS-migraine were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treat 3 consecutive migraine attacks with either almotriptan 12.5 mg or placebo. Patients were instructed to take their study medication at the first sign of headache pain of any intensity within 1 hour of onset and to record their symptoms at multiple time points during their headaches using a personal digital assistant. Clinical trial efficacy results for the first study headache and safety data for the entire study are presented. Results.-A total of 378 patients were randomized 189 to each group 162 almotriptan-treated patients and 155 placebo-treated patients were evaluable for efficacy. Almotriptan treatment compared to placebo resulted in a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving 2-hour pain free (37.0% vs 23.9% P= .010) 2-hour pain relief (72.3% vs 48.4% P < .001) and sustained pain free (24.7% vs 16.1% P = .040). Significant differences in pain free (P = .026) and pain relief (P = .019) between almotriptan and placebo also were observed at 1 hour. At 2 to 4 hours and 4 to 24 hours after treatment the mean intensity of phonophobia and photophobia were significantly lower in the patients treated with almotriptan compared to the placebo-treated patients. A greater proportion of patients treating with almotriptan versus placebo reported normal functionality within 2 hours postdose (54.4% vs 38.1% P = .007) and 4 hours postdose (74.5% vs 54.3% P < .001). The percentage of patients experiencing 1 or more treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) was 9.8% for almotriptan and 6.4% for placebo. The only treatment-emergent AEs that occurred with a frequency of at least 1% (equivalent to 2 or more patients) in the almotriptan and placebo groups respectively were somnolence (1.1% and 2.3%) nausea (1.1% and 1.7%) vomiting (1.1% and 0.6%) and fatigue (1.1% and 0%). Conclusion.-Treatment with almotriptan within 1 hour of migraine onset resulted in significantly better clinical outcomes than placebo and tolerability similar to placebo. Acute medications such as almotriptan that are both effective and well tolerated may encourage patients to access acute treatment earlier.;2007
Objective: Better quality bystander first-aid could improve outcome rates foremergency victims significantly. In this case-control study we hypothesised that expert knowledge presented step-by-step to untrained helpers using a personal digital assistant (PDA) would improve the quality of bystanders basic life support. Method: We confronted 101 lay-helpers with two standard emergency situations. (1) An unconscious trauma victim with severe bleeding. (2) Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Performance was assessed using an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). One group was supported by a PDA providing visual and audio instructions whereas the control group acted only with their current knowledge. The expert system was programmed in HTML-code and displayed on the PDA's Internet browser. Results: The maximum score obtainable was 24 points corresponding to optimal treatment. The control group without the PDA reached 14.8 +/- 3.5 (mean value standard deviation) whereas the PDA supported group scored significantly higher (21.9 +/- 2.7 p < 0.01). The difference in performance was measurable in all criteria tested and particularly notable in the items: placing in recovery position airway management and quality of CPR. Conclusion: The PDA based expert system increased the performance of untrained helpers supplying emergency care significantly. Since Internet compatible mobile devices have become widely available a significant quality improvement in bystander first-aid seems possible. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Objectives. This article will address the process involved in the development and implementation of a clinician-driven portable electronic chart on an Acute Pain Management Service (APMS). We describe the latest version of the program and provide 1 year of clinical data. Setting. Tertiary care center in Kingston Ontario Canada. Patients. All patients admitted to the APMS between August 1 2005 and July 31 2006. Results. A total of 8726 APMS visits were made to 2528 patients. Mean length of stay on the Service was 2.3 days. Sixty-one percent of patients reported an active pain score > 3/10. Pain scores were highest with hip or knee surgery. Thirty-five percent of patients reported nausea. Conclusions. Executive sponsorship alignment with institutional priorities and user input are essential to the development implementation adoption and sustainability of an electronic patient record. Ready access to data at the bedside can improve quality of care while ongoing comprehensive data can contribute to Phase IV drug trials. Incorporating both clinical and research outcomes in the database improves data quality and usability but must be balanced with the impact of clinical time constraints on documentation. Wireless technology and Tablet computers provide portability and adequate screen size for documentation and reviewing of patient data on an acute pain service. It is necessary to provide solutions to process issues such as printing electronic records during the transition from paper to electronic records.;2007
Objectives: To evaluate the effects of using an audiovisual animation (i.e. digital video) displayed on a personal digital assistant (PDA) for patient education in a clinical setting. Methods: Quasi-experimental study of a prospective technology intervention conducted in an outpatient infectious diseases clinic at an academic medical center. Subjects responded to questions immediately before immediately after and 4-6 weeks after watching a digital video on a PDA. Outcome measures include participant knowledge of disease knowledge of medications and knowledge of adherence behaviors attitudes toward the video and PDA self-reported adherence and practicality of the intervention. Results: Fifty-one English-speaking adults who were initiating or taking medications for the treatment of HIV/AIDS participated in the study. At visit one statistically significant improvements in knowledge of disease (p < 0.005 paired t-test) knowledge of medications (p < 0.005 paired t-test) and knowledge of adherence behaviors (P < 0.05 ANOVA) were measured after participants watched the PDA-based video. At visit two (4-6 weeks later) statistically significant improvements in self-reported adherence to the medication regimens (p < 0.005 paired t-test) were reported. Participants liked the PDA-based video and indicated that it was an appropriate medium for learning regardless of their baseline literacy skills. The video education process was estimated to take 25 min of participant time and was viewed in both private and semi-private locations. Conclusions: Technology-assisted education using a digital video delivered via PDA is a convenient and potentially powerful way to deliver health messages. The intervention was implemented efficiently with participants of a variety of ages and educational levels and in a range of locations within clinical environments. Additional study of this methodology is warranted. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2007
Online systems have come to be heavily used in education particularly for online learning and collecting information not otherwise readily available. Most e-learning systems including interactive learning systems have been designed to push course materials to students but rarely to collect or pull ideas from them. The interactive mechanisms in proposed instructional design models however prevent many potential designers from improving course quality even though some believe that the learning experience and the comments of students are important for enhancing course materials. As well students could actually contribute to instructional design. This paper presents a course material enhancement process that elicits ideas from students by encouraging students to modify course materials. This process had been tested on different higher education programs both graduate and undergraduate. It aims to understand which programs' students have a higher willingness to participate in this work and if they can benefit from this process. To facilitate this research an asynchronous interaction system teacher digital assistant (TDA) was designed for teachers to receive responses recommendations and modified materials from students at any time. The major advantage of this process is that it could embed students' thoughts into the course material to improve the curriculum which can benefit future students. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

People possess an innate need to belong that drives social interactions. Aberrations in the need to belong such as social anhedonia and social anxiety provide a point of entry for examining this need. The current study used experience-sampling methodology to explore deviations in the need to belong in the daily lives of 245 undergraduates. Eight times daily for a week personal digital assistants signaled subjects to complete questionnaires regarding affect thoughts and behaviors. As predicted higher levels of social anhedonia were associated with increased time alone greater preference for solitude and lower positive affect. Higher social anxiety in contrast was associated with higher negative affect and was not associated with increased time alone. Furthermore greater social anxiety was associated with greater self-consciousness and preference to be alone while interacting with unfamiliar people. Thus deviations in the need to belong affect social functioning differently depending on whether this need is absent or thwarted.;2007
Personal Digital Assistant devices are becoming a frequently used device for the bedside care of the patient. Ways of application are many but limitations are also numerous. Input device and monitor resolution are limited by the device size. Moreover the choice of specific programs and the amount of storable data are limited by the quantity of memory. During HandHealth project a system was developed using a different point of view. Personal Digital Assistant is only a means to access data and use functionalities that are stored in a remote server. Using that system patient ward note can be showed and collected on the handheld device but saved directly on the Hospital Information System. Medical images can be showed on but also transferred to a high-resolution monitor. Large amount of data the device display can be dictated and translated by remote continuous speech recognition.

Phase change material (PCM)-based heat sink consisting of a conventional extruded aluminum sink embedded with appropriate PCMs can potentially be used for cooling of mobile electronic devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and notebooks which are operated intermittently. During the use of such mobile devices the orientation changes from time to time. A numerical investigation was carried out to study the effect of orientation of heat sink on the thermal performance of the combined cooling system to determine if it affects the thermal performance of a PCM-based cooling system significantly.

Purpose - The aim of this work is to explore the use of lightweight but effective user interfaces for mobile navigation and wayfinding in urban environments. Design/methodology/approach - Two interactive mobile interfaces were designed and implemented following a user-centred approach. The first interface makes use of 2D digital technology such as different representations of 2D maps and textual information. To enhance the user experience during navigation location aware searches may be performed indicating information about the surroundings. The second interface makes use of virtual reality (VR) and computer graphics to present 3D maps and textual information. The VR maps are also interactive and contain hyperlinks positioned in 3D space which link to either web pages or other multimedia content. Findings - Both interfaces allow users to visualise and interact with different levels of representation of urban maps. Initial evaluation has been performed to test the usability of the 2D interface and limitations of the 21) technology were recorded. To overcome these limitations and explore the potentials of alternative technologies a VR interface was prototyped and a pilot evaluation was conducted. Practical implications - This paper provides two prototype interfaces with some initial evaluation that may be useful for future navigation and wayfinding systems. Originality/value - As more and more people make use of mobile technologies and advanced interfaces to enhance access to location-based services this paper offers two prototype interfaces for personal digital assistants that provide solutions to urban navigation and wayfinding.;2007
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe an experiment in introducing fiction e-books in two reading groups run by a public library. Design/methodology/approach - A user study involving two reading groups run over a period of three months. Electronic versions of titles of interest to each group were given out to each participant on Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Readers were then asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire and discuss their experience with the rest of their group. Findings - Readers were not too negative about using a new tool/gadget like the PDA but they did not see any advantage in reading an electronic version of the selected book. Research limitations/implications - It was realised quite earlier on that the target readers were emotionally so attached to physical books to feel as if they were betraying them when reading them electronically. A different sample of users more inclined to use technology and more open to different publishing models would have possibly provided a better insight. Originality/value - The group reading approach introduced a social side to the adoption of e-books and it was hoped that that would have made a difference. It was also one of the first attempts to look into the use of fiction e-books in public libraries as opposed to an already existing number of studies looking into e-books and their use in education and academic libraries. As such it can benefit both publishers and librarians.;2007
Purpose To determine the types of information sources that evidence-based medicine (EBM)-trained family medicine residents use to answer clinical questions at the point of care to assess whether the sources are evidence-based and to provide suggestions for more effective information-management strategies in residency training. Method In 2005 trained medical students directly observed (for two half-days per physician) how 25 third-year family medicine residents retrieved information to answer clinical questions arising at the point of care and documented the type and name of each source. the retrieval location and the estimated time spent consulting the source. An end-of-study questionnaire asked 37 full-time faculty and the participating residents about the best information sources available subscriptions owned why they use a personal digital assistant (PDA) to practice medicine and their experience in preventing medical errors using a PDA. Results Forty-four percent of questions were answered by attending physicians 23% by consulting PDAs and 20% from books. Seventy-two percent of questions were answered within two minutes. Residents rated UptoDate as the best source for evidence-based information but they used this source only five times. PDAs were used because of ease of use time factors and accessibility. All examples of medical errors discovered or prevented with PDA programs were medication related. None of the participants' residencies required the use of a specific medical information resource. Conclusions The results support the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality's call for medical system improvements at the point of care. Additionally it may be necessary to teach residents better information-management skills in addition to EBM skills.;2007
Purpose. The literature describing pharmacists' use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) as intervention documentation tools in health systems is reviewed. Methods. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts to find articles whose title and abstract indicated that the articles' content addressed pharmacists' use of PDAs as intervention documentation tools. Qualitative analyses were conducted to characterize the existing literature on pharmacists' use of PDAs to document interventions in health systems. The articles were categorized using eight characteristics: study type objective setting participants PDA platform documentation software results and conclusions. Results. A total of 12 articles were included in this review. All articles were classified as descriptive. Two studies lacked objectives while 10 contained explicitly stated objectives or objectives that could be inferred from article content. The majority of implementation processes occurred in acute care teaching facilities. All study participants were pharmacists. The majority of articles described PDA-based documentation by more than one pharmacist. Results from the articles can be divided into four categories: no measurable comparison performed anecdotal comparison performed survey data reported and measurable comparison performed. Three articles specifically presented information regarding security and confidentiality of patient information. Each article described the use of password protection for the PDAs. Conclusion. The use of PDAs may increase the frequency and number of interventions documented by pharmacists however there is a lack of well-designed studies reporting the overall outcomes of using PDAs for intervention documentation by pharmacists.;2007
Purpose: Our study aims to develop a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based wireless application in medical information processing by using Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11b wireless standards and SyncML codes. Methods: In this study an integrated database access module is used to provide a unified integrated access interface while consistency of wireless data transmission is achieved by using the standardized SyncML protocol. A prototype of the system has been developed implemented and tested for its mobility usability stability and performance with questionnaire survey. Results: Response time for browsing/searching was usually less than 3 s. The average time intervals needed for data transmissions were 68.6 +/- 8.5 s for Bluetooth and 47.0 +/- 4.8 s for 802.11b. The five-point Likert scale (from 1 = least to 5 = most) questionnaire survey of 30 medical professionals yielded a high degree of satisfaction with the system's mobility (4.18 +/- 0.89) usability (4.69 +/- 0.90) stability (3.81 +/- 0.94) and performance (3.97 +/- 0.88). Conclusion: The results of our study suggested that PDA applications which exploit wireless communication are convenient and feasible in clinical practice. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Quality control (QC) of external beam radiotherapy equipment ensures that commissioning performance is maintained. Paper based data recording is still used for QC but this is resource intensive in terms of data calculation and processing. Electronic systems of data recording have many advantages for example they facilitate the analysis of data on a regular basis allowing the user to examine the health of each machine they help review and audit local frequencies of each check and can possibly predict component failure. They also allow for secure calculation of results and automatic charting for routine trend analysis. Initially data recording at our centre was paper-based for daily weekly and monthly checks. This paper system has been successfully replaced with an electronic system for QC data recording and processing for linear accelerators and superficial units. The system makes use of personal digital assistants and networked laptops for online recording of data and networked desktop PCs for offline work. The systems of data recording have been designed using the. power of macros within Microsoft Excel which automatically calculate each QC parameter and charts the data recorded for long-term analysis of trends. As of the beginning of 2006 these systems have been fully implemented. The benefits of implementing such a system are numerous for example central storage backup and archiving of data for greater security and reducing operator errors in calculations. Other benefits are discussed within the paper. In the future we hope to develop similar systems of data recording for QC checks on other radiotherapy equipment.;2007
Rapid advances in wireless communications and networking technologies linked with advances in computing and medical technologies facilitate the development and offering of emerging mobile systems and services in the healthcare sector. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the current status and challenges of mobile health systems (m-health) in emergency healthcare systems and services (e-emergency). The paper covers a review of recent e-emergency systems including the wireless technologies used as well as the data transmitted (electronic patient record bio-signals medical images and video subject video and other). Furthermore emerging wireless video systems for reliable communications in these applications are presented. We anticipate that m-health e-emergency systems will significantly affect the delivery of healthcare however their exploitation in daily practice still remains to be achieved.;2007
Recent advances in embedded computing systems have led to the emergence of wireless sensor networks (SNETs) consisting of small battery-powered '' motes '' with limited computation and radio communication capabilities. SNETs permit data gathering and computation to be deeply embedded in the physical environment. Large-scale ad hoc sensor networks (ASNET) when deployed among mobile patients can provide dynamic data query architecture to allow medical specialists to monitor patients at any place via the web or cellular network. In case of an emergency doctors and/or nurses will be contacted automatically through their handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs) or cellular phones. In specific the proposed network consists of sensor nodes at the first layer whose responsibility is to measure collect and communicate via wired or wireless interface readings to a microcontroller representing the second layer of the architecture. Deployed microcontrollers process incoming readings and report to a central system via a wireless interface. The implemented network distinguishes between periodic sensor readings and critical or event driven readings where higher priority is given for the latter. In this paper we implement 3 special cases for tracking and monitoring patients and doctors using SNETs. In addition the performance of a large scale of our implementation has been tested by means of mathematical analysis.;2007
Recent years have seen steady improvements in the quality and performance of speech-based human-machine interaction driven by a significant convergence in the methods and techniques employed. However the quantity of training data required to improve state-of-the-art systems seems to be growing exponentially and performance appears to be asymptotic to a level that may be inadequate for many real-world applications. This suggests that there may be a fundamental flaw in the underlying architecture of contemporary systems as well as a failure to capitalize on the combinatorial properties of human spoken language. This paper addresses these issues and presents a novel architecture for speech-based human-machine interaction inspired by recent findings in the neurobiology of living systems. Called PRESENCE-PREdictive SENsorimotor Control and Emulation - this new architecture blurs the distinction between the core components of a traditional spoken language dialogue system and instead focuses on a recursive hierarchical feedback control structure. Cooperative and communicative behavior emerges as a by-product of an architecture that is founded on a model of interaction in which the system has in mind the needs and intentions of a user and a user has in mind the needs and intentions of the system.;2007
Recognition errors made by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems may not prevent the development of useful dialogue applications if the interpretation strategy has an introspection capability for evaluating the reliability of the results. This paper proposes an interpretation strategy which is particularly effective when applications are developed with a training corpus of moderate size. From the lattice of word hypotheses generated by an ASR system a short list of conceptual structures is obtained with a set of finite state machines (FSM). Interpretation or a rejection decision is then performed by a tree-based strategy. The nodes of the tree correspond to elaboration-decision units containing a redundant set of classifiers. A decision tree based and two large margin classifiers are trained with a development set to become interpretation knowledge sources. Discriminative training of the classifiers selects linguistic and confidence-based features for contributing to a cooperative assessment of the reliability of an interpretation. Such an assessment leads to the definition of a limited number of reliability states. The probability that a proposed interpretation is correct is provided by its reliability state and transmitted to the dialogue manager. Experimental results are presented for a telephone service application.;2007
Remote teleconsultation by specialists is important for timely correct and specialized emergency surgical and medical decision making. In this paper we designed a new personal digital assistant (PDA)-phone-based emergency teleradiology system by combining cellular communication with Bluetooth-interfaced local wireless links. The mobility and portability resulting from the use of PDAs and wireless communication can provide a more effective means of emergency teleconsultation without requiring the user to be limited to a fixed location. Moreover it enables synchronized radiological image sharing between the attending physician in the emergency room and the remote specialist on picture archiving and communication system terminals without distorted image acquisition. To enable rapid and fine-quality radiological image transmission over a cellular network in a secure manner progressive compression and security mechanisms have been incorporated. The proposed system is tested over a code division Multiple Access 1x-Evolution Data-Only network to evaluate the performance and to demonstrate the feasibility of this system in a real-world setting.;2007
Reporting bias in adolescent behavioural research may be overcome with the use of personal digital assistants (PDA) or other computer based technologies. However there is little insight into the use of these tools among adolescents in low resource settings. We compared self-administered paper questionnaires with PDA questionnaires to collect sexual behaviour data from a sample of 11-19 year olds living in a periurban Xhosa-speaking community in South Africa. There was a high level of agreement between sexual risk behaviour data collected via each method (kappas >= 0.50). Data collected from the PDA questionnaires were more complete. Subjectively adolescents found the use of PDA to be simple and confidential. PDA may be a useful method to collect sensitive self-reported information from adolescents in resource-limited settings.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a major impact on physical and psychological health. It can cause severe disability and reduce health-related quality of life aspects that are important to patients. Thus it is important to measure disability and health-related quality of life in clinical practice and in clinical trials. This article presents an overview of the most important measures of outcome concerning disability and health-related quality of life including different forms of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ MHAQ MDHAQ HAQ II) visual analogue scales for fatigue and function SF-36 Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS/AIMS2) the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (PAQoL) questionnaire Nottingham Health Profile Sickness Impact Profile and the utility instruments 15D EQ-5D SF-6D and Health Utilities Index (HUI) 2 and 3.;2007
Secure group communication is an important research issue for network security because of the popularity of group-oriented applications such as electronic conferences and collaborative works. The secure group key agreement protocol design is crucial for achieving secure group communications. As we all know most security technologies are currently deployed in wired networks and are not fully applicable to wireless networks involving mobile devices with limited computing capability. In 2005 Nam et al. proposed a group key agreement protocol for a wireless environment. Unfortunately in this paper we present that their protocol has a security weakness in which participants cannot confirm that their contributions were actually involved in the group key establishment. This is an important property of group key agreement. Therefore we propose a new group key agreement protocol for an imbalanced wireless network consisting of many mobile nodes with limited computing capability and a powerful node with less restriction. We show that the proposed protocol produces contributory group key agreement. We demonstrate that the proposed protocol is provably secure against passive attacks under the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem assumption. A simulation result on a personal digital assistant (PDA) shows that the proposed protocol is well suited for mobile devices with limited computing capability. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Speech communication interfaces (SCI) are nowadays widely used in several domains. Automated spoken language human-computer interaction can replace human-human interaction if needed. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) a key technology of SCI has been extensively studied during the past few decades. Most of present systems are based on statistical modeling both at the acoustic and linguistic levels. Increased attention has been paid to speech recognition in adverse conditions recently since noise-resistance has become one of the major bottlenecks for practical use of speech recognizers. Although many techniques have been developed many challenges still have to be overcome before the ultimate goal - creating machines capable of communicating with humans naturally - can be achieved. In this paper we describe the research and development of the first Slovak spoken language dialogue system. The dialogue system is based on the DARPA Communicator architecture. The proposed system consists of the Galaxy hub and telephony automatic speech recognition text-to-speech back-end transport and VoiceXML dialogue management modules. The SCI enables multi-user interaction in the Slovak language. Functionality of the SLDS is demonstrated and tested via two pilot applications Weather forecast for Slovakia and Timetable of Slovak Railways. The required information is retrieved from Internet resources in multi-user mode through PSTN ISDN GSM and/or VoIP network.;2007
Study Objectives. To evaluate personal digital assistant (PDA) drug information databases used to support clinical decision-making and to compare the performance of PDA databases with their online versions. Design. Prospective evaluation with descriptive analysis. Methods. Five drug information databases available for PDAs and online were evaluated according to their scope (inclusion of correct answers) completeness (on a 3-point scale) and ease of use 158 question-answer pairs across 15 weighted categories of drug information essential to health care professionals were used to evaluate these databases. An overall composite score integrating these three measures was then calculated. Scores for the PDA databases and for each PDA-online pair were compared. Results. Among the PDA databases composite rankings from highest to lowest were as follows: Lexi-Drugs Clinical Pharmacology OnHand Epocrates Rx Pro mobileMicromedex (now called Thomson Clinical Xpert) and Epocrates Rx free version. When we compared database pairs online databases that had greater scope than their PDA counterparts were Clinical Pharmacology (137 vs 100 answers p<0.001) Micromedex (132 vs 96 answers p<0.001) Lexi-Comp Online (131 vs 119 answers p<0.001) and Epocrates Online Premium (103 vs 98 answers p=0.001). Only Micromedex online was more complete than its PDA version (p=0.008). Regarding ease of use the Lexi-Drugs PDA database was superior to Lexi-Comp Online (p<0.001) however Epocrates Online Premium Epocrates Online Free and Micromedex online were easier to use than their PDA counterparts (p<0.001). In terms of composite scores only the online versions of Clinical Pharmacology and Micromedex demonstrated superiority over their PDA versions (p<0.01). Conclusion. Online and PDA drug information databases assist practitioners in improving their clinical decision-making. Lexi-Drugs performed significantly better than all of the other PDA databases evaluated. No PDA database demonstrated superiority to its online counterpart however the online versions of Clinical Pharmacology and Micromedex were superior to their PDA versions in answering questions.;2007
The advancement of traffic and computer networks makes the world more and more internationalized and increases the frequency of communications between people who speak different languages and show different nonverbal behaviors. To improve the communication of embodied conversational agent (ECA) systems with their human users the importance of their capability to cover cultural differences emerged. Various excellent ECA systems are developed and proposed previously however the cross-culture communication issues are seldom addressed by researchers. This paper describes a short-term project aiming to explore the possibility of rapidly building multicultural and the multimodal ECA interfaces for a tour guide system by using a generic framework connecting their functional blocks.;2007
The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of modality on collaboration processes between human and computer. Spoken and written interactions with a natural language dialogue system were compared using two real information-retrieval systems. In order to look for a restaurant (Experiment 1) or plan a trip (Experiment 2) participants performed several task-oriented dialogue scenarios. Although the spoken interaction mode was less efficient it promoted collaboration the use of personal pronouns and the literal form of the system's command utterances. Overall in the written mode the emphasis was on the task and its performance rather than on dialogue. These findings are discussed with respect to the effect of communication mode on collaboration in human-computer dialogue. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2007
The ARES' (ANAM' Readiness Evaluation System) is a cognitive testing system designed for operation on palm OS handheld computers i.e. Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). It provides an inexpensive and portable testing platform for field and clinical applications. ARES test batteries can be configured from a library of tests derived from the ANAM test system. ARES features include support of multiple users on a single PDA a Microsoft Windows T-test battery authoring program and a program for downloading viewing graphing and archiving data. In validity tests the same subjects were tested on identical ARES and conventional ANAM NeuroCog test batteries. Scores from the two platforms correlated highly but absolute scores differed slightly. In reliability testing with the ARES Warrior battery ARES scores were highly correlated in daily tests. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of National Academy of Neuropsychology.;2007
The 'authenticity' of fictional dialogue is widely held to play a pivotal role in shaping the audience's perception of the quality of a film. Yet the factors that account for the authenticity of both original and dubbed film conversation remain largely under-researched. This paper begins by outlining key contributions from the fields of stylistics film studies and corpus-based translation studies that have enhanced our understanding of the specific nature and dynamics of fictional dialogue and its translation. A common assumption that underpins these approaches is that the success of the narrative and characterization-enhancing resources deployed in a film is contingent on the build-up of interpersonal alignments through a combination of prefabricated orality and spontaneous-sounding conversation. And yet both film theory and dubbing studies have so far focused on phenomena that take place within a single turn-at-talk and hence neglected the study of the sequential dimension of film dialogue. Drawing on the analysis of four scenes of the English and Spanish versions of Twelve Angry Men (Sidney Lumet 1957) this article attempts to demonstrate the advantages of Martin's (2000a) systemic functional modelling of the exchange especially his notion of 'telos'. Ultimately this paper assesses the advantages of a heightened awareness of the sequential configuration of dialogue among dubbing practitioners.;2007
The authors describe the design and implementation of a new Web-based system that allows students to record important features of their clinical encounters during all 10 required clinical clerkships document their learning experiences in six major competency domains and generate detailed real-time reports for themselves and their clerkship directors. A new Web-based system DMEDS (Dartmouth Medical Encounter Documentation System) accepts input from computers and PDAs. Its design permits students to describe their patients learning sites interactions with preceptors and important aspects of their clinical encounters in all of our medical school's competency domains. Using a common format for all required clerkships clerkship directors select specific items most relevant to their clerkships from a common menu and set learning targets for specific diagnoses and clinical skills. This new system was designed in the fall of 2003 tested in the spring of 2004 and implemented in all clerkships for the 2004 to 2005 academic year. During the first full academic year that DMEDS was used students documented nearly 32000 discrete student-patient-preceptor encounters an average of between 21 and 120 clinical encounters per Year 3 clerkship. Highlights of the analysis of these initial data include the following: (1) insights into how educational targets are set (2) the extent of site-to-site variation in clerkship experiences (3) the epidemiology of patients' declining student involvement and (4) student experiences in and understanding of the newer competency domains. DMEDS can be used in all clinical clerkships and can address student experiences in all competency domains. It provides substantial value to students clerkship directors preceptors and medical school administrators. As secondary benefits the authors found that DMEDS facilitates educational research and is readily adapted for use in residency and fellowship programs as well. Student feedback highlights the need to pay close attention to the time invested by students documenting their clinical encounters. Course directors must ensure that the benefits to students (such as knowledge of meeting learning targets and preceptors providing direct feedback to students) are transparent. Finally for other schools contemplating the change to a competency-based curriculum with the use of a clinical encounter documentation system the time required for both students and faculty to adopt and fully engage these major educational culture shifts seems to be at least several years.;2007
The challenge of incorporating technology solutions into the daily practice of nursing has become a part of every nurse's role whether as a nurse executive educator manager or a staff nurse in acute care or community settings. The personal digital assistant is a rechargeable battery-operated handheld computer that usually includes an address book calendar notes calculator music player document reader and a variety of additional optional or cost-added applications. One of the most beneficial aspects of using a PDA for clinical decision making is that by connecting to the Internet for daily updates the tool is always current. No matter what your specialty area is being able to identify the important preventive services for each patient by age and risk factors will provide a contribution to quality outcomes.;2007
The empirical investigation of human gesture stands at the center of multiple research disciplines and various gesture annotation schemes exist with varying degrees of precision and required annotation effort. We present a gesture annotation scheme for the specific purpose of automatically generating and animating character-specific hand/arm gestures but with potential general value. We focus on how to capture temporal structure and locational information with relatively little annotation effort. The scheme is evaluated in terms of how accurately it captures the original gestures by re-creating those gestures on an animated character using the annotated data. This paper presents our scheme in detail and compares it to other approaches.;2007
The functionality of mobile devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) has evolved to include various applications where security is a critical concern (secure web transactions mobile commerce download and playback of protected audio/video content connection to corporate private networks etc.). Security mechanisms (e.g. secure communication protocols) involve cryptographic algorithms and are often quite computationally intensive challenging the constrained processing and battery resources of mobile devices. Extensive design effort and aggressive hardware and software optimizations are required to address this challenge. Previous work has addressed the design of hardware architectures (custom accelerators domain-specific processors etc.) to accelerate security processing and many emerging systems-on-chip (SoCs) feature some form of hardware support for security. In this paper we address the complementary problem of mapping a complex security software library to an SoC platform with security hardware enhancements. We present a systematic methodology for exploring the software architecture for security processing for a commercial heterogeneous multiprocessor SoC for mobile devices. The SoC contains multiple host processors executing applications and a dedicated programmable security processing engine. We developed an exploration methodology to map the code and data of security software libraries onto the platform with the objective of maximizing the overall application-visible performance. The salient features of the methodology include: 1) the use of real performance measurements from a prototyping board which contains the target platform to drive the exploration 2) a new data structure access profiling framework that allows us to accurately model the communication overheads involved in offloading a given set of functions to the security processor and 3) an exact branch-and-bound-based design space exploration algorithm that determines the best mapping of security library functions and data structures to the host and security processors. We used the proposed framework to map a commercial security library to the target mobile application SoC. The resulting optimized software architecture outperformed several manually designed software architectures resulting in up to 12.5x speed-up for individual cryptographic operations (encryption hashing) and 2.2-6.2x speed-up for applications such as a digital rights management (DRM) agent and secure sockets layer (SSL) client. We also demonstrate the applicability of our framework to software architecture exploration in other multiprocessor scenarios.;2007
The impact of the user's hand holding a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) terminal on system performance and specifically on channel capacity is investigated. A 4 x 4 MIMO system is considered with a personal digital assistant terminal equipped with a compact array of 4 patch elements. The proposed methodology is based on the use of radiation patterns of the antenna elements in the presence of the other elements and in the presence of a user's hand. Radiation patterns are obtained by means of simulations as well as of measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Two MIMO channel models are considered namely a correlation-based model and a geometry-based model where the antenna patterns are incorporated. The evaluation of MIMO channel capacity demonstrates the impact of the specific terminal antenna array. Moreover significant degradation of channel capacity is proved because of the presence of the user's hand.;2007
The open-vocabulary name recognition technique is one of the most challenging tasks in the application of automatic Chinese speech recognition technology. It can be used as the free name input method for telephony speech applications and automatic directory assistance systems. A Chinese name usually has two to three characters each of which is pronounced as a single tonal syllable. Obviously it is very confusing to recognize a three-syllable word from millions to billions of possible candidates. A novel interactive automatic-speech-recognition system is proposed to resolve this highly challenging task. This system was built as an open-vocabulary Chinese name recognition system using character-based approaches. Two important character-input speech-recognition modules were designed as backoff approaches in this system to complete the name input or to correct any misrecognized characters. Finite-state networks were compiled from regular grammar of syllable spellings and character descriptions for these two speech recognition modules. The possible candidate names cover more than five billions. This system has been tested publicly and proved a robust way to interact with the speaker. An 86.7% name recognition success rate was achieved by the interactive open-vocabulary Chinese name input system.;2007
The purpose of this study was to determine whether nursing medication errors could be reduced and nursing care provided more efficiently using personal digital assistant (PDA) technology. The sample for this study consisted of junior and senior undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students. By self-selection of owning a PDA or not students were placed in the PDA (experimental) group or the textbook (control) group provided with a case study to read and asked to answer six questions (i.e. three medication administration calculations and three clinical decisions based on medication administration). The analysis of collected data calculated using a t test revealed that the PDAgroup answered the six questions with greater accuracy and speed than did the textbook group.;2007
The purpose of this study was to understand elders' perception on 3 assistive technology devices that might enhance their safety and independence at home. This study also aimed to describe the perceptions of older persons who did not use these devices and their reasons for not using them. The following assistive technology devices were investigated: (1) personal digital assistant (2) home automation systems and (3) home health monitoring systems. Six hundred seventy-three older persons with chronic physical conditions were surveyed in 2001-2002. Although smart technology will play an increasingly important role in promoting independent living for older persons this study found that it has been underutilized by this population.;2007
The recent introduction and advancements in design of simple constant force mechanisms have created the potential for small-scale low-cost constant force electronic connectors (CFECs). CFECs differ from traditional connectors by the separation or disassociation of contact normalforce and contact deflection. By removing the traditional constraints imposed by forces and deflections that are dependent on each other new types of electronic connectors can be explored. These new designs may lead to smaller and more reliable electronic connectors. In this paper constant force mechanisms are adapted to satisfy current industry practices for the design of electronic connectors. Different CFEC configurations are explored and one is selected prototyped and used as a proof-of-concept connector for a personal digital assistant (PDA) docking station. The modeling optimization and verification of the prototype CFEC is presented. Adaptation of constant force technology to electronic connectors creates new possibilities in electronic connector designs including allowing an optimal contact force to be utilized to decrease the effects of fretting and wear lowering required manufacturing tolerances reducing the system's sensitivity to variations introduced by the user and increasing the system's robustness in applications where movement or vibrations exist.;2007
The Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) is a set of specifications and guidelines for the representation and operation of asynchronous distance learning. Since it was announced in late 1990s the reference model has been used by software developers and academics in the development of authoring tools learning management systems and repositories for distance learning content. To date most e-learning systems have been based on multimedia and Web technologies on personal computers. Our project Hard SCORM advances the field by implementing an integrated system which allows learners to read SCORM-compliant textbooks using multimodal multimedia devices. Hard SCORM employs a pen-like optical character reader device (called Hyper Pen) as an input mechanism. A computer a personal digital assistant or a cellular phone can be used for user behavior supervision using the Hard SCORM Machine. With an authoring tool specially designed tags are printed in textbooks and recognized by Hyper Pen for user navigation control. In this way users can read hardcopy textbooks in a traditional manner while the process of reading conforms to the SCORM specification. Part of the implemented system (Pocket SCORM on PDA) received the 2005 Brandon Hall Excellence in Learning Awards. The system has also been used by an airline company for online security checking and a high school for online mobile learning.;2007
The term Electronic Voting (e-voting) refers to the use of computers or computerized equipment to cast votes in an election. e-voting aims at increasing participation lowering the costs of running elections and improving the accuracy of the results. This paper details the requirements design and implementation of a special type of electronic voting systems the remote on-line voting system suitable for university setting where students can cast their votes anytime anywhere and using fixed and mobile electronic devices including personal computers personal digital assistants and smart and regular phones. To avoid web content replication for each of the connecting devices the implemented system separates the data content from its presentation form. The separation is achieved by using modem technologies such as the extensible markup language to represent the web data content and the extensible style language transformation style sheets to customize the presentation of such content on different connecting devices thus achieving true author once publish to any device design and implementation.

This article argues that a clear division between two sources of information-one oriented to world knowledge the other to linguistic semantics-offers a framework within which mechanisms for modelling the highly flexible relation between language and interpretation necessary for natural discourse can be specified and empirically validated. Moreover importing techniques and results from formal ontology provides the formal underpinnings necessary for representing these sources of information appropriately. The result is a computationally specifiable model of dialogic interaction within which flexible discourse interpretation occurs as the result of inter-ontology mappings between our two sources of information. These mappings are dynamically negotiated according to the concrete discourse moves of interlocutors. The article draws on ongoing empirical-studies in spatial discourse where interlocutors jointly solve varieties of spatially embedded tasks and suggests that ontological formalization benefits the construction of computational dialogue systems.;2007
This paper addresses the problem of recognizing a vocabulary of over 50000 city names in a telephone access spoken dialogue system. We adopt a two-stage framework in which only major cities are represented in the first stage lexicon. We rely on an unknown word model encoded as a phone loop to detect OOV city names (referred to as 'rare city' names). We use SpeM a tool that can extract words and word-initial cohorts from phone graphs from a large fallback lexicon to provide an N-best list of promising city name hypotheses on the basis of the phone graph corresponding to the OOV. This N-best list is then inserted into the second stage lexicon for a subsequent recognition pass. Experiments were conducted on a set of spontaneous telephone-quality utterances each containing one rare city name. It appeared that SpeM was able to include nearly 75% of the correct city names in an N-best hypothesis list of 3000 city names. With the names found by SpeM to extend the lexicon of the second stage recognizer a word accuracy of 77.3% could be obtained. The best one-stage system yielded a word accuracy of 72.6%. The absolute number of correctly recognized rare city names almost doubled from 62 for the best one-stage system to 102 for the best two-stage system. However AA even the best two-stage system recognized only about one-third of the rare city names retrieved by SpeM. The paper discusses ways for improving the overall performance in the context of an application. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2007
This paper argues that interactive knowledge acquisition systems would benefit from a tighter and more thorough incorporation of tutoring and learning principles. Current acquisition systems learn from users in a passive manner and could instead be designed to incorporate the proactive capabilities that one expects of a good student. We first describe our analysis of the literature on teacher-student interaction and present a compilation of tutoring and learning principles that are relevant to interactive knowledge acquisition systems. We then point out what tutoring and learning principles have been used to date in the acquisition literature though unintentionally and implicitly and discuss how a more thorough and explicit representation of these principles would help improve how computers learn from users. We present our design and an initial implementation of an acquisition dialogue system called SLICK that represents acquisition principles and goals explicitly and declaratively making the system actively reason about various acquisition tasks and generate its interactions dynamically. Finally we discuss promising directions in designing acquisition systems by structuring interactions with users according to tutoring and learning principles. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes an integrated system based on open-domain and domain-specific knowledge for the purpose of providing query-based intelligent web interaction. It is understood that general purpose conversational agents are not able to answer questions on specific domain subject. On the other hand domain specific systems lack the flexibility to handle common sense questions. To overcome the above limitations this paper proposed an integrated system comprises of an artificial intelligent conversation software robot or chatterbot called Artificial Intelligence Natural-language Identity (hereafter AINI) and an Automated Knowledge Extraction Agent (AKEA) for the acquisition of real world knowledge from the Internet. The objective of AKEA is to retrieve real world knowledge or information from trustworthy websites. AINI is the mechanism used to manage the knowledge and to provide appropriate answer to the user. In this paper we compare the performance of the proposed system against two popular search engines two question answering systems and two other conversational systems.;2007
This paper introduces the performance and technical features of the new generation international video coding standard H.264 as well as discusses the implementation and optimization of H.264 on mobile device. Our work is to implement H.264 Baseline Profile encoder and decoder on an HP IPAQ hx4700 PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) which has a powerful embedded processor PXA27x produced by Intel. By rising the way of system optimization algorithm optimization and instruction optimization we have successfully implemented the H.264 codec on mobile device and made great improvement in terms of coding speed with very little performance degradation in terms of PSNR and bit-rate. Experimental results show that the speed of our codec increases significantly after optimization (much more than 25frames per second). In the QCIF (176x144) resolution our codec can run in real time on the mobile device. Based on our optimized real-time H.264 codec a wireless video conferencing system is implemented and is described in this paper.;2007
This paper presents an internal dual-band patch antenna to be mounted above the system ground plane of the PDA (personal digital assistant) phone for GSM/DDCS operation. The antenna is supported by conducting pins (5 mm long in this study) and mounted above the system ground plane of the PDA phone. In this case the antenna does not directly occupy the system ground plane and a usable space between the antenna ground portion and the system ground plane is provided for accommodating associated conducting elements or electronic components of the PDA phone. A design example is demonstrated and obtained results are presented and discussed. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2007
This paper presents three novel color filter structures and a fuzzy mapping algorithm for improving brightness of color LCD systems. On the basis of human vision discrimination the three colorfilter structures with white sub-pixels are presented to enhance brightness of conventional stripe Delta and PenTile color filter architectures without loss of their original color saturation and resolution. A new fuzzy mapping algorithm using RGB Sub-pixel data around white sub-pixels is proposed to obtain better image quality Numerous simulation and experimental results are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed structures and mapping method. The proposed techniques can be expected to be pragmatic and effective in designing color LCD display systems for electronic consumer products such as notebooks personal digital assistants mobile phones and etc.;2007
This research has highlighted the importance of the prolonged reading of e-book displays and three popular e-book displays including a personal digital assistant (PDA) an e-book reader (Reader) and a notebook computer (NB) were evaluated in ergonomic perspective. Twenty-two university students (11 males and 11 females) participated in the formal experiment. They performed three 100-min reading trials with a different display for each trial. Visual fatigue reading performance and subjective satisfaction were collected at the end of each trial. The results are as follows: first visual fatigue was significantly greater when subjects read from the PDA compared with the other two displays. Second reading speed and accuracy rate were not significantly different among the three displays. Third female subjects tended to have better reading performance than male subjects did. Finally the subjects preferred the NB to the other two displays because the NB had the highest satisfaction ratings in text legibility luminance contrast and screen size. Furthermore some recommendations were provided to select or design an adequate e-book display for prolonged reading. Relevance to industry With the increase in e-books publications various e-book displays and their sales have continuously grown in recent years. For designing a good e-book display it is necessary to understand what factors would affect user performances visual fatigue and satisfaction. Moreover the significant effect of character size and screen size on visual fatigue and satisfaction may assist in improving e-book display related consumer products. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines rural-urban differences in the use of various information technologies ( IT) applications by physicians in the ambulatory setting. Findings suggest that no differences exist between rural and urban physicians with respect to the use of a computer (77.4 vs 81.4 p=. 144) or with the availability of an Internet connection (95.0 vs 96.5 p=. 249) in the office. However rural physicians were significantly less likely than urban doctors to indicate using e-mail with patients (7.9 vs 17.2% p<. 001) and slightly less likely to use a personal digital assistant (PDA) (32.3 vs 37.9 p=. 091). Rural doctors were significantly less likely to indicate routinely using an electronic health records (EHR) system (17.6 vs 24.1 p=. 020). EHR differences between rural and urban physicians were not significant ( p=. 124) in multivariate analyses and were explained away by practice size ( p<. 001) and practice type ( p=. 015). Most barriers to EHR did not differ between rural and urban physicians. However rural physicians more commonly cited barriers associated with temporary disruptions to productivity or disruptions in access to records when computers systems fail. In sum EHR use and patient e-mailing is less common in rural areas. While much of this variability can be explained by rural practice characteristics these findings illustrate the need for further efforts to identify and alleviate barriers and encourage health IT adoption in rural areas.;2007
This study explores the perceptions of pharmaceutical sales representatives toward the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in pharmaceutical detailing. It uses data from a survey of sales representatives at a large pharmaceutical company that adopted a PDA system for use in pharmaceutical detailing. The study first identifies the specific PDA features that users perceive as being important in performing pharmaceutical detailing tasks. Then built on the technology acceptance model (TAM) the study examines the important PDA features as antecedents to the perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the system. The results suggest some ways to improve specific system features which in turn enhance PU and PEOU and through them system usage. The findings would be useful to those who use or plan to use PDAs for pharmaceutical detailing or other similar mobile tasks.;2007
This study was carried out to examine first the validity of a new dietary assessment method a handheld personal digital assistant with camera and mobile phone card (Wellnavi) in comparison with a weighed diet record as a reference method and second the relation between obesity and underreporting in the Wellnavi method in 27 men and 48 women volunteers aged 30-67 y from the general population. On the validity there were significant correlations (0.32-0.75) between the daily nutrient intakes measured by the Wellnavi method and the weighed diet record method in all the subjects except for some nutrients such as iron magnesium and vitamin E. Results similar to those from the group of all the subjects were obtained in the men's group and the women's group. In all the subjects and the men's group and the women's group the differences in the daily nutrient intakes between the two dietary assessment methods were statistically significant. However good agreement of the differences between the two dietary assessment methods for many daily nutrient intakes was obtained in the nonobese men. The nutrient intakes estimated by the Wellnavi method in all the subjects and the men's group and the women's group were significantly lower than those values estimated by the weighed diet record method except for some nutrients such as sodium iron and fat-soluble vitamins. With respect to the relation between obesity and underreporting the obesity in women was not a factor of underreporting in the Wellnavi method but the presence of this relation was undeniable in the obese men. The reason why the values of daily nutrient intakes in the Wellnavi method were lower than those estimated by the weighed diet record method seemed to be the low quality of the digital photo of the Wellnavi instrument. By improving the digital photo quality of this instrument the Wellnavi method could become a useful new dietary assessment method to get accurate dietary information from people of a wide range of age and occupation and a wide variety of physical situations of subjects from the general population.;2007
To support various bandwidth requirements for mobile multimedia services for future heterogeneous mobile environments such as portable notebooks personal digital assistants (PDAs) and 3G cellular phones a transcoding video proxy is usually necessary to provide mobile clients with adapted video streams by not only transcoding videos to meet different needs on demand but also caching them for later use. Traditional proxy technology is not applicable to a video proxy because it is less cost-effective to cache the complete videos to fit all kinds of clients in the proxy. Since transcoded video objects have inheritance dependency between different bit-rate versions we can use this property to amortize the retransmission overhead from transcoding other objects cached in the proxy. In this paper we propose the object relation graph (ORG) to manage the static relationships between video versions and an efficient replacement algorithm to dynamically manage video segments cached in the proxy. Specifically we formulate a transcoding time constrained profit function to evaluate the profit from caching each version of an object. The profit function considers not only the sum of the costs of caching individual versions of an object but also the transcoding relationship among these versions. In addition an effective data structure cached object relation tree (CORT) is designed to facilitate the management of multiple versions of different objects cached in the transcoding proxy. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms companion schemes in terms of the byte-hit ratios and the startup latency. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2007
Until now research on arrangement of verbal and non-verbal information in multimedia presentations has not considered multimodal behavior of animated agents. In this paper we will present an experiment exploring the effects of different types of speech-gesture cooperation in agents' behavior: redundancy (gestures duplicate pieces of information conveyed by speech) complementarity (distribution of information across speech and gestures) and a control condition in which gesture does not convey semantic information. Using a Latin-square design these strategies were attributed to agents of different appearances to present different objects. Fifty-four male and 54 female users attended three short presentations performed by the agents recalled the content of presentations and evaluated both the presentations and the agents. Although speech-gesture cooperation was not consciously perceived it proved to influence users' recall performance and subjective evaluations: redundancy increased verbal information recall ratings of the quality of explanation and expressiveness of agents. Redundancy also resulted in higher likeability scores for the agents and a more positive perception of their personality. Users' gender had no influence on this set of results.

Use of handheld devices with electronic patient diaries (EPDs) can improve the quality of patient-reported information collected in clinical and research settings. EPDs have advantages compared with traditional paper-based instruments that include decreased data entry error and decreased time spent on data management. Orthopaedic pain management which is often dependent on patient-reported pain levels can benefit from the use of EPDs. A pilot survey was conducted to compare two self-report pain diary methods in shoulder surgery patients: (a) EPD or (b) paper entry. Compliance was lower in the EPD group which was attributed to insufficient ease of use. Handheld technology can be used by nurses to improve and streamline patient care by capturing clinical data by organizing and reporting home health services and by providing references for evidence-based practice. Handheld technology can facilitate the transformation of clinical documentation of assessments interventions and outcomes into evidence-based decision making in orthopaedic nursing.;2007
We consider the problem of detecting anomalies in data that arise as multidimensional arrays with each dimension corresponding to the levels of a categorical variable. In typical data mining applications the number of cells in such arrays are usually large. Our primary focus is detecting anomalies by comparing information at the current time to historical data. Naive approaches advocated in the process control literature do not work well in this scenario due to the multiple testing problem-performing multiple statistical tests on the same data produce excessive number of false positives. We use an empirical Bayes method which works by fitting a two-component Gaussian mixture to deviations at current time. The approach is scalable to problems that involve monitoring massive number of cells and fast enough to be potentially useful in many streaming scenarios. We show the superiority of the method relative to a naive per component error rate procedure through simulation. A novel feature of our technique is the ability to suppress deviations that are merely the consequence of sharp changes in the marginal distributions. This research was motivated by the need to extract critical application information and business intelligence from the daily logs that accompany large-scale spoken dialog systems. We illustrate our method on one such system.;2007
We describe a study of the use of decision-theoretic policies for optimally joining human and automated problem-solving efforts. We focus specifically on the challenge of determining when it is best to transfer callers from an automated dialog system to human receptionists. We demonstrate the sensitivities of transfer actions to both the inferred competency of the spoken-dialog models and the current sensed load on human receptionists. The policies draw upon probabilistic models constructed via machine learning from cases that were logged by a call routing service deployed at our organization. We describe the learning of models that predict outcomes and interaction times and show how these models can be used to generate expected-utility policies that identify when it is best to transfer callers to human operators. We explore the behavior of the policies with simulations constructed from real-world call data.;2007
We describe an implementation integrating a complete spoken dialogue system with a mobile robot which a human can direct to specific locations ask for information about its status and supply information about its environment. The robot uses an internal map for navigation and communicates its current orientation and accessible locations to the dialogue system using a topological map as interface. We focus on linguistic and inferential aspects of the human-robot communication process. The result is a novel approach using a principled semantic theory combined with techniques from automated deduction applied to a mobile robot platform. Due to the abstract level of the dialogue system it is easily portable to other environments or applications.;2007
We developed a personal digital assistant-based knowledgebase of surgical pathology report content recommendations and performed an experimental trial to test if the knowledgebase improved report completeness. The 15 experimental group and 13 control group residents were given microscope slides and corresponding reports with the final diagnosis section blanked-out and were asked to complete the final diagnosis section during 3 study episodes (T0 T1 and T2). At T0 (baseline) experimental group and control group produced reports of comparable completeness. During T1 experimental group was allowed to use the knowledgebase while completing reports. During T I experimental group produced more complete reports and were better judges of report completeness than control group. At T2 when neither group used the knowledgebase experimental group's performance was still statistically better than control group's. Use of the knowledgebase did not ensure report completeness but was associated with more complete reports and more accurate judgments of report completeness and this performance advantage persisted in the absence of the knowledgebase.

We evaluated a mobile video system for surgical teleconsultation. A video streaming server in the operating room transmitted video and audio to a hand-held computer (personal digital assistant [PDA]) over a wireless local area network. Two groups of 20 surgeons (each with 12 qualified surgeons and eight surgeons between the 2nd and the 4th year of training) participated in the tests. For voice transmission correct understanding of numbers was achieved in 100% of the cases (n = 1000) and 98% of medical terms (n = 400). The quality of the video displayed on the PDA was assessed by the recognition of different operating room scenarios. Only 62% (SD 17) of the structures were identified clearly on the hand-held device (n = 400). The accuracy improved to 78% (SD 15) (n=400) if the same scenario was observed on a larger (50cm) video screen (P<0.001). Accuracy was significantly better if audio conversation was possible. The quality evaluation by the consultants showed that the PDA display size and quality were sufficient for clinical use.;2007
We introduce an innovative method that uses personal digital assistants (PDAs) equipped with global positioning system (GPS) units in household surveys to select a probability-based sample arid perform PDA-based interviews. Our approach uses PDAs with GPS to rapidly map all households in selected areas choose a random sample and navigate back to the sampled households to conduct an interview. We present recent field experience in two large-scale nationally representative household surveys to assess insecticide-treated bed net coverage as part of malaria control efforts in Africa. The successful application of this method resulted in statistically valid samples quality-controlled data entry and rapid aggregation analyses and availability of preliminary results within days of completing the field work. We propose this method as an alternative to the Expanded Program on Immunization cluster sample method when a fast statistically valid survey is required in an environment with little census information at the enumeration area level.;2007
We present a method for increasing the accuracy and acquisition rate of the initial location data of plants within fixed areas. Using a personal digital assistant (PDA) to create a link between various electronic measurement devices (pantograph micrometers etc.) and a database of the study individual's location information has significantly increased measurement reliability and speed in a demographic field study. The method also provides a means to quickly and accurately re-identify the same individuals during subsequent visits to the study plot. Application of the same method can be used in all ecological field studies with sessile organisms in permanent plots increasing speed and accuracy of coordinate measurement. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We propose three methods for extending the Boosting family of classifiers motivated by the real-life problems we have encountered. First we propose a semisupervised learning method for exploiting the unlabeled data in Boosting. We then present a novel classification model adaptation method. The goal of adaptation is optimizing an existing model for a new target application which is similar to the previous one but may have different classes or class distributions. Finally we present an efficient and effective cost-sensitive classification method that extends Boosting to allow for weighted classes. We evaluated these methods for call classification in the AT&T VoiceTone (R) spoken language understanding system. Our results indicate that it is possible to obtain the same classification performance by using 30% less labeled data when the unlabeled data is utilized through semisupervised learning. Using model adaptation we can achieve the same classification accuracy using less than half of the labeled data from the new application. Finally we present significant improvements in the important (i.e. higher weighted) classes without a significant loss in overall performance using the proposed cost-sensitive classification method.;2007
What is the hallmark of success in human-agent interaction? In animation and robotics many have concentrated on the looks of the agent-whether the appearance is realistic or lifelike. We present an alternative benchmark that lies in the dyad and not the agent alone: Does the agent's behavior evoke intersubjectivity from the user? That is in both conscious and unconscious communication do users react to behaviorally realistic agents in the same way they react to other humans? Do users appear to attribute similar thoughts and actions? We discuss why we distinguish between appearance and behavior why we use the benchmark of intersubjectivity our methodology for applying this benchmark to embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and why we believe this benchmark should be applied to human-robot interaction.;2007
With the growing popularity of personal digital assistant devices and smart phones more and more consumers are becoming quite enthusiastic to appreciate videos via mobile devices. However limited display size of the mobile devices has been imposing significant barriers for users to enjoy browsing high-resolution videos. In this paper we present an attention-information-based spatial adaptation framework to address this problem. The whole framework includes two major parts: video content generation and video adaptation system. During video compression the attention information in video sequences will be detected using an attention model and embedded into bitstreams with proposed supplement-enhanced information (SEI) structure. Furthermore we also develop an innovative scheme to adaptively adjust quantization parameters in order to simultaneously improve the quality of overall encoding and the quality of transcoding the attention areas. When the high-resolution bitstream is transmitted to mobile users a fast transcoding algorithm we developed earlier will be applied to generate a new bitstream for attention areas in frames. The new low-resolution bitstream containing mostly attention information instead of the high-resolution one will be sent to users for display on the mobile devices. Experimental results show that the proposed spatial adaptation scheme is able to improve both subjective and objective video qualities.;2007
With the increasingly popular use of PDAs in healthcare the need for a reliable scale to evaluate this technology has become critical. The authors describe the development and testing of an evaluation scale for PDAs in nurses' daily practice. A review of the literature generated a 30-item questionnaire that was administered online to a convenience sample of 334 hospital nurses in Taiwan. The scale's reliability and validity were established by item and factor analyses. From the original pool of 30 items 24 were selected and grouped into six major constructs: user preference nursing efficiency user training device features drug content and user support. The scale's overall reliability (a coefficient) was 0.88. Survey results showed an overall slightly negative score for the evaluation scale for PDAs indicating a slightly moderate evaluation of PDA use. Additional psychometric analysis and refinement of item wordings are recommended.;2007
Within the last 10 years technological advances have allowed personal wireless communications to become part of our global information-centric culture. Cellular telephones personal digital assistants and wireless computer networks allow for tetherless use anytime and almost anywhere. These wireless communication advances have quickly matured through three technological generations. Currently wireless communications are considered to be in the third generation (3G) of deployment and are rapidly approaching the fourth (4G). As these wireless technologies advance to meet market demand careful pre-market technical analysis of these new capabilities must be made to understand potential impact on existing communication systems. This paper provides a novel examination into the effects of 4G ultrawide band (UWB) signaling on a 3G wireless fidelity (WiFi) system. Through empirical and statistical analyses we show that the throughput performance of the Wi-Fi system can be negatively impacted by up to 20%. We conclude that careful implementation of emerging 4G UWB systems must occur to mitigate the detriments to existing 3G communication systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2007
A conversational agent capable to have a sense of humor is presented. The agent can both generate humorous sentences and recognize humoristic expressions introduced by the user during the dialogue. EHeBby is an entertainment oriented conversational agent implemented using the ALICE framework embedded into an Yahoo! Messenger client. It is characterized by two areas: a rational rule-based area and an evocative area. The first one is based on well founded techniques of computational humor and a standard AIML KB. The second one is based on a conceptual space automatically induced by a corpus of funny documents where KB items and user sentences are mapped. This area emulates an associative/evocative behavior of the conversational agent making her more attractive. EHeBby includes also an avatar that changes the face expression according to humoristic content of the dialogue.;2008
A critical component of community-based disaster preparedness (CBDP) is a local resource database of suppliers providing physical information and human resources for use in disaster response. Maintenance of such a database can become a collaborative responsibility among community-based non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and public and private community organisations. In addition to mobilising resources this process raises awareness within the community and aids in assessing local knowledge and resources. This paper presents the results of a pilot study on implementing a community-based resource database through collaboration with local American Red Cross chapters and public and private community organisations. The design of the resource database is described. The resource database is accessible via the internet and offline using laptops and handheld Personal Digital Assistants. The study concludes that CBDP is strengthened through a combination of appropriate information technology and collaborative relationships between NGOs and community-based organisations.;2008
A custom tool PARROTS [Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) system for Activity Registration and Recording of Travel Scheduling] was developed to collect both activity data and global positioning system (GPS) data. This tool is currently deployed in a survey carried out on 2500 households in Flanders (Belgium). The GPS-enabled PDA data collection tool features default answers predefined drop-down lists and many other graphical design elements. Two types of data were collected using PARROTS: activity and travel diaries input by the respondents and location data logged by a GPS receiver. To judge the effect of the PARROTS tool on the quality of activity and travel diaries a paper-and-pencil diary was designed and deployed as well and various analyses were performed on both the paper-and-pencil and PDA data. For the collected GPS data the data quality was investigated in terms of availability of location information in the logs. In addition to investigating data quality the impact of using PDA technology on user response rates was examined and compared with response rates for the paper-and-pencil format. The PARROTS tool provided high-quality activity and travel diary data and it enabled the collection of scheduling and rescheduling information that would be too burdensome to collect using paper-and-pencil surveys. Moreover PARROTS was able to collect GPS-based location information and it made the data readily available in electronic form while keeping the burden for the respondents at an acceptable level.;2008
A multiplayer dice game was realized which is played by two users and one embodied conversational agent. During the game the players have to lie to each other to win the game and the longer the game commences the more probable it is that someone is lying which creates highly emotional situations. We ran a number of evaluation studies with the system. The specific setting allows us to compare user-user interactions directly with user-agent interactions in the same game. So far the users' gaze behavior and the users' verbal behavior towards one another and towards the agent have been analyzed. Gaze and verbal behavior towards the agent partly resembles patterns found in the literature for human-human interactions partly the behavior deviates from these observations and could be interpreted as rude or impolite like continuous staring insulting or talking about the agent. For most of these seemingly abusive behaviors a more thorough analysis reveals that they are either acceptable or present some interesting insights for improving the interaction design between users and embodied conversational agents.

A novel assessment procedure based on knowledge space theory (KST) is presented along with a complete implementation of an intelligent tutoring system. (ITS) that has been used to test our theoretical findings. The key idea is that correct assessment of the student knowledge is strictly related to the structure of the domain ontology. Suitable relationships between the concepts must be present to allow the creation of a reverse path from the knowledge state representing the student goal to the one that contains her actual knowledge about this topic. Knowledge space theory is a very good framework to guide the process of building the ontology used by the artificial tutor The system. we present uses a conversational. agent to assess the student knowledge through a natural language question/answer procedure. The system exploits a Cyc-based common sense ontology about the specific domain of interest to select the concepts needed to explain unknown topics emerging from the dialogue. Besides the talent semantic analysis (LSA) technique is used to determine the correctness of the student sentences in order to establish which concepts she knows. As a result the system supplies learning material arranged as a path between the unknown topics resulting from the student assessment. The learning path is presented to the student by a user-firiendly graphical interface which allows to access documents browsing a visual map. The procedure is explained in detail along with the rest of the system. and the assessment validation results are presented.;2008
A numerical study is conducted to evaluate the thermal characteristics of a PCM-based heat sink which can be potentially used for cooling of mobile electronic devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and notebooks. The heat sink consists of a conventional extruded aluminum sink embedded with appropriate PCMs. Some important parameters such as PCM volume fraction temperature difference aspect ratio and PCM properties were studied to investigate their effects on the thermal performance of the hybrid cooling system.

A PDA (personal digital assistant) program containing information on 193 laboratory tests was provided to students during the 8-week core clerkship in internal medicine. Students used the program at their own discretion. The number of times each test was accessed during the clerkship was recorded by the program's database. Ten tests were accessed by more than 40% of the students: serum enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase amylase alkaline phosphatase creatine kinase and gamma-glutamyl transferase) electrolytes (sodium and potassium) renal function tests (urea and creatinine) and a plasma protein (albumin). The most frequently looked up test category was the CBC followed by liver-related tests plasma proteins electrolytes and autoantibodies. Students at the 2 hospitals where the clerkship was offered had similar test lookup patterns. We conclude that students seek information about laboratory tests that are frequently ordered and directly relevant to the diagnosis and management of their patients.;2008
A portable multi-channel telemetry system which can be used for brain stimulation and neuronal activity recording in freely behaving small animals is described here. This system consists of three major components of headstage backpack and Portable Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). The headstage contains high precision instrument amplifiers with high input impedance. The backpack is comprised of two parts: (1) a main board (size: 36 mm x 22 mm x 3.5 mm and weight: 40 g with batteries 20 g without) with current/voltage stimulator and special circuit suitable for neuronal activity recording and (2) and a bluetooth transceiver with a high data transmission rate up to 70 kb/s suitable for downloading stimulation commands and uploading acquired data. We recorded neuronal activities of the primary motor area of a freely behaving rat with 12-bit resolution at 12 k samples/s. The recorded data and analysis results showed that the system was successful by comparing with the commercial equipment Cerebus (TM) 128-Channel Data Acquisition System (Cyberkinetics Inc.). Using the PDA we can control stimulation and recording. It provides a flexible method to do some research work in the circumstances where other approaches would be difficult or impossible.

Aim and objective. The purpose of this study was to explore nurses' experiences during the first year of the installation of a nursing information system (NIS). The objective was to identify the major issues that emerged regarding the users' concerns of this technology in their daily practice. Background. The success of the implementation of an information system depends mostly on the users' acceptance of this technology however nurses' experience of a system installation for a particular length of time as in this study has seldom been explored. This is a report on a qualitative study that explored nurses' experiences of a NIS use during the first year of its installation. Design. Descriptive qualitative interviews with nurse participants were used to collect data at a medical centre in Taiwan. Method. Four focus groups were conducted with the 23 nurse participants in November 2005. The interview guide included questions about the impact of computer use on the nurses' workflow and the electronic documentation process. Results. Six major themes emerged regarding the nurses' NIS use including their dissatisfaction with insufficient personal computers and printers the slow system response time workflow change poor content design decreased charting quality and the impact on their interpersonal relationships. Conclusions. Organizations may need to redesign the computer interface to provide better hardware and to maintain a more reliable network function to meet the nurses' needs during the adoption process as well as to modify or devise appropriate documentation regulations. Relevance to clinical practice. As they continue to use electronic documentation nurses may become accustomed to the technology and use it more easily as it becomes the required documentation method. However understanding the barriers and difficulties they encountered could maximize their technology use and improve both the nursing efficiency and the documentation quality.;2008
Aim: We examined whether Using a new: personal digital assistant (PDA)-based computerized tracking system (PDAT) improved the rate Of faculty evaluation Of students compared to Using written clinical encounter cards. Also we examined whether the addition of e-mail reminders to PDAT affected the evaluation rate. Methods: Retrospective review of collected data Oil evaluation rates before and after implementation Of the computerized tracking system with and without e-mail reminders. Written encounter cards were available during all phases of the study. The study was Conducted at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Results: Evaluation rates between three separate 3-month periods were compared: (1) written cards alone (2) PDAT alone and (3) PDAT plus e-mail reminders to the faculty (PDAT-e). The odds ratio (OR) for faculty completion of evaluations was 2.97 when electronic and paper submission were available compared to paper-only evaluations (95% CI: 2.10-4.22 p-value <0.0001). With the addition of e-mail reminders the OR was 4.19 (95% CI: 2-98-5.88 p-value <0.0001). Conclusion: PDAT significantly improved faculty compliance with medical student evaluations when compared with written cards alone. The addition of e-mail reminders Further improved faculty compliance but this was nor statistically significant. The use Of a PDAT appears to he an effective way to improve faculty compliance with medical student evaluations.;2008
Aims and objectives. The aims were to explore advanced practice nurses' perceptions on wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies to establish the type and range of tools that would be useful to support their practice and to identify any requirements and limitations that may impact the implementation of wireless Personal Digital Assistants in practice. Background. The wireless Personal Digital Assistant is becoming established as a hand-held computing tool for healthcare professionals. The reflections of advanced practice nurses' about the value of wireless Personal Digital Assistants and its potential to contribute to improved patient care has not been investigated. Design. A qualitative interpretivist design was used to explore advanced practice nurses' perceptions on the value of wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies to support their practice. Methods. The data were collected using survey questionnaires and individual and focus group interviews with nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists and information technology managers based in British Columbia Canada. An open-coding content analysis was performed using qualitative data analysis software. Results. Wireless Personal Digital Assistant's use supports the principles of pervasivity and is a technology rapidly being adopted by advanced practice nurses. Some nurses indicated a reluctance to integrate wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies into their practices because of the cost and the short technological life cycle of these devices. Many of the barriers which precluded the use of wireless networks within facilities are being removed. Nurses demonstrated a complex understanding of wireless Personal Digital Assistant technologies and gave good rationales for its integration in their practice. Conclusions. Nurses identified improved client care as the major benefit of this technology in practice and the type and range of tools they identified included clinical reference tools such as drug and diagnostic/laboratory reference applications and wireless communications. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses in this study support integrating wireless mobile computing technologies into their practice to improve client care.;2008
An immersive video system that has been developed for the purpose of evaluating future traveller information system (F-TIS) in particular F-TIS scenarios that rely on a pervasive computing infrastructure is presented. Immersive video uses multiple video streams captured from a first person perspective at key locations in a scenario. By dynamically reconstructing a user's visual and aural experiences the immersive video system creates a lab-based framework that captures a number of contextual factors of real-world mobile information system use. Graphical user interfaces displayed on a wearable display and a personal digital assistant are used in the evaluation. Both the technical basis of the immersive video system and its application to the study of user perceptions and reactions to pervasive information services are presented.;2008
Background: Brief motivational interventions that have been provided in addition to routine primary care have changed adolescent health behaviors. Whether health screening and motivational-interviewing-based counseling provided by clinicians during routine care can change behaviors is unknown. Methods: Healthy Teens was a primary care office-system intervention to support efficient patient-centered counseling at well visits. Healthy Teens utilized a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based screener that provided the clinician with information about a teen's health risks and motivation to change. Changes in adolescent self-report of diet and activity health behaviors 6 months later were assessed in two cross-sectional samples of teens from five rural practices in 2005 and 2006. Usual-care subjects (N= 148) were recruited at well visits prior to the intervention and the Healthy Teens subjects (N= 136) were recruited at well visits after the Healthy Teens system was well established. Results: At 6-month follow-up the Healthy Teens group had significantly increased self-reported exercise levels and milk-product intake. In the models exploring covariates the only significant predictors for improvement in exercise levels were intervention-group status (p=0.009) and post-visit interest in making a change (p=0.015). Interest in changing predicted increased milk intake (p=0.028) in both groups. When teens planned an action related to nutrition physical activity or both after a well visit Healthy Teens participants were more likely to report multiple planned actions (68% Healthy Teens vs 32% usual care p < 0.05). Conclusions: Changes in office systems using low-cost technology to screen adolescents and promote patient-centered counseling appear to influence teens to increase exercise and milk intake.;2008
BACKGROUND: Canadian wait time data are available for the treatment of cancer and heart disease as well as for joint replacement cataract surgery and diagnostic imaging procedures. Wait times for gastroenterology consultation and procedures have not been studied although digestive diseases pose a greater economic burden in Canada than cancer or heart disease. METHODS: Specialist physicians completed the practice audit if they provided digestive health care accepted new patients and recorded referral dates. For patients seen for consultation or investigation over a one-week period preprogrammed personal digital assistants were used to collect data including the main reason for referral initial referral and consultation dates procedure dates (if performed) personal and family history and patient symptoms signs and test results. Patient triaging appropriateness of the referral and timeliness of care were noted. RESULTS: Over 10 months 199 physicians recorded details of 5559 referrals including 1903 visits for procedures. The distribution of total wait times (from referral to procedure) nationally was highly skewed at 91/203 days (median/75th percentile) with substantial interprovincial variation: British Columbia 66/185 days Alberta 134/284 days Ontario 110/208 days Quebec 71/149 days New Brunswick 104/234 days and Nova Scotia 42/84 days. The percentage of physicians by province offering average-risk screening colonoscopy varied from 29% to 100%. DISCUSSION: Access to specialist gastroenterology care in Canada is limited by long wait times which exceed clinically reasonable waits for specialist treatment. Although exhibiting some methodological limitations this large practice audit sampling offers broadly generalized results as well as a means to identify barriers to health care delivery and evaluate strategies to address these barriers with the goals of expediting appropriate care for patients with digestive health disorders and ameliorating the personal and societal burdens imposed by digestive diseases.;2008
Background: Computerized Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMAc) techniques permit the assessment of daily life behaviors and experiences. The present investigation examined the feasibility and validity of this assessment methodology in outpatients with schizophrenia. Methods: Outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n = 54) received a battery of standard laboratory clinical and functional outcome measures and then completed electronic questionnaires on a personal digital assistant (PDA) microcomputer 4 times per day for 1 week. Results: Generally good compliance (87%) with EMAc was found and participants rated their experience with the study positively. The data collected in daily life demonstrated expected patterns across the assessment week and were significantly associated with scores from standard laboratory instruments measuring similar constructs. Conclusions: EMAc is a feasible and valid approach to data collection in community-dwelling people with schizophrenia and it may provide important information that is inaccessible via standard clinical and functional outcome measures administered in the laboratory.;2008
Background: Developing high quality clinical trials within rehabilitation research is achievable and should be pursued wherever possible. One of the greatest challenges rehabilitation trialists face is defining experimental and control interventions and ensuring that the intervention dose is delivered as planned. Aim: We describe procedures employed within a pilot randomised controlled trial of a rehabilitation intervention to monitor therapy dose. Method: The trial setting was two acute Stroke units in large teaching hospitals in Melbourne Australia. The design was a randomised controlled trial of very early mobilisation (commenced within 24 hours of stroke onset) plus standard care (VEM) versus standard care alone. Assessors were blinded to group and analysis was intention to treat All therapy data (both intervention and control) were acquired using personal digital assistants. Monitoring of therapy dose and feedback to trial staff was given 6 months into the trial by a researcher independent of the trial team. Results: Before feedback therapists were barely meeting intervention protocol minimum targets. Following feedback compliance with trial protocol was achieved. Conclusion: Monitoring of the therapy dose within a clinical trial is important to achieve trial quality. This article shows how monitoring including feedback leads to improved delivery of the therapy 'pill'.;2008
Background: Efforts to achieve population-wide increases in walking and similar moderate-intensity physical activities potentially can be enhanced through relevant applications of state-of-the-art interactive communication technologies. Yet few systematic efforts to evaluate the efficacy of hand-held computers and similar devices for enhancing physical activity levels have occurred. The purpose of this first-generation study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e. personal digital assistant [PDA]) for increasing moderate intensity or more vigorous (MOD+) physical activity levels over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults relative to a standard information control arm. Design: Randomized controlled 8-week experiment. Data were collected in 2005 and analyzed in 2006-2007. Setting/Participants: Community-based study of 37 healthy initially underactive adults aged 50 years and older who were randomized and completed the 8-week study (intervention=19 control=18). Intervention: Participants received an instructional session and a PDA programmed to monitor their physical activity levels twice per day and provide daily and weekly individualized feedback goal setting and support. Controls received standard age-appropriate written physical activity educational materials. Main Oucome Measure: Physical activity was assessed via the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks. Results: Relative to controls intervention participants reported significantly greater 8-week mean estimated caloric expenditure levels and minutes per week in MOD+ activity (p<0.04). Satisfaction with the PDA was reasonably high in. this largely PDA-naive sample. Conclusions: Results from this first-generation study indicate that hand-held computers may be effective tools for increasing initial physical activity levels among underactive adults.;2008
Background: Errors in the transfusion process are common. These errors encompass a spectrum of events ranging from incorrect transfusion to administration of infected blood products. To overcome these complications we developed a new blood management software system - the BT-Online system - to decrease erroneous transfusions that are mostly human based. Material/Methods: Like previously developed transfusion safety systems this program uses handheld devices to improve the safety of bedside practices. The BT-online system consists of 3 main structures: (1) the personal digital assistant (2) the equipment and software (user interface) and (3) the relational database and a web service providing communication of a security-layered database with other personal digital assistants. Results: This system has many features including the ability at the bedside to check the complete patient history and requested tests and blood products the ability to conduct simulataneous multiple procedures the ability to transmit results to the database the ability to gather restrictions and warnings regarding the transfusion and request sections the ability to provide constant and secure data transfer a user-friendly design the ability to gather warmings during measurements that alert the user to potential errors the ability to enter complications and symptoms and retrieve relevant information and suggestions the ability to enter transfusion complications and the ability to check test results and create statistical data for future use. Conclusions: This system can contribute to blood banks and health care facilities via the above-mentioned specifications. We recommend this system to health care facilities with a significant patient turnover.;2008
Background: For several years final-year students at McMaster University have been required to complete 10 mini-CEX type assessments per rotation. A similar system was being introduced at Ottawa. Purpose: To facilitate data capture we decided to introduce a personal data assistant (PDA)-based system and evaluate its impact. Method: A randomized trial was designed to compare the acceptability of PDA and printed evaluation forms. The trial failed because of clerks' unwillingness to use PDAs. A focus group was held and user surveys were administered chiefly by e-mail to explore students' preference for printed forms. Results: Thirty percent of invited clerks (52/176) agreed to use a PDA 6% (11 21% of those agreeing) recorded one or more encounters 2% (4) recorded at least the minimum number of evaluations required by their program. Most survey respondents expressed concerns related primarily to the relative inconvenience of PDAs compared to paper a judgment reflecting the time required both to install required software and to become familiar with the software and data entry form and to record information via the form. A minority were also concerned about assessors' willingness or ability to use PDA forms. Conclusion: Before asking students and clinical supervisors to use a PDA-based encounter-evaluation form in clerkship planners should conduct a careful assessment of the advantages and disadvantages for students of the system they hope to implement. The prima facie greater convenience and efficiency of the PDA may actually be offset by workplace disincentives and inefficiencies in data recording relative to the incentives and efficiencies associated with a system based on printed (paper) forms.;2008
Background: Given the high prevalence of medication use in the US the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and potential for patient harm is of concern. Despite the rise in technologies to identify potential DDIs the ability of physicians and other prescribers to recognize potential DDIs is essential to reduce their occurrence. The objectives of this study were to assess prescribers' ability to recognize potential clinically significant DDIs and to examine the sources of information they use to identify potential DDIs and prescribers' opinions on the usefulness of various DDI information sources. Methods: A postal questionnaire was developed to assess prescriber knowledge of medications that may interact and prescribers' usual sources of DDI information. Recipients were asked to classify 14 drug pairs as 'contraindicated' 'may be used together but with monitoring' or 'no interaction'. A response option of 'not sure' was also provided. The questionnaires were sent to a national sample of 12 500 prescribers based on past history of prescribing drugs associated with known potential for DDI who were identified using data from a pharmacy benefit manager covering over 50 million individuals. Results: Usable questionnaires were obtained from 950 prescribers. The percentage of prescribers who correctly classified specific drug pairs ranged from 18.2% for warfarin and cimetidine to 81.2% for paracetamol (acetaminophen) with codeine and amoxicillin with 42.7% of all combinations classified correctly. The number of drug pairs correctly classified by the prescribers ranged from 0 to 13. For half of the drug pairs over one-third of the respondents answered 'not sure' among those drug pairs two were contraindicated. When asked what source was used to learn more about a potential DDI a quarter of the prescribers reported using personal digital assistants and another quarter used printed material. The majority of the prescribers (68.4%) reported that they were usually informed by pharmacists about their patients' potential exposure to DDIs. Compared with the prescribers who used other sources those who used computerized DDI alerts as their usual source of DDI information consistently gave a lower rating score to the five statements that assessed the usefulness of the information. Conclusion: This study suggests that prescribers' knowledge of potential clinically significant DDIs is generally poor. These findings are supported by other research and emphasize the need to develop systems that alert prescribers about potential interactions that are clinically relevant. Physicians most commonly reported learning about potential DDIs from pharmacists suggesting further work is needed to improve the drug-prescribing process to identify potential safety issues earlier in the medication use process.;2008
BACKGROUND: In April 2004 the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III Guidelines for management of high cholesterol encouraged even lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) than previous guidelines for high and very high risk groups. Assessing patients' risk factors to determine LDL goals is the first step to help guide therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of the Mobile Lipid Clinic Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) Calculator during office visits will increase the number of patients achieving their LDL goal compared to using electronic medical records or conventional methods. METHODS: Four family medicine residency programs affiliated with the Northeastern Ohio Network participated with each site using a different method. The PDA site used the Mobile Lipid Clinic Calculator the second site used electronic health records (EHRs) the control site used usual care methods and the transition site moved from paper charts to EHRs during the study. In 2006 baseline chart reviews were conducted to randomly enroll 100 patients per site (aged 40-75 years) with LDL levels at least 10% above goal. In 2007 follow-up chart reviews were conducted on the same patients to determine reductions in LDL and the percent of patients that reached their LDL goals. RESULTS: The percentage reaching their LDL goal and option goal were as follows: PDA site 27% and 12% EHR site 19% and 3% control site 4% and 1% transition site 32% and 12%. Cholesterol-lowering medication usage increased significantly from 38% at baseline to 47% at follow-up (chi(2) = 149.5 P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Using a PDA tool can be just as effective as EHRs in getting patients to their LDL goal and is better than some conventional methods suggesting the benefit of utilizing technology to improve patient care and health outcomes.

Background: In this era of evidence-based medicine doctors are increasingly using information technology to acquire medical knowledge. This study evaluates how residents and interns utilise and perceive the personal digital assistant (PDA) and the online resource UpToDate. Methods: This is a questionnaire survey of all residents and interns in a tertiary teaching hospital. Results: Out of 168 doctors 134 (79.8%) responded to the questionnaire. Only 54 doctors (40.3%) owned a PDA. Although these owners perceived that the PDA was most useful for providing drug information followed by medical references scheduling and medical calculators the majority of them did not actually have medical software applications downloaded on their PDAs. The greatest concerns highlighted for the PDA were the fear of loss and breakage and the preference for working with desktop computers and paper. Meanwhile only 76 doctors (56.7%) used UpToDate even though the hospital had an institutional subscription for it. Although 93.4% of these users would recommend UpToDate to a colleague only 57.9% stated that the use of UpToDate had led to a change in their management of patients. Conclusion: Although UpToDate and various PDA software applications were deemed useful by some of the residents and interns in our study both digital tools were under-utilised. More should be done to facilitate the use of medical software applications on PDAs to promote awareness of tools for evidence-based medicine such as UpToDate and to facilitate the application of evidence-based medicine in daily clinical practice.;2008
Background: Low-cost handheld computers (PDA) potentially represent an efficient tool for collecting sensitive data in surveys. The goal of this study is to evaluate the quality of sexual behavior data collected with handheld computers in comparison with paper-based questionnaires. Methods: A PDA-based program for data collection was developed using Open-Source tools. In two cross-sectional studies we compared data concerning sexual behavior collected with paper forms to data collected with PDA-based forms in Ancon (Lima). Results: The first study enrolled 200 participants (18-29 years). General agreement between data collected with paper format and handheld computers was 86%. Categorical variables agreement was between 70.5% and 98.5% (Kappa: 0.43-0.86) while numeric variables agreement was between 57.1% and 79.8% (Spearman: 0.76-0.95). Agreement and correlation were higher in those who had completed at least high school than those with less education. The second study enrolled 198 participants. Rates of responses to sensitive questions were similar between both kinds of questionnaires. However the number of inconsistencies (p = 0.0001) and missing values (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in paper questionnaires. Conclusion: This study showed the value of the use of handheld computers for collecting sensitive data since a high level of agreement between paper and PDA responses was reached. In addition a lower number of inconsistencies and missing values were found with the PDA-based system. This study has demonstrated that it is feasible to develop a low-cost application for handheld computers and that PDAs are feasible alternatives for collecting field data in a developing country.;2008
BACKGROUND: Multi-tier copayment designs in pharmacy benefit plans are intended to steer patients and prescribers to preferred drug therapies that have lower out-of-pocket costs for patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe and assess physicians' prescribing experiences and opinions in a multi-tier primarily 3-tier formulary environment in 2 Midwestern states. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey of physicians practicing in either Minnesota or North Dakota. A packet consisting of a survey instrument a cover letter and a postage-paid return envelope was mailed to a random sample of 690 physician members of the Minnesota Medical Association (n = 460 5.1% of members) or the North Dakota Medical Association (n = 230 25.6% of members). Surveys were mailed between March and May 2006. Nonresponders were mailed up to 2 additional surveys Survey items included practice specialty sources used to obtain drug information perceived importance of cost containment actions (e.g. prescribing drug with lowest total cost prescribing drug that minimizes patient out-of-pocket cost) and how often the physician was personally aware of the following when writing a prescription: identity of the patient's insurer patient's pharmacy benefit structure preferred medications on the insurer's formulary patient's copayment (out-of-pocket cost) responsibility and list price of the medication. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 49.8% (296 of 594). The results were as follows: 93.5% of respondents agreed that it was important to prescribe the drug that would minimize the patient's out-of-pocket costs 73.2% agreed that it was important to discuss out-of-pocket medication costs with patients 81.8% of respondents agreed that it was important to prescribe the drug with the lowest total costs and 33.3% of respondents believed that it was their responsibility to prescribe a preferred (formulary) medication. According to the survey 61.6% of respondents were rarely or never aware of their patient's copayment amounts and 42.4% were rarely or never aware of the list price of the medication. Physician specialty was associated with the awareness of the identity of the patient's insurer (generalists 41.1% vs. specialists 19.2% P=0.001) and use of personal digital assistant (PDA) when prescribing (generalists 38.9% vs. specialists 21.1% P=0.005). CONCLUSION: Physicians who responded to this survey believed that it was important to prescribe drugs that would minimize patients' prescription copayments but they were often unaware of the preferred medications on the formulary the patients' copayment amounts or the price of the drugs prescribed.;2008
Background: People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continue to experience dyspnea with activities of daily living (ADL) despite optimal medical management. Information and communication technologies may facilitate collaborative symptom management and could potentially increase the reach of such interventions to those who are unable to attend face-to-face pulmonary rehabilitation or self-management programs. Objective: The purpose of this randomized study was to test the efficacy of two 6-month dyspnea self-management programs Internet-based (eDSMP) and face-to-face (fDSMP) on dyspnea with ADL in people living with COPD. Methods: We randomly assigned 50 participants with moderate to severe COPD who were current Internet users to either the eDSMP (n = 26) or fDSMP (n = 24) group. The content of the two programs was similar focusing on education skills training and ongoing support for dyspnea self-management including independent exercise. The only difference was the mode (Internet/personal digital assistant [PDA] or face-to-face) in which the education sessions reinforcement contacts and peer interactions took place. Participants returned to one of two academic clinical sites for evaluation at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome of dyspnea with ADL was measured with the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes of exercise behavior exercise performance COPD exacerbations and mediators such as self-efficacy and social support were also measured. A satisfaction survey was administered and a semi structured exit interview was conducted at the final visit. Results: The study was stopped early due to multiple technical challenges with the eDSMP but follow-up was completed on all enrolled participants. Data were available for 39 participants who completed the study (female: 44% age: 69.5 +/- 8.5 years percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s: 49.6 +/- 17.0%). The fDSMP and eDSMP showed similar clinically meaningful changes in dyspnea with ADL from baseline to 3 months (fDSMP: + 3.3 points eDSMP: + 3.5 points) and sustained these improvements at 6 months (fDSMP: +4.0 points eDSMP: + 2.5 points time effects P < .001 group by tithe P=.51). Self-reported endurance exercise time (P=.001) physical functioning (P=.04) and self-efficacy for managing dyspnea (P=.02) also showed positive improvements over time in both groups with no significant differences with respect to program modality. Participants who completed the study reported favorable satisfaction with the programs. Conclusions: Although there were numerous technical challenges with the eDSMP both dyspnea self-management programs were effective in reducing dyspnea with ADL in the short term. Our findings will need to be confirmed in a larger randomized trial with more mature Web and personal digital assistant tools use of a control group and longer follow-up.;2008
Background: Personal digital assistants (PDA) offer putative advantages over paper for collecting research data. However there are no data prospectively comparing PDA and paper in the emergency department. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the performance of PDA and paper enrollment instruments with respect to time required and errors generated. Methods: We randomized consecutive patients enrolled in an ongoing prospective study to having their data recorded either on a PDA or a paper data collection instrument. For each method we recorded the total time required for enrollment and the time required for manual transcription (paper) onto a computer database. We compared data error rates by examining missing data nonsensical data and errors made during the transcription of paper forms. Statistical comparisons were performed by Kruskal-Wallis and Poisson regression analyses for time and errors respectively. Results: We enrolled 68 patients (37 PDA 31 paper). Two of 31 paper forms were not available for analysis. Total data gathering times inclusive of transcription were significantly less for PDA (6: 13 min per patient) compared to paper (9: 12 min per patient p < 0.001). There were a total of 0.9 missing and nonsense errors per paper form compared to 0.2 errors per PDA form (p < 0.001). An additional 0.7 errors per paper form were generated during transcription. In total there were 1.6 errors per paper form and 0.2 errors per PDA form (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Using a PDA-based data collection instrument for clinical research reduces the time required for data gathering and significantly improves data integrity.;2008
Background: Portable hand-held information technology offers much promise not only in assessing dietary intake in the real world but also in providing dietary feedback to individuals. However stringent research designs have not been employed to examine whether it can be effective in modifying dietary behaviors. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e. personal digital assistant [PDA]) for increasing vegetable and whole-grain intake over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults using a randomized study design. Methods: Twenty-seven healthy adults aged 50 were randomized and completed the 8-week study. Intervention participants received an instructional session and a PDA programmed to monitor their vegetable and whole-grain intake levels twice per day and to provide daily individualized feedback goal-setting and support. Controls received standard age-appropriate written nutritional education materials. Dietary intake was assessed via the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks. Results: Relative to controls intervention participants reported significantly greater increases in vegetable servings (1.5-2.5 servings/day p=0.02) as well as a trend toward greater intake of dietary fiber from grains (3.7-4.5 servings/day p=0.10). Conclusions: This study's findings provide preliminary evidence that using portable hand-held technology to provide daily individualized feedback OD dietary behavior in the real world can increase the dietary intake of healthy food groups.;2008
Background: Teaching is an important professional role for most faculty members in academic health sciences centres. Careful delineation of educational workload is needed to foster and reward teaching efforts and to facilitate equitable allocation of resources. Aims: To promote recognition in teaching and facilitate equitable resource allocation we developed piloted and qualitatively assessed a tool for delineating the educational workload of pediatric faculty in an academic health sciences centre. Methods: A prototype educational workload measurement tool was developed. Between 2002 and 2004 three successive phases of pilot implementation were conducted to (1) assess the face validity of the tool (2) assess its feasibility and (3) develop and assess the feasibility of a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) version. Participants were interviewed regarding strengths weaknesses and barriers to completion. Data were analyzed for recurrent themes. Results: Faculty found that the tool was usable and represented a broad range of educational activities. The PDA format was easier to use and better received. Technical support would be imperative for long-term implementation. The greatest barriers to implementation were skepticism about the purpose of the tool and concerns that it would promote quantity over quality of teaching. Conclusion: We developed a usable tool to capture data on the diverse educational workload of pediatric faculty. PDA technology can be used to facilitate collection of workload data. Faculty skepticism is an important barrier that should be addressed in future work.;2008
Background: The information processing demands associated with behavioral self-management of diabetes are extensive. Pairing personal digital assistant (PDA)-based self-monitoring with a behavioral self-management intervention may improve adherence and patient outcomes. Methods: ENHANCE is a randomized controlled trial to test an intervention designed to improve regimen adherence in adults with type 2 diabetes. The intervention based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is paired with PDA-based self-monitoring. In this paper we describe the: (a) manner in which PDA-based self-monitoring is integrated within the SCT-based intervention (b) feasibility and acceptability of PDA-based dietary self-monitoring and (c) issues encountered in teaching participants to self-monitor using a PDA. Results: During the first 30 months of this 5-year study 232 participants were screened and 151 were randomized. To date 6 cohorts have completed the study. The retention rate is 85% (n = 129). Of those randomized to the intervention (n = 74) and completing the study (n = 61) 88% reported understanding the usefulness of PDA-monitoring 85% reported ease in entering foods into the device 70% reported ease in interpreting feedback graphs and 82% indicated that they would continue to use the PDA for self-monitoring after the study concluded. Assuming 3 meals per day participants entered an average of 58% of their meals in their PDA and 43% were entered assuming 4 meals per day. If we eliminate from the analysis those individuals who entered less than 10% of their expected meals (n = 12) the average rate of self-monitoring was 69% assuming 3 meals per day and 52% assuming 4 meals per day. Conclusions: PDA-based dietary monitoring is perceived by participants to be useful and acceptable. The approach used to instruct participants in use of the PDA and lessons learned are discussed. PDA technology shows promise as a tool for assisting those with type 2 diabetes in their efforts to manage their disease. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2008
Because of recent advances in wireless communication technologies the world of mobile computing is flourishing with a variety of applications. In this study we present an integrated architecture for a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based mobile medical display system that supports collaborative work between remote users. We aim to develop a system that enables users in different regions to share a working environment for collaborative visualization with the potential for exploring huge medical datasets. Our system consists of three major components: mobile client gateway and parallel rendering server. The mobile client serves as a front end and enables users to choose the visualization and control parameters interactively and cooperatively The gateway handles requests and responses between mobile clients and the rendering server for efficient communication. Through the gateway it is possible to share working environments between users allowing them to work together in computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) mode. Finally the parallel rendering server is responsible for performing heavy visualization tasks. Our experience indicates that some features currently available to our mobile clients for collaborative scientific visualization are limited due to the poor performance of mobile devices and the low bandwidth of wireless connections. However as mobile devices and wireless network systems are experiencing considerable elevation in their capabilities we believe that our methodology will be utilized effectively in building quite responsive useful mobile collaborative medical systems in the very near future.

Biomedical engineering research efforts have accomplished another level of a technological solution for diabetes: an artificial pancreas to be used by patients and supervised by healthcare professionals at any-time and place. Reliability of continuous glucose monitoring availability of real-time programmable insulin pumps and validation of safe and efficient control algorithms are critical components for achieving that goal. Nevertheless the development and integration of these new technologies within a telemedicine system can be the basis of a future artificial pancreas. This paper introduces the concept design and evaluation of the intelligent control assistant for diabetes INCA system. INCA is a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based personal smart assistant to provide patients with closed-loop control strategies (personal and remote loop) based on a real-time continuous glucose sensor (Guardian RT Medtronic) an insulin pump (D-TRON Disetronic Medical Systems) and a mobile general packet radio service (GPRS)-based telemedicine communication system. Patient therapeutic decision making is supervised by doctors through a multiaccess telemedicine central server that provides to diabetics and doctors a Web-based access to continuous glucose monitoring and insulin infusion data. The INCA system has been technically and clinically evaluated in two randomized and crossover clinical trials showing an improvement on glycaemic control of diabetic patients.;2008
By adopting augmented reality (AR) and integrating the functions of wireless communication of a personal digital assistant (PDA) and a head-mounted displays (HMD) we built a design evaluation environment that combines a full-scale car display and a visual evaluation system. The image of a car is transmitted via wireless communication onto the PDA which provides functions for measuring distances and changing parameters of the virtual car using graphical user interfaces (GUI). The updated car image is constructed on the fly on a PC server and sent back to the HMD and the PDA. Multiple users can look at a virtual car simultaneously and discuss its various aspects enabling better evaluation of the car design. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2008
Chinese materia medica (CMM) is becoming increasingly important in modern health care with the potential for new or improved clinical protocols and reduction in treatment costs. Conventional approaches to drug discovery are based on knowledge of biological systems and screen phenotypes in the context of a whole organism. It will be valuable to identify the CMM that would induce certain biological responses (such as angiogenesis). The authors have developed a database that they plan to commercialize that contains traditional knowledge of Chinese medicine and pharmacology along with their own experimental data from controlled scientific observations by using the zebrafish as a model of CMM-induced pathology. The database is visualized and functions via the World Wide Web by subscription or license. The authors have also written software for personal digital assistant (PDA) devices that supports multiple users performing screening experiments worldwide. This provides a platform for the study of CMM and data mining of this resource will help evaluate CMM in the context of experimental observations of biological aberrations.;2008
Context Further restrictions in resident duty hours are being considered and it is important to understand the association between workload sleep loss shift duration and the educational time of on-call medical interns. Objective To assess whether increased on- call intern workload as measured by the number of new admissions on- call and the number of previously admitted patients remaining on the service was associated with reductions in on- call sleep increased total shift duration and lower likelihood of participation in educational activities. Design Setting and Participants Prospective cohort study of medical interns at a single US academic medical center from July 1 2003 through June 24 2005. Of the 81 interns 56 participated ( 69%) for a total of 165 general medicine inpatient months resulting in 1100 call nights. Main Outcome Measures On- call sleep duration estimated by wrist watch actigraphy total shift duration measured from paging logs and participation in educational activities ( didactic lectures or bedside teaching) measured by experience sampling method via a personal digital assistant. Results Mean ( SD) sleep duration on- call was 2.8 ( 1.5) hours and mean ( SD) shift duration was 29.9 ( 1.7) hours. Interns reported spending 11% of their time in educational activities. Early in the academic year ( July to October) each new on- call admission was associated with less sleep (- 10.5 minutes [ 95% confidence interval {CI} - 16.8 to - 4.2 minutes] P <. 001) and a longer shift duration ( 13.2 minutes [ 95% CI 3.2- 23.3 minutes] P=. 01). A higher number of previously admitted patients remaining on the service was associated with a lower odds of participation in educational activities ( odds ratio 0.82 [ 95% CI 0.70- 0.96] P=. 01]. Call nights during the week and early in the academic year were associated with the most sleep loss and longest shift durations. Conclusion In this study population increased on- call workload was associated with more sleep loss longer shift duration and a lower likelihood of participation in educational activities.;2008
Convergence in the electronics sector has enabled the addition of disparate new functionalities to existing base products (e.g. adding mobile television to a cell phone or Internet access to a personal digital assistant). This research investigates the role of two factors-(1) the goal congruence between the added functionality and the base and (2) the nature of the base product (utilitarian versus hedonic)-on the evaluation of such convergent products (CPs). The author proposes that the evaluation of CPs with a utilitarian versus hedonic base is subject to an asymmetric additivity effect. Specifically whereas CPs with a utilitarian base gain more from adding an incongruent hedonic functionality than a congruent utilitarian one CPs with a hedonic base gain less from an incongruent utilitarian addition than a congruent hedonic one. This asymmetry is because hedonic additions enhance the pleasure of using a utilitarian base whereas utilitarian additions may dilute the existing hedonic image of a hedonic base. The moderating role of prior ownership of the base of a CP is also explored. The author proposes that the effects of goal congruence are stronger for owners than for nonowners but only for CPs with a hedonic base not for those with a utilitarian base. The author verifies the proposed effects in an experimental study conducted with a large-scale representative sample of the target market population. Further research on other (moderating) factors affecting the evaluation of CPs is also suggested.;2008
Conversation systems are moving out of the research labs and out into the real world. The persistent belief that conversation would be the most natural and powerful user interface to computers. This change is important for the performance of the systems. In this paper we present an experiment named a multimedia conversation System with application in supervised learning method and ranking function. This paper firstly discusses how to use multimedia information build knowledge database. Then it introduces applying the supervised learning method and ranking function to Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Finally it gives experiment approach and results. The experiment showed that this method could achieve better results in practice.;2008
Customer-driven product design process is critically an important part of concurrent engineering (CE). Many new principles and approaches such as quality function deployment (QFD) and axiomatic design have been introduced to help designers identify the relationship between customer requirements and design characteristics. However identification of customer requirements and evaluation of design alternatives are still heavily reliant on designer's experience and knowledge. This will affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the customer-driven design process and even make the development of design automation become more difficult. This paper presents a framework that integrates the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to assist designers in identifying customer requirements and design characteristics and help achieve an effective evaluation of the final design solution. The proposed approach starts with applying the AHP method to evaluate the relative overall importance of customer requirements and design characteristics. The TOPSIS method is then used to per-form competitive benchmarking. Finally a search strategy is employed to set target values for design characteristics of the recommended design alternative. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated and validated using a personal digital assistant (PDA) design example. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of helping designers to systematically consider relevant design information and effectively determine the key design objectives and optimal conceptual alternatives.

Dialogue systems are one of the most interesting applications of speech and language technologies. There have recently been some attempts to build dialogue systems in Spanish and some corpora have been acquired and annotated. Using these corpora statistical machine learning methods can be applied to try to solve problems in spoken dialogue systems. In this paper two statistical models based on the maximum likelihood assumption are presented and two main applications of these models on a Spanish dialogue corpus are shown: labelling and decoding. The labelling application is useful for annotating new dialogue corpora. The decoding application is useful for implementing dialogue strategies in dialogue systems. Both applications centre on unsegmented dialogue turns. The obtained results show that although limited the proposed statistical models are appropriate for these applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

During the process of learning teachers and/or students interact with each other on a personal level. However in e-learning the process is achieved through the intermediary of an information and communication technology ( ICT) system or service. Descriptions of these ICT-human interface devices are given in this paper. Successful interaction depends not just on personal relationships but also on understanding and the ability to use computers and communications equipment effectively. Interactivity when using ICT may as a result be different from that in a traditional classroom. The computer is the main man-machine interface and modulates people's ability to interact. Newer mobile technology will extend the ability to interact in terms of time and place as is illustrated by the use of portable digital assistants for dental teaching in clinics. The paper concludes that it is very important that both teachers and students should understand how to interact optimally with current and future ICT systems and devices.;2008
For many teenagers and young adults cell phones personal digital assistants and other handheld devices have become a necessity of everyday life. That fact has not escaped the attention of companies that have had great difficulty reaching young consumers through traditional marketing approaches. In theory the mobile platform provides the perfect mechanism for reaching young consumers. A large retailer might for example send a group of teenagers who are at a shopping mall various electronic coupons on their phones to promote special discounts. Many global corporations including Burger King MTV Procter & Gamble and Ford have initiated programs that enable consumers to search for the nearest restaurant location using their cell phones receive electronic coupons or participate in other mobile marketing activities. Such campaigns have generated click-through rates up to 10 times those of traditional Internet banner ads and recent forecasts for global mobile marketing spending range from $9 billion to $19 billion by 2011. That said several brands including Budweiser ESPN Sprite and adidas have launched mobile marketing efforts only to see some successes amidst an equal number of disappointments. To investigate what truly influences whether young consumers will participate in mobile marketing activities the authors recently conducted a survey in the United States and Pakistan. The study looked at the relative importance of a number of factors including consumers' personal attachment to their cell phones their concerns for privacy and their willingness to opt in and accept permission-based marketing. An analysis of the results uncovered important insights in consumer behavior. For instance people who are personally attached to their cell phones are neither more nor less inclined to participate in mobile marketing activities. And the data also revealed differences between markets: In general young Pakistanis are more amenable to receiving - and even may desire - mobile marketing communications whereas their American counterparts' willingness depends on a greater number of factors. Such results hold a number of important implications for companies developing mobile advertising campaigns across global markets.;2008
In a Digital Signal Processing course students received two different types of instructional delivery messages (online text only and text along with a simulation tool: MATLAB) via two different types of instructional delivery media (desktop PC and personal digital assistant (PDA)). An experimental study was designed to investigate the potential main effects and the interaction of these two independent variables: instructional delivery message and instructional delivery media. Results showed that students expressed a significantly higher intention to learn in a desktop PC environment than in a PDA environment (F[121]=17.31 p < 0.05). We also found that students who used a MATLAB simulation tool performed significantly better on an achievement test than those who did not use it (F[121]=10.96 p < 0.05).;2008
In this article we investigate the discourse between a female conversational pedagogical agent and 59 adolescents in the context of a social studies lesson. We note that previous pedagogical agent research has focused on the positive effects of agents while failing to take into account the intricacies of learner-agent discourse and subsequently missing the abuse suffered by pedagogical agents at users' fingertips. Our analysis indicates that learners readily misuse and abuse pedagogical agents while placing them in a subordinate and inferior role. We conclude by making recommendations on agent design and future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2008
In this paper we introduce a new perspective to the implementation of wireless MIMO transmission systems with increased bandwidth efficiency. Unlike traditional spatial multiplexing techniques in MIMO systems where additional information can be sent through the wireless channel by feeding uncorrelated antenna elements with diverse bitstreams we use the idea of mapping diverse bitstreams onto orthogonal bases defined in the beamspace domain of the transmitting array farfield region. Using this approach we show that we can increase the capacity of wireless communication systems using compact parasitic antenna architectures and a single RF front end at the transmitter thus paving the way for integrating MIMO systems in cost and size sensitive wireless devices such as mobile terminals and mobile personal digital assistants.;2008
In this paper we present the design implementation and evaluation of SOBA a system for ontology-based information extraction from heterogeneous data resources including plain text tables and image captions. SOBA is capable of processing structured information text and image captions to extract information and integrate it into a coherent knowledge base. To establish coherence SOBA interlinks the information extracted from different sources and detects duplicate information. The knowledge base produced by SOBA can then be used to query for information contained in the different sources in an integrated and seamless manner. Overall this allows for advanced retrieval functionality by which questions can be answered precisely. A further distinguishing feature of the SOBA system is that it straightforwardly integrates deep and shallow natural language processing to increase robustness and accuracy. We discuss the implementation and application of the SOBA system within the SmartWeb multimodal dialog system. In addition we present a thorough evaluation of the different components of the system. However an end-to-end evaluation of the whole SmartWeb system is out of the scope of this paper and has been presented elsewhere by the SmartWeb consortium. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we examine the meaning of conversing with pedagogical agents. Previous research has focused on examining cause and effect relationships failing to take into account the meaning of the experiences individuals have when holding a dialogue with conversational agents for educational purposes. To understand these experiences we have conducted a phenomenological examination of what it means to converse with a pedagogical agent. In phenomenological terms findings suggest the experience is complex engrossing virtual yet real human-like and social. Implications for the future design implementation and research of conversational agents in educational and other settings are discussed.;2008
In this paper we study the impact of considering context information for the annotation of emotions. Concretely we propose the inclusion of the history of user-system interaction and the neutral speaking style of users. A new method to automatically include both sources of information has been developed making use of novel techniques for acoustic normalization and dialogue context annotation. We have carried out experiments with a corpus extracted from real human interactions with a spoken dialogue system. Results show that the performance of non-expert human annotators and machine-learned classifications are both affected by contextual information. The proposed method allows the annotation of more non-neutral emotions and yields values closer to maximum agreement rates for nonexpert human annotation. Moreover automatic classification accuracy improves by 29.57% compared to the classical approach based only on acoustic features. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2008
In this project our goal is to improve student learning in engineering mechanics courses. Our hypothesis is that learning is improved by providing rapid feedback to students of their understanding of key concepts and skills being taught. This hypothesis was tested through experiments in which student performance on quizzes was measured after classes in which they were provided rapid feedback. The feedback system acts as a catalyst to encourage students working in pairs to assist each other in correcting misconceptions or deepening each other's understanding of the concept or skill at hand. Furthermore the system allows the professor to assess the students' level of comprehension or misconception in a just-in-time fashion and thus guide the pace of covering the material. The feedback is enabled through wireless-networked handheld computers or color-coded flashcards and this study focused on the differences in results between these two rapid feedback methods. In the first two years of the study this study was implemented in two sections Of a lower-level core-engineering course Statics as well as in follow-on courses of Dynamics and Solid Mechanics. Our results show that there was no statistically significant difference in knowledge gained between the two feedback methods as measured by student performance on quizzes. The students' perception however was that the handheld computers were more useful to them. The students showed a good retention of Statics concepts and skills in follow-on courses.;2008
In this study we combine swarm intelligence and Web Services to transform a conventional library system into an intelligent library system with high integrity usability correctness and reliability software for readers. We select 300 readers to test this intelligent system and software and compare it with a conventional library system. It is revealed that 64% of the readers are dissatisfied with the conventional library system and 93% of the readers are satisfied with the intelligent library system when using personal digital assistants. The software integrity satisfaction Was 99.99% usability satisfaction 93% correctness 95% and reliability 95%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2008
In this study we evaluated the sensitivity of a 5-min personal digital assistant-psychomotor vigilance test (PDA-PVT) to severe sleep loss. Twenty-one participants completed a 10-min PVT-192 and a 5-min PDA-PVT at two hourly intervals during 62 h of sustained wakefulness. For both tasks response speed and number of lapses (RTs > 500) per minute significantly increased with increasing hours of wakefulness. Overall standardized response speed scores on the 5-min PDA-PVT closely tracked those of the PVT-192 however the PDA-PVT was generally associated with more lapses/minute. Closer inspection of the data indicated that when the level of sleep loss and fatigue became more severe (i.e. Day 3) the 5-min PDA-PVT was not quite as sensitive as the 10-min PVT-192 when 2- to 10-sec foreperiods were used for both. It is likely however that the observed differences between the two devices was due to differences in task length. Thus the findings provide further evidence of the validity of the 5-min PDA-PVT as a substitute for the 10-min PVT-192 particularly in circumstances in which a shorter test is required and/or the PVT-192 is not as practical.;2008
Institutions of higher education are now using Internet-based technology tools to conduct surveys for data collection. Research shows that the type and quality of responses one receives with online surveys are comparable with what one receives in paper-based surveys. Data collection can take place on Web-based surveys e-mail-based surveys and personal digital assistants/Smartphone devices. Web surveys can be subscription templates software packages installed on one's own server or created from scratch using Web programming development tools. All of these approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. The survey owner must make informed decisions as to the right technology to implement. The correct choice can save hours of work in sorting organizing and analyzing data.;2008
Interest in the use and application of handheld technology at undergraduate and graduate nursing programs across the country is growing rapidly. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are often referred to as a peripheral brain because they can save time decrease errors and simplify information retrieval at the point of care. In addition research results support the notion that PDAs enhance nursing clinical education and are an effective student learning resource. However most nursing programs lack the full range of technological resources to implement and provide ongoing support for handheld technology use by faculty and students. This article describes a 9-month pilot project for the initial use of PDAs by novice faculty and students at Simmons College.;2008
Introduction This paper aims to describe the design methods and approaches used to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Skilled Care Initiative in reducing pregnancy-related and perinatal mortality in Ouargaye district Burkina Faso. Methods The evaluation used a quasi-experimental design mixed methods and a composite of tools to compare mortality and severe morbidity (near-miss) of women in reproductive age perinatal mortality facility functionality perceived quality of care utilisation of maternal health services and costs borne by families and the health care system for maternal health care in Ouargaye and Diapaga districts. Structured questionnaires and interview guides were developed pre-tested and piloted prior to the main survey. The evaluation was carried out from January to July 2006. A household census was used to retrospectively assess pregnancy-related and perinatal mortality over the previous 5 years and causes of pregnancy-related death were identified using a newly developed and tested probabilistic model for interpreting verbal autopsy data. Data were directly entered into Personal Digital Assistant devices at the point of interview. Analyses included univariate and multivariate regressions and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results A population census covering over half a million people three qualitative surveys and facility surveys in 47 health centres have been carried out. Conclusion A partnership with key stakeholders and the use of mixed methods proved feasible for evaluating complex safe motherhood strategies and the use of hand-held computers proved possible for direct data capture even in this remote rural environment.;2008
Irion Technologies is a language technology company at Delft (The Netherlands) that incorporates linguistic knowledge to build new generations of information systems: conceptual retrieval automatic extraction of terms and ontologies and open-domain dialogue systems. These systems are multi-lingual and cross-lingual and combine statistical machine learning techniques with linguistic techniques. We have carried out evaluations of some of these systems. For information retrieval we found advantages with respect to standard statistical approaches within special experimental settings that focus on ambiguity. Term extraction is clearly benefiting from rich linguistic knowledge and resources. Dialogue systems depend on the communicative models and systems that also require deep linguistic processing. From our perspective language technology is definitely helping to make applications better and necessary to develop new applications.;2008
Laboratory specialists currently need to access scientific-based information at anytime and anywhere. A considerable period of time and too much effort are required to access this information through existing accumulated data. Personal digital assistants (PDA) are supposed to provide an effective solution with commercial software for this problem. In this study 11 commercial software products (UpToDate ePocrates Inforetrive Pepid eMedicine FIRST Consult and 5 laboratory e-books released by Skyscape and/or Isilo) were selected and the benefits of their use were evaluated by seven laboratory specialists. The assessment of the software was performed based on the number of the tests included the software content of detailed information for each test-like process method interpretation of results reference ranges critical values interferences equations pathophysiology supplementary technical details such as sample collection principles and additional information such as linked references evidence-based data test cost etc. In terms of technique the following items are considered: the amount of memory required to run the software the graphical user interface which is a user-friendly instrument and the frequency of new and/or up-date releases. There is still no perfect program as we have anticipated. Interpretation of laboratory results may require software with an integrated program. However methodological data are mostly not included in the software evaluated. It seems that these shortcomings will be fixed in the near future and PDAs and relevant medical applications will also become indispensable for all physicians including laboratory specialists in the field of training/education and in patient care.;2008
Mobile technology has the potential to revolutionize how physicians practice medicine. From having access to the latest medical research at the point of care to being able to communicate at a moment's notice with physicians and colleagues around the world we are practicing medicine in a technological age. During recent years many physicians have been simultaneously using a pager cellular telephone and personal digital assistant (PDA) to keep in communication with the hospital and to access medical information or calendar functions. Many physicians have begun replacing multiple devices with a smartphone which functions as a cellular telephone pager and PDA. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the currently available platforms that make up the smartphone devices and the available medical software. Each platform has its unique advantages and disadvantages and available software will vary by device and is in constant flux.;2008
Mobile technology is a continuously growing domain and research activities regarding its use are quite intensive. A questionnaire regarding the use of mobile devices was developed and distributed to 416 students in it Greek University. There were completed 384 questionnaires. The results revealed that students Use their mobiles mostly for phone calls and Short Message Service (SMS). They also tend to use their mobiles to take photos and activate the reminder. However they do not deal with many of the devices' operations. They use their mobiles to communicate (telephone SMS and e-mail) mostly with their boy/girl friend then with their friends. They use their mobiles mostly at home then at the University. Also they consider health issues as the main reason to limit the use of their mobiles. Finally there was not a statistically significant relationship between genders and their preferences.;2008
New geographic information system (GIS) applications in airfield infrastructure system management and maintenance are discussed. Aviation activity is steadily increasing and U.S. airport facilities must provide higher service quality and must increase capacities to accommodate projected aviation growth. In response to the increasing requirements from passengers and airliners efficiency is the most important factor in airport operations and airfield facilities maintenance. Airport authorities particularly at large commercial airports increasingly understand the benefits in using GIS-based programs to plan and manage their airport facilities. An integrated GIS system combined with Geographic Positioning Systems and personal digital assistants provides a powerful tool that helps airport operators and engineers improve regular airfield inspection management and reporting processes resulting in a more efficient airport operation system. GIS applications associated with other tools are introduced and airport personnel are given several easy-to-learn GIS approaches and techniques. This is intended to help airports improve current airfield facility inspection processes and maintenance mechanisms. An implementation plan achieved at Kaohsiung International Airport in Taiwan was used to demonstrate how an integrated GIS system can help airport operators and engineers receive real-time facilities data evaluate deterioration rates and make policy decisions on maintenance and rehabilitation within a short time. This implementation plan is designed on a step-by-step basis that allows airport personnel to easily follow and apply the system to airport practice. Another example carried out at Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) in Utah was used to show GIS applications in facilitating skid resistance evaluation of runway surfaces. By adding projection data to the airport image SLC airport maintenance crews can graphically evaluate friction capacities of Runway 16L-34R and investigate potential factors that result in a reduction of skid resistance. Up-to-date GIS application approaches are shown so that airport personnel may develop a suitable GIS system that enables airports to improve their operation systems and increase aviation safety.;2008
OBJECTIVE. Cognitive impairment is a common symptom for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the effects of an occupational therapy training protocol using personal digital assistants (PDAs) as assistive technology for people with cognitive impairment related to MS. METHODS. Twenty participants were trained to use PDAs by an occupational therapist. Assessments of functional performance were taken at the start of an 8-week pretreatment period at the beginning and end of training and 8 weeks after the conclusion of training. RESULTS. Participants demonstrated the ability to learn how to use basic PDA functions and retain learning for at least 8 weeks. Functional performance increased significantly with PDA use and this gain was maintained at 8-week follow-up. CONCLUSION. This study provides evidence of an association between an intervention providing training in the use of a PDA and improvements in the everyday function of people with cognitive impairment related to MS.;2008
OBJECTIVES In December 2005 and March 2006 Niger conducted nationwide integrated campaigns to distribute polio vaccine and long lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) to children < 5 years of age. We evaluated the campaign effectiveness net retention insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership and usage. METHODS Two nationwide cross-sectional surveys in January 2006 (dry season) and September 2006 (rainy season) using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design. We mapped selected communities selected households by simple random sampling and administered questionnaires by interviewers using personal digital assistants. RESULTS The first survey showed that ITN ownership in all households was 6.3% prior to the campaign increasing to 65.1% after the campaign in the second survey. The second survey also showed that 73.4% of households with children < 5 received an LLIN and that 97.7% of households that received >= one LLIN retained it. The wealth equity ratio for ITN ownership in households with children < 5 increased from 0.17 prior to the campaign to 0.79 afterward. During the dry season 15.4% of all children < 5 and 11.3% of pregnant women slept under an ITN while during rainy season 55.5% of children < 5 and 48.2% of pregnant women slept under an ITN. CONCLUSIONS Free distribution during the integrated campaign rapidly increased ITN ownership and decreased inequities between those in the highest and lowest wealth quintiles. Retention of ITNs was very high and usage was high during malaria transmission season. However ITN ownership and usage by vulnerable groups continues to fall short of RBM targets and additional strategies are needed to increase ownership and usage.;2008
OBJECTIVES. The objectives of this study were to ( 1) assess accuracy of hypoglycemia detection in children with type 1 diabetes and their parents using personal digital assistant technology to collect glucose estimates and meter readings ( 2) identify demographic clinical and psychological predictors of individual differences in accuracy and ( 3) test whether poor hypoglycemia detection is a risk factor for severe hypoglycemia in children. METHODS. Sixty-one children aged 6 to 11 and their parents completed 70 trials over 1 month of a survey programmed on a personal digital assistant which asked them to rate symptoms estimate current blood glucose level and then measure blood glucose level. For the subsequent 6 months parents reported children's severe hypoglycemia episodes bimonthly. RESULTS. Both parents and children showed poor ability to recognize high or low blood glucose levels making clinically significant errors as frequently as clinically accurate estimates. Parents failed to recognize >50% of readings <3 mmol/ L (<55 mg/dL) and made potentially dangerous errors such as believing the blood glucose level was high when it was low 17% of the time. Children were significantly more accurate at recognizing their hypoglycemia but still failed to detect >40% of episodes. Higher depression scores for children related to lower accuracy. Children who were less accurate at detecting hypoglycemia subsequently experienced more severe hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS. Ability to recognize hypoglycemia is a significant problem for children with type 1 diabetes and their parents. For children poor ability to detect low blood glucose levels may be a significant and underappreciated risk factor for severe hypoglycemia. More effort is needed to provide education and training designed to improve hypoglycemia detection in this population.;2008
Objective To develop a personal digital assistant (PDA) application for oral health assessment fieldwork including back-office and database systems (MobilDent). Design System design construction and implementation of PDA back-office and database systems. Methods System requirements for MobilDent were collected analysed and translated into system functions. User interfaces were implemented and system architecture was outlined. MobilDent was based on a platform with.NET (Microsoft) components using an SQL Server 2005 (Microsoft) for data storage with Windows Mobile (Microsoft) operating system. The PDA devices were Dell Axim. Results System functions and user interfaces were specified for MobilDent. User interfaces for PDA back-office and database systems were based on. NET programming. The PDA user interface was based on Windows suitable to a PDA display whereas the back-office interface was designed for a normal-sized computer screen. A synchronisation module (MS Active Sync Microsoft) was used to enable download of field data from PDA to the database. Conclusions MobilDent is a feasible application for oral health assessment fieldwork and the oral health assessment database may prove a valuable source for care planning educational and research purposes. Further development of the MobilDent system will include wireless connectivity with download-on-demand technology.;2008
Objective. To investigate rheumatology practice in Canada with regard to evaluating disease activity status and treatment regimens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It was hypothesized that patients with smoldering disease activity were not being adequately treated. Methods. Rheumatologists were invited to participate by the Canadian Rheumatology Association in an audit entitled the Assessment in Rheumatology (AIR) program. From across Canada 65 rheumatologists participated. One thousand five hundred ninety-six consecutive patients with RA seen in regular clinics were classified according to 4 states of disease activity: remission controlled adequately smoldering and uncontrolled. Demographics (age sex geographic region) therapy (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs disease modifying antirheumatic drugs biologicals steroids) joint counts (tender/swollen) comorbidity and treatment decisions at the time of the visit were recorded. Data were collected at the time of the visit with personal digital assistants (PDA) and aggregated without personal identifiers for analysis in SPSS. Results. The majority of patients had smoldering (29%) or uncontrolled disease (23%) with the remainder in remission (15%) or controlled adequately (33%) at the time of their visit. Following the appointment the uncontrolled group had a 100% increase (from 10.4% to 23.4%) in the addition of biological agents however there was no significant increase in the rates for those with smoldering disease (19.4% to 20.5%). Conclusion. Despite Canada's universal healthcare system current treatment regimens may not be optimized on the basis of disease activity. A large proportion of patients with RA (29%) seen in Canadian rheumatology practices may be experiencing unnecessary disease for a variety of reasons.;2008
Objective: Following the recent introduction of hand-held computers to be used by patients instead of conventional pencil-and-paper questionnaires a validation study under 'real-life' conditions was conducted in order to compare these two clinical instruments when used by chronic pain patients to describe their pain using visual and numerical rating scales. Method. Each of 200 chronic pain patients attending a single physician's practice was given two pain questionnaires to complete one on paper and one on a hand-held computer completion of these took place directly before and after consultation in randomised order. The questions asked in the two questionnaires were identical: present pain average pain worst pain and those of the pain DETECT questionnaire (the latter distinguishes characteristic symptoms of nociceptive pain). In accordance with standard practice the paper questionnaire used numerical rating scales and the electronic one employed visual analogue scales with or without a numerical indicator. Results: Nearly all patients (99%) of the study population (58% female aged 57 +/- 14 years) completed both questionnaires. In spite of the expected substantial intra-individual scatter overall results from the two questionnaire types were highly consistent. Only a few differences of potential statistical significance (p < 5%) were observed and none were found that would have led to different interpretations. No difference was seen between results from the electronic visual analogue scales with and without a numerical indicator. Conclusion: Under conditions of routine clinical practice the hand-held computer questionnaire can give results equivalent to those obtained with the conventional paper questionnaire.;2008
Objective: Presented work highlights the development and initial validation of a medical embedded device for individualized care (MEDIC) which is based on a novel software architecture enabling sensor management and disease prediction capabilities and commercially available microelectronic components sensors and conventional. personal digital assistant (PDA) (or a cell phone). Methods and materials: In this paper we present a general architecture for a wearable sensor system that can be customized to an individual patient's needs. This architecture is based on embedded artificial intelligence that permits autonomous operation sensor management and inference and may be applied to a general purpose wearable medical diagnostics. Results: A prototype of the system has been developed based on a standard PDA and wireless sensor nodes equipped with commercially available Bluetooth radio components permitting real-time streaming of high-bandwidth data from various physiological and contextual sensors. We also present the results of abnormal gait diagnosis using the complete system from our evaluation and illustrate how the wearable system and its operation can be remotely configured and managed by either-enterprise systems or medical personnel at centralized locations. Conclusion: By using commercially available hardware components and software architecture presented in this paper the MEDIC system can be rapidly configured providing medical researchers with broadband sensor data from remote patients and platform access to best adapt operation for diagnostic operation objectives.

Objective: The progression from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed through intensive lifestyle changes. How to translate this to implementation across whole communities remains unclear. We now describe the results to a pilot of a personal trainer (Maori Community Health Worker MCHW) approach among Maori in New Zealand. Design setting and subjects: A randomised cluster-controlled trial of intensive lifestyle change was commenced among 5240 non-pregnant Maori family members without diabetes from 106 rural and 106 urban geographical clusters. Baseline assessments included lifestyle questionnaires anthropometric measurements and venesection. A pilot studt (Vanguard Study) cohort of 160 participants were weighed before and during MCHW intervention and compared with fifty-two participants weighed immediately before intervention and with 1143 participants from the same geographical area. Interactions between participants and the MCHW were reported using personal digital assistants with a programmed detailed structured approach to each interview. Results: During the Vanguard Study participants and MCHW found the messages toolkit and delivery approach acceptable. Those with IGT/IFG diagnosed (n 27) experienced significant weight loss after screening and during the Vanguard Study (5.2 (SD 6.6) kg paired t test P < 0.01). Significant weight loss occurred during the Vanguard Study among all participants (-1.3 (SD 3.6) kg P < 0.001). Conclusions: Comparable initial weight loss was shown among those with IGT/IFG and those from existing trials. Community-wide prevention programmes are feasible among Maori and are likely to result in significant reductions in the incidence of diabetes.;2008
Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of personal digital assistants (PDAs) as cognitive aids in a sample of individuals with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method: The group included 23 community-dwelling individuals at least 1 year post-severe TBI who had difficulties in performing everyday tasks due to behavioural memory problems. Participants were trained by an occupational therapist to use PDAs as cognitive aids and assessed for occupational performance (using Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)) and participation in everyday life tasks (using Craig Handicap Assessment and Rating Technique-Revised (CHART)) before training and 8 weeks after training concluded. Results: Statistically significant improvement was noted for self-ratings of occupational performance and satisfaction with occupational performance (COPM) significant improvement in a self-rating of participation was noted (CHART-R). Conclusion: A brief training intervention utilizing PDAs as cognitive aids is associated with improved self-ratings of performance in everyday life tasks among community-dwelling individuals with severe TBI.;2008
Objective: To use experience sampling method (ESM) to examine the impact of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD symptoms on emotional well-being activities and distress cognitive impairment and social functioning assessed in the daily lives of young adults. The impact of subjective appraisals on their experiences is also examined. Method: Participants (n = 206) complete up to 56 in-the-moment assessments of mood and current activities using Personal Digital Assistants for 1 week. Results: Multilevel modeling techniques reveal that ADHD inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms differentially relate to daily experiences. Higher inattentive symptoms are associated with indices of general distress including less positive and more negative mood as well as more concentration problems. Higher hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are associated with reduced sensitivity to contextual factors in perceptions of situations. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate predictive validity for adult self-report of ADHD symptoms in a general population sample and suggest future research directions using ESM. (J. of Att. Dis. 2008 11(6) 652-663);2008
Objective: Treatment-emergent side effects are frequent events particularly during the uptitration of antiepileptic drugs. So far monitoring of such adverse events in outpatients has often been limited to intervals of weeks or months. We here report the application of a new device for temporally fine-grained assessment of objective well-being and cognitive performance using personal digital assistants (PDAs). Methods: Twenty adult patients with epilepsy participated in this pilot study. Ten received add-on treatment with levetiracetam. Ten patients with constant medication served as a control group. Differences between groups with respect to self-rated cognitive condition psychophysical condition aggressiveness and cognitive test performance in a concentration test assessed three times daily (morning early afternoon and evening) over the course of 6 days were analyzed. Results: Levetiracetam-treated patients manifested an early augmentation of self-rated aggressiveness which increased in intensity over the course of days. Aggressiveness reached a maximum in the early afternoon across days. There were no major changes in cognitive performance except for an increase in morning performance in the control group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a new method of ambulatory assessment of behavioral and cognitive data during titration of antiepileptic drugs. Significant changes in aggressiveness under add-on treatment with levetiracetam were found to be dependent on the time of assessment during the day. These results suggest that PDA-based ambulatory monitoring of patients with epilepsy may be a promising tool for early detection of drug-related side effects and thus may constitute a significant improvement in patient care.

Objective: We evaluated the feasibility of electronic data capture of self-administered patient questionnaires using a Tablet PC for integration in routine patient management we also compared these data with results received from corresponding paper-pencil versions. Methods: Standardised patient questionnaires (FFbH/ HAQ BASDAI SF-36) were implemented in our documentation software. 153 outpatients ( rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus spondyloarthritis) completed sets of questionnaires as paper-pencil and electronic versions using a Tablet PC. The quality and validity of data obtained using a Tablet PC and the capability of disabled patients to handle it were assigned patients' experiences preferences and computer/internet use were also assessed. Results: Scores obtained by direct data entry on the Tablet PC did not differ from the scores obtained by the paper-pencil questionnaires in the complete group and disease subgroups. No major difficulties using the Tablet PC occurred. 62.1% preferred remote data entry in the future. Seven (4.6%) patients felt uncomfortable with the Tablet PC due to their rheumatic disease. Conclusions: Self-administered questionnaires via Tablet PC are a facile and capable option in patients with rheumatic diseases to monitor disease activity efficacy and safety assessments continuously. Tablet PC applications offers directly available data for clinical decision-making improves quality of care by effective patient monitoring and contributes to patients' empowerment.;2008
Objectives To assess our experiences of using hand-held computers (personal digital assistants PDAs) for direct data capture in a large community-based geo-referenced survey in rural Burkina Faso highlighting benefits and lessons learnt from their use. Methods A population-based geo-referenced survey of over 500 000 people was undertaken using PDAs with in-built GPS receivers and the resulting database analysed in terms of successful completion error rates and interview durations. Results Surveys were successfully completed for 84 861 households (98.3%) by 127 interviewers. The data input error rate was assessed at 0.24% with more than half of the errors being made by less than 10% of the interviewers. Faster interviewers were not less accurate. Time-stamped and geo-referenced data allowed reconstruction of particular interviewer-day activities. Conclusions Although the survey setting was challenging the feasibility of using direct data capture on a large scale was well established. We learnt that with more experience we could have made better use of real-time entry and quality control checking procedures. The work involved in designing and setting up a complex survey on PDAs prior to data collection should not be underestimated.;2008
Objectives To investigate the perceived value and the recording storage and use of pharmacists' clinical intervention data in New Zealand hospitals. Methods A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey of all pharmacy managers in public and privately funded hospitals employing one or more pharmacists. Main outcome measures The number of hospitals collecting information the collection and storage systems used and use of the data. Results Twenty-nine hospitals responded (94%). All rated data collection as very important (17) or important (12) but five hospitals of all sizes did not record interventions. Of those collecting data 21 hospitals made daily recordings and three periodic. Pre-printed forms were the most popular initial collection method (18 hospitals) with notebooks used by three hospitals. Almost all the hospitals using a paper-based collection system (15 83%) transcribed data into an electronic database but there were unfavourable comments regarding transcription and analysis time. Three hospitals stated they used direct intranet data entry but one also used a backup paper form when ward computer access was limited. Of information frequently recorded variability in categorising interventions and grading severity were identified as concerns. The impact on cost savings was not commonly recorded. The most popular uses for intervention data was to provide management activity reports (15) identify pharmacists' impact on patient care (15) and to identify prescribing problems (14) less than half reported use for educational purposes. Five hospitals reported data were underutilised and 15 considered their systems required modification. Conclusions The majority of New Zealand hospitals collect pharmacist intervention data on a daily basis. While a high value is placed on intervention data by pharmacy managers some hospitals did not meet national data collection requirements. Favouring paper-based systems over direct electronic entry may reflect difficulties in computer access in ward areas. The development of a national system is suggested to aid access to data collection for all hospitals provided issues of categorising and grading can be resolved. Furthermore we recommend that direct-entry technologies be critically evaluated for reliability efficiency and cost and that data be used more frequently for hospital staff education.;2008
Objectives. To describe the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) by doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) students determine the reliability of psychometric constructs that determine technology acceptance and determine constructs that directly correlate with PDA use. Methods. A survey instrument was developed containing descriptive and psychometric items and administered to PharmD students at 2 universities. Results. Over half of new users (58.1%) and experienced users (51.3%) reported using their PDA at least weekly. Eighty-four percent of experienced users used their PDA at least weekly to look up drug information. The most reliable scales were perceived usefulness (alpha = 0.92) perceived ease of use (alpha = 0.89) and attitude towards behavior (alpha = 0.84). Intention to use and self- reported use of PDAs were strongly correlated with perceived usefulness attitude towards behavior and compatibility. Conclusions. The majority of pharmacy students used their PDAs at least weekly and find them most useful for looking up drug information.;2008
Objectives: The objective of the study was to determine how many patient-related questions emergency medicine physicians have and how they answer them at the point of care. Methods: We conducted an observational study of 26 physicians at 2 institutions. All physicians were followed for at least 2 shifts. The number and type of questions were recorded. The percentage answered resources used and barriers to answering questions were also recorded. Results: Physicians had 235 questions or approximately 5 questions per 8-hour shift. They attempted to answer 81% of them and were successful 87% of the time. The 2 most commonly used information sources were drug information resources (Personal digital assistant [PDA] pocket pharmacopeia [37% of the time]) followed by electronic resources (Google UpToDate [29% of the time]). The most common reason for not pursuing a question was lack of time and distractions or interruptions followed by a belief that an answer would not be found. When an answer was not found to a pursued question non-emergency department physicians were the most common resource consulted (28%). Conclusions: Emergency department physicians in this study pursued and found answers for most questions posed at the point of care. Rapid access to electronic resources and drug-prescribing references were critical for answering questions at the point of care. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2008
Objectives: To determine the feasibility of using personal digital assistant (PDA)-based technology for tracking and analysis of food intake in low-income pregnant women. Design: Descriptive. Participants provided an initial 24-hour dietary recall and recorded their food intake using a PDA-based software program for 2 days. Setting: Recruitment occurred during the prenatal intake visit at a health department-sponsored Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) clinic. Participants: Nonprobability sampling was used to recruit 10 women. Variable Measured: Demographics and a satisfaction rating scale for the 2 food recording methods. A Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was calculated for each food record. Analysis: Scores of the satisfaction rating scales were summarized. Paired t tests were used to analyze differences in HEIs obtained from the participants' 24-hour recall and PDA-based food records. Results: The PDA was significantly easier to use compared to the 24-hour recall and no significant differences in ease of remembering food intake between these methods was noted. Most women liked the PDA and felt it was more accurate than 24-hour recalls. Results showed no significant difference in mean HEI scores between food records from 24-hour recall to PDA. Conclusions and Implications: PDA-based software may be an acceptable method for obtaining food records to provide more accurate assessments of dietary intake in this vulnerable population.;2008
On-line auctions pose many challenges for the empirical researcher one of which is the effective and reliable modelling of price paths. We propose a novel way of modelling price paths in eBay's on-line auctions by using functional data analysis. One of the practical challenges is that the functional objects are sampled only very sparsely and unevenly. Most approaches rely on smoothing to recover the underlying functional object from the data which can be difficult if the data are irregularly distributed. We present a new approach that can overcome this challenge. The approach is based on the ideas of mixed models. Specifically we propose a semiparametric mixed model with boosting to recover the functional object. As well as being able to handle sparse and unevenly distributed data the model also results in conceptually more meaningful functional objects. In particular we motivate our method within the framework of eBay's on-line auctions. On-line auctions produce monotonic increasing price curves that are often correlated across auctions. The semiparametric mixed model accounts for this correlation in a parsimonious way. It also manages to capture the underlying monotonic trend in the data without imposing model constraints. Our application shows that the resulting functional objects are conceptually more appealing. Moreover when used to forecast the outcome of an on-line auction our approach also results in more accurate price predictions compared with standard approaches. We illustrate our model on a set of 183 closed auctions for Palm M515 personal digital assistants.;2008
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are increasingly in use in both clinical practice and nursing education as a method of providing timely access to resources at the point of care. This article describes the use of PDAs during the medical-surgical clinical component of a Bachelor of Nursing program in Australia. The aim of the study was to investigate whether PDAs would enhance students' pharmacological and clinical contextual knowledge and to identify issues associated with the use of PDAs in students' clinical experience. A mixed-method approach was used incorporating a quasi-experimental design with pretest and posttest of pharmacological knowledge and focus group discussions. Students using the PDAs demonstrated a moderate increase in their mean score which was double the increase in the control group. Findings from the focus group discussions indicated that students found the PDAs easy to use and perceived their use as beneficial to their learning in the clinical area. This study provides support for the ongoing implementation of PDAs into nursing education.;2008

Purpose - This paper aims to give an overview of a dialogue manager and recent experiments with multimodal human-robot dialogues. Design/methodology/approach - The paper identifies requirements and solutions in the design of a human-robot interface. The paper presents essential techniques for a humanoid robot in a household environment and describes their application to representative interaction scenarios that are based on standard situations for a humanoid robot in a household environment. The presented dialogue manager has been developed within the German collaborative research center SFB-588 on Humanoid Robots - Learning and Cooperating Multimodal Robots. The dialogue system is embedded in a multimodal perceptual system of the humanoid robot developed within this project. The implementation of the dialogue manager is geared to requirements found in the explored scenarios. The algorithms include multimodal fusion reinforcement learning knowledge acquisition and tight coupling of dialogue manager and speech recognition. Findings - Within the presented scenarios several algorithms have been implemented and show improvements of the interactions. Results are reported within scenarios that model typical household situations. Research limitations/implications - Additional scenarios need to be explored especially in real-world (out of the lab) experiments. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for the development of humanoid robots and human-robot interaction. Originality/value - This paper explores human-robot interaction scenarios and describes solutions for dialogue systems.;2008
Purpose: To illustrate approaches for providing decision support for evidence-based nursing practice through integration of evidence into clinical information systems (CISs) with examples from our experience at Columbia University Medical Center. Organizing construct: Examples are organized according to three types of decision support functions: information management focusing attention and patient-specific consultation. Methods: Three decision support tools that are integrated into three types of CISs are discussed: (1) infobuttons that provide context-specific access to digital sources of evidence (2) automated Fall-Injury Risk Assessment and (3) personal digital assistant-based screening reminders screening assessments and tailored documentation templates for the identification and management of obesity depression and tobacco cessation. The informatics infrastructure for implementing these decision support tools is described from the perspective of components identified in the published literature. Conclusions: Efforts to facilitate application of evidence into nursing practice are unlikely to be successful unless the approaches used are integrated into the clinical workflow. Our approaches use a variety of informatics methods to integrate evidence into CiSs as a mechanism for providing decision support for evidence-based practice in a manner consistent with nursing workflow.

Rapid deployment of statistical spoken dialogue systems poses portability challenges for building new applications. We discuss the challenges that arise and focus on two main problems: (i) fast semantic annotation for statistical speech understanding and (ii) reliable and efficient statistical language modeling using limited in-domain resources. We address the first problem by presenting a new boot-strapping framework that uses a majority-voting based combination of three methods for the semantic annotation of a mini-corpus that is usually manually annotated. The three methods are a statistical decision tree based parser a similarity measure and a support vector machine classifier. The bootstrapping framework results in an overall cost reduction of about a factor of two in the annotation effort compared to the baseline method. We address the second problem by devising a method to efficiently build reliable statistical language models for new spoken dialog systems given limited in-domain data. This method exploits external text resources that are collected for other speech recognition tasks as well as dynamic text resources acquired from the World Wide Web. The proposed method is applied to a spoken dialog system in a financial transaction domain and a natural language call-routing task in a package shipment domain. The experiments demonstrate that language models built using external resources when used jointly with the limited in-domain language model result in relative word error rate reductions of 9-18%. Alternatively the proposed method can be used to produce a 3-to-10 fold reduction for the in-domain data requirement to achieve a given performance level. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Rationale Cognitive processes underlying drug use have typically been assessed in laboratory settings. More detailed and ecologically valid data may be possible if assessments were conducted in an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) setting. Objectives We evaluated the feasibility and utility of administering a reaction time task on a hand-held computer (personal digital assistant PDA) in an EMA setting. Materials and methods Twenty-two smokers and 22 non-smokers carried around the PDA for 1 week as they went about their daily lives. They were beeped at random times four times per day (random assessments RAs). Participants were also instructed to press an anxiety assessment (AA) button on the PDA whenever they felt suddenly anxious. At each assessment (RA AA) participants responded to items assessing subjective pharmacological and contextual variables and subsequently completed a Stroop task (classic-Stroop emotional-Stroop or smoking-Stroop task). Results Participants responded to 81.2% of RAs completed assessments in an average of 4.44 min reported no interruptions on the majority of assessments (62.4%) and produced data with adequate reliability. Using generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses age was associated with the classic-Stroop effect state anxiety was associated with the emotional-Stroop effect and Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scores were associated with the smoking-Stroop effect. Conclusions The study provided evidence for the feasibility and utility of the approach.;2008
Rising demand for parking at suburban transit stations such as the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District in San Francisco California necessitates strategies to manage traveler demand. To better manage parking supply researchers implemented a smart parking field test at the Rock-ridge BART station from 2004 to 2006 to evaluate the effects of smart parking technologies [changeable message signs (CMSs) Internet reservations and billing mobile phone and personal digital assistant communications and a wireless parking lot counting system] on transit ridership and response to service pricing. Researchers used expert interviews Internet surveys focus groups and parking reservation data to conduct this analysis. Survey data indicated that the field test increased BART trips and resulted in 9.7 fewer miles per participant per month on average. Key lessons learned include that it would have been beneficial to anticipate additional time for project scoping and permitting and that fixed wayfinding signs were beneficial in terms of both directing vehicles from the highway to the smart parking lot and addressing resident concerns about increased traffic. In addition most participants continued to use the service when fees were implemented. However CMSs were not widely employed in users' decision-making processes in this application. Finally the wireless counting system worked well with the exception of the in-ground sensors which were prone to miscounts.;2008
SETTING: One hundred and twenty-six public health centers and laboratories in Lima Peru without internet. BACKGROUND : We have previously shown that a personal digital assistant (PDA) based system reduces data collection delays and errors for tuberculosis (TB) laboratory results when compared to a paper system. OBJECTIVE: To assess the data collection efficiency of each system and the resources required to develop implement and transfer the PDA-based system to a resource-poor setting. DESIGN: Time-motion study of data collectors using the PDA-based and paper systems. Cost analysis of developing implementing and transferring the PDA-based system to a local organization and their redeployment of the system. RESULTS: Work hours spent collecting and processing results decreased by 60% (P < 0.001). Users perceived this decrease to be 70% and had no technical problems they failed to fix. The total cost and time to develop and implement the intervention was US$26 092 and 22 weeks. The cost to extend the system to cover nine more districts was $1125 and to implement collecting patient weights was $4107. CONCLUSION: A PDA-based system drastically reduced the effort required to collect TB laboratory results from remote locations. With the framework described open-source software and local development organizations in resource-poor settings could reap the benefits of this technology.;2008
Since English has been an international language how to enhance English levels of people by useful computer assisted learning forms or tools is a critical issue in non-English speaking countries because it definitely affects the overall competition ability of a country. With the rapid growth of wireless and mobile technologies the mobile learning has been gradually considered as a novel and effective learning form because it inherits all the advantages of e-learning as well as breaks the limitations of learning time and space occurring in the traditional classroom learning. To provide an effective and flexible learning environment for English learning this study adopts the advantages of the mobile learning to present a personalized intelligent mobile learning system (PIMS) which can appropriately recommend English news articles to learners based on the learners' reading abilities evaluated by the proposed fuzzy Item Response Theory (FIRT). In addition to promote the reading abilities of English news the unknown or unfamiliar vocabularies of individual learner can also be automatically discovered and retrieved from the reading English news articles by the PIMS system according to the English vocabulary ability of individual learner for enhancing vocabulary learning. Currently the PIMS system has been successfully implemented on the personal digital assistant (PDA) to provide personalized mobile learning for promoting the reading ability of English news. Experimental results indicated that the proposed system provides an efficient and effective mobile learning mechanism by adaptively recommending English news articles as well as enhancing unknown or unfamiliar vocabularies' learning for individual learners.;2008
Since learning English is very popular in non-English speaking countries developing modern assisted-learning tools that support effective English learning is a critical issue in the English-language education field. Learning English involves memorization and practice of a large number of vocabulary words and numerous grammatical structures. Vocabulary learning is a principal issue for English learning because vocabulary comprises the basic building blocks of English sentences. Therefore many studies have attempted to improve the efficiency and performance when learning English vocabulary. With the accelerated growth in wireless and mobile technologies mobile learning using mobile devices such as PDAs tablet PCs and cell phones has gradually become considered effective because it inherits all the advantages of e-learning and overcomes limitations of learning time and space that limit web-based learning systems. Therefore this study presents a personalized mobile English vocabulary learning system based on Item Response Theory and learning memory cycle which recommends appropriate English vocabulary for learning according to individual learner vocabulary ability and memory cycle. The proposed system has been successfully implemented on personal digital assistant (PDA) for personalized English vocabulary learning. The experimental results indicated that the proposed system could obviously promote the learning performances and interests of learners due to effective and flexible learning mode for English vocabulary learning.

Small displays on mobile handheld devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cellular phones are the bottlenecks for usability of most content browsing applications. Generally conventional content such as documents and web pages need to be modified for effective presentation on mobile devices. This paper proposes a novel visualization for documents called Multimedia Thumbnails which consists of text and image content converted into playable multimedia clips. A Multimedia Thumbnail utilizes visual and audio channels of small portable devices as well as both spatial and time dimensions to communicate text and image information of a single document. The proposed algorithm for generating Multimedia Thumbnails includes 1) a semantic document analysis step where salient content from a source document is extracted 2) an optimization step where a subset of this extracted content is selected based on time display and application constraints and 3) a composition step where the selected visual and audible document content is combined into a Multimedia Thumbnail. Scalability of MMNails that allows generation of multimedia clips of various lengths is also described. A user study is presented that evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed Multimedia Thumbnail visualization.;2008
Smart and intelligent environments can proficiently benefit a new generation of multimodal dialog systems which enable users to interact in natural ways like voice gesture facial motions and so on. However in order to make this possible it is necessary to integrate such systems and services possibly in a transparent way. In the present paper we propose an architectural model for multimodal smart environments then an agent-based middleware infrastructure that provides basic components for the integration of multimodal interaction systems and a set of ontologies and rules for semantically handling interacting properties of devices and resources available in smart environments.

Speech recognition in a noisy environment is one of the hottest topics in the speech recognition research. Noise-tolerant acoustic models or noise reduction techniques are often used to improve recognition accuracy. In this paper we propose a method to improve accuracy of spoken dialog system from a language model point of view. In the proposed method the dialog system automatically changes its language model and dialog strategy according to the estimated recognition accuracy in a noisy environment in order to keep the performance of the system high. In a noise-free environment the system accepts any utterance from a user. On the other hand the system restricts its grammar and vocabulary in a noisy environment. To realize this strategy we investigated a method to avoid the user's out-of-grammar utterances through an instruction given by the system to a user. Furthermore we developed a method to estimate recognition accuracy from features extracted from noise signals. Finally we realized a proposed dialog system according to these investigations.;2008
Spoken dialogue systems must inevitably deal with out-of-grammar utterances. We address this problem in multi-domain spoken dialogue systems which deal with more tasks than a single-domain system. We defined a topic by augmenting a domain about which users want to find more information and we developed a method of recovering out-of-grammar utterances based on topic estimation i.e. by providing a help message in the estimated domain. Moreover domain extensibility that is the ability to add new domains to the system should be inherently retained in multi-domain systems. To estimate domains without sacrificing extensibility we collected documents from the Web as training data. Since the data contained a certain amount of noise we used latent semantic mapping (LSM) which enables robust topic estimation by removing the effects of noise from the data. Experimental results showed that our method improved topic estimation accuracy by 23.2 points for data including out-of-grammar utterances. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2008
Spoken language is one of the most intuitive forms of interaction between humans and agents. Unfortunately agents that interact with people using natural language often experience communication errors and do not correctly understand the user's intentions. Recent systems have successfully used probabilistic models of speech language and user behaviour to generate robust dialogue performance in the presence of noisy speech recognition and ambiguous language choices but decisions made using these probabilistic models are still prone to errors owing to the complexity of acquiring and maintaining a complete model of human language and behaviour. In this paper a decision-theoretic model for human-robot interaction using natural language is described. The algorithm is based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) which allows agents to choose actions that are robust not only to uncertainty from noisy or ambiguous speech recognition but also unknown user models. Like most dialogue systems a POMDP is defined by a large number of parameters that may be difficult to specify a priori from domain knowledge and learning these parameters from the user may require an unacceptably long training period. An extension to the POMDP model is described that allows the agent to acquire a linguistic model of the user online including new vocabulary and word choice preferences. The approach not only avoids a training period of constant questioning as the agent learns but also allows the agent actively to query for additional information when its uncertainty suggests a high risk of mistakes. The approach is demonstrated both in simulation and on a natural language interaction system for a robotic wheelchair application.;2008
Surgeons may be severely criticized from the perspective of evidence-based medicine because the majority of surgical publications appear not to be convincing. In the top nine surgical journals in 1996 half of the 175 publications refer to pilot studies lacking a control group 18% to animal experiments and only 5% to randomized controlled trials (RCT). There are five levels of clinical evidence: level 1 (randomized controlled trial) level 2 (prospective concurrent cohort study) level 3 (retrospective historical cohort study) level 4 (pre-post study) and level 5 (case report). Recently a Japanese evidence-based guideline for the surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was made by a committee (Chairman Professor Makuuchi and five members). We searched the literature using the Medline Dialog System with four keywords: HCC surgery English papers in the last 20 years. A total of 915 publications were identified systematically reviewed. At the first selection (in which surgery-dominant papers were selected) 478 papers survived. In the second selection (clearly concluded papers) 181 papers survived. In the final selection (clinically significant papers) 100 papers survived. The evidence level of the 100 surviving papers is shown here: level-1 papers (13%) level-2 papers (11%) level-3 papers (52%) and level-4 papers (24%) therefore there were 24% prospective papers and 76% retrospective papers. Here we present a part of the guideline on the five main surgical issues: indication to operation operative procedure peri-operative care prognostic factor and post-operative adjuvant therapy.

The advanced technology of computing system was followed by the rapid improvement of medical instrumentation and patient record management system. The typical examples are hospital information system (HIS) and picture archiving and communication system (PACS) which computerized the management procedure of medical records and images in hospital. Because these systems were built and used in hospitals doctors out of hospital have problems to access them immediately on emergent cases. To solve these problems this paper addressed the realization of system that could transmit the images acquired by medical imaging systems in hospital to the remote doctors' handheld PDA's using CDMA cellular phone network. The system consists of server and PDA. The server was developed to manage the accounts of doctors and patients and allocate the patient images to each doctor. The PDA was developed to display patient images through remote server connection. To authenticate the personal user remote data access (RDA) method was used in PDA accessing the server database and file transfer protocol (FTP) was used to download patient images from the remove server. In laboratory experiments it was calculated to take ninety seconds to transmit thirty images with 832x488 resolution and 24 bit depth and 0.37 Mb size. This result showed that the developed system has no problems for remote doctors to receive and review the patient images immediately on emergent cases.;2008
The aim of this paper is to present the concept for the development of an entirely speech-based user interface for a digital radio in combination with the possibility to specifically search for audio and data content. On the basis of a Digital Audio Broadcasting DAB device the embedded system utilizes a multichannel receiver with the possibility of simultaneously monitoring a variety of information sources with the purpose to generate spoken replies to verbal user requests. Furthermore the system embraces at audio repository storing speech-based content elements to diminish the volatile property of broadcast content and to enable a memory function.(1);2008
The author has previously reported on principles of diffusion of innovations the processes by which new technologies become popularly adopted specifically in relation to anatomy and education. In presentations on adopting handheld computers [personal digital assistants (PDAs)] and personal media players for health sciences education particular attention has been directed to the anticipated integration of PDA functions into popular cellular telephones. However limited distribution of early smartphones (e. g. Palm Treo and Blackberry) has provided few potential users for anatomical learning resources. In contrast iPod media players have been self-adopted by millions of students and podcasting has become a popular medium for distributing educational media content. The recently introduced Apple iPhone has combined smartphone and higher resolution media player capabilities. The author successfully tested the iPhone and the work alike iPod touch wireless media player with text-based flashcard resources existing PDF educational documents 3D clinical imaging data lecture podcasts and clinical procedure video. These touch-interfaced mobile computing devices represent just the first of a new generation providing practical scalable wireless Web access with enhanced multimedia capabilities. With widespread student self-adoption of such new personal technology educators can look forward to increasing portability of well-designed multiplatform learn anywhere resources.

The design construction and characterization of a portable opto-coupled potentiostat are presented. The potentiostat is battery-powered managed by a microcontroller which implements cyclic voltammetry (CV) using suitable sensor electrodes. Its opto-coupling permits a wide range of current measurements varying from mA to nA. Two software interfaces were developed to perform the CV measurement: a virtual instrument for a personal computer (PC) and a C-base interface for personal digital assistant (PDA). The potentiostat has been evaluated by detection of potassium ferrocyanide in KCl medium both with macro and microelectrodes. There was good agreement between the instrumental results and those from commercial equipment.;2008
The Direct Alcohol Fuel Cell ( DAFC) appears to be the most promising replacement for batteries in portable applications such as cellular phones personal Digital Assistants ( PDAs) digital cameras and laptop computers. The necessity along with related consumer demand has been an impetus to incorporate direct alcohol fuel cells ( DAFCs) to power these smart electronic devices. The present study deals with the investigation of various aliphatic alcohols such as ethanol 1-propanol 2-propanol and butanol with respect to methanol as fuels in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). 2-Propanol emerges the prospective fuel candidate as the study shows.;2008
The first generation of Location-based Services (LBSs) did not succeed on the market. In order to prepare LBSs of the next generation for the challenges of pervasive service execution in different situations (e.g. while walking on the street or while driving a car) the user interface must provide a second modality of interaction besides the visual interface. In this paper we describe the challenges and a possible solution for combining LBSs with a spoken-dialogue user interface.;2008
The importance of the user perspective to the wireless information access experience cannot be understated: simply put users will not indulge in devices that are perceived to be difficult to use and in technologies that do not offer quality infotainment - combined information and entertainment - content. In this paper we investigate the impact that mobile devices have on the user wireless infotainment access experience in practice. To this end we have undertaken an empirical study placed in a 'real-world' setting in which participants undertook typical infotainment access tasks oil three different wireless-enabled mobile devices: a laptop a personal digital assistant and a head mounted display device. Results show that with the exception of participants' level of self-consciousness when using such devices in public environments the user wireless information access experience is generally unaffected by device type. Location was shown though to be a significant factor when users engage in tasks such as listening to online music or navigation. Whilst the interaction between device and environment was found to influence entertainment-related tasks in our experiments the informational ones were not affected. However the interaction effects between device and user type was found to affect both types of tasks. Lastly a user's particular computing experience was shown to influence the perceived ease of wireless information access only in the case of online searching irrespective of whether this is done for primarily informational purposes or entertainment ones.

The main task of a service robot with a voice-enabled communication interface is to engage a user in dialogue providing an access to the services it is designed for. In managing such interaction inferring the user goal (intention) from the request for a service at each dialogue turn is the key issue. In service robot deployment conditions speech recognition limitations with noisy speech input and inexperienced users may jeopardize user goal identification. In this paper we introduce a grounding state-based model motivated by reducing the risk of communication failure due to incorrect user goal identification. The model exploits the multiple modalities available in the service robot system to provide evidence for reaching grounding states. In order to handle the speech input as sufficiently grounded (correctly understood) by the robot four proposed states have to be reached. Bayesian networks combining speech and non-speech modalities during user goal identification are used to estimate probability that each grounding state has been reached. These probabilities serve as a base for detecting whether the user is attending to the conversation as well as for deciding on an alternative input modality (e.g. buttons) when the speech modality is unreliable. The Bayesian networks used in the grounding model are specially designed for modularity and computationally efficient inference. The potential of the proposed model is demonstrated comparing a conversational system for the mobile service robot RoboX employing only speech recognition for user goal identification and a system equipped with multimodal grounding. The evaluation experiments use component and system level metrics for technical (objective) and user-based (subjective) evaluation with multimodal data collected during the conversations of the robot RoboX with users.;2008
The past two decades have presented significant technological developments of mobile information and communication technology (ICT) such as portable technologies (e.g. mobile phones notebook computers personal digital assistants) kind associated wireless infrastructures (e.g. wireless local area networks mobile telecommunications infrastructures bluetooth personal area networks). Mobile ICT offers a range of technical opportunities for organisations and their members to implement enterprise mobility. However the challenges of unlocking the opportunities of enterprise mobility are not well understood. One of the key issues is to establish systems and associated working practices that are deemed usable by both individuals and the Organisation. The aim of this paper is to show that the concept of organisational usability can enrich the understanding of mobile ICT in organisations. As kin addition to the traditional understanding of individual usability organisational usability emphasises the role of mobile ICT beyond individual support. A large-scale Study Of four different ways of organising foreign exchange trading in it Middle Eastern bank serves as the concrete foundation for the discussion. The empirical study showed how the final of the four attempts at establishing 24-h trading deployed mobile ICT to enable mobile trading and by providing a solution which was deemed usable for both the organisation kind the traders. The paper contributes to the understanding of how usability of mobile ICT critically depends oil Carefully balancing individual and organisational requirements. It also demonstrates the need for research in enterprise mobility to embrace both individual and organisational concerns in order to grasp the complexity of the phenomena. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The usage patterns of speech and visual input modes are investigated as a function of relative. input mode efficiency for both desktop and personal digital assistant (PDA) working environments. For this purpose the form-filling part of a multimodal dialogue system is implemented and evaluated three multimodal modes of interaction are implemented: Click-to-Talk Open-Mike and Modality-Selection. Modality-Selection implements an adaptive interface where the system selects the most efficient input mode at each turn. effectively. alternating between a Click-to-Talk and Open-Mike interaction style as proposed in Modality tracking in the multimodal Bell Labs Communicator in Proceedings of the Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop by A. Potamianos et al. 2003. The multimodal systems are evaluated and compared with the unimodal systems. Objective and subjective measures used include task completion task duration turn duration and overall user satisfaction. Turn duration is broken down into interaction time and inactivity time to better measure the efficiency of each input mode. Duration statistics and empirical probability density functions are computed as a function of interaction context and user. Results show that the multimodal systems outperform the unimodal systems in terms of objective and subjective criteria. Also users tend to use the most efficient input mode at each turn however biases towards the default input modality and a general bias towards the speech modality also exists. Results demonstrate that although users exploit some of the available synergies in multimodal dialogue interaction further efficiency gains can be achieved by designing adaptive interfaces that fully exploit these synergies.;2008
The utility of personal digital assistant resources in healthcare practice and education presents new challenges for faculty due to changing device capabilities and software availability. Although there is a plethora of personal digital assistant resources available for use by healthcare providers little is known about the effect on clinical reasoning in nursing students. The complexity of the healthcare arena precludes reliance on memory as a sole resource for problem solving because it can be unreliable. A personal digital assistant provides instant access to information on medical treatment. options so reliance on memory alone is avoided. The aims of this study are to assess clinical reasoning when personal digital assistants are used as an information resource for nursing students. These findings have implications for the future nursing work force including accurate differential diagnosis and diagnostic reasoning reduction of medication errors reduction of healthcare costs and development of effective treatment protocols.;2008
There has been increasing interest in informal learning in recent years alongside interest in how such learning can be supported by technology. However relatively little is known about the extent to which adults make use of their own mobile devices to support informal learning. In this study a survey was used to investigate whether and to what extent experienced users of mobile devices use their mobile devices to support intentional informal learning. If so do they make use of mobile device connectivity to support opportunistic informal learning and does such connectivity support or encourage collaborative informal learning? Experienced mobile device users were recruited from web forums and business and asked whether they used their devices to support informal learning. A pattern of learning uses emerged some of which deployed the mobile device capabilities relatively unchanged others triggered adaptations to typical learning activities to provide a better fit to the needs of the learner. These informal learning activities provided the basis for the design of a flexible mobile learning framework that can be extended to support developments in mobile technology and increasing use of Web 2.0 technologies by informal learners.;2008
This article describes an integrated system managed by an artificial agent (ChatBot) whose knowledge base has been realised in Artificial Intelligence Markup Languange (AIML). The system is able to constantly supervise the activities of the servers and at the same time realise backup distribution to safeguard the data in e-learning contexts. It also interacts with a Private Automatic Branch eXchange (PABX) for the management of the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone system. This system has been conceived as support for the management of web sections and in particular web-learning (w-learning) platforms. The purpose is to be able to watch the platform's activity all the time to immediately 'warn' when there are problems deriving from the platform contents and warn the technical area in case of failures in the server system that contains the w-learning platform. In addition the backup system guarantees having a frequently updated file of the data present on the various servers on which the e-learning platform leans so that safety can be guaranteed in case of the permanent loss of the data present on the servers.;2008
This article describes rates of missing item responses in personal digital assistant (PDA) assessments as compared to paper assessments. Data come from the evaluation of a classroom-based leisure life skills and sexuality education program delivered to high school students in Cape Town South Africa. Analyses show that the paper assessments had much higher rates of missingness than PDA assessments. This association is moderated by item order. Certain analyses also suggest that paper assessments have higher rates of missingness for items pertaining to participants' sexual behavior. Implications of these results for evaluation research will be discussed.;2008
This article focuses on issues relevant to human-computer interaction in the case of autism. We designed training software that target specific communicative disorders attributed to autism and defined an empirical protocol to test this software. The experimental software platform that we developed manages each game's interface modalities and logs users' actions for the purpose of exploring the impact of various human-computer interfaces which involve text speech and images. Ten adolescents diagnosed with autism used this software during 13 sessions at the rate of one session per week. The first and last sessions were dedicated for evaluating participants' skills. The experiment was also performed by a group of 10 typically developing children matched on developmental age and academic level. Results show that participants with autism had poorer performances on the richer multimedia interfaces. They seemed to lack the initiative of organizing the available multimodal sources of information. In this article we specifically discuss the impact of executive disorders on the use of multimodal interfaces with an emphasis on Animated Conversational Agents. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This article presents a bilingual ontology-based dialog system with multiple services. An ontology-alignment algorithm is proposed to integrate ontologies of different languages for cross-language applications. A domain-specific ontology is further extracted from the bilingual ontology using an island-driven algorithm and a domain corpus. This study extracts the semantic words/concepts using latent semantic analysis (LSA). Based on the extracted semantic words and the domain ontology a partial pattern tree is constructed to model the speech act of a spoken utterance. The partial pattern tree is used to deal with the ill-formed sentence problem in a spoken-dialog system. Concept expansion based on domain ontology is also adopted to improve system performance. For performance evaluation a medical dialog system with multiple services including registration information clinic information and FAQ information is implemented. Four performance measures were used separately for evaluation. The speech act identification rate was 86.2%. A task success rate of 77% was obtained. The contextual appropriateness of the system response was 78.5%. Finally the rate for correct FAQ retrieval was 82% an improvement of 15% over the keyword-based vector-space model. The results show the proposed ontology-based speech-act identification is effective for dialog management.;2008
This article provides an overview of the current state of the art for incorporating personal digital assistants (PDAs) into nursing education.

This article reviews recent advances in telemetrics a class of wireless information systems technology that can collect and transmit a wide variety of behavioral and environmental data remotely. Telemetrics include wearable computers that weave on-body sensors into articles of clothing ubiquitous computers that embed sensors and transmitters seamlessly into the environment and handheld devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants that can record cognitive and affective states. Examples of telemetric applications are provided to illustrate how this technology has been used in the behavioral sciences to unobtrusively and repeatedly gather physiological behavioral environmental cognitive and affective data in natural settings. Special issues relating to privacy and confidentiality practical considerations and statistical and measurement challenges when telemetrics are used are also discussed.;2008
This paper considers the results of an online questionnaire survey that collected user data on e-book collections held at Essex County Libraries over a two-year period between April 2004 and June 2006. The research was funded by the Laser Foundation 1 and specifically considered e-book collections held on Personal Digital Assistant ( PDA) devices as well as collections viewable on Personal Computers with Internet access. 2 Questionnaire responses from 58 individuals indicated clearly that marketing of e-book collections needs serious consideration that certain genres were popular with users ( notably Science Fiction) and that the largest number of respondents were aged between 21 and 30. As we discuss the findings of this questionnaire survey offer few insights into e-book usage that have not been reported in other research. However what the findings do illustrate clearly is that publicity afforded to e-book and other electronic collections remains crucial. From perusal of the data 47 of the 58 respondents found out about the e-book collections after browsing the website. Whilst this obviously indicates that the website is indeed useful the fact that only nine respondents investigated the collections having seen publicity material tells another story.;2008
This paper describes an innovative solution that allows a multimedia session to be distributed over multiple devices that are in close proximity to a user This would typically be useful when a user engaged in an audio/video conference enters a meeting room. Upon entering all media session components are transferred from the personal digital assistant (PDA) to the projector Hi-Fi set and webcam present in the meeting room. When the user leaves the room all media session components are transferred back to the PDA. Transferring parts of a multimedia session between different devices is defined as partial session mobility (PSM). Numerous methods exist for PSM. None of these methods is directly suitable for initiating PSM from a dedicated network node such as an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) application server but they do provide a starting point. Because of a number of advantages in the invite-based method this method is taken as a basis for network-initiated PSM. This paper compares the existing methods describes the proposed network-initiated method to support PSM and investigates how to combine it with terminal-initiated PSM. It also describes how PSM could be supported in IMS. (C) 2008 Alcatel-Lucent.;2008
This paper describes and proposes an autonomic computing system for PDAs or smart phone devices. The proposed system incorporates two major functions: self healing and self reconfiguration. The self healing enables system recovery when an error occurs during the operation of an application program or a middleware component whereas the self reconfiguration facilitates efficient management of system resources by autonomic management of system versions and dynamic reconfiguration of the middleware components'.;2008
This paper presents a descriptive lexical analysis of spontaneous conversations between users and the 2005 Loebner prize winning chatterbot Jabber-wacky. The study was motivated in part by the suspicion that evidence in support of the Media Equation especially in the field of conversational agents was supported by incomplete data too often omitted in its purview is the occurrence of unsavoury user responses. Our study shows that conversations with Jabberwacky often bring about the expression of negative verbal disinhibition. We discovered that 10% of the total stems in the corpus reflected abusive language and approximately 11% of the sample addressed hard-core sex. Users were often rude and violated the conversation maxims of manner quantity and relevance. Also particularly pronounced in the conversations was a persistent need of the user to define the speakers' identities (human vs. machine). Users were also curious to understand and test the cognitive capabilities of the chatterbot. Our analysis indicates that the Media Equation may need qualifying that users treat computers that talk less as they do people and more as they might treat something not quite an object yet not quite human.

This paper presents the Croatian context-dependent acoustic modelling used in speech recognition and in speech synthesis. The proposed acoustic model is based on context-dependent triphone hidden Markov models and Croatian phonetic rules. For speech recognition and speech synthesis system modelling and testing the Croatian speech corpus VEPRAD was used. The experiments have shown that Croatian speech corpus Croatian phonetic rules and hidden Markov models as the modelling formalism can be used to develop speech recognition and speech synthesis systems in parallel for a highly flective and free order language like Croatian. We propose an evaluation procedure for speech synthesis which combines an objective and a subjective evaluation approach and we present the achieved evaluation results. The proposed procedures for Croatian acoustic modelling were developed as parts of speech interfaces in a spoken dialog system for a limited weather forecast domain.;2008
This paper presents the integration of ubiquitous computing systems into classroom settings in order to provide basic support for classrooms and field activities. We have developed web application components using Java technology and configured a classroom with wireless network access and a web camera for our purposes. In this classroom the students interact among each other and with the professor through an Internet-enabled personal digital assistant (PDA) using the different modules described in this paper. We include our evaluations about the performance and usability of the system in a computer science related course of the University of Tokushima other practical uses including outdoor learning activities and future research and development work.;2008
This paper presents the NECA approach to the generation of dialogues between Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs). This approach consist of the automated construction of an abstract script for an entire dialogue (cast in terms of dialogue acts) which is incrementally enhanced by a series of modules and finally performed by means of text speech and body language by a cast of ECAs. The approach makes it possible to automatically produce a large variety of highly expressive dialogues some of whose essential properties are under the control of a user. The paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of NECA's approach to Fully Generated Scripted Dialogue (FGSD) and explains the main techniques used in the two demonstrators that were built. The paper can be read as a survey of issues and techniques in the construction of ECAs focusing on the generation of behaviour (i.e. focusing on information presentation) rather than on interpretation.

This study explored some quandaries concerning craving and mood as motivators to smoke. Craving and negative mood have long been associated with day-to-day smoking as two of the primary motivational forces behind the maintenance of the behavior as well as significant barriers in smokers' attempts to quit. Craving remains a clinically relevant phenomenon with most smokers describing craving as a troublesome problem when quitting. Smokers' self-reports of negative mood as an antecedent for smoking are so robustly reported that many models of nicotine dependence have incorporated a critical role for negative mood in maintaining smoking behavior. However several naturalistic studies that collected mood ratings with hand held computers from smokers in real time just before smoking a cigarette have provided scant evidence that negative mood plays a major role in motivation to smoke. No study to date has examined craving and mood data as a consequence of smoking that is collecting the same data immediately after smoking. This study used personal digital assistants (PDAs) to collect craving and mood data immediately before smoking immediately after smoking and at random times of day. Nontreatment seeking smokers (N=72) carried a PDA for an average of 10 days while they recorded their smoking behavior. Results showed that craving and negative mood ratings were lowest immediately after smoking compared with immediately before smoking and at random times of day. These findings suggest that smokers may be at least partially motivated to smoke to lower their craving and improve their mood states.;2008
This study tried to control and monitor computerized numerical controller (CNC) machines anywhere and anytime for machine (mobile) to machine (M2M) application in wired and wireless environment of upcoming ubiquitous manufacturing systems (u-Manufacturing). With a personal digital assistant (PDA) phone the machine status and machining data of CNC machines can be monitored in wired and wireless environments including the environments of IMT2000 and Wireless LAN. Moreover CNC machines can be controlled anywhere and anytime. The concept of the anywhere-anytime controlling and monitoring of a manufacturing system was implemented for u-Manufacturing in this study. In this concept the communication between the CNC controller and the PDA phone was successfully performed anywhere and anytime for the real-time monitoring and control of CNC machines. In addition the interface between the CNC controller and the developed application module was implemented by object linking and embedding for process control (OPC) and shared CNC memory. For communication the design of a server content module within the target CNC was based on a TCP/IP. Furthermore the client content module within the PDA phone was designed with the aid of embedded c++ programming for mobile communication. For the interface the monitoring data such as the machine status the machine running state the name of the numerical control (NC) program the alarm and the position of the stage axes were acquired in real time from real machines with the aid of the OPC method and by sharing the CNC memory. The control data such as the start hold emergency stop reserved start and reserved stop were also applied to the CNC domain of the real machine. CNC machines can therefore be controlled and monitored in real time anywhere and anytime. Moreover prompt notification from CNC machines to mobile phones including cellular phones and PDA phones can be automatically realized in emergencies.;2008
This work proposes a highly compact dual-band antenna design based on meander-line folded monopole for Universal Mobile Telecommunications-System-High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (UMTS-HSDPA)-based data card applications. This novel antenna is designed to cover UMTS frequency bands of I III and VIII under the physical size constraint of 30 x 5.1 x 4 mm Good agreement between the numerical results and measured data is observed. The excellent measured gain performance at far-field chamber validates this useful design approach.;2008
To date a number of methods exist for the capture of fingerprints from cadavers that can then be used in isolation as a primary method for the identification of the dead. We report the use of a handheld mobile wireless unit used in conjunction with a personal digital assistant (PDA) device for the capture of fingerprints from the dead. We also consider a handheld single-digit fingerprint scanner that utilises a USB laptop connection for the electronic capture of cadaveric fingerprints. Both are single-operator units that if ridge detail is preserved can collect a 10-set of finger pad prints in approximately 45 and 90 s respectively. We present our observations on the restrictions as to when such devices can be used with cadavers. We do however illustrate that the images are of sufficient quality to allow positive identification from finger pad prints of the dead. With the development of mobile handheld biometric PDA-based units for the police we hypothesize that under certain circumstances devices such as these could be used for the accelerated acquisition of fingerprint identification data with the potential for rapid near-patient identification in the future.;2008
To generate correct reactions a dialogue system should identify domain actions indicated by users' utterances because speaker intentions can be captured by the domain actions. In this paper we propose a domain action classification model to determine speech acts (general intentions) and concept sequences (semantic focuses) at the same time in a schedule management domain. To avoid biased learning problems the proposed model uses low-level linguistic features and filters out uninformative features using statistic. Then the proposed model determines domain actions using a maximum entropy model. In the experiment the proposed model showed better performances than previous works in speech act classification. In addition the proposed model showed high performances in concept sequence classification. Based on these experimental results we believe that the proposed model will be more helpful to a dialogue system than previous speech act classification models because it can return speech acts and concept sequences at the same time on the same framework.;2008
Two studies were conducted to identify individual characteristics that predict behavioral responses to violence prevention interventions. These studies used embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to create hypothetical social situations (called virtual vignettes) to assess interpersonal competency skills. One study was of male inner-city African-American adolescents and the second was of male prisoners in a state correctional system. In pre- and post-intervention sessions participants interacted with an ECA that tried to entice them into making risky decisions. The virtual vignette sessions tested participants' negotiation and conflict resolution skills. Results showed differing tendencies for participants to be engaged by the virtual vignettes. The vignettes were sufficiently realistic to elicit differences in behavior among the adolescents but generally not for the prisoners. Prior acceptance accessibility and usability data suggest that most users readily accept ECAs as valid conversational partners. The evidence presented here suggests that the technology - or the setting in which the technology is used is not by itself sufficient to actively engage users. The usefulness of virtual vignettes to adequately predict future behavior may be at least partially influenced by participant characteristics. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2008
Until recently personal digital assistants (PDAs) have been ignominiously characterized as a solution without a problem. To many they were glorified versions of calendars address books notepads and calculators that appeared only minimally more useful than their paper predecessors. Today's PDAs cater to a wider range of mobile computing needs especially in the veterinary field where they support mobile information-centric work. Despite the PDA's resurgent popularity hardware constraints limit its wide-scale integration. Most notably small screen sizes limit the PDA designers who compose texts videos and images for PDA delivery. This article addresses the problem of designing for small screens by re-characterizing the issue as an information design problem rather than a hardware problem. By analyzing how fourth-year students in a veterinary medicine program use their PDAs in their clinical education we offer suggestions for designing information to meet their needs.;2008
Use of information technology in diabetes management has been shown to improve self-care. We determined whether enhancing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) self-care with a personal digital assistant (PDA) by patients in the ambulatory setting would improve glycemic control. A pretest/ posttest intervention study was conducted in four family practice clinics in a large multispecialty group practice associated with an 186000-member Health Maintenance Organization. Adults with T2DM and last measured glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of >= 8.00% received one-on-one training on the use of a loaned PDA pre-installed with  Diabetes Pilot. Changes in HbA1c and other outcomes were assessed at 6 months from baseline for all participants and by participant-reported PDA use patterns dichotomized into high PDA users (>= 3 days in past 7) and low PDA users (< 3 days). Of 43 subjects enrolled 18 (41.90%) completed the 6-month intervention. Their mean HbA1c decreased 17.50% from 9.70% at baseline to 8.00% a significant mean HbA1c change of -1.7% (95% CI = -2.60 to -0.90). The mean HbA1c change was higher among reported high PDA users (n = 9 mean difference = -1.90 95% CI = -3.20 to -0.50) than among reported low PDA users (n = 9 mean difference = -1.50 95% CI = -2.80 to -0.30). Significant increases were reported for the foot care and general diet subscales of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities from 3 to 6 months. Enhancing T2DM self-care by adults with a PDA was associated with significant reductions in HbA1c the reductions were greater among reported high PDA users.;2008
User simulations are increasingly employed in the development and evaluation of spoken dialog systems. However there is no accepted method for evaluating user simulations which is problematic because the performance of new dialog management techniques is often evaluated on user simulations alone not on real people. In this paper we propose a novel method of evaluating user simulations. We view a user simulation as a predictor of the performance of a dialog system where per-dialog performance is measured with a domain-specific scoring function. The divergence between the distribution of dialog scores in the real and simulated corpora provides a measure of the quality of the user simulation and we argue that the Cramer-von Mises divergence is well-suited to this task. To demonstrate this technique we study a corpus of callers with real information needs and show that Cramer-von Mises divergence conforms to expectations. Finally we present simple tools which enable practitioners to interpret the statistical significance of comparisons between user simulations. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2008
We built an automated dialogue system whose style of interaction can be varied along the three dimensions of Humour Relationship Maintenance and Personality Matching. We then ran a longitudinal experiment which investigated manipulations of these three dimensions. We explored the interaction of these separate dimensions on user perception of the system using a controlled study design. We showed a strong positive effect for the use of Humour and Relationship Maintenance while the use of Personality Matching raised a number of questions which need further investigation.

We compute quality-adjusted price indexes for personal digital assistants (PDAs) for the period 1999 to 2004. Hedonic regressions indicate that prices are related to processor generation and clock speed memory capacity screen size and quality and the presence of a digital camera or wireless capability. A particularly salient feature of PDAs is portability where we find: (i) purchasers value the energy density of the battery technology (e.g. lithium ion) rather than the battery life in hours and (ii) the physical characteristics of the PDA (e.g. weight volume) are nonlinearly related to price suggesting that valuation of the physical form of PDAs does not bear a simple linear relationship to characteristics either in absolute terms ('smaller is better') or vs. an ergonomic 'sweet spot'. Rather portability characteristics are correlated with other desirable attributes making the relationship between price and portability difficult to disentangle. However hedonic price indexes are robust across different measures of the portability of PDAs. Hedonic indexes using the dummy variable characteristics prices and imputation approaches decline on average between 19 and 26% per year. A matched model price index computed from a subset of observations declines at 19% per year while a fixed-effects hedonic index declines at 14% per year.;2008
We conducted a pilot project to evaluate the potential of Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) technologies to improve the oral health of people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities chronic health problems and a long-standi history of poor oral health self-care. Oral health video and audio materials were prepared and transferred to PDAs. Patients were trained in the use of the PDAs at a regular dental appointment and the utilization of the PDA and any change in oral health status was tracked over the next six months. More than half of the 36 patients reported problems in keeping the PDAs functioning properly (mainly problems of keeping the batteries charged) for the duration of the project and 11 patients dropped out of the study. Ten of the remainder (40%) achieved improvement in at least three areas of oral health. The pilot project potentially brings a range of health promotion activities within the reach of people with limited health literacy which may produce better self-management of chronic health conditions.;2008
We consider here the design aspect of a real-time scheduler for a class of embedded systems. For this purpose we design a feedback controller for a reservation-based CPU scheduler for soft real-time systems. The execution time of soft real-time systems such as multimedia systems portable MP3 players personal digital assistants cellular phones and embedded web servers is highly variable. Hence it is crucial to assign an adequate amount of CPU resources for the running tasks to guarantee the quality of service. On the other hand it is also important not to allocate the large amount of resources to avoid waste. The purpose of this paper is to attain the aforementioned crucial objectives for a class of embedded systems under real-time computing constraints. Specifically we provide an analytical model for a real-time scheduler in terms of a switched system with time-varying uncertainty. Moreover by using Lyapunov stability in a linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) framework we design a state feedback controller that stabilizes the switched system. This in fact achieves the regulation of scheduling errors caused by time-varying uncertainty to a desired level. We extend an LMI-framework-based control scheme to a relatively new control application domain i.e. a soft real-time scheduling domain. We provide performance analysis under scheduler simulation environments and implement a feedback bandwidth server scheduler under a real-time kernel simulator. In the simulation studies the advantages of the controller design scheme are clearly highlighted in comparison with some conventional existing open-loop systems.;2008
We consider the problem of authentication of biometric identification documents via mobile devices such as mobile phones or personal digital assistants (PDAs). We assume that the biometric identification document holds biometric data (e.g. face or fingerprint) in the form of an image and personal data in the form of text both being printed directly onto the identification document. The proposed solution makes use of digital data hiding in order to cross-store the biometric data inside the personal data and vice versa. Moreover a theoretical framework is presented that should enable analysis and guide the design of future authentication systems based on this approach. In particular we advocate the separation approach which uses robust visual hashing techniques in order to match the information rates of biometric and personal data to the rates offered by current image and text data hiding technologies. We also describe practical schemes for robust visual hashing and digital data hiding that can be used as building blocks for the proposed authentication system. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed system constitutes a viable and practical solution. (C) 2008 SPIE and IS&T.;2008
We describe a two-layer architecture for supporting semantic interpretation and domain reasoning in dialogue systems. Building system that supports both semantic interpretation and domain reasoning in a transparent and well-integrated manner is an unresolved problem because of the diverging requirements of the semantic representations used in contextual interpretation versus the knowledge representations used in domain reasoning. We propose an architecture that provides both portability and efficiency in natural language interpretation by maintaining separate semantic and domain knowledge representations and integrating them via an ontology mapping procedure. The ontology mapping is used to obtain representations of utterances in a form most suitable for domain reasoners and to automatically specialize the lexicon. The use of a linguistically motivated parser for producing semantic representations for complex natural language sentences facilitates building portable semantic interpretation components as well as connections with domain reasoners. Two evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: we show that a small number of mapping rules are sufficient for customizing the generic semantic representation to a new domain and that our automatic lexicon specialization technique improves parser speed and accuracy.;2008
We hypothesize that student affect is a useful predictor of spoken dialogue system performance relative to other parameters. We test this hypothesis in the context of our spoken dialogue tutoring system where student learning is the primary performance metric. We first present our system and corpora which have been annotated with several student affective states student correctness and discourse structure. We then discuss unigram and bigram parameters derived from these annotations. The unigram parameters represent each annotation type individually as well as system-generic features. The bigram parameters represent annotation combinations including student state sequences and student states in the discourse structure context. We then use these parameters to build learning models. First we build simple models based on correlations between each of our parameters and learning. Our results suggest that our affect parameters are among our most useful predictors of learning particularly in specific discourse structure contexts. Next we use the PARADISE framework (multiple linear regression) to build complex learning models containing only the most useful subset of parameters. Our approach is a value-added one we perform a number of model-building experiments both with and without including our affect parameters and then compare the performance of the models on the training and the test sets. Our results show that when included as inputs our affect parameters are selected as predictors in most models and many of these models show high generalizability in testing. Our results also show that overall the affect-included models significantly outperform the affect-excluded models.;2008
We investigated the usability of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to improve research utilization and timely access to electronic practice information to assist in clinical decisions. Nurses used a decision support tool on a PDA to collect point-of-care outcomes data. Follow-up interviews documented usability. Nurses liked the portability and size of the PDA as well as ease of use of the PDA software. Electronic decision support tools at point of care have the potential to improve nurses' research utilization and quality of care.;2008
We present a new methodology of user simulation applied to the evaluation and refinement of stochastic dialog systems. Common weaknesses of these systems are the scarceness of the training corpus and the cost of an evaluation made by real users. We have considered the user simulation technique as an alternative way of testing and improving our dialog system. We have developed a new dialog manager that plays the role of the user. This user dialog manager incorporates several knowledge sources combining statistical and heuristic information in order to define its dialog strategy. Once the user simulator is integrated into the dialog system it is possible to enhance the dialog models by an automatic strategy learning. We have performed an extensive evaluation achieving a slight but clear improvement of the dialog system. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2008
We propose a method for learning dialogue management policies from a fixed data set. The method addresses the challenges posed by Information State Update (ISU)-based dialogue systems which represent the state of a dialogue as a large set of features resulting in a very large state space and a huge policy space. To address the problem that any fixed data set will only provide information about small portions of these state and policy spaces we propose a hybrid model that combines reinforcement learning with supervised learning. The reinforcement learning is used to optimize a measure of dialogue reward while the supervised learning is used to restrict the learned policy to the portions of these spaces for which we have data. We also use linear function approximation to address the need to generalize from a fixed amount of data to large state spaces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on this challenging task we trained this model on the COMMUNICATOR corpus to which we have added annotations for user actions and Information States. When tested with a user simulation trained on a different part of the same data set our hybrid model outperforms a pure supervised learning model and a pure reinforcement learning model. It also outperforms the hand-crafted systems on the COMMUNICATOR data according to automatic evaluation measures improving over the average COMMUNICATOR system policy by 10%. The proposed method will improve techniques for bootstrapping and automatic optimization of dialogue management policies from limited initial data sets.;2008
We provided a laboratory test program for the personal digital assistant (PDA) to a cohort of third-year medical students during their internal medicine clerkship. At the end of each rotation students were interviewed about their experience with the program and tracking information was downloaded from their PDAs. Students found the program helpful and easy to use accessed it more often during patient care activities than as a study aid and considered the program a better way to learn about laboratory tests than formal teaching sessions. The program was accessed an average of 4 or 5 times per week although individual use was highly variable. There was no relationship between end-of-clerkship examination scores and the number of tests that were accessed. The PDA program is an effective way to introduce laboratory facts and concepts into an internal medicine clerkship.;2008
Wireless technology is the networking backbone in homes and offices worldwide. This same technology now offers a maintenance solution for Surface Force Atlantic tank and void material condition assessments. Wireless technology puts the power of a desktop computer into the hands of tank and void assessors as they enter these cavernous shipboard compartments. With a few taps on a personal digital assistant (PDA) touch-screen assessors can record equipment configuration errors annotate any one of over 100 possible tank condition abnormalities or generate a repair work order with pre-written problem description and recommended solution statements. At the end of a typical workday these PDAs are wirelessly connected to a mid-Atlantic regional maintenance center (MARMC) commercial off the shelf (COTS) server where data export files are formatted for ship and shore 3M input. As Navy commands look to reduce operational and maintenance budgets this automated and wireless business solution offers a means of maintaining the original tank and void maintenance goal of inspecting and trending degradation at a fraction of the previous required time and effort. Additionally this process allows for the processing of assessment results to the SNAPSHOT database the master tank and void historical data repository. This automated process was successfully tested and implemented on 27 Norfolk-based ships in 2006. With significant cost and time savings realized the next logical step was to develop a distant support capability for remote locations. The goal here was to incorporate these same standards and processes into southeast regional maintenance center (SERMC) ships while maintaining the MARMC-located COTS server as the main hub for work scheduling and PDA loading. To accomplish these goals a process was developed using standard web technology for transferring PDA work assignment files (tanks and voids scheduled for assessment) from the main COTS server located at MARMC to the remote SERMC tank assessor equipped with a PDA. Once the assigned tank and void condition assessments are accomplished files are then returned to MARMC using the same web technology. MARMC handles these remote files the same way as they do local files for data export to ship and shore 3M systems. This distant support capability was successfully tested and implemented on three Mayport-based ships in December 2006. This paper will detail the significant steps taken to automate a maintenance process that used a hand-scribed paper process and standard US Navy maintenance reporting infrastructures. The lessons learned during the upgrade process maintenance advantages that maximize efficiency cost effectiveness and surface force ship reliability will be also be discussed.;2008
Wireless telephones and personal digital assistants are emerging as the information hubs connect their human users with assorted electronic devices and the World Wide Web. As such they quickly become the de facto basis for personalized information services. The Kannon project team at the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Taiwan is developing a ubiquitous service infrastructure for elders' healthcare support. Among their deliverables there is a PDA Phone christened Health Pal which can communicate with Bluetooth/ZigBee devices universal plug-and-play (UPnP) e-home service platforms and online healthcare providers to offer 24/7 healthcare services to elderly people. This paper presents the early results of this effort including the functional and operational concepts of Health Pal as well as the activity-oriented approach of its design. Preliminary results of its usefulness and usability evaluations are reported. A comparison of this platform against several similar prototypes was also included to illustrate the advantage of applying activity-oriented design approach to human-computer interactions.

With over 50% of the US population living in coastal counties the ocean and coastal environments have substantial impacts on coastal communities. While many of the impacts are positive such as tourism and recreation opportunities there are also negative impacts such as exposure to harmful algal blooms (HABs) and water borne pathogens. Recent advances in environmental monitoring and weather prediction may allow us to forecast these potential adverse effects and thus mitigate the negative impact from coastal environmental threats. One example of the need to mitigate adverse environmental impacts occurs on Florida's west coast which experiences annual blooms or periods of exuberant growth of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. K. brevis produces a suite of potent neurotoxins called brevetoxins. Wind and wave action can break up the cells releasing toxin that can then become part of the marine aerosol or sea spray. Brevetoxins in the aerosol cause respiratory irritation in people who inhale it. In addition asthmatics who inhale the toxins report increase upper and lower airway symptoms and experience measurable changes in pulmonary function. Real-time reporting of the presence or absence of these toxic aerosols will allow asthmatics and local coastal residents to make informed decisions about their personal exposures thus adding to their quality of life. A system to protect public health that combines information collected by an Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) has been designed and implemented in Sarasota and Manatee Counties Florida. This system is based on real-time reports from lifeguards at the eight public beaches. The lifeguards provide periodic subjective reports of the amount of dead fish on the beach apparent level of respiratory irritation among beach-goers water color wind direction surf condition and the beach warning flag they are flying. A key component in the design of the observing system was an easy reporting pathway for the lifeguards to minimize the amount of time away from their primary duties. Specifically we provided a Personal Digital Assistant for each of the eight beaches. The portable unit allows the lifeguards to report from their guard tower. The data are transferred via wireless Internet to a website hosted on the Mote Marine Laboratory Sarasota Operations of the Coastal Ocean Observation Laboratories (SO COOL) server. The system has proven to be robust and well received by the public. The system has reported variability from beach to beach and has provided vital information to users to minimize their exposure to toxic marine aerosols. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

With the availability of large corpora of spoken dialog it is now possible to use data-driven techniques to build and use models of task-oriented dialogs. In this paper we use data-driven techniques to build task structures for individual dialogs and use the dialog task structures for: dialog act classification task/subtask classification task/subtask prediction and dialog act prediction. We evaluate our approach using a corpus of customer/agent dialogs from a catalog service domain. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using corpora of human-human conversation to learn dialog models suitable for human-computer dialog applications.;2008
With the rapid introduction of technology in nursing education information regarding its implementation in undergraduate curricula is emerging.

Wound measurement is essential in assessing the progress of wound healing. The most commonly used tools include wound tracings width and length measurements and digital photography. These methods have been useful in clinical practice but have some limitations such as lack of accuracy difficulty of use and often entail wound contact. More advanced equipment tends to be bulky heavy and expensive. The following reviews the authors' experience with a new wound measurement and documentation system the ARANZ Medical Silhouette Mobile (TM) (ARANZ Medical Christchurch New Zealand). This innovative device combines a digital camera and structured lighting in the form of 2 laser beams to automatically correct for image scale and skin curvature allowing rapid and accurate measurements of the wound surface area and depth. The scanner unit plugs into a standard personal digital assistant to form a portable device that can be easily held and operated using I hand. The scanner has been used in clinical practice trials in patients with venous leg ulcers diabetic foot ulcers and in the community setting. The scanner was found to be accurate and reliable easy to learn and use portable and compact. The results presented suggest that this device may be a viable choice in the management of different types of chronic wounds.;2008
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a nondestructive multielemental fast and cost-effective analysis technique. It can be applied in a nonvacuum environment directly on the samples without any preparation. As archaeological and historical objects are often unique and may not be easily movable a mobile XRF detector system allowing in situ analysis is ideally suited for archaeometric applications. A mobile system was designed and built at the IPNAS laboratory to provide such analyses. The system includes an industrial grade x-ray generator which supplies the primary x-ray beam an air-cooled silicon rift Detector detector (SDD) with a 5-mm(2) active area. The data acquisition system measures the energy and the intensity of the secondary fluorescence x-rays. The detector signal is amplified and analyzed by a multichannel recorder coupled to a microcomputer running JavaSpectre which visualizes and analyzes spectra obtained from the detector. The detection head containing the detector the x-ray tube and its power supply are fixed on a movable platform allowing independent vertical and horizontal movement. All displacements are controlled by a hand-held personal digital assistant (PDA) (Palm) which exchanges data with microcontrollers embedded in the system providing a very precise positioning of the detector over a surface of many square meters. This system control as well as a typical application of this XRF spectrometer for analyzing pigment composition of a wall painting will be described. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;2008
3D graphic rendering in mobile application programs is becoming increasingly popular with rapid advances in mobile device technology. Current 3D graphic rendering engines for mobile devices do not provide triangulation capabilities for surfaces therefore mobile 3D graphic applications have been dealing only with pre-tessellated geometric data. Since triangulation is comparatively expensive in terms of computation real-time tessellation cannot be easily implemented on mobile devices with limited resources. No research has yet been reported on real-time triangulation on mobile devices. In this paper we propose a real-time triangulation algorithm for visualization on mobile devices based on sequential constrained Delaunay triangulation. We apply a compact data structure and a sequential triangulation process for visualization of CAD data on mobile devices. In order to achieve a high performance and compact implementation of the triangulation the nature of the CAD data is fully considered in the Computational process. This paper also presents a prototype implementation for a mobile 3D CAD viewer running on a handheld Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009
802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) technology is now common in power sensitive devices like smart phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). However the energy efficiency of such devices will be very low especially for next generation WLAN technology. The reasons for this include the existence of a large number of active stations short data time and ultra high Physical Layer (PHY) data rate which are the characteristics of next generation WLAN technology. This poor energy efficiency will be due to the fact that the device will consume a lot of idle-listening energy during the Distributed InterFrame Space (DIFS) and back-off time and that the energy consumed for idle listening is similar to the energy consumed while receiving data [9]. In this article we propose an intelligent scheme for reducing the energy consumed in idle listening. Our analysis and simulation programs show that our scheme can lengthen the battery endurance due to the shortening in idle-listening time effectively especially when the number of active stations is large. An important characteristic of our scheme is that it is fully compatible with legacy Distributed Coordinated Function (DCF) and there will be no throughput reduction if this power saving scheme is applied to the DCF of 802.11. We also propose an accurate power consumption model in the MAC layer which to the best of our knowledge has not been presented in any earlier research.(1);2009
A fully implantable wireless pressure sensor system was developed to monitor bladder pressures in vivo. The system comprises a small commercial pressure die connected via catheter to amplifying electronics a microcontroller wireless transmitter battery and a personal digital assistant (PDA) or computer to receive the wireless data. The sensor is fully implantable and transmits pressure data once every second with a pressure detection range of 1.5 psi gauge and a resolution of 0.02 psi. In vitro calibration measurements of the device showed a high degree of linearity and excellent temporal response. The implanted device performed continuously in vivo in several porcine studies lasting over 3 days. This system can be adapted for other pressure readings as well as other vital sign measurements it represents the first step in developing a ubiquitous sensing platform for telemedicine and remote patient monitoring.;2009
A key advantage of taking a statistical approach to spoken dialogue systems is the ability to formalise dialogue policy design as a stochastic optimization problem. However since dialogue policies are learnt by interactively exploring alternative dialogue paths conventional static dialogue corpora cannot be used directly for training and instead a user simulator is commonly used. This paper describes a novel statistical user model based on a compact stack-like state representation called a user agenda which allows state transitions to be modeled as sequences of push- and pop-operations and elegantly encodes the dialogue history from a user's point of view. An expectation-maximisation based algorithm is presented which models the observable user output in terms of a sequence of hidden states and thereby allows the model to be trained on a corpus of minimally annotated data. Experimental results with a real-world dialogue system demonstrate that the trained user model can be successfully used to optimise a dialogue policy which outperforms a hand-crafted baseline in terms of task completion rates and user satisfaction scores.;2009
A mobile telemedicine system capable of transmitting video and audio simultaneously was designed for consulting acute stroke patients remotely. It could use a wireless local area network (e.g. inside the hospital) or a mobile phone network (e.g. outside the hospital). When initiating a call the sending unit chose a suitable encoding profile based on the measured data throughput in order to allocate appropriate bit rates for video and audio transmission. The system was tested using a portable digital assistant (PDA) type phone and smart phone as receiving units. Video and audio recordings were made from five patients (two normal and three stroke patients) and then transmitted at different rates. Subjectively both video and audio qualities improved as the data throughput increased. The physical findings including facial droop arm drift and abnormal speech were observed remotely by four specialists according to the Cincinnati Pre-hospital Stroke Scale guideline. A comparison between the face-to-face method and the mobile telemedicine method showed that there were no discrepancies at bit rates of more than 400 kbit/s. We conclude that specialists could generally conduct remote consultations for stroke patients either using a public mobile network or a wireless LAN.;2009
A new monitoring tool called FFI (FEAT/FIREMON Integrated) has been developed to assist managers with collection storage and analysis of ecological information. The tool was developed through the complementary integration of two fire effects monitoring systems commonly used in the United States: FIREMON and the Fire Ecology Assessment Tool. FFI provides software components for: data entry data storage Geographic Information System summary reports analysis tools and Personal Digital Assistant use. In addition to a large set of standard FFI protocols the Protocol Manager lets users define their own sampling protocol when custom data entry forms are needed. The standard FFI protocols and Protocol Manager allow FFI to be used for monitoring in a broad range of ecosystems. FFI is designed to help managers fulfil monitoring mandates set forth in land management policy. It supports scalable (project- to landscape-scale) monitoring at the field and research level and encourages cooperative interagency data management and information sharing. Though developed for application in the USA FFI can potentially be used to meet monitoring needs internationally.;2009
Aim: To adapt the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ(S)) the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ(S)) for a personal. digital assistant (Paim TX) and to examine the validity of the electronic versions by comparing them with the original paper versions. Methods: 84 adults with asthma and 32 with rhinitis were randomised to complete either the paper or the electronic version first. After 2 h they completed the other version. Results: 68 asthma and 27 rhinitis patients provided analysable data. For the AQLQ(S) and RQLQ(S) differences between paper and electronic were significant. Concordance between paper and electronic evaluated using an intraclass correlation coefficient were: AQLQ = 0.92 ACQ = 0.90 and RQLQ = 0.85. Concordance for the individual. domains of the AQLQ and RQLQ ranged from 0.52 to 0.94. These levels of concordance did not reach the a priori defined requirement for validity. Conclusions: The significant bias between paper and electronic versions and only modest concordance provides evidence that patients may respond differently to questionnaires in different formats and show that different formats must not be used interchangeably.

Aims. - Flexible intensive insulin therapy (FIT) has become the reference standard in type I diabetes. Besides carbohydrate Counting (CHO) it requires the use of algorithms to adjust prandial insulin doses to the number of CHO portions. As recourse to standard algorithms is usual when initiating FIT the use of personalized algorithms would also allow more precise adjustments to be made The aim of the present Study was to validate personalized prandial algorithms for FIT as proposed by Howorka et al. in 1990. Methods. - We conducted a 4-month observational Study of 35 patients with type I diabetes treated with FIT for at least 6 months who were already using Howorka's prandial algorithms (meal-related and correctional insulin doses for blood glucose increases induced by CHO). These patients were asked to use a personal digital assistant (PDA) phone with an electronic diary (instead of a paper one) to take advantage of the computerized data-collection system to assess the quality of postprandial metabolic control. Results. - Whatever the number of CHO portions mean postprandial blood glucose Values remained close to the target of 7.8 mmol/L and the compensatory algorithm allowed precise correction of preprandial hyperglycaemia. In fact the algorithms for meal-related and correctional insulin doses at the end of the study did not differ significantly from those initially calculated but they generally differed from one patient to another. Conclusion. - In type I diabetic patients treated with FIT the use of individualized parameters permits fast and accurate adjustment of mealtime insulin doses leading to good control of the postprandial state.

All kinds of information technologies have been converging rapidly in recent few years from simple traditional computers to diversified multimedia information appliances creating unprecedented technologies and devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) smart cell phones portable media players (PMPs) online console games and set top boxes among others. These electronic functionalities converged devices with powerful contents and functions such as the World Wide Web videoconferencing e-mail internet telephony online gaming digital television and net banking are easier to use than traditional computers but not less capable of performing daily tasks. These information technology revolutions along with rapid growing of network technology not only increased the amount of internet applications and digital contents but also led to diversified consumer behaviors increased competition and opportunities. On the other hand one-to-one marketing is different from traditional marketing methods because it focuses on customer satisfaction and is customer-oriented rather than focusing on marketing mass consumers thus a one-to-one marketer tries to find more different products and services for the same customer. Therefore how to establish potential cross-selling and one-to-one offers through product mix analysis enhance relationship with customers by means of personalized offers through product knowledge and understand users' needs and making useful suggestions for new product developments and one-to-one marketing become critical issues to information appliance firms. This paper proposes association rules clustering analysis and CART as methodologies of data-mining which is implemented for mining product and marketing knowledge from information users. Knowledge extraction from information users is illustrated as knowledge patterns rules clusters and trees in order to propose suggestions on one-to-one marketing for information appliance firms.

All-in-one devices with mobile phone web browser and organizer are now owned by over 6 million people and their Popularity is increasing. These devices are often called personal digital assistants (PDAS) or 'BlackBerry (R)' devices after a Popular brand name of these appliances. The use of PDAs is associated with exposure of distal thumbs and nails to repeated pressure with a frequency of up to a few thousand times per hour and several tens of thousands of times per day. We describe two cases or traumatic thumb nail dystrophy associated with using a PDA keyboard for several hours per day. Both patients developed median nail plate dystrophy after 4-8 months of habitual PDA use. One patient also developed thumb nail psoriasis and paronychia. All symptoms resolved I few months after discontinuing PDA use. Analysis of nail biomechanics performed by using a finite element fingertip model showed that maximal stress reaches approximately 3 MPa and appears near the root on the internal surface of the nail while it reaches approximately 2 MPa and appears around one-third from the root on the outside surface. In conclusion biomechanical stress resulting from overuse of PDAs may result in various types of nail dystrophy. We Suggest the general term 'PDA nails' for these nail abnormalities.;2009
Although there is a large literature examining head trauma in general several areas remain understudied. Notably little is known about symptom expression over the course of a day for adolescents recovering from concussion. Furthermore intra-individual symptom variability has not been well characterized. This pilot study examined the feasibility of a momentary data-gathering method as well as the sensitivity of the assessment to the subtle and dynamic changes in symptoms of concussion. Six adolescents three of whom suffered a concussion and three non-injured controls provided symptom ratings five times per day for 5 days. This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) was conducted on a personal digital assistant to capture variability in symptom reports while in the natural environment. Preliminary results indicated that the EMA method showed great promise as a research tool in natural settings (e. g. school and home). Adolescents were able to comply with all tasks with little interference in their daily activities. Students with concussion showed generally higher symptom ratings across physical cognitive and affective domains and temporal and diurnal patterns for symptoms emerged. Implications for future research and patient care are discussed.;2009
An Intelligent Environment is a physical space that becomes augmented with computation communication and digital content thus transcending the limits of direct human perception.

As an alternative to dominant cognitive-constructivist approaches to educational technology this article makes the case for what has been termed a discursive or postcognitive psychological research paradigm. It does so by adapting discursive psychological analyses of conversational activity to the study of educational technology use. It applies these modified techniques specifically to discursive interactions with chatbots or intelligent agents and to the theories commonly associated with them. In doing so it presents a critique of notions of human-computer indistinguishability or equality as they have been articulated from Alan Turing to Reeves and Nass and it sketches an alternative account of the potential and limitations of this technology. In divergence from Turing and Reeves and Nass human discourse generated through encounters with natural language interfaces is seen as emphasizing the issue of conversation itself foregrounding the achievement of common discursive aims and projects rather than illuminating the internal states of either interlocutor. Mind and cognition correspondingly are revealed as phenomena accomplished through contingent social activity rather than as computational processes concealed within or distributed between mind and machine.;2009
Background and purpose: EpiData and Epi Info are often used together by public health agencies around the world particularly in developing countries to meet their needs of low-cost public health data management however the current open source data management technology lacks a mobile component to meet the needs of mobile public health data collectors. The goal of this project is to explore the opportunity of filling this gap through developing and trial of a personal digital assistant (PDA) based data collection/entry system. It evaluated whether such a system could increase efficiency and reduce data transcription errors for public surveillance data collection in developing countries represented by Fiji. Methods: A generic PDA-based data collection software eSTEPS was developed. The software and the data collected using it directly interfaces with EpiData. A field trial was conducted to test the viability of public health surveillance data collection using eSTEPS. The design was a randomised controlled trial with cross-over design. 120 participants recruited from the Fiji School of Medicine were randomly assigned to be interviewed by one of six interviewers in one of the two ways: (1) paper-based survey followed by PDA survey and (2) PDA survey followed by paper-based survey. Data quality was measured by error rates (logical range errors/inconsistencies skip errors missing values date or time field errors and incorrect data type). Work flow and cost were evaluated in three stages of the survey process: (1) preparation of data collection instrument (2) data collection and (3) data entry validation and cleaning. User acceptance was also evaluated in the two groups of participants: (1) data collectors and (2) survey participants. Results: None of the errors presented in 20.8% of the paper questionnaires was found in the data set collected using PDA. Sixty-two percent of the participants perceived that the PDA-based questionnaire took less time to complete. Data entry validation and cleaning for the PDA-based data collection from 120 participants took a total of 1.5 h a 93.26% reduction of time from 20.5 h required using paper and pen. The cost is also significantly reduced with PDA-based protocol. Both data collectors and participants prefer to use PDA instead of paper for data collection. The trial results prove that eSTEPS is a feasible solution for public health surveillance data collection in the field. Several deficiencies of the software were also identified and would be addressed in the next version. Conclusion: eSTEPS offers the potential to meet the need for an effective mobile public health data collection tool for use in the field. The eSTEPS field trial proves that PDA was more efficient than paper for public health survey data collection. it also significantly reduced errors in data entry. The later benefit was derived from the software providing its users with the flexibility of building their own constraints to control the data type range and logic of data entry.

Background Endotracheal tube cuff pressure must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range to prevent complications. Cuff pressure is measured and adjusted intermittently. Objectives To assess the accuracy and feasibility of continuous monitoring of cuff pressure describe changes in cuff pressure over time and identify clinical factors that influence cuff pressure. Methods In a pilot study data were collected for a mean of 9.3 hours on 10 patients who were orally intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Sixty percent of the patients were white mean age was 55 years and mean intubation time was 2.8 days. The initial cuff pressure was adjusted to a minimum of 20 cm H2O. The pilot balloon of the endotracheal tube was connected to a transducer and a pressure monitor. Cuff pressure was recorded every 0.008 seconds during a typical 12-hour shift and was reduced to 1-minute means. Patient care activities and interventions were recorded on a personal digital assistant. Results Values obtained with the cufflator-manometer and the transducer were congruent. Only 54% of cuff pressure measurements were within the recommended range of 20 to 30 cm H2O. The cuff pressure was high in 16% of measurements and low in 30%. No statistically significant changes over time were noted. Endotracheal suctioning coughing and positioning affected cuff pressure. Conclusions Continuous monitoring of cuff pressure is feasible accurate and safe. Cuff pressures vary widely among patients. (American Journal of Critical Care. 2009 18:133-143);2009
Background/Objective: Applying practice-based evidence research methodology to spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation requires taxonomy (typology or classification) of rehabilitation interventions provided by every discipline contributing to SCI rehabilitation. The rehabilitation field currently lacks such taxonomy. Methods: SCIRehab project researchers and clinicians representing 7 rehabilitation disciplines from 6 US inpatient SCI rehabilitation facilities worked in discipline groups during 2 face-to-face meetings and weekly discipline-specific teleconferences for 9 months to identify key contributions of each discipline to SCI rehabilitation and to develop a classification of treatment interventions used by each discipline. These clinician groups were charged with designing documentation systems that collected enough details to describe treatment adequately while not imposing an unrealistic data collection burden on clinicians. Completed documentation systems were programmed onto handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs) to facilitate data entry by clinicians at the point of care. Results: Seven discipline-specific SCI rehabilitation taxonomies were developed that describe and quantify intervention activities (major categories of treatment offered by the discipline) and the activity-specific details (variables deemed important to fully describe the interventional process). Much treatment information is unique to each discipline some is common across disciplines. Conclusions: The taxonomies provide a format with which clinicians document actual interventions performed with or for patients. The SCIRehab project has developed the first comprehensive multidisciplinary taxonomy for describing the details of the SCI rehabilitation process and designed a PDA-based documentation system based on that taxonomy that allows clinicians to describe the specifics of their interactions with their patients.;2009
Background/Objective: Limited research evidence is available to show the effectiveness of the many specific interventions provided in spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation what is available typically focuses on effects of the full rehabilitation package but not specific therapy interventions medical procedures patient education or counseling. Given the problems of conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in rehabilitation practice-based evidence (PBE) research has been suggested as an alternative methodology for identifying which rehabilitation interventions are associated most strongly with positive outcomes after controlling for patient differences. Using the PBE research methodology the SCIRehab project attempts to open the black box of acute SCI rehabilitation provide detailed information on treatments delivered by all rehabilitation disciplines and contribute to outcomes-based guidelines for clinical decision-making. Methods: The SCIRehab project includes 1500 patients with acute SCI consecutively admitted to 1 of 6 US inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Details of the rehabilitation process are captured by clinicians from multiple disciplines documenting their interventions in handheld personal digital assistants after sessions with their patients. Outcome data are abstracted from medical records (clinical outcomes data) and obtained from patient interviews at 6 and 12 months after injury. Extensive patient injury and other treatment characteristics are abstracted from medical records. SCIRehab is the first research project to collect detailed information on individual interventions offered by the full rehabilitation team. Results: SCIRehab is the first research project to collect detailed information on individual interventions offered by the full rehabilitation team. These findings are presented in a series of 9 articles. Conclusions: To date SCIRehab's major contribution is a system for categorizing specific contributions of each discipline and a technology for documenting that detail. After data collection is complete future manuscripts will relate those process elements to outcomes. The SCIRehab Project is an important step toward establishing outcomes-based guidelines for SCI rehabilitation.;2009
Background: A major obstacle facing many lower-income countries in establishing and maintaining HIV treatment programmes is the scarcity of trained health care providers. To address this shortage the World Health Organization has recommend task shifting to HIV-infected peers. Methods: We designed a model of HIV care that utilizes HIV-infected patients community care coordinators (CCCs) to care for their clinically stable peers with the assistance of preprogrammed personal digital assistants (PDAs). Rather than presenting for the standard of care monthly clinic visits in this model patients were seen every three months in clinics and monthly by their CCCs in the community during the interim two months. This study was conducted in Kosirai Division western Kenya where eight of the 24 sub-locations (defined geographic areas) within the division were randomly assigned to the intervention with the remainder used as controls. Prior to entering the field CCCs underwent intensive didactic training and mentoring related to the assessment and support of HIV patients as well as the use of PDAs. PDAs were programmed with specific questions and to issue alerts if responses fell outside of pre-established parameters. CCCs were regularly evaluated in six performance areas. An impressionistic analysis on the transcripts from the monthly group meetings that formed the basis of the continuous feedback and quality improvement programme was used to assess this model. Results: All eight of the assigned CCCs successfully passed their training and mentoring entered the field and remained active for the two years of the study. On evaluation of the CCCs 89% of their summary scores were documented as superior during Year 1 and 94% as superior during Year 2. Six themes emerged from the impressionistic analysis in Year 1: confidentiality and community disclosure roles and responsibilities logistics clinical care partnership antiretroviral adherence and PDA issues. At the end of the trial of those patients not lost to follow up 64% (56 of 87) in the intervention and 52% (58 of 103) in the control group were willing to continue in the programme (p = 0.26). Conclusion: We found that an antiretroviral treatment delivery model that shifted patient monitoring and antiretroviral dispensing tasks into the community by HIV-infected patients was both acceptable and feasible.;2009
Background: Although personal digital assistant use among residents is common few outcomes-based studies have examined the impact of this technology on medical education. Aim: We evaluated the educational effectiveness of a personal digital assistant-based geriatric assessment tool. Methods: Internal medicine residents were enrolled as subjects. Personal digital assistant users were randomly assigned to receive or not receive a geriatric assessment tool for use on their device. Outcome measures included pretest/posttest performance and tabulation of geriatric assessment tool for use on their device. Outcome measures included pretest/posttest performence and tabulation of geriatric functional issues on hospital dismissal summaries. Results: Seventy-two residents patticipated. Of these 38 (53%) reported personal digital assistant use. Twenty were assigned to receive the geriatric assessment tool. Average change between pro: test and posttest scores was highest for the group using the geriatric assessment tool on a personal digital assistant (2.8 P= 0.01). This group also had the highest average posttest score and the highest average number of geriatric functional issues identified on dismissal summaris but neither value was significantly different from respective averages for the other study groups. Conclusions: Residents who used a personal digital assistant-based geriatric assessment tool demonstrated improvement in geriatric knowledge than peers who did not use this resource. Curricula adapted to this technology may prove useful in medical education.;2009
Background: Computerized ambulatory monitoring provides real-time assessments of clinical outcomes in natural contexts and it has been increasingly applied in recent years to investigate symptom expression in a wide range of disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and validity of this data collection strategy with adult stroke patients. Methods: Forty-eight individuals (75% of the contacted sample) agreed to participate in the current study and were instructed to complete electronic interviews using a personal digital assistant 5 times per day over a 1-week period. Results: More than 80% of programmed assessments were completed by the sample and no evidence was found for fatigue effects. Expected patterns of associations were observed among daily life variables and data collected through ambulatory monitoring were significantly correlated with standard clinic-based measures of similar constructs. Conclusion: Support was found for the feasibility and validity of computerized ambulatory monitoring with stroke patients. The application of these novel methods with stroke patients should provide complementary information that is inaccessible to standard hospital-based assessments and permit increased understanding of the significance of clinical results and test scores for daily life experience.

Background: In 2006 a digitalised clinical portfolio was introduced into an undergraduate nursing program. The use of a tablet personal computer (PC) with wireless broadband access could overcome issues around computer access in the clinical setting enhancing authenticity and timeliness of assessment. Methods: In July 2007 a Hewlett-Packard TC 4400 tablet PC was issued to three participating students. A focus group utilising a semi-structured interview and a survey collected data from the students at the end of the trial to determine the effectiveness of the strategy. Results: Participants used tablet PCs to access their portfolios. However tack of space busy wards and concerns about the security of the PCs limited their use in the clinical setting. The majority of their journal entries were made at home and within similar time frames to those prior to access to tablet PCs. Participants also used the PCs to provide education to other students and staff but were reluctant to use them in front of patients. Conclusion: Barriers limiting the use of tablet PCs in the clinical setting may be overcome with greater proficiency in their utility and increased portability of the technology. Tablet PCs offer advantages related to and beyond portfolio use in the clinical setting. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009
Background: Information on dietary intake provides some of the most valuable insights for mounting intervention programmes for the prevention of chronic diseases. With the growing concern about adolescent overweight the need to accurately measure diet becomes imperative. Assessment among adolescents is problematic as this group has irregular eating patterns and they have less enthusiasm for recording food intake. Subjects/Methods: We used qualitative and quantitative techniques among adolescents to assess their preferences for dietary assessment methods. Results: Dietary assessment methods using technology for example a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a disposable camera were preferred over the pen and paper food record. Conclusions: There was a strong preference for using methods that incorporate technology such as capturing images of food. This suggests that for adolescents dietary methods that incorporate technology may improve cooperation and accuracy. Current computing technology includes higher resolution images improved memory capacity and faster processors that allow small mobile devices to process information not previously possible. Our goal is to develop implement and evaluate a mobile device (for example PDA mobile phone) food record that will translate to an accurate account of daily food and nutrient intake among adolescents. This mobile computing device will include digital images a nutrient database and image analysis for identification and quantification of food consumption. Mobile computing devices provide a unique vehicle for collecting dietary information that reduces the burden on record keepers. Images of food can be marked with a variety of input methods that link the item for image processing and analysis to estimate the amount of food. Images before and after the foods are eaten can estimate the amount of food consumed. The initial stages and potential of this project will be described.;2009
Background: Little is known about Australian Nurse Practitioners (NPs) perceptions of the importance of continuing education (CE) their preferred methods to undertake CE in relation to prescribing practices or their access to electronic resources at work. Nurse Practitioner access to computerised technology may increase their provision of resources provide point of care technology and increase opportunities to participate in CE. Purpose: This paper aims to explore Australian NP preferences for continuing education and NP access to electronic mediums that may increase CE opportunities. Methods: A self-administered online survey was completed by 68 NPs from across Australia. Results: The majority of respondents (93%) viewed CE to be very important and preferred methods of continuing education included receipt of information by email and interactive online case studies. Respondents working in metropolitan areas had increased access to high speed Internet in comparison to NPs working in rural or remote areas although this did not reach statistical significance (88% vs. 69% p = 0.07). Significantly more NPs working in metropolitan areas had access to a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) than NPs working in rural or remote areas (44% vs. 6% p = 0.003). Conclusion: This is the first national survey to report preference for CE and access to technology of NPs in Australia. Electronic technology can provide programmed support such as online learning and resources through computers and PDAs to maximise NP prescribing potential.

Background: Lung transplant recipients are expected to perform self-care behaviors to maximize transplant-related health outcomes. Despite high non-adherence rates in performing these self-care behaviors and the dire clinical consequences of such non-adherence interventions are lacking. Pocket Personal Assistant for Tracking Health (Pocket PATH) is a hand-held device developed for patients to record health data review data trends and report condition changes to the transplant team. Methods: A pilot trial was conducted to compare self-care agency self-care behaviors and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between recipients randomized to use Pocket PATH (n = 15) vs. standard care (n = 15) for the first two months following hospital discharge after lung transplantation. Results: Baseline characteristics were equivalent across groups. Patients in the Pocket PATH group showed significantly higher ratings of self-care agency performed self-care behaviors at significantly higher rates and reported significantly better HRQOL than standard care controls. Conclusion: Pocket PATH is more efficacious than standard care in promoting early self-care agency self-care behaviors and HRQOL in lung recipients. A large-scale randomized controlled trial is needed to test the impact of Pocket PATH on long-term self-care behaviors.;2009
Background: Medical education literature emphasizes that reflection and self-audit are pivotal steps in learning and that personal digital assistants (PDAs) have potential as decision support tools. Description: The purpose was to examine the efficacy of PDA-based resources and patient-encounter logging systems among 3rd-year medical clerks during pediatrics rotations. Evaluation: Students in rotations were assigned to control (using paper-based logs and references) or intervention groups (using PDA-based logs and resources). Students completed pre- and postrotation Paediatrics Competency Surveys participated in focus groups and were compared on year-end examination grades. Use of PDA logs far outweighed that of paper logs (1020 PDA logs and 87 paper logs). PDA logs were ranked significantly higher in enhancing learning and reflection than paper logs (t = 2.52 p < .01). PDA logs also facilitated specific learning experiences. Conclusion: PDA-based patient-encounter logs appear to be effective case documentation and reflection tools. The difference in number of logs between control and intervention groups demonstrates the utility of the PDA for point-of-care patient logging.;2009
Background: Medication errors associated with anticancer agents may cause fatal events. Therefore exact verification of the prescription order and accurate preparation of the mixture of anticancer injections are required for safe management in cancer chemotherapy. Methods: A computer-assisted biohazard safety cabinet was newly developed for verification and preparation of anticancer agents. Using a barcode reader information on prescription orders was transmitted from an electronic medical record to the computer system installed in the safety cabinet. The computer was controlled using a 3-button foot switch which avoided interruption of the mixing procedure. A monitor on the cabinet wall displayed the required amounts of anticancer injections and any special information for the dissolution or mixing procedure. The names of anticancer agents were verified using a personal digital assistant and the volume of injection taken which was automatically converted to weight on the basis of the specific gravity of anticancer solution was recorded on the computer through a digital scale. Results: Accuracy and efficiency in mixing anticancer injections were compared between procedures with and without the present apparatus. Errors in the amounts were much smaller and the time spent in preparation was significantly shorter using the present apparatus. Conclusions: The present computer-assisted biohazard safety cabinet for preparation of the mixture of anticancer agents is considered to be potentially useful for the safe management in cancer chemotherapy.

Background: Microcosting studies collect detailed data on resources used and the value of those resources. Such studies are useful for estimating the cost of new technologies or new community-based interventions for producing estimates in studies that include nonmarket goods and for studying within-procedure cost variation. Objectives: The objectives of this article were to (1) describe basic microcosting methods focusing on quantity data collection and (2) suggest a research agenda to improve methods in and the interpretation of microcosting. Research Design: Examples in the published literature were used to illustrate steps in the methods of gathering data (primarily quantity data) for a microcosting study. Results: Quantity data collection methods that were illustrated in the literature include the use of (1) administrative databases at single facilities (2) insurer administrative data (3) forms applied across multiple settings (4) an expert panel (5) surveys or interviews of one or more types of providers (6) review of patient charts (7) direct observation (8) personal digital assistants (9) program operation logs and (10) diary data. Conclusions: Future microcosting studies are likely to improve if research is done to compare the validity and cost of different data collection methods if a critical review is conducted of studies done to date and if the combination of the results of the first 2 steps described are used to develop guidelines that address common limitations critical judgment points and decisions that can reduce limitations and improve the quality of studies.;2009
Background: Physician adherence to National Cholesterol Education Program clinical practice guidelines has been poor. Methods: We recruited 68 primary care family and internal medicine practices 66 were randomly allocated to a study arm 5 practices withdrew resulting in 29 receiving the Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) intervention and 32 receiving an alternative intervention focused on the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7). The ATP III providers received a personal digital assistant providing the Framingham risk scores and ATP III-recommended treatment. All practices received copies of each clinical practice guideline an introductory lecture 1 performance feedback report and 4 visits for intervention-specific academic detailing. Data were abstracted at 61 practices from random samples of medical records of patients treated from June 1 2001 through May 31 2003 (baseline) and from May 1 2004 through April 30 2006 (follow-up). The proportion screened with subsequent appropriate decision making (primary outcome) was calculated. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare results by arm accounting for clustering of patients within practices. Results: We examined 5057 baseline and 3821 follow-up medical records. The screening rate for lipid levels increased from 43.6% to 49.0% (ATP III practices) and from 40.1% to 50.8% (control practices) (net difference -5.3% [P=.22]). Appropriate management of lipid levels decreased slightly (73.4% to 72.3%) in ATP III practices and more markedly (79.7% to 68.9%) in control practices. The net change in appropriate management favored the intervention (+9.7% 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8%-16.6% [P <.01]). Appropriate drug prescription within 4 months decreased in both arms (38.8% to 24.8% in ATP III practices and 45.3% to 24.1% in control practices net change 17.2% [P=.37]) Overtreatment declined from 6.6% to 3.9% in ATP III and rose from 4.2% to 6.4% in control practices (net change -4.9% [P=.01]). Conclusions: A multifactor intervention including personal digital assistant-based decision support may improve primary care physician adherence to the ATP III guidelines.;2009
BACKGROUND: Technology advances continue to impact patient care and physician workflow. To enable more efficient performance of billing activities a point-of-care (POC) handheld Computer technology replaced a paper-based system on an acute pain management service. METHODS: Using a handheld personal digital assistant (PDA) and software from MDeverywhere (MDe MDeverywhere Long Island NY) we performed a 1-yr prospective observational Study of an anesthesiology acute pain management service billings and collections. Seventeen anesthesiologists providing billable acute pain services were trained and entered their charges on a PDA. Twelve months of data just before electronic implementation (pre-elec) were compared to a 12-m period after implementation (post-elec). RESULTS: The total charges were 4883 for 890 patients pre-elec and 5368 for 1128 patients post-elec. With adoption of handheld billing the charge lag days decreased from 29.3 to 7.0 (P < 0.001). The days in accounts receivable trended downward from 59.9 to 51.1 (P = 0.031). The average number of charge lag days decreased significantly with month (P = 0.0002). The net collection rate increased from 37.4% pre-elec to 40.3% post-elec (P < 0.001). The return on investment was 1.18 fold (118%). 1CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of POC electronic billing using PDAs to replace a paper-based billing system improved the collection rate and decreased the number of charge lag days with a positive return on investment. The handheld PDA billing system provided POC support for physicians during their daily clinical (e.g. patient locations rounding lists) and billing activities improving workflow.;2009
Background: The data generated during a course of a biological experiment/study can be sometimes be massive and its management becomes quite critical for the success of the investigation undertaken. The accumulation and analysis of such large datasets often becomes tedious for biologists and lab technicians. Most of the current phenotype data acquisition management systems do not cater to the specialized needs of large-scale data analysis. The successful application of genomic tools/strategies to introduce desired traits in plants requires extensive and precise phenotyping of plant populations or gene bank material thus necessitating an efficient data acquisition system. Results: Here we describe newly developed software PHENOME for high-throughput phenotyping which allows researchers to accumulate categorize and manage large volume of phenotypic data. In this study a large number of individual tomato plants were phenotyped with the PHENOME application using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) with built-in barcode scanner in concert with customized database specific for handling large populations. Conclusion: The phenotyping of large population of plants both in the laboratory and in the field is very efficiently managed using PDA. The data is transferred to a specialized database(s) where it can be further analyzed and catalogued. The PHENOME aids collection and analysis of data obtained in large-scale mutagenesis assessing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) raising mapping population sampling of several individuals in one or more ecological niches etc.;2009
Background: The effects of the use of technological devices on dimensions that affect the physician-patient relationship need to be well understood. Objectives: Determine patients' perceptions of physicians' personal digital assistant (PDA) use comparing the results across 8 physician-patient dimensions important to clinical interactions. Results: Patients completed anonymous surveys about their perceptions of physician PDA use. Data were collected during 2006 and 2007 at 12 family medicine practices. Survey items included physician sex patient demographics if physicians explained why they were using the PDA and Likert ratings on 8 dimensions of how a PDA can influence physician-patient interactions (surprise confidence feelings comfort communication relationship intelligence and satisfaction). The survey response rate was 78%. Physicians explained to their patients what they were doing with the PDA 64% of the time. Logistic regression analyses determined that patients of male physicians patients attending private practices and underserved sites patients with Medicaid insurance and patients who observed their physician using a PDA during both the index visit and at least one prior visit were more likely to receive an explanation of PDA use. Most importantly physician-patient communication was rated significantly more positive if an explanation of PDA use was offered. Conclusion: Patients rate interactions with their physicians more positively when physicians explain their PDA use. (J Am Board Fam Med 200922:353-9.);2009
Background: The primary form of treatment for obesity today is behavioral therapy Self-monitoring diet and physical activity plays an important role in interventions targeting behavior and weight change. The SMART weight loss trial examined the impact of replacing the standard paper record used for self-monitoring with a personal digital assistant (PDA). This paper describes the design methods intervention and baseline sample characteristics of the SMART trial. Methods: The SMART trial used a 3-group design to determine the effects of different modes of self-monitoring on short- and long-term weight loss and on adherence to self-monitoring in a 24-month intervention. Participants were randomized to one of three conditions (11) use of a standard paper record (PR) (2) use of a PDA with dietary and physical activity software (PDA) or (3) use of a PDA with the same software plus a customized feedback program (PDA + FB). Results: We screened 704 individuals and randomized 210. There were statistically but not clinically significant differences among the three cohorts in age education. HDL cholesterol blood glucose and systolic blood pressure. At 24 months retention rate for the first of three cohorts was 90%. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge the SMART trial is the first large study to compare different methods of self-monitoring in a behavioral weight loss intervention and to compare the use of PDAs to conventional paper records. This study has the potential to reveal significant details about self-monitoring patterns and whether technology can improve adherence to this vital intervention component. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Chatter vibration problems arise during machining. This paper aims to produce a strategy that can detect the emergence of chatter so that subsequently in accordance with the lobe on the stability diagram where the process is located the proper strategy may be determined either by taking the machine to a stable spindle speed or causing continuous variation in spindle speed. The effectiveness of this strategy is contrasted for a number of different cases using both simulation and experimental testing. The context targeted by the strategy is a high-speed mill roughing operation for cases of vibration arising on the headstock/cutting tool unit when high material removal rates (MRR) must be maintained. Industrial implementation of the strategy and the chatter detection and diagnosis algorithm is carried out using a portable digital assistant (PDA). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009
Cognition faculty related to perception imagination memory and problem solving refers to internal mental processes through which sensorial input is acquired elaborated used and stored. One of its importances relies on the fact that it affects in a direct way the learning potential. It has been shown that even thou cognitive processes develop side by side with biological maturity this cognitive development can be enhanced by means of mediated learning as signaled by Feuerstein's Mediated Learning theory. Based on this theory is that we propose an intervention model that addresses school academic issues using technologically assisted small group collaboration pursuing a dual academic objective: to thrive students' cognitive processes while addressing school curriculum topics. The purpose therefore is to balance the students' cognitive differences by means of in-school content-filled classroom activities. Our aim is to make use of peer mediation in a real world setting with a virtual construction of it. In this paper we describe this novel intervention model along with an in-school usage experience. For this we present an activity designed for high school students specifically aimed to assist the learning of kinematics graph interpretation and graph plotting. In this activity the students work in groups of three using a robot and wirelessly interconnected Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). By means of a controlled experiment we show how technologically-supported peer mediation promotes the students' enrichment of their cognitive processes in each of the different stages of the mental act (input-elaboration-output) favoring communication skills insight and reasoning while also restraining impulsive conduct and trial-and-error answers.;2009
Content and objective: Health professionals now routinely use electronic knowledge resources (EKRs). Few studies have considered EKR-related tensions which may arise in a clinical decision-making context. The present study aims to explore three types of tension: (1) user-computer tension (2) social tensions and (3) organizational tensions (constraints associated with organizational routines and health policies). Design participants intervention setting: We conducted a multiple case study examining Family Medicine residents' searches for information in everyday life. Cases were defined as critical searches for information among 17 first year family medicine residents using InfoRetriever (R) 2003/2004 on a PDA over 1.5 months at McGill University. InfoRetriever (R) - derived information was used within a resident-patient decision-making context in 84 of 156 cases. For each case residents were interviewed and extracts of interview transcripts were assigned to themes using specialized software (presence of tension type of tension). Further computer-assisted lexical-semantic analysis was performed on transcripts. Authors reached consensus on assignments. Results: Twenty-five cases with tension were identified (one case had two types of tension) and illustrate the above mentioned types of tensions: (T1) tension between the resident and InfoRetriever (R) (N = 16) (T2) InfoRetriever (R)-related tension between the resident and other social actors specifically supervisors other health care professionals and patients (N = 7) (T3) InfoRetriever (R)-related tension between the resident and the health organization/system (N = 3). Conclusions: Results suggest EKR usage in a clinical decision-making context may have negative consequences when three types of tension arise in a clinical decision-making context. Illustrated types of tension are interrelated and not mutually exclusive. Awareness of EKR-related tensions may help clinicians to integrate EKRs in practice. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Conversational agents are becoming more widespread in computer technologies but there has been little research in how humans interact with them. Two eye tracking studies investigated how humans distribute eye gaze towards conversational agents in complex tutoring systems. In Study 1 participants interacted with the single-agent tutoring system AutoTutor. Fixation times showed that the agent received most attention throughout the interaction even when display size was statistically controlled. In Study 2 participants interacted with iSTART. Fixations were on the relevant agents when these agents spoke. Both studies provided evidence that humans regard animated conversational agents as conversational partners in the communication process. Copyright (C) 2008 JohnWiley & Sons Ltd.;2009
Conversational systems or chatterbots converse/chat by learning from their interactions with users. To do this the systems must have an adaptive knowledge base that can be updated by the systems themselves. RONE is a tele-text based conversational system. RONE's knowledge base is built using SQL and accessed using the main Java application. Additionally RONE uses conjunctions and prepositions as markers to expedite the dissemination and storage of information which helps him learn. In this paper we describe the approach RONE uses to break up new information for learning purposes - the principle technique introduced here being the storage of information in a format to answer all the possible questions directly without inference. We also look at other conversation based learning approaches and their limitations. Further we compare RONE's performance against some contemporary conversational systems and provide evidence of the relative superior informational accuracy of RONE's responses to user interrogation. RONE's better performance is noteworthy because it is relative to systems which are Loebner Prize medal winners.;2009
CSIEC (Computer Simulation in Educational Communication) system with newly developed multiple functions for English instruction still focuses on supplying a virtual chatting partner (chatbot) which can chat in English with the English learners anytime anywhere. It generates communicative response according to the user input the dialogue context the user's and its own personality knowledge common sense knowledge and inference knowledge. All these kinds of knowledge are expressed in the form of NLML an annotation language for natural language text. These NLMLs can either be automatically obtained through parsing the text or be easily authored with the help of GUI editors designed by LIS. So the CSIEC system suggests a naive approach of logical reasoning and inference directly through syntactical and semantic analysis of textual knowledge. This approach has advantages over the old ELIZA-like keywords matching mechanism. The chatting log summarization of free Internet usage within six months demonstrates this advantage. In this paper we present the system architecture and underlying technologies and the educational application results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2009
Despite being expensive and time consuming board-level drop testing has been widely used to assess the drop or impact resistance of the solder joints in handheld microelectronic devices such as cellphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). In this study a new test method which is much simpler and quicker is proposed. The method involves evaluating the elastic strain energy and relating it to the impact resistance of the solder joint by considering the Young's modulus of the bulk solder and the fracture stress of the solder joint during a ball pull test at high strain rates. The results show that solder joints can be ranked in order of descending elastic strain energy as follows: Sn-37Pb Sn-1Ag-0.5Cu Sn-3Ag-0.5Cu and Sn-4Ag-0.5Cu. This order is consistent with the actual drop performances of the samples.;2009
Due to ever increasing consumer demand today's marketplace is full of portable computing devices such as notebook computers gaming machines personal digital assistants and smart phones. In each of these technologies processing power and functionality levels are continuing to increase resulting in increased thermal management issues. The former of these technologies already use an active cooling solution with a profile of 10-15 mm while the latter two are quickly approaching the limits of passive cooling. Since a common characteristic in each of these technologies is the desire to reduce profile height there exists a need to develop low profile cooling solutions that are capable of supporting this growing market. However a prerequisite to developing such solutions is an accurate understanding of how the noise level characteristics of the driving fans scale with height. This paper experimentally addresses the acoustic scaling of low profile fans. The rotor heights range from 0.5 mm to 15 mm with diameters from 15 mm to 32 mm giving an aspect ratio of height relative to diameter of 0.03-0.6. The results can be used as a foundation for the development of active cooling in mobile devices where both correlations for noise levels and basic design criteria are identified.;2009
Effective text entry on handheld devices remains an important user input problem. On a personal digital assistant (PDA) text entry methods traditionally support stylus-based input performed by the user's dominant hand. In this paper we present the design of a two-handed software keyboard for a PDA which specifically takes advantage of the thumb in the non-dominant hand. We compare our chorded keyboard design to other stylus-based text entry methods in an evaluation that studies user input in different user mobility states. Our study shows that users type fastest using the mini-qwerty keyboard and most accurately using our two-handed keyboard. We also discover a difference in input performance with the mini-qwerty keyboard between stationary and mobile states. As a user walks text input speed decreases while error rates and mental workload increases however these metrics remain relatively stable in our two-handed technique despite user mobility.

Evaluation of methods and techniques for conversational and multimodal spoken dialogue systems is complex as is gathering data for the modeling and tuning of such techniques. This article describes MushyPeek all experiment framework that allows us to manipulate the audiovisual behavior of interlocutors in a setting similar to face-to-face human-human dialogue. The setup connects two subjects to each other over a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone connection and simultaneously provides each of them with an avatar representing the other. We present a first experiment which inaugurates exemplifies and validates the framework. The experiment corroborates earlier findings on the use of gaze and head pose gestures in turn-taking.;2009
Failure to communicate important patient information between physicians causes medical errors and adverse patient events. On-call neurosurgery physicians at the Toronto Western Hospital do not know the medical details of all the patients that they are covering at night because they do not care for the entire service of patients during the clay. Because there is no formal handover system to transfer patient information to the on-call physician a nurse practitioner-based sign-out system was recently introduced. its effectiveness for communication was evaluated with preintervention-postintervention questionnaires and by recording daily logins. There was a statistically significant decrease in number of logins after 8 weeks Of use (p = .05 Fisher's exact test) and the tool was abandoned after 16 weeks. Modifications identified to improve the system include the ability to sort by attending physician and to automatically populate the list with new patients. Effective communication is important for reducing medical errors and perhaps these modifications will facilitate this important endeavor.;2009
Hand-held personal digital assistant (PDA)-based food diaries have been developed for self-monitoring of dietary intake but the accuracy of these diaries is unclear for patients with diabetes. The aim of the study was to assess the accuracy and feasibility of use of a new PDA-based food diary including food photographs. The study included 44 Japanese participants without diabetes (mean age 23 years) and 16 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 53 years). The PDA-based food diary was used for 7 consecutive days. Information about all dietary intake on the 7th day of PDA self-monitoring was collected by a 24-hour recall interview on the 8th day. The PDA-based data for dietary intake on the 7th day were then compared to the 24-hour recall data for the same period. Feasibility was assessed based on the frequency and timeliness of self-monitoring. There was no significant difference in daily totals for energy protein carbohydrate and fat between the two methods in each group. Pearson's correlation and intraclass correlation coefficients showed strong significant relationships for all variables between the two methods in both groups. Bland-Altman plots did not indicate any bias in estimated daily caloric intake. Participants recorded 98% of their meals in the PDA with 75% of entries recorded within 6 hours after the meal starting time. The findings suggest that the PDA-based food diary is a potential clinical method to estimate dietary intake and may be a beneficial tool for self-monitoring of dietary intake.

Health-care has rapidly evolved with the informatics revolution. The rapid growth of the world-wide web as a tool for global connectivity has affected the way in which health-related information is distributed and accessed over the internet. Many informatics and internet applications are now available for use by both oncology health-care professionals and patients with cancer with many people using the internet to search for drug-related and other health-related information. The practice of pharmaceutical care aims to ensure optimum medication-related therapeutic outcomes in patients and involves identifying solving and preventing potential or actual drug-related problems (DRPs) with regards to a patient's drug therapy. Pharmacoinformatics involves the use of informatics the internet and interactive technologies to solve DRPs with a focus on providing optimum pharmaceutical care and improved patient safety. This paper highlights the different pharmacoinformatics channels that have been used in the provision of pharmaceutical care which are relevant to both oncology health-care professionals and patients with cancer. We will discuss several issues that have arisen as a result of cybermedicine which can potentially affect the quality of pharmaceutical care in patients with cancer and also provide insights into how pharmacoinformatics can potentially affect the future of healthcare. The opportunity of integrating pharmacoinformatics in the practice of clinical oncology as an aid to solve DRPs is indeed appealing. Oncology practitioners should not only focus on the acquistion of new treatment strategies but also continue to embrace and harness new information and communication technologies so as to increase their efficiency and improve on the pharmaceutical care of patients with cancer.;2009
If artists and art explore organization of the brain [Zeki S. Lamb M. 1994. The neurology of kinetic art. Brain 117 607-636] then investigation of response to artistic performance holds promise as a window to perceptual and cognitive processes. A new instrument for recording real-time audience response - the portable Audience Response Facility (pARF) - is described. Twenty hand-held Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) collect responses on customizable skin interfaces. The pARF server transmits the customizable options synchronizes devices and collects data for export. We report two studies using the pARF that demonstrate respondent agreement of perceived emotion during particular sections of two dance works. Greater agreement was evident in continuous ratings of arousal than valence arousal appears to be related to surface features of the dance work. Future applications of the pARF to studies of multi-modal perception and cognition are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009
Implementation of patient safety initiatives can be costly in time and energy. Because of small volumes and limited resources rural hospitals often are not included in nationally driven patient safety initiatives. This article describes the Tennessee Rural Hospital Patient Safety Demonstration project whose goal was to strengthen capacity for patient safety initiatives in 8 small Tennessee rural hospitals using a multi-organizational collaborative model. The demonstration identified and facilitated implementation of 3 patient safety interventions: the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) patient safety culture survey use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and sharing of emergency room protocols. The experience suggested that a collaborative model between rural hospitals a payer a hospital association a quality improvement organization and academic institutions can effectively support patient safety activities in rural hospitals. Successful implementation of the 3 patient safety interventions depended on leadership provided by nursing and patient safety/quality managers and open trusting communications within the hospitals.;2009
In response to escalation of community violence the U.S. Department of Commerce funded Home Health VNA (HHVNA) serving the Merrimack River valley communities in Massachusetts and New Hampshire for a project demonstrating innovative use of technology in screening for abuse and neglect. All health care providers in the HHVNA were trained in screening through tools loaded on their personal digital assistants. The sample was comprised of patients served by HHVNA during the study period. When a patient screened positive the health care provider mobilized resources including social workers the office of elder services or the local department of social services office for same-day follow-up. Screening for abuse and neglect was mainstreamed into routine care. Health care providers noted significant reduction in redundant domestic abuse data collection. The close communication networks created enabled health care providers to mobilize resources initiating same-day in-depth social work assessment and referrals to appropriate community agencies. Health care providers now transmit selected encrypted health information and mandated reports to official agencies. Wedding technology with health care professionals' skills and knowledge can move prevention of and early intervention for domestic abuse and neglect to a new level of efficacy.;2009
In the past a German Computerized Adaptive Test based on Item Response Theory (IRT) was developed for purposes of assessing the construct depression [Computer-adaptive test for depression (D-CAT)]. This study aims at testing the feasibility and validity of the real computer-adaptive application. The D-CAT supplied by a bank of 64 items was administered on personal digital assistants (PDAs) to 423 consecutive patients suffering from psychosomatic and other medical conditions (78 with depression). Items were adaptively administered until a predetermined reliability (r >= 0.90) was attained. For validation purposes the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered. Another sample of 114 patients was evaluated using standardized diagnostic interviews [Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)]. The D-CAT was quickly completed (mean 74 seconds) well accepted by the patients and reliable after an average administration of only six items. In 95% of the cases 10 items or less were needed for a reliable score estimate. Correlations between the D-CAT and the HADS CES-D and BDI ranged between r = 0.68 and r = 0.77. The D-CAT distinguished between diagnostic groups as well as established questionnaires do. The D-CAT proved an efficient well accepted and reliable tool. Discriminative power was comparable to other depression measures whereby the CAT is shorter and more precise. Item usage raises questions of balancing the item selection for content in the future.

In this paper we describe RavenClaw a plan-based task-independent dialog management framework: RavenClaw isolates the domain-specific aspects of the dialog control logic from domain-independent conversational skills and in the process facilitates rapid development of mixed-initiative systems operating in complex task-oriented domains. System developers can focus exclusively on describing the dialog task control logic while a large number of domain-independent conversational skills such as error handling timing and turn-taking are transparently supported and enforced by the RavenClaw dialog engine. To date RavenClaw has been used to construct and deploy a large number of systems spanning different domains and interaction styles such as information access guidance through procedures command-and-control medical diagnosis etc. The framework has easily adapted to all of these domains indicating a high degree of versatility and scalability.

In this paper we investigate two statistical methods for spoken language understanding based on statistical machine translation. The first approach employs the source-channel paradigm whereas the other uses the maximum entropy framework. Starting with an annotated corpus we describe the problem of natural language understanding as a translation from a source sentence to a formal language target sentence. We analyze the quality of different alignment models and feature functions and show that the direct maximum entropy approach outperforms the source channel-based method. Furthermore we investigate how both methods perform if the input sentences contain speech recognition errors. Finally we investigate a new approach to combine speech recognition and spoken language understanding. For this purpose we employ minimum error rate training which directly optimizes the final evaluation criterion. By combining all knowledge sources in a log-linear way we show that we can decrease both the word error rate and the slot error rate. Experiments were carried out on two German inhouse corpora for spoken dialogue systems.;2009
In this paper we present the comprehensive version of CSIEC (Computer Simulation in Educational Communication) an interactive web-based human-computer dialogue system with natural language for English instruction and its tentative application and evaluation in English education. First we briefly introduce the motivation for this project survey the related works and illustrate the system structure with flow diagram. Then we describe its pedagogical functions especially free chatting and chatting on a given topic. We summarise the free Internet usage within 6 months and introduce its integration into English classrooms as well as the formal evaluation results of the integration. The evaluation findings show that the chatting function has been improved and fully used by the users and the application of the CSIEC system in English instruction can motivate the learners to use English and enhance their learning process. Lastly we discuss the application-driven approach of system development and draw some conclusions for future improvement.;2009
In this study a personal digital assistant (PDA) with picture auditory and video prompts with voice over was evaluated as a portable self-prompting device for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a multiple probe design across three cooking recipes and replicated with three students with ASD the system was tested for its effectiveness in increasing independent performance across the multiple step tasks. In addition data were recorded for the number and types of prompts used by the students across time. Results indicate that the students with ASD were able to adjust the prompt levels used on the PDA and to maintain their ability to use the device to independently complete recipes over time.;2009
In today's marketplace many of the newer-generation convergence products (e.g. camera phones all-in-one personal digital assistants) offer consumers product performance that rivals dedicated versions. With the increased availability of options consumers now face another dilemma in their purchase consideration: Which product form should they choose-converged dedicated or both? This study investigates the choice patterns for product forms along the technology trajectories. In a series of four studies the authors find that at low levels of technological performance consumers overwhelmingly select convergence products over the dedicated options whereas the choice pattern is reversed at high levels of technological performance. Furthermore the authors demonstrate that a preannouncement of future technology can affect consumer preferences for product forms. Finally they address the managerial implications and suggest directions for further research.;2009
In trying to control various aspects concerning utterance production in multi-party human-computer dialogue argumentative considerations play an important part particularly in choosing appropriate lexical units so that we fine-tune the degree of persuasion that each utterance has. A preliminary step in this endeavor is the ability to place an ordering relation between semantic forms (that are due to be realized as utterances by the machine) concerning their persuasion strength with respect to certain (explicit or implicit) conclusions. Thus in this article we propose a mechanism for assessing utterances in terms of their argumentative force. The framework designed conflates insights from Asher and Lascarides' SDRT (Segmented Discourse Representation Theory) and from Anscombre and Ducrot's AT (Argumentation Theory). These mechanisms are included in a language generation component of a multi-party dialogue system for book reservation applications (i.e. a virtual librarian) and thus evaluated via typical human-machine conversations.;2009
Intelligent Tutoring Systems are computer programs that aim at providing personalized instruction to students. In recent years conversational robots usually known as chatterbots become very popular in the Internet and ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity) is probably the most popular one. ALICE brain is written in AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) an open XML language. We have considered the combination of both approaches i.e the use of AIML-based bots for tutoring purposes in open e-Learning platforms such as Claroline or Moodle. With that aim in mind we have developed a bot (chatterbot) for helping the students during their learning process and for supporting the activities of the teacher. This bot (TQ-Bot) is able to analyse the requests made by the learners in written natural language and to provide adequate and domain specific answers orienting the student to the right course contents. Besides TQ-Bot is able to track and supervise the student progress by means of personalized questionnaires. This bot has been developed and integrated as user-friendly modules in Claroline and Moodle.;2009
Introduction. Personal digital assistant (PDA)-based continuing medical education (CME) activities have become widely available. Aims. To evaluate the effectiveness of print- and PDA-based CME materials in erectile dysfunction (ED). Methods. CME materials describing links between ED and comorbid medical conditions effects of certain lifestyle modifications on ED and treatment of ED with phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors were distributed as a print supplement and as electronic modules viewed with PDAs. We evaluated how effectively these materials improved evidence-based clinical choices using survey questions about case vignettes and comparing responses of CME participants (N = 85) and matched nonparticipants (N = 94). Main Outcome Measures. Effect size measuring the difference in evidence-based clinical scores between participants and nonparticipants. Results. CME certificates were awarded to 3557 participants (459 print 3098 PDA). Among survey respondents significantly more CME participants recognized that ED was associated with greater risk for myocardial infarction (61% participants 34% nonparticipants P < 0.001) and was a strong marker for diabetes mellitus (37% participants 9% nonparticipants P < 0.001). In contrast participants and nonparticipants both displayed a good understanding of the relationships of smoking obesity and sedentary lifestyle with ED and of using PDE5 inhibitors to treat ED in patients with prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia this likely reflects a good baseline understanding of these topics. Participants and nonparticipants each displayed a poor understanding of the recommendations regarding nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and PDE5 inhibitor use. Patient reluctance to discuss sexual concerns was perceived as the most significant barrier to optimal ED management. Conclusions. Given patient reluctance to discuss sexual concerns future CME activities should focus on educating health-care providers and patients that ED is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Both print- and PDA-based CME on ED were effective the large number of lesson completers suggests a trend toward on-demand self-selected CME is positive. Broderick GA and Abdolrasulnia M.

It was analyzed whether an embodied conversational agent (ECA) has specific advantages when employed with privacy invading technologies such as a biometric security system. The study compares the effects of an ECA interface with the effects of conventional text-based and voice-based interfaces on user acceptance and usability. An additional variable was whether the biometric system falsely rejected the user twice or whether it directly accepted him/her. Results of the 2 x 3 between-subjects design indicated that although overall the text interface is rated most positive voice and ECA yield distinct social effects: They have more advantageous consequences when problems arise - i.e. when the user is rejected repeatedly. The implications for social psychology in terms of applicability of new research methods as well as insights concerning fundamental research are discussed.;2009
Mobile electronic products have recently become very popular because of their portable convenience and versatile functions. The personal digital assistant (PDA) can even access the Internet. However there is still plenty of room for improvement in the PDA interface. This research proposes a systematic approach to analyze generate and evaluate a PDA integrated menu-icon interface design for the DigitHub Company based on customer requirements. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) is incorporated with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to identify and categorize functional PDA menus and their corresponding icons. We evaluate the importance of each of the different functional menus and categories. We generate five PDA menu-icon interface design alternatives that meet the proposed design guidelines and we evaluate each for their respective feasibilities. The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is applied to measure the overall operating performance of the five PDA menu-icon interface design alternatives. The evaluation results show that the preferred design is option PDA(5) a hierarchical and separated menu-icon layout style that features a two-layer menu structure. We expect that the proposed development procedure for the generation and evaluation of PDA menu-icon design alternatives based on customer requirements will be of interest to interface designers who wish to focus on mobile products. Relevance to industry: This paper proposes an integrated procedure for designing PDA menu-icon interfaces. Our methodology should help in the creation and optimization of screen layouts for mobile phones global positioning system (GPS) navigation devices digital cameras and related screen interfaces.

Mobile handheld devices are increasingly being used in education. In this paper we undertook a review of empirical based articles to summarise the current research regarding the use of mobile handheld devices (personal digital assistants/PDAs palmtops and mobile phones) in K-12 and higher education settings. This review was guided by the following four questions: (a) How are mobile handheld devices such as PDAs palmtops and mobile phones used by students and teachers? (b) What types of research methods have been applied using such devices? (c) What data collection methods are used in the research? and (d) What research topics have been conducted on these handheld devices in education settings as well as their related findings? We summarise and discuss some major findings from the research as well as several limitations of previous empirical studies. We conclude by providing some recommendations for future research related to mobile handheld devices in education settings.;2009
Mobile learning and testing is emerging as a potential educational environment. In this article we evaluate the use of mobile devices for testing as compared to web-based assessment systems. We also describe an authoring tool to develop adaptable and adaptive computerized tests that can be executed on such different platforms as personal computers personal digital assistants and mobile phones. We have carried out an experiment with computer science university students to determine their satisfaction and to compare the results obtained when executing a test on personal computers versus mobile devices. The experiments have shown that students were highly motivated and enjoyed using mobile application for testing. Furthermore there were not any significant differences in the results obtained with the different versions of the test. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals Inc.

Mobile telemedicine integrates wireless communications for different telemedical applications such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants and with the implementation of modern wireless telecommunication wireless local area network and satellite communication is a reality. New generation cellular phones or personal digital assistants have overcome limitations of image quality seen in older devices and with dermatology being a visual profession mobile teledermatology is perhaps the most recent development in this field. Mobile teledermatology may provide a triage service aimed toward management of patients with emergent skin disease or for follow-up with patients requiring systemic treatment. Teledermoscopy enables rapid transmission of dermoscopic images via e-mail or specific web-application and studies have demonstrated a high 91% concordance between face-to-face diagnosis and remote diagnosis of such images. Further to this telediagnosis of melanocytic skin neoplasms achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 83% versus the conventional histopathologic diagnosis. Mobile teledermoscopy is the combination of such approaches enabling transfer of images captured with cellular phones coupled with a pocket dermatoscope and preliminary studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of its use in triage of pigmented lesions. Such applications are of benefit to physicians in enabling easy storage of data for follow-up or referral of images for expert second opinion and may facilitate a person-centered health system for patients with numerous moles and pigmented skin lesions who could forward images for evaluation. The incidence of skin cancers has reached epidemic proportions among whites and the trend is still going upward. Mobile teledermatology and teledermoscopy may be implemented as a triage or screening tool for malignant tumors to facilitate early detection and diagnosis which is crucial for improved patient outcomes. While the legal aspects concerning teleconsultations need to be evaluated the communications technologies provide a unique opportunity for physicians and patients alike and we foresee a place for these tools in dermatology soon.

Multimodal grammars provide an effective mechanism for quickly creating integration and understanding capabilities for interactive systems supporting simultaneous use of multiple input modalities. However like other approaches based on hand-crafted grammars multimodal grammars can be brittle with respect to unexpected erroneous or disfluent input. In this article we show how the finite-state approach to multimodal language processing can be extended to support multimodal applications combining speech with complex freehand pen input and evaluate the approach in the context of a multimodal conversational system (MATCH). We explore a range of different techniques for improving the robustness of multimodal integration and understanding. These include techniques for building effective language models for speech recognition when little or no multimodal training data is available and techniques for robust multimodal understanding that draw on classification machine translation and sequence edit methods. We also explore the use of edit-based methods to overcome mismatches between the gesture stream and the speech stream.;2009
New approaches to assess energy intake (EI) may have advantages over traditional written methods but validity of these emerging methodologies must be demonstrated. This exploratory study compared EI obtained using a hand-held personal digital assistant (PDA) and traditional written records with total energy expenditure measured by doubly labeled water (TEEDLW). Twenty-six volunteers (aged 23 +/- 4 years body mass index [calculated as kg/m(2)] 24 +/- 2) participated in a randomized (either PDA or written record group) and matched (for sex age and body mass index) study for 7 consecutive days between June 2005 and April 2006 to record EI. Group comparisons were made with t and Mann-Whitney U tests. Bland-Altman plots were used to compare limits of agreement between methods. Volunteers remained weight stable during the study period (0.2 +/- 0.8 kg P > 0.05). Reported El by written record and PDA were similar to TEEDLW 105% vs 92% of TEEDLW respectively (P > 0.05). There was a significant relationship between reported El by PDA and TEEDLW (r=0.60 P < 0.05) but not for written record (r=0.45 P > 0.05). Limits of agreement indicated both written record and PDA had large variability (range 1394 to -1472 kcal/day). Findings suggest the bias in using a PDA is similar to that observed when using a written record for estimation of El in weight-stable volunteers. J Am Diet Assoc. 2009109:1241-1245.;2009
OBJECTIVE - We developed a field procedure using personal digital assistant (PDA) technology to test the hypothesis that naturally occurring episodes of hypo- and hyperglycemia are associated with deterioration in cognitive function in children with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 61 children aged 6-11. years with type 1 diabetes received a PDA programmed with two brief cognitive tests (mental math and choice reaction time) which they completed just before home glucose readings. The computer recorded Lime to complete each test and number of correct responses. Children completed several trials per day over 4-6 weeks for a total of 70 trials. Performance variables were compared across glucose ranges. Individual impairment scores (IISs) were also computed for each child by calculating the SD between performance during euglycemia and that during glucose extremes. RESULTS - Time to complete both mental math and reaction time was significantly longer during hypoglycemia. During hyperglycemia time to complete math was significantly longer and reaction time was marginally significant (P = 0.053). There were no differences on task accuracy. Decline in mental math performance was equivalent at glucose levels <3.0 and >22.2 mmol/l. IISs varied greatly across children with no age or sex differences. CONCLUSIONS - A decrease in mental efficiency occurs With naturally occurring hypo- and hyperglycemic glucose fluctuations in children with type 1 diabetes and this effect can be detected with a field procedure using PDA technology. With blood glucose levels >22.2 mmol/l cognitive deterioration equals that associated With significant hypoglycemia. Diabetes Care 32:1001-1.006 2009;2009
OBJECTIVE. Pay-for-performance programs are used to promote improved health care quality often through increased use of health information technology. However little is known about whether pay-for-performance programs influence the adoption of health information technology especially among child health providers. This study explored how various pay-for-performance compensation methods are related to health information technology use. METHODS. Survey data from 1014 child health providers practicing in Florida were analyzed by using univariate and multivariate techniques. Questions asked about the adoption of electronic health records and personal digital assistants as well as types of activities that affected child health provider compensation or income. RESULTS. The most common reported method to affect respondents' compensation was traditional productivity or billing (78%). Of the pay-for-performance-related methods of compensation child health providers indicated that measures of clinical care (41%) patient surveys and experience (34%) the use of health information technology (29%) and quality bonuses or incentives (27%) were a major or minor factor in their compensation. In multivariate logistic regression analyses only pay-for-performance programs that compensated directly for health information technology use were associated with an increased likelihood of electronic health record system adoption. Pay-for-performance programs linking measures of clinical quality to compensation were positively associated with personal digital assistant use among child health providers. CONCLUSIONS. Pay-for-performance programs that do not directly emphasize health information technology use do not influence the adoption of electronic health records among Florida physicians treating children. Understanding how different pay-for-performance compensation methods incentivize health information technology adoption is important for improving quality. Pediatrics 2009 123: S92-S96;2009
Objective. To explore how reported joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) relates to weather and solar variables. Methods. A prospective cohort study was conducted in Norway on 36 patients with stable RA. Daily reports of pain in the morning on a visual analog scale for 84 consecutive days were correlated (using time-series methodology) with records of atmospheric and solar variables for the same days. Results. Pain was significantly associated with 3 or more external variables in 6 (17%) of the patients with 1 or 2 external variables in 16 (44%) of the patients and no associations were observed in 14 (39%) of the patients. The multivariate model explained between 19% and 64% of the variance in pain (R-2) in the patients with associations to at least 3 weather/solar variables. The patients differed in the variables they responded to and in which direction except for consistent negative associations between pain and ultraviolet light dose and between pain and solar radio flux/sunspot count. The associations were mostly with same-day weather but also lagged up to 3 days. We were not able to fit a statistically significant model at the group level. Conclusion. Weather sensitivity seems to be a continuum and a highly individual phenomenon in patients with RA. In the present sample pain was significantly associated with 3 or more weather variables in 1 out of 6 patients for whom the magnitude of weather sensitivity might significantly influence pain reporting in clinical care and research.;2009
Objective: Clinical informatics intervention research suffers from a lack of attention to external validity in study design implementation evaluation and reporting. This hampers the ability of others to assess the fit of a clinical informatics intervention with demonstrated efficacy in one setting for implementation in their setting. The objective of this model formulation paper is to demonstrate the applicability of the RE-AIM (Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation and Maintenance) framework with proposed extensions to clinical informatics intervention research and describe the framework's role in facilitating the translation of evidence into practice and generation of evidence from practice. Both aspects are essential to reap the clinical and public health benefits of clinical informatics research. Design: We expanded RE-AIM through the addition of assessment questions relevant to clinical informatics intervention research including those related to predisposing enabling and reinforcing factors and validated it with two case studies. Results: The first case study supported the applicability of RE-AIM to inform real world implementation of a clinical informatics intervention with demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) - the Choice (Creating better Health Outcomes by Improving Communication about Patients' Experiences) intervention. The second an RCT of a personal digital assistant-based decision support system for guideline-based care illustrated how RE-AIM can be used to inform the design of an efficacy RCT that captures essential contextual details typically lacking in RCT design and reporting. Conclusion: The case studies validate through example the applicability of RE-AIM. to inform the design implementation evaluation and reporting of clinical informatics intervention studies.

Objective: Handheld computers (personal digital assistant PDA) have the potential to reduce the logistic burden cost and error rate of paper-based health research data collection but there is a lack of appropriate software. The present work describes the development and evaluation of PDACT a Personal Data Collection Toolset (www.healthware.org/pdact/index.htm) for the Palm (TM) Pilot handheld computer for interviewer-administered and respondent-administered data collection. Methods: We developed Personal Data Collection Toolkit ( PDACT) software to enable questionnaires developed in QDS (TM) Design Studio a Windows (TM) application to be compiled and completed on Palm (TM) Pilot devices and evaluated in several representative field survey settings. Results: The software has been used in seven separate studies and in over 90000 interviews. Five interviewer-administered studies were completed in rural settings with poor communications infrastructure following one day of interviewer training. Two respondent-administered questionnaire studies were completed by learners in urban secondary schools after 15 min training. Questionnaires were available on each handheld in up to 11 languages ranged from 20 to 580 questions and took between 15 and 90 min to complete. Up to 200 Palm (TM) Pilot devices were in use on a single day and in about 50 device-years of use very few technical problems were found. Compared with paper-based collection data validation and cleaning times were reduced and fewer errors were found. PDA data collection is easy to use and preferred by interviewers and respondents ( both respondent-administered and interviewer-administered) over paper. Data are compiled and available within hours of collection facilitating data quality assurance. Although hardware increases the setup cost of the first study the cumulative cost falls thereafter and converges on the cumulative cost of paper-based studies ( four in the case of our interviewer-administered studies). Handheld data collection is an appropriate affordable and convenient technology for health data collection in diverse settings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009
Objective: To compare users' speed number of entry errors and satisfaction in using two current devices for electronic data collection in clinical research: handheld and laptop computers. Design: The authors performed a randomized cross-over trial using 160 different paper-based questionnaires and representing altogether 45440 variables. Four data coders were instructed to record according to a random predefined and equally balanced sequence the content of these questionnaires either on a laptop or on a handheld computer. Instructions on the kind of device to be used were provided to data-coders in individual sealed and opaque envelopes. Study conditions were controlled and the data entry process performed in a quiet environment. Measurements: The authors compared the duration of the data recording process the number of errors and users' satisfaction with the two devices. The authors divided errors into two separate categories typing and missing data errors. The original paper-based questionnaire was used as a gold-standard. Results: The overall duration of the recording process was significantly reduced (2.0 versus 3.3 min) when data were recorded on the laptop computer (p < 0.001). Data accuracy also improved. There were 5.8 typing errors per 1000 entries with the laptop compared to 8.4 per 1000 with the handheld computer (p < 0.001). The difference was even more important for missing data which decreased from 22.8 to 2.9 per 1000 entries when a laptop was used (p < 0.001.). Users found the laptop easier faster and more satisfying to use than the handheld computer. Conclusions: Despite the increasing use of handheld computers for electronic data collection in clinical research these devices should be used with caution. They double the duration of the data entry process and significantly increase the risk of typing errors and missing data. This may become a particularly crucial issue in Studies where these devices are provided to patients or healthcare workers unfamiliar with Computer Technologies for self-reporting or research data collection processes.;2009
Objective: To evaluate pharmacists' behavioral intention to use personal digital assistants (PDAs) in their profession by means of the Extended Technology Acceptance Model (ETAM). Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Setting: Hospital and community pharmacies in Houston TX in 2004. Participants: Convenience sample of 295 practicing pharmacists. Intervention: A prevalidated survey containing 30 items evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree) which measured the ETAM variables. Main outcome measures: Predictors of intention to use PDA for pharmacists owning the device. Results: Among the surveyed population 49% of pharmacists owned PDAs. Overall the ETAM constructs showed fairly good reliability. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the ETAM explained 69% of the variance in intention to use PDAs for pharmacists owning the device. Result demonstrability (beta = 0.53) subjective norm (beta = 0.25) and voluntariness (beta = -0.10) were significant (P < 0.05) predictors of pharmacists' intention to use PDAs. Conclusion: ETAM proved useful in predicting pharmacists' behavior in using PDAs. With improvements in technology PDAs be an effective tool for pharmacists in providing better patient care.;2009
Objectives: To describe the health issues reported using a personal digital assistant (PDA) to conduct screening at adolescent well visits and to determine the effect of a PDA screening tool on the content and quality of the clinical interaction. Design: The PDA screening tool was used to record adolescent health risk behaviors and cross-sectional exit surveys were administered before and after PDA introduction. Setting: Five primary care practices in New England. Participants: The PDA screening was completed by 1052 youth aged 11 to 19 years. In addition youth seen before (n = 65) and after (n = 98) PDA screening implementation completed exit surveys. Intervention: Adolescents completed the PDA screening immediately before the well visit. Branching questions explored risk behaviors in more depth including motivation to change. Physicians viewed the summarized findings before the adolescent health visit. Main Outcome Measures: Health risk behaviors based on PDA data. Exit surveys assessed the quality of the visit and of any discussion of nutrition exercise screen time tobacco use alcohol and other drug use and mood. Results: Multiple risk behaviors (n = 3-9) were reported by 30% of 11- to 14-year-olds and 45% of 15- to 19-year-olds. Exit surveys showed that with PDA use the proportion of visits that included discussions of health risk behaviors increased for fruit/vegetable intake (60.4% vs 41.7% without PDA use P=.03) tobacco use (54.9% vs 40.0% P=.07) and alcohol use (53.9% vs 38.0% P=.05). With PDA use more adolescents rated the visit as confidential (83.7% vs 61.5% P=.002) more thought they were listened to carefully (87.8% vs 64.6% P<.001) and more were very satisfied (87.8% vs 63.1% P<.001). Conclusion: Use of a PDA-based screening tool enhances physician counseling and improves adolescents' perceptions of the well visit.;2009
Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based system for collecting tuberculosis test results and to compare this new system to the previous paper-based system. The PDA- and paper-based systems were evaluated based on processing times frequency of errors and number of work-hours expended by data collectors. Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in 93 health establishments in Peru. Baseline data were collected for 19 months. Districts (n = 4) were then randomly assigned to intervention (PDA) or control (paper) groups and further data were collected for 6 months. Comparisons were made between intervention and control districts and within-districts before and after the introduction of the intervention. Results: The PDA-based system had a significant effect on processing times (p < 0.001) and errors (p = 0.005). In the between-districts comparison the median processing time for cultures was reduced from 23 to 8 days and for smears was reduced from 25 to 12 days. In that comparison the proportion of cultures with delays >90 days was reduced from 9.2% to 0.1% and the number of errors was decreased by 57.1%. The intervention reduced the work-hours necessary to process results by 70% and was preferred by all users. Conclusions: A well-designed PDA-based system to collect data from institutions over a large resource-poor area can significantly reduce delays errors and person-hours spent processing data.

ObjectivesTo evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a handheld personal digital assistant (PDA)-based supplement for maternal Problem-Solving Skills Training (PSST) and to explore Spanish-speaking mothers experiences with it.MethodsMothers (n 197) of children with newly diagnosed cancer were randomized to traditional PSST or PSST PDA 8-week programs. Participants completed the Social Problem-Solving Inventory-Revised Beck Depression Inventory-II Profile of Mood States and Impact of Event Scale-Revised pre- post-treatment and 3 months after completion of the intervention. Mothers also rated optimism logic and confidence in the intervention and technology.ResultsBoth groups demonstrated significant positive change over time on all psychosocial measures. No between-group differences emerged. Despite technological glitches mothers expressed moderately high optimism appreciation for logic and confidence in both interventions and rated the PDA-based program favorably. Technology appealed to all Spanish-speaking mothers with younger mothers showing greater proficiency.ConclusionsWell-designed supported technology holds promise for enhancing psychological interventions.;2009
One of the basic topics of question answering (QA) dialogue systems is how follow-up questions should be interpreted by a QA system. In this paper we shall discuss our experience with the IMIX and Ritel systems for both of which a follow-up question handling scheme has been developed and corpora have been collected. These two systems are each other's opposites in many respects: IMIX is multimodal non-factoid black-box QA while Ritel is speech factoid keyword-based QA. Nevertheless we will show that they are quite comparable and that it is fruitful to examine the similarities and differences. We shall look at how the systems are composed and how real non-expert users interact with the systems. We shall also provide comparisons with systems from the literature where possible and indicate where open issues lie and in what areas existing systems may be improved. We conclude that most systems have a common architecture with a set of common subtasks in particular detecting follow-up questions and finding referents for them. We characterise these tasks using the typical techniques used for performing them and data from our corpora. We also identify a special type of follow-up question the discourse question which is asked when the user is trying to understand an answer and propose some basic methods for handling it.;2009
One of the most promising methods of interacting with small portable computing devices such as personal digital assistants is the use of handwriting. In order to make this communication method more natural we propose to observe visually the writing process on an ordinary paper and to automatically recover the pen trajectory from numerical tablet sequences. On the basis of this work we developed a handwriting recognition system based on visual coding and genetic algorithm GA. The system is applied on Arabic script. In this paper we will present the different steps of the handwriting recognition system. We focus our contribution on the encoding system and the fitness function conception used as basic steps of the GA. A new approach based on visual indices similarity is developed to calculate the evaluation function. We optimize the times cooling of our system to give the final output (proposed words). Several experimentations are developed using an Arabic data set words extracted from LMCA database elaborated in our laboratory by 24 participants. The results obtained are very promising and prove that our new method based on hybridization between visual codes and GA is a powerful method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009
Over six years we iterated on the design of a language for describing the functionality of appliances such as televisions telephones VCRs and copiers. This language has been used to describe more than thirty diverse appliances and these descriptions have been used to automatically generate both graphical and speech user interfaces on handheld computers mobile phones and desktop computers. In this article we describe the final design of our language and analyze the key design choices that led to this design. Through this analysis we hope to provide a useful guide for the designers of future user interface description languages.;2009
Performance of statistical n-gram language models depends heavily on the amount of training text material and the degree to which the training text matches the domain of interest. The language modeling community is showing a growing interest in using large collections of text (obtainable for example from a diverse set of resources on the Internet) to supplement sparse in-domain resources. However in most cases the style and content of the text harvested from the web differs significantly from the specific nature of these domains. In this paper we present a relative entropy based method to select subsets of sentences whose n-gram distribution matches the domain of interest. We present results on language model adaptation using two speech recognition tasks: a medium vocabulary medical domain doctor-patient dialog system and a large vocabulary transcription system for European Parliamentary Plenary Speeches (EPPS). We show that the proposed subset selection scheme leads to performance improvements over state of the art speech recognition systems in terms of both speech recognition word error rate (WER) and language model perplexity (PPL).;2009
Policy learning is an active topic in dialogue systems research but it has not been explored in relation to interactive question answering (IQA). We take a first step in learning adaptive interaction policies for question answering : we address the question of how to acquire enough reliable query constraints how many database results to present to the user and when to present them given the competing trade-offs between the length of the answer list the length of the interaction the type of database and the noise in the communication channel. The operating conditions are reflected in an objective function which we use to derive a hand-coded threshold-based policy and rewards to train a reinforcement learning policy. The same objective function is used for evaluation. We show that we can learn strategies for this complex trade-off problem which perform significantly better than a variety of hand-coded policies for a wide range of noise conditions user types types of DB and turn-penalties. Our policy learning framework thus covers a wide spectrum of operating conditions. The learned policies produce an average relative increase in reward of 86.78% over the hand-coded policies. In 93% of the cases the learned policies perform significantly better than the hand-coded ones (p < .001). Furthermore we show that the type of database has a significant effect on learning and we give qualitative descriptions of the learned IQA policies.;2009
Purpose - The purpose of this article is to present a guiding system with enhanced functionality based upon radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to promote a user friendly experience. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a user survey the paper provides a guiding system using RFID with blog platform for further interaction. An example of this technology was built into a gallery at a college in Taiwan. Findings - This guiding system is defined as pull type because users actively pull the relevant information using RFID readers. With such functionalities users have the opportunity to acquire information using a mobile device about a specific object in a context-aware manner. In addition users can share ideas and comments related to the object on blogs with others who had visited or will visit the object or site. The user survey results showed that visitors seldom met the artists at an exhibition of their works but desired to discuss and shares comments with them and other visitors. The proposed system addressees this need with a blog and the user satisfaction survey confirmed that the proposed system met the requirements. Originality/value - The paper provides a guiding system to enhancing user experience by RFID and blog. The system also builds a channel between the creators of the artworks and others.;2009
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore a conceptual model for analyzing customers' perceptions of using mobile commerce services for online shopping. This paper provides insights into consumer behavior and the results have important implications for designers managers marketers and system providers of mobile shopping (m-shopping) web sites. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical investigation was carried out to test the hypotheses. The samples include 369 professional participants. For testing the relationships of the model structural equation modeling (SEM) is used. Findings - The results demonstrate that anxiety which is an affective barrier against using innovative systems is a key negative predictor of a customer's intentions to use mobile phones. Also the consumer's self-perception of mobile skillfulness significantly affects anxiety enjoyment and usefulness. Furthermore enjoyment usefulness and compatibility have an impact on a customer's behavioral intentions. Practical implications - The findings of this study help to understand what hinders or encourages the m-shopping intention of online customers. Originality/value - The results not only help develop a sophisticated understanding of mobile commerce theories for researchers but they also offer useful knowledge to those involved in promoting m-shopping to potential purchasers. The value of the paper is that the results could be applied to other portable information technology service adoptions such as personal digital assistants (PDA) smart phones advanced mobile phones and portable global positioning systems (GPS).;2009
Purpose of the study: ASyMS(C) is an advanced symptom management system utilising mobile phone technology for patients to report cancer chemotherapy-related symptoms. The aim of this paper is to present health professionals involvement in the development of ASyMS(C) for use with young people (YG) and evaluate their perceptions of the system. Stage 1: Health professionals reviewed the symptoms chosen by young people to be included on the personal digital assistant questionnaire to confirm they would have universal relevance. These included: mouth sores nausea diarrhoea vomiting and weight loss. Stage 2: Health professionals completed a questionnaire prior to the study commencing which suggested they felt ASyMS(C)-YG would give young people control and facilitate timely interventions when symptoms occur. Post-study perceptions were sought through semi-structured interviews and consultation sessions with 23 health professionals. These showed two over-arching themes: young people's symptoms and perceptions of ASyMS(C)-YG and six sub-themes: increased control for young people enhances communication between young people and health professionals and helps with professional early intervention increased support for young people: improve knowledge and understanding technology appealing to young people. Conclusions: This early development work indicates that ASyMS(C)-YG is acceptable to health professionals and their perceptions of the system were overall very positive. Health professionals will continue to be involved in the study through developing self-care guidelines and alert system which will be tested in an exploratory trial (stage 3) and randomised controlled trial (stage 4) in the future.

Reducing data entry error has the potential to improve estimates produced by fisheries practitioners. However the frequencies of data entry error and evaluations of the recommended protocols for dealing with data entry error have rarely been presented in fisheries-related literature. The objectives of our study were to determine the magnitude of data entry error in a typical fisheries data set what kind of errors Occurred most often. and how those errors might affect commonly generated estimates of abundance size structure and species richness. We evaluated four methods of data entry into proofing: (1) a single entry (2) read-aloud proofing.(3)double-entry proofing and (4) field use of it personal digital assistant (PDA). We determined the quality of the data after the use of each method and compared common fisheries estimates derived front each with estimates generated front standardized data. Total error discovered in the data set averaged 0.79 +/- 0.22 % (mean +/- SD) and consisted of 44.1% field-related error and 55.9% data entry errors. We found thin numbers of known errors remaining in the data were significantly lower when proofing methods were ticked. Abundance estimates derived front it single data entry were significantly different front those derived front data thin had undergone proofing. However the magnitude of the difference (2.22%) was less than our limit of acceptable error and Far less than the mean confidence interval of the estimates themselves (60.91%). Further no differences were detected in mark-recapture abundance estimates estimates of size or estimates of species richness. This Suggests thin for most common fisheries estimates a single entry of data or single entry using a PDA is sufficient. We subsequently found thin the use of automated en-or checking helped to ensure an acceptable level of data quality without the time and expense of more traditional error-checking methods.;2009
Research concerning motives for smoking cessation has focused on beliefs (cognitions) that people have especially risk perceptions with less attention directed to worry (negative affect) concerning one's smoking. We tested a manipulation to encourage smokers to think and worry more about their smoking behavior. We contrasted risk perceptions and worry as predictors of contemplation to quit smoking. Smokers were randomly assigned to two conditions in which they carried personal digital assistants for 2 weeks. When signaled smokers read smoking consequence statements or daily hassle statements. After 2 weeks experimental smokers reported greater perceived risk and worry about developing a medical condition compared to control smokers. Both perceived risk and worry independently mediated the relationship between the experimental manipulation and increased contemplation to quit smoking however worry was the strongest mediator in a multiple mediation model. Worry may be foremost for motivating smokers to attempt quitting.;2009
Research has begun to explore the determinants of personal digital assistant (PDA) adoption in health care. Much of this research has however been inconsistent in its treatment of key constructs and its methodological approaches. The current study takes a stricter approach and tracks the pre- and postadoption beliefs of physicians provided with an actual PDA within a single health care facility in the United States. Results show that age position in hospital beliefs about health IT and cluster ownership are significant direct predictors of the physician's preadoption beliefs about PDAs. Contrary to prior research findings both ease of use and usefulness perceptions significantly influenced the physician's intent to adopt PDAs. More important results show that physicians focus on a broader range of PDA factors during preadoption assessment of the technology while actual use is based solely on the PDA's ease of use. Moreover the preadoption usefulness perceptions do not influence postadoption usefulness. Hence the cognitive and affective determinants of intent to use are seemingly different from those used to evaluate PDA use.;2009
Sensor technologies are being introduced as a means to collect the accurate and online information of products in logistics networks. Products with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags can guarantee timely product location visibility. Also additional sensors can measure location dependent attributes such as temperature and humidity. Representative product centric approaches such as EPC Network and the Dialog system make it possible to secure the item level product information automatically and fast. However they leave room for more advanced services especially for active product state tracking service that monitors the locations and attributes of products in a timely manner and triggers exception handling when the constraints associated with the product states are violated. Using state transition model temporal data model and publish/subscribe model this paper proposes an active product state tracking system architecture which is able to track products even when they are enclosed in a box a pallet. or a container. A simulation based experiment is provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2009
Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are now regarded as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The increasing demands for home-based sleep monitoring have prompted studies to develop devices that monitor sleep using fewer sensors. This paper proposes an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based sleep monitoring system that uses a personal digital assistant to display signals and a wireless transmission system. An OSA detection algorithm based only on the overnight-ECG-derived heart-rate-variability low-frequency component (0.02-0.04 Hz) exhibited detection sensitivity of 68.97% and specificity of 100%. This system could meet the future demands of home-based sleep monitoring and thereby reduce the current considerable burdens on hospital sleep centers.;2009
The aim of the French Media project was to define a protocol for the evaluation of speech understanding modules for dialog systems. Accordingly a corpus of 1257 real spoken dialogs related to hotel reservation and tourist information was recorded transcribed and semantically annotated and a semantic attribute-value representation was defined in which each conceptual relationship was represented by the names of the attributes. Two semantic annotation levels are distinguished in this approach. At the first level each utterance is considered separately and the annotation represents the meaning of the statement without taking into account the dialog context. The second level of annotation then corresponds to the interpretation of the meaning of the statement by taking into account the dialog context in this way a semantic representation of the dialog context is defined. This paper discusses the data collection the detailed definition of both annotation levels and the annotation scheme. Then the paper comments on both evaluation campaigns which were carried out during the project and discusses some results.;2009
The aim of the present study was to report the first rehability and validity tests of the remote food photography method (RFPM) which consists of camera-enabled cell phones with data transfer capability. Participants take and transmit photographs of food selection and plate waste to researchers/clinicians for analysis. Following two pilot studies adult participants (n 52 BMI 20-35 kg/m(2) inclusive) were randomly assigned to the dine-in or take-out group. Energy intake (EI) was measured for 3 d. The dine-in group ate lunch and dinner in the laboratory. The take-out group ate lunch in the laboratory and dinner in free-living conditions (participants received a cooler with pre-weighed food that they returned the following morning). El was measured with the RFPM and by directly weighing foods. The RFPM was tested in laboratory and free-living conditions. Reliability was tested over 3 d and validity was tested by comparing directly weighed El to El estimated with the RFPM using Bland-Altman analysis. The RFPM produced reliable El estimates over 3d in laboratory (r 0.62 P<0.0001) and free-living (r 0.68 P<0.0001) conditions. Weighed El correlated highly with El estimated with the RFPM in laboratory and free-living conditions (r > 0.93 P<0.0001). In two laboratory-based validity tests the RFPM underestimated El by -4.7% (P=0.046) and -5.5% (P=0.076). In free-living conditions the RFPM underestimated EI by -6.6% (P=0.017). Bias did not differ by body weight or age. The RFPM is a promising new method for accurately measuring the r El of free-living individuals. Error associated with the method is small compared with self-report methods.;2009
The aim of various approaches implemented whether the classical three Ps'' (presentation practice and production) or communicative language teaching (CLT) is to achieve communicative competence. Although a lot of software developed for teaching spoken English is dressed up to raise interaction its methodology is largely rooted in tradition. Chatterbots based on dialogue management and developed with AI TTS technology and computer animation can engage the learner in computer-simulated human-human conversations. Its natural language social interaction opens new horizons for spoken language teaching/learning. A classroom survey was conducted in which the students showed keen interest and computer-simulated human-human interaction was frequently observed.;2009
The automatic detection tracking and identification of multiple people in intelligent environments are important building blocks on which smart interaction systems can be designed. Those could be e.g. gesture recognizers head pose estimators or far-field speech recognizers and dialog systems. In this paper we present a system which is capable of tracking multiple people in a smart room environment while inferring their identities in a completely automatic and unobtrusive way. It relies on a set of fixed and active cameras to track the users and get close-ups of their faces for identification and on several microphone arrays to determine active speakers and steer the attention of the system. Information coming asynchronously from several sources such as position updates from audio or visual trackers and identification events from identification modules is fused at higher level to gradually refine the room's situation model. The system has been trained on a small set of users and showed good performance at acquiring and keeping their identities in a smart room environment.;2009
The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a common rating system used in clinical trials and longitudinal research projects to rate the presence and severity of cognitive problem.. in Alzheimer disease and related disorders. The interview process requires training and call be time-consuming. Here we describe the validity reliability and discriminative ability of a computer-generated CDR using a personal digital assistant Format. This project used clinical data from 138 archival and live evaluations (patient and informant interviews) collected for research purposes at Washington University to develop and test a software-based system for the administration and automatic scoring of file CDR. The system was programmed for use oil a hand-held computer via the Palm Operating System. We developed domain-specific algorithms to quantify and translate clinical scoring decisions for the 3 cognitive (Memory Orientation Judgment and Problem Solving) and the 3 functional (Community Affairs Home and Hobbies Personal Care) domains of the CDR. An acceptable set of algorithms were developed using data from 104 research cases reflecting a rang-e of impairment levels (CDR 0 to 3) and expert scoring decisions. These algorithms were then tested for accuracy in a validation sample of 34 cases. The computer-generated CDR has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.94 to 0.98) and interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0.88 to 0.96). The computer-generated CDR showed excellent discrimination between demented and nondemented cases (Area Under the curve = 0.95 95% confidence interval 0.84-1.1). The computer-generated CDR using a Palm Operating System is easy to use valid and reliable. The level of agreement compares favorably to published interrater reliability data for the CDR. Software-based administration and automatic scoring of the CDR is a viable alternative to paper-based methods and may be useful in research and clinical settings especially where electronic data management and reliability in scoring are critical.;2009
The cue reactivity (CR) paradigm has been used extensively to assess smokers' craving responses to smoking-related stimuli. To date nearly all CR research has been conducted in laboratory settings there has been no experimental research of the impact of smoking cues on smokers' craving in their natural environment. The present research combined CR procedures with ecological momentary assessment (CREMA) the latter has been used successfully to monitor a variety of behaviors in real time using handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs). Participants were 43 daily heavy smokers ages 18 and older. PDAs were sent home with participants over an 8-day CREMA period. PDAs were used to record each cigarette smoked and to administer daily CR trials. CR stimuli consisted of photographs and imagery scripts that were either smoking related or neutral. CR trials were also administered in the laboratory by means of PDAs at the beginning and end of the CREMA period. Results from CREMA trials indicated that smoking-related cues significantly increased craving compared with neutral cues for both photographs and imagery scripts. This pattern was also observed in the laboratory-based trials. Findings indicate that CREMA is well suited for the investigation of cue-elicited craving under real-world conditions.;2009
The current work will describe an approach to synthesize expressions including intermediate ones via the tools provided in the MPEG-4 standard based on real measurements and on universally accepted assumptions of their meaning taking into account results of Whissel's study. Additionally MPEG-4 facial animation parameters are used in order to evaluate theoretical predictions for intermediate expressions of a given emotion episode based on Scherer's appraisal theory. MPEG-4 FAPs and action units are combined in modeling the effects of appraisal checks on facial expressions and temporal evolution issues of facial expressions are investigated. The results of the synthesizing process can then be applied to Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) rendering their interaction with humans or other ECAs more affective.;2009
The evaluation of spoken dialog systems still relies on subjective interaction experiments for quantifying interaction behavior and user-perceived quality. In this paper we present a simulation approach replacing subjective tests in early system design and evaluation phases. The simulation is based on a model of the system and a probabilistic model of user behavior. Probabilities for the next user action vary in dependence of system features and user characteristics as defined by rules. This way simulations can be conducted before data have been acquired. In order to evaluate the simulation approach characteristics of simulated interactions are compared to interaction corpora obtained in subjective experiments. As was previously proposed in the literature we compare interaction parameters for both corpora and calculate recall and precision of user utterances. The results are compared to those from a comparison of real user corpora. While the real corpora are not equal they are more similar than the simulation is to the real data. However the simulations can predict differences between system versions and user groups quite well on a relative level. In order to derive further requirements for the model we conclude with a detailed analysis of utterances missing in the simulated corpus and consider the believability of entire dialogs.

The impact of sleep restriction on sustained attention in children has not been well quantified. To address this shortcoming this study tested the sensitivity of a 5-min personal digital assistant-psychomotor vigilance task (PDA-PVT) to sleep restriction in 14 female children [mean (SD) age = 10.6 +/- 0.3 years]. The children underwent PDA-PVT trials at regular intervals both before and after a sleep restriction (5 h time-in-bed) and a control (10 h time-in-bed) condition. Sleep restriction was associated with longer mean response times and increased number of lapses. These results are consistent with findings in the adult literature suggesting an association between inadequate sleep and impaired functioning. In conclusion the 5-min PDA-PVT is sensitive to sleep restriction in pre-adolescent female children supporting the utility of the PDA-PVT for examining the impact of sleep deprivation on daytime functioning in children.;2009
The integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology into mobile devices provides them with an awareness of their physical location. This geospatial context can be employed in a wide range of applications including locating nearby places of interest as well as guiding emergency services to incidents. In this research a GPS-enabled Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) is used to create a computerised tree inventory for the management of arboriculture. Using the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) GPS information and arboreal image data are sent to a web-server. An office-based PC running customised Geographical Information Software (GIS) then automatically retrieves the GPS tagged image data for display and analysis purposes. The resulting application allows an expert user to view the condition of individual trees in greater detail than is possible using remotely sensed imagery. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The majority of existing work on agent dialogues considers negotiation persuasion or deliberation dialogues we focus on inquiry dialogues which allow agents to collaborate in order to find new knowledge. We present a general framework for representing dialogues and give the details necessary to generate two subtypes of inquiry dialogue that we define: argument inquiry dialogues allow two agents to share knowledge to jointly construct arguments warrant inquiry dialogues allow two agents to share knowledge to jointly construct dialectical trees (essentially a tree with an argument at each node in which a child node is a counter argument to its parent). Existing inquiry dialogue systems only model dialogues meaning they provide a protocol which dictates what the possible legal next moves are but not which of these moves to make. Our system not only includes a dialogue-game style protocol for each subtype of inquiry dialogue that we present but also a strategy that selects exactly one of the legal moves to make. We propose a benchmark against which we compare our dialogues being the arguments that can be constructed from the union of the agents' beliefs and use this to define soundness and completeness properties that we show hold for all inquiry dialogues generated by our system.;2009
The objective of this study was to examine the factors that might influence the use of personal digital assistant devices (PDAs) by physicians for assistance in the delivery of their routine patient care. An Internet-based single-institution survey was done of internal medicine resident physicians. None of the baseline demographic characteristics measured were associated with whether PDAs were being used or not by resident physicians in patient care. Resident physicians who used their PDAs for medical purposes perceived more benefits associated with the use of PDAs and fewer barriers than did those who did not own a PDA or owned one but did not use it for medical purposes. Among regular users of PDAs for medical purposes greater frequency of use in patient care was associated with more positive perceptions of the devices. Some associations were also found between residents' self-reported standardized test scores and the type of information resources being used on their device. Similar to previous studies the majority of those in this cohort owned PDAs and most of those who owned one used it for assistance in delivery of their patient care. It is concluded that users of PDAs for medical purposes differ from nonusers in certain attitudes and opinions and standardized test scores may correlate with different patterns of use. These results may be useful in helping medical leaders overcome barriers to more full adoption of PDAs as a tool for effective patient care.;2009
The paper presents the development of a mobile maintenance support system based on web and mobile device technologies i.e. personal digital assistant. The architecture relies on a shop floor system and a supporting system in a diagnostic center. The shop floor system is supported by a mobile device which helps the maintenance engineer to perform maintenance tasks. This gives great support to the maintenance engineer as it facilitates the access to decision-making support work order and spare part handling modules etc. that are available in the device. The diagnostic center provides the maintenance engineer with decision support for his various tasks when needed. Moreover a database table listener agent located at the database server was developed to keep track of the maintenance engineer's work orders at a certain priority level. The proposed approach can reduce the maintenance costs and solve the problem of the unavailability of an expert. More efficient maintenance is believed to be achieved through the use of web and agent technologies since data maintenance systems and processing can be gathered and integrated and data can be acquired from additional sources when necessary. The proposed system the web and embedded technologies as well as remote communication were tested successfully.;2009
The Personal Digital Assistance for Guideline Adherence (GLAD Heart) study was designed to test a strategy to improve quality of care through increased adherence to ATPIII cholesterol guidelines. This paper describes the overall study design including the multi-faceted intervention and outcome measures. Sixty-one primary care practices in NC were recruited and randomized to either a personal digital assistant-based cholesterol management intervention or an intervention similar in intensity and frequency of contact but focused on a hypertension clinical practice guideline. Installation and implementation of the technology intervention was challenging. Over the course of the study there were 74 technical issues requiring assistance for the palm pilot from 23 participating practices. The GLAD Heart project was. completed successfully with some impact on cholesterol management. Technology has the potential to improve the quality of care provided in the healthcare setting. However potentially expensive interventions such as that conducted in GLAD Heart should undergo rigorous testing to assure their efficacy before widespread adoption. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The present study examined the PDA menu navigation performance of younger and older adults. The research focus was directed to the understanding of the combination and interaction of user characteristics with PDA menu navigation performance. In order to detail individual factors that influence user's performance users' age spatial ability verbal memory the confidence to use technical devices and computer-expertise were studied and related to performance outcomes. Younger and older adults experienced with the usage of different technical devices but PDA novices had to complete four common tasks in the digital diary of an emulated PDA and users' effectiveness and efficiency were surveyed. Even though the users of both age groups had a comparably high computer experience participants had considerable difficulties to solve the PDA tasks successfully. Especially older adults were strongly disadvantaged when navigating through the PDA menu. Among the user characteristics which were revealed to be essential for performance spatial abilities were the best predictor to explain PDA performance. In addition an adequate mental representation of the PDA data structure was decisive for navigation performance especially in the older adult group.;2009
The present study examines the role of mobile technology in promoting campus-wide learning environment. Its main objectives were to a) evaluate the role of mobile technology in higher education in terms of its i). appropriateness ii). flexibility iii). Interactivity & iv). availability & usefulness and to b). identify the problems of students with mobile technology. The population of the study consisted of all the Ph.D scholars (N=83) and faculty (N=10) of the Department of Education International Islamic University Islamabad. The samples of the study comprised of 100% of both the populations. The study was descriptive in nature therefore survey approach was considered appropriate. The researchers used questionnaires as research tools developed on five point rating (likert) scale to collect the data from the respondents (students and faculty respectively). The researchers personally administered the finalized research tools (through pilot testing) to the respondents to collect the data. The data collected was analyzed through applying the mean score and percentage and main findings were (i) 92% of the respondents (students and faculty) were of the opinion that mobile technology is appropriate for effective communication and interaction (ii). 94% of the respondents ((students and faculty) were of the view that mobile technology promotes flexible interactive learning environment (iii). 93% of the respondents (students) supported that they do face problems with technology. Keeping in view these findings it was concluded that mobile technology is appropriate for research and education throughout the campus as it promotes effective interaction among faculty and scholars.;2009
The proliferation of portable electronic products such as cellular telephones and personal digital assistants has created a high demand for small format liquid crystal displays (LCD) with increasing bit resolution. The electronic drivers for these display applications must adhere to stringent power and area budgets. This paper describes a low-power area efficient scalable digital-analog conversion (DAC) integrated circuit architecture optimized for driving small format LCDs. A 12 channel 9-bit DAC driver based on this architecture implemented in 0.5 mu m CMOS technology and suitable for 1/4 VGA resolution displays exhibited a 2 MSPS conversion rate 252 mu W power dissipation per channel using a 5 V supply and a per DAC die area of 0.042 mm(2). This performance sets a new standard for DAC display drivers in joules per bit areal density at less than 0.58 pJ per bit per mm(2).;2009
The proliferation of wireless and mobile devices such as personal digital assistants and mobile phones has created a large demand for mobile software applications such as social networking software. in addition the realization and widespread usage of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking have drastically increased the number of applications utilizing these technologies. The convergence of mobile and P2P networking have generated increasing interest in the mobile peer-to-peer (MP2P) community. In this paper we describe the design and development of a mobile social software (MoSoSo) based on a P2P network architecture using juxtapose (JXTA) and juxtapose for Java MicroEdition (JXME). The MoSoSo application allows users to discover communicate and share resources with one another. We present three facets of designing the MoSoSo: object-oriented software design network infrastructure design and user-interface design. The software has been fully implemented and tested on a variety of mobile devices for use in a campus setting. By studying the design and implementation of the MoSoSo we hope to benefit the entire mobile application development community by providing common models and insights into developing MP2P software.

The purpose of the Study was to compare the proportion of obesity-related diagnoses in clinical encounters (N = 1874) documented by nurses using a personal digital assistant-based log with and without obesity decision support features. The experimental group encounters in the randomized controlled trial had significantly more (P = .000) obesity-related diagnoses (11.3%) than did the control group encounters (1%) and a significantly lower false negative rate (24.5% vs 66.5% P = .000). The study findings provide evidence that integration of a decision support feature that automatically calculates an obesity-related diagnosis increases diagnoses and decreases missed diagnoses and suggest that such systems have the potential to improve the quality of obesity-related care.;2009
The topic of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has been gathering more and more scientific attention of late. A very important but often undervalued area in this field is human engagement. That is a person's commitment to take part in and continue the interaction. In this paper we describe work on a humor-equipped casual conversational system (chatterbot) and investigate the effect of humor on a user's engagement in the conversation. A group of users was made to converse with two systems: one with and one without humor. The chat logs were then analyzed using an emotive analysis system to check user reactions and attitudes towards each system. Results were projected on Russell's two-dimensional emotiveness space to evaluate the positivity/negativity and activation/deactivation of these emotions. This analysis indicated emotions elicited by the humor-equipped system were more positively active and less negatively active than by the system without humor. The implications of results and relation between them and user engagement in the conversation are discussed. We also propose a distinction between positive and negative engagement.;2009
The trend towards point-of-care and the advance in mobile technologies bring the potential to employ Mobile Nursing Information Systems (MNIS) in nursing care routines. However adopting the MNIS is not simply a case of purchasing the required hardware and software but rather a social interaction process between users organizations and the environment. Therefore this study developed a framework of twelve factors affecting the decision to adopt/not to adopt the MNIS in the nursing department and tested it from the perspective of the nursing administrators. A mail survey was conducted to collect the opinions of 84 nursing administrators and a discriminant analysis was used to identify the critical factors for the adoption/non-adoption of the MNIS. Business competition external suppliers' support and internal needs were identified as being significantly associated with the adoption of MNIS. Potential adopters can apply the results of this study as a reference when making the adoption decision regarding MNIS while non-adopters and vendors can examine the resistance to MNIS.;2009
The use of information and communication technologies to support collaborative management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and associated symptoms is particularly appealing since most people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease continue to experience dyspnea despite optimal medical therapy and therefore must engage in the long-term tasks of self-management. Exercise is an effective therapy to reduce dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this article was to describe our process of developing a set of integrated tools to support collaborative symptom and exercise monitoring for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This process could be followed by other researchers and clinicians interested in developing collaborative management tools for other chronic conditions. User-centered design principles guided the 4-phase development process of a set of integrated tools for self-symptom management. The usability challenges uncovered during the field testing were mostly minor and were easily corrected. Patients had a strong preference for a calendar-like display of completed exercise coupled with simultaneous goal viewing. Field usability testing showed that the integrated set of tools was relatively easy to learn efficient to use and with minimal errors and has a high level of user satisfaction. An iterative multimodal process is essential to successful development of acceptable Web-based tools for self-management in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;2009
The variability observed in handwriting patterns is analyzed from the perspective of integrating the resulting motor control knowledge in the design of more powerful handwriting recognizers in personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones. Using the highest representational level of the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movement the Sigma-Lognormal model this article reports basic theoretical and practical results that could be taken into account in the design of such systems. The main movement variability introduced by the neuromuscular system (NMS) and induced through the scheduling of motor tasks by the central nervous system (CNS) is divided into global and local fluctuations. From a fiducial action plan decoded by this model a wide range of handwriting distortions are artificially generated by acting on the Sigma-Lognormal parameters. The resulting patterns are studied to understand scale changes and rotational deformations the two basic features that a recognizer has to take into account. An experiment based on the writing of the same word by six writers is also reported. The results obtained by an ANOVA analysis corroborate the predictions and support the relevance of the Kinematic Theory for the analysis and synthesis of handwriting disruptions. These findings consolidate the results of previous studies on single strokes using the Sigma-Lognormal model. Overall this report provides new insights into our understanding of motor control as well as into practical cues for the development of huge databases of letters and words to train and test on-line handwriting classifiers and recognizers.

There has been a great deal of media attention paid to high profile losses of data such as the UK HR Revenue and Customs (HMRC) loss of the personal records of 25 Million people in 2CDs the TJX (the parent company of TJ MAXX) loss of 40 million customer account records and the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loss of information on more than half a million people. While these spectacular failures are certainly newsworthy they have in some ways diverted attention from the underlying issues. What remains almost unreported is the levels and types of information that are given away on a daily basis when equipment that contains digital storage media such as computers Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) mobile phones etc. is disposed of at the end of its useful life. Over the last four years research has been carried out to determine the level of information that individuals and organisations inadvertently give away when they dispose of computers and hand-held devices such as mobile (cell) phones RIM Blackberries and PDAs. This research has been carried out by an industry/academic collaboration led by British Telecommunications with academic partners at Edith Cowan University in Perth Australia the University of Glamorgan in Wales and Longwood University in Virginia USA. The results of the research which has now examined more than 1000 computer disks and 160 hand-held devices have provided an insight into the very poor protection that both organisations and individuals give to data when they dispose of these types of equipment. It has given an indication of the effect that the availability of this information is likely to have in causing data breaches and will provide personnel involved in incident response and management with indicative data of the type of information that may be lost in an incident and allow them to plan suitable measures to mitigate the effects. It will also be of interest to those involved in digital forensics as it provides an indication of the likelihood of information being available on devices being examined and the steps that have been taken in attempts to remove it.

This article describes the application of computational models of spatial prepositions to visually situated dialog systems. In these dialogs spatial prepositions are important because people often use them to refer to entities in the visual context of a dialog. We first describe a generic architecture for a visually situated dialog system and highlight the interactions between the spatial cognition module which provides the interface to the models of prepositional semantics and the other components in the architecture. Following this we present two new computational models of topological and projective spatial prepositions. The main novelty within these models is the fact that they account for the contextual effect which other distractor objects in a visual scene can have on the region described by a given preposition. We next present psycholinguistic tests evaluating our approach to distractor interference on prepositional semantics and illustrate how these models are used for both interpretation and generation of prepositional expressions.;2009
This article presents an empirical study to determine the optimal size of a box for the input of handwriting characters on personal digital assistants (PDAs). The experiments involve the consideration of boxes for different kinds of characters different box sizes and shapes (square and rectangular) different user postures and the age differences of users. The results are assessed in terms of high performance (high character recognition rates minimal stroke protrusions outside the character box minimal number of error corrections minimum writing time) and subjective ratings (e.g. ease of writing and minimum degree of fatigue). The results show that the optimal size of character boxes for the input of alphanumeric characters is 12 x 14 mm (rectangular) whereas for Kanji (Chinese characters) mixed with Kana characters and for Hiragana Katakana characters the optimal size is 14 x 14 mm (square). We believe that knowledge of the optimal size of character input boxes will be useful for the design of user interfaces on PDAs.;2009
This paper addresses the problem of multi-domain spoken language understanding (SLU) where domain detection and domain-dependent semantic tagging problems are combined. We present a transfer learning approach to the multi-domain SLU problem in which multiple domain-specific data sources can be incorporated. To implement multi-domain SLU with transfer learning we introduce a triangular-chain structured model. This model effectively learns multiple domains in parallel and allows use of domain-independent patterns among domains to create a better model for the target domain. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline models on dialog data for multi-domain SLU problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2009
This paper analyses the experience of a teacher and her Year 6 class (10-11 year-olds) over a school year while participating in a pilot project introducing Personal Digital Assistants as a learning tool. The intervention was initiated and supported by the local City Learning Centre which was concerned with how best to use technologies for learning and the teacher was prepared to take risks to learn how to use the technology and apply it within the national curriculum. This paper focuses on the roles the teacher played in designing managing and mediating multi-modal approaches to teaching and learning while meeting the curriculum requirements. Her creative approach was rewarded with high levels of student engagement motivation and autonomy across the class and higher than expected results in the national tests.;2009
This paper describes a temperature management system for a deformable mirrors of piezo-actuated display package (PADP). This package which is integrated in microbeam projectors is used in portable devices such as cellphones laptops and personal digital assistants (PDAs) to name a few. Ambient temperature change is a critical factor affecting the performance of PADR To reduce this effect of ambient temperature change a temperature control system using a microheater and a temperature feedback circuit is developed. A computational model of the transient thermal analysis for the feedback control system is also developed. The obtained theoretical results are in a good agreement with the experimental measurements. Under this controlled system the magnitude of the temperature fluctuation is reduced by +/- 0.5 degrees C. In order to enhance the performance of the developed system various values of the temperature sensor resistance are used leading to a reduction of about 10% of the temperature fluctuation.

This paper describes a Ubiquitous Performance Support System for Teachers (UPSST) and its implementation model. Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) were used as the platform to support high-school teachers. Based on concepts of Electronic Performance Support Systems and design-based research the authors conducted an iterative process of analysis design development and evaluation. Besides the data collected from the two initial users during the iterative process 12 teachers were recruited for evaluating the functions and interface design of the UPSST. The participants mostly reported positive attitudes toward the functions and interface but some expressed concerns. Explanations of the concerns and suggestions for future studies are provided.;2009
This paper describes an attempt to automate the large-scale assessment of oral language proficiency and listening comprehension for fairly advanced students of English as a second language. The automatic test is implemented as a spoken dialogue system and consists of a reading as well as a repeating task. Two experiments are described in which different rating criteria were used by human judges. In the first experiment proficiency was scored globally for each of the two test components. In the second experiment various aspects of proficiency were evaluated for each section of the test. In both experiments rate of speech (ROS) goodness of pronunciation (GOP) and repeat accuracy were calculated for the spoken utterances. The correlation between scores assigned by human raters and these three automatically derived measures was determined to assess their suitability as proficiency indicators. Results show that the more specific rating instructions used in the second experiment improved intra-rater agreement but made little difference to inter-rater agreement. In addition the more specific rating criteria resulted in a better correlation between the human and the automatic scores for the repeating task but had almost no impact in the reading task. Overall the results indicate that even for the narrow range of proficiency levels observed in the test population the automatically derived ROS and accuracy scores give a fair indication of oral proficiency.

This paper describes two systems using embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for language learning. The first system called Ville is a virtual language teacher for vocabulary and pronunciation training. The second system a dialogue system called DEAL is a role-playing game for practicing conversational skills. Whereas DEAL acts as a conversational partner with the objective of creating and keeping an interesting dialogue Ville takes the role of a teacher who guides encourages and gives feedback to the students.

This paper discusses the discourse understanding process in spoken dialogue systems. This process enables a system to understand user utterances from the context of a dialogue. Ambiguity in user utterances caused by multiple speech recognition hypotheses and parsing results sometimes makes it difficult for a system to decide on a single interpretation of a user intention. As a solution the idea of retaining possible interpretations as multiple dialogue states and resolving the ambiguity using succeeding user utterances has been proposed. Although this approach has proven to improve discourse understanding accuracy carefully created hand-crafted rules are necessary in order to accurately rank the dialogue states. This paper proposes automatically ranking multiple dialogue states using statistical information obtained from dialogue corpora. The experimental results in the train ticket reservation and weather information service domains show that the statistical information can significantly improve the ranking accuracy of dialogue states as well as the slot accuracy and the concept error rate of the top-ranked dialogue states.;2009
This paper investigates a conformal antenna for the ingestible biotelemetric capsule system. This system has the potential to provide real-time biological information from within the human body via a radio frequency link. The balanced planar meandered dipole (concept used for antenna miniaturization through space-filling) is discussed along with the offset planar meandered dipole which facilitates better matching. The conformal chandelier meandered dipole antenna (CCMDA) which is an extension of the offset planar meandered dipole and envelopes the capsule surface is then investigated. The return loss input impedance and radiation pattern characteristics of the CCMDA are discussed in detail at the operating frequency of 1.4 GHz. Additionally electrical components (specifically the batteries) are modeled inside the capsule to investigate their effects on the conformal antenna performance in free space. The capsule antenna is then inserted into a simple box model (a simplification of the human torso) and a 4-mm precision human-body model (Ansoft) where the detuning effects are observed and discussed. Finally a circularly polarized receiver antenna design consisting of orthogonal dipoles is suggested which provides polarization diversity and is miniaturized to fit into a personal digital assistant (PDA) for portability of the data telemetric link.;2009
This paper presents an innovatory system for controlling the emotional state of an embodied conversational agent. Unlike other existing models our system is fast adaptable to different application domains and it is highly interpretable. This will provide specialists with a tool to easily test their hypotheses about the most suitable emotional attitude for an agent in a specific domain. it also provides emotional stability and dynamic and automatic behavior orientation which will result in the design of more believable conversational agents that behave as humans do.

This paper presents information on re-developing an outcome evaluation for a state-funded program providing service coordination utilizing wraparound to youth with severe emotional disturbance (SED) and their families. Originally funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation the Kentucky IMPACT program has existed statewide since 1990. Changing data needs and limitations of the original evaluation required revamping the program's data collection system. The new evaluation uses the extant knowledge base to improve: (1) design (2) measures and (3) utility. A pre-post design with Multiple follow-ups provides the framework for data collection. An ecological framework provides a conceptual structure for selecting measures focusing on both the service recipients and their environment. Data collection via a personal digital assistant (PDA) ensures utility of the data for both consumers and researchers. Issues ranging from conceptualization to implementation of the project as well as lessons learned are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved;2009
This paper proposes a generic dialog modeling framework for a multi-domain dialog system to simultaneously manage goal-oriented and chat dialogs for both information access and entertainment. We developed a dialog modeling technique using an example-based approach to implement multiple applications such as car navigation weather information TV program guidance and chatbot. Example-based dialog modeling (EBDM) is a simple and effective method for prototyping and deploying of various dialog systems. This paper also introduces the system architecture of multi-domain dialog systems using the EBDM framework and the domain spotting technique. In our experiments we evaluate our system using both simulated and real users. We expect that our approach can support flexible management of multi-domain dialogs on the same framework.

This paper proposes a home automation System using a PDA(Personal Digital Assistants)-based intelligent robot system architecture which consists of three layers: a user layer a manager layer and an action layer. In the user layer users manage and control the robot and get visual information via the remote monitoring system. In the case of showing maps with the status of the robot synchronization is very important. In the manager layer there are three parts a server part a home appliances part and a slot-age part. The server part manages all the status information of the house the home appliances part controls all appliances and the storage system stores all the status information of the house. In the action layer the main robot system uses a PDA instead of a computer. As a PDA has limited performance simple algorithms are required It has an intelligent functional engine for SLAM(Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) and vision processing. We have developed the PDA-based mobile robot system for home automation based on this architecture in order to verify its efficiency.;2009
This paper proposes a novel integrated dialog simulation technique for evaluating spoken dialog systems. A data-driven user simulation technique for simulating user intention and utterance is introduced. A novel user intention modeling and generating method is proposed that uses a linear-chain conditional random field and a two-phase data-driven domain-specific user utterance Simulation method and a linguistic knowledge-based ASR channel simulation method are also presented. Evaluation metrics are introduced to measure the quality of user simulation at intention and utterance. Experiments using these techniques were carried out to evaluate the performance and behavior of dialog systems designed for car navigation dialogs and a building guide robot and it turned out that Our approach was easy to set tip and showed similar tendencies to real human users.

This paper proposes a remote vital signs monitoring system which integrates wireless body area network (WBAN) and personal digital assistant (PDA) phone technology. Four different physiological signs e. g. ECG SpO(2) temperature and blood pressure can be continuously acquired or derived from two wireless sensor nodes-ECG sensor and integrated SpO(2)/temperature sensor. Once sentinel events happened or there quest to real-time display vital signs is confirmed all physiological signs and critical indices will be immediately transmitted to patient's PDA phone through Bluetooth and further relayed to doctor's PDA phone through global system for mobile communication (GSM) technology. A prototype of such system has been successfully developed and implemented which will offer high standard of healthcare with a major reduction in cost for our society.

This paper reports our implementation and evaluation of a wireless handheld learning environment used to support a clinical nursing practicum course. The learning environment was designed so that nursing students could use handhelds for recording information organizing ideas assessing patients and also for interaction and collaboration with peers during an on-site clinical practicum. Our wireless handheld learning environment was field tested during a three-week practicum session. Analysis of data showed that both the instructor and the student benefited from using the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) environment. The handhelds not only provided students with scaffolds to enhance learning but also facilitated peer cooperation and interaction with the instructor. Issues resulted from our implementation included things like the capacity of handhelds network access and participants' preconceptions on using PC-based systems.;2009

This pilot study examined the feasibility of an interactive obesity prevention program delivered to a class of fourth-grade students utilizing daily e-mail messages sent to the students' home computers. The study involved a single intact class of 22 students 17 (77%) of whom submitted parental permission documentation and received e-mail messages each school day over the course of one month. Concerns regarding Internet safety and children's use of e-mail were addressed fairly easily. Cost/benefit issues for the school did not seem prohibitive. Providing e-mail access to students without a home computer was accomplished by loaning them personal digital assistant (PDA) devices. In larger interventions loaning PDAs is probably not feasible economically although cell phones may be an acceptable alternative. It was concluded that this type of interactive obesity prevention program is feasible from most perspectives. Data from a larger scale effectiveness study is still needed.;2009
This study presents the design and development of a novel mobile wireless system to be used for monitoring seismic events and related electromagnetic signals employing smart mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and wireless communication technologies such as wireless local area networks (WLANs) general packet radio service (GPRS) and universal mobile telecommunications system (LIMTS). The proposed system enables scientists to access critical data while being geographically independent of the sites of data sources rendering it as a useful tool for preliminary scientific analysis.

This study used both survey and interview questionnaires. It was designed to assess the feasibility usability and utility of two point-of-care tools especially prepared with information relevant for dementia care by staff nurses in a small a medium-sized and a large nursing home in Florida. Twenty-five LPN or RN nurses were recruited for the study of their use of one of the toolseither a set of pocket cards (used by the control group) or a pocket PC (used by the experimental group). The findings of our study indicate that personal digital assistants (PDAs) can potentially improve long-term care clinicians' effectiveness and efficiency at work resulting in better patient care for nursing home residents.;2009
This work focuses on the development of expressive text-to-speech synthesis techniques for a Chinese spoken dialog system where the expressivity is driven by the message content. We adapt the three-dimensional pleasure-displeasure arousal-nonarousal and dominance-submissiveness (PAD) model for describing expressivity in input text semantics. The context of our study is based on response messages generated by a spoken dialog system in the tourist information domain. We use the (pleasure) and (arousal) dimensions to describe expressivity at the prosodic word level based on lexical semantics. The (dominance) dimension is used to describe expressivity at the utterance level based on dialog acts. We analyze contrastive (neutral versus expressive) speech recordings to develop a nonlinear perturbation model that incorporates the PAD values of a response message to transform neutral speech into expressive speech. Two levels of perturbations are implemented-local perturbation at the prosodic word level as well as global perturbation at the utterance level. Perceptual experiments involving 14 subjects indicate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance expressivity in response generation for a spoken dialog system.;2009
To quantify the time required for nurses to complete the medication administration process in long-term care (LTC). Time-motion methods were used to time all steps in the medication administration process. LTC units that differed according to case mix (physical support behavioral care dementia care and continuing care) in a single facility in Ontario Canada. Regular and temporary nurses who agreed to be observed. Seven predefined steps interruptions and total time required for the medication administration process were timed using a personal digital assistant. One hundred forty-one medication rounds were observed. Total time estimates were standardized to 20 beds to facilitate comparisons. For a single medication administration process the average total time was 62.0 +/- 4.9 minutes per 20 residents on physical support units 84.0 +/- 4.5 minutes per 20 residents on behavioral care units and 70.0 +/- 4.9 minutes per 20 residents on dementia care units. Regular nurses took an average of 68.0 +/- 4.9 minutes per 20 residents to complete the medication administration process and temporary nurses took an average of 90.0 +/- 5.4 minutes per 20 residents. On continuing care units which are organized differently because of the greater severity of residents' needs the medication administration process took 9.6 +/- 3.2 minutes per resident. Interruptions occurred in 79% of observations and accounted for 11.5% of the medication administration process. Time requirements for the medication administration process are substantial in LTC and are compounded when nurses are unfamiliar with residents. Interruptions are a major problem potentially affecting the efficiency quality and safety of this process.;2009
Traditionally social interaction research has concentrated on either fully virtually embodied agents (e.g. embodied conversational agents) or fully physically embodied agents (e.g. robots). For some time however both areas have started augmenting their agents' capabilities for social interaction using ubiquitous and intelligent environments. We are placing different agent systems for social interaction along Milgram's Reality-Virtuality Continuum-according to the degree they are embodied in a physical virtual or mixed reality environment-and show systems that follow the next logical step in this progression namely social interaction in the middle of Milgram's continuum that is agents richly embodied in the physical and virtual world. This paper surveys the field of social interaction research with embodied agents with a particular view towards their embodiment forms and highlights some of the advantages and issues associated with the very recent field of social interaction with mixed reality agents.;2009
Understanding consumers' upgrading behavior is essential to product planning. Product managers would like to know what fraction of customers would upgrade to new and improved versions and how fast. This paper presents a method to forecast the sales path of an improved version of a high-technology product defined in terms of its price path and multiattribute product specification. The approach is potentially useful to managers to answer what-if questions on the effects of alternative price paths and product specifications of the upgrade on when and what fraction of customers will upgrade. By doing such analysis for several product options under consideration managers can choose the best feature specification and price path for the upgrade. The proposed approach integrates an individual-level conjoint utility model with a hazard function specification. The first stage of estimation (i.e. conjoint analysis) measures individual-level multiattribute utility functions and the second stage ( i.e. duration analysis) calibrates the coefficients of predictor variables of the time to upgrade via maximum likelihood. An illustrative application in the personal digital assistant (PDA) category confirms the predictive validity and potential usefulness of the proposed approach. Among the empirical findings are that higher upgrade costs and expectation of faster product improvement tend to delay buyers' upgrading decisions. The roles of other predictor variables such as product category characteristics consumer characteristics and peer pressure were also confirmed.;2009
Unlike computer games where Non-Player-Character avatars are common in most virtual worlds they are the exception. Deploying an embodied AI into a virtual world offers a unique opportunity to evaluate embodied AIs and to develop them within an environment where human and computer are on almost equal terms. This paper presents an architecture being used for the deployment of chatbot driven avatars within the Second Life virtual world looks at the challenges of deploying an AI within such a virtual world the possible implications for the Turing Test and identifies research directions for the future.

Visual-cognitive loads influence the effectiveness of word prediction technology. Adjusting parameters of word prediction programs can lessen visual-cognitive loads. This study evaluated the benefits of WordQ word prediction software for users' performance when the prediction window was moved to a personal digital assistant (PDA) device placed at the keyboard level. Twenty-one young people aged 11-14 (11 new users and 10 experienced users) participated in the study. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure was used to measure users' self-ratings of performance and satisfaction. Results of two-tailed paired t-tests reveal significantly (p < .05) higher performance and satisfaction ratings when the word prediction list was displayed on the PDA. Users reported that it was easier to look for the words at the keyboard level and to select words directly from the PDA. Visual comparisons of the users' typing speed and accuracy show that experienced users had faster typing rates and new users appeared to have better accuracy when they typed with WordQ on the PDA display. Further studies with larger samples of individuals with different diagnoses and ages are required to confirm the benefit of using a PDA display in enhancing typing rate and accuracy.;2009
We apply socio-technical theories to explain and predict technological choices and use by humanitarian relief and development organizations. This research examines the organizational context of using a personal digital assistant (PDA) in the field to collect data. We identify organizational factors at multiple levels that are likely to influence a field-based PDA data collection initiative in the context of a large international non-governmental organization. This research differs from existing studies that have documented different effects of information and communication technology on various organization levels when information technology (IT) is deployed throughout the organization. The research suggests that despite being motivated by upper levels of the organization the middle levels of the organization (the country offices) are most affected by the IT implementation. We assert that the motivations for changes made to the technological systems and/or devices used by a multi-level organization will produce significant social/organizational changes at each level of the organization. We also claim that the motivations for technological change in organizations that stem from the top layers of that organization are likely to produce beneficial changes for the top layers of that organization. Intermediate and bottom layers will experience a mix of changes with some being negative and some unintended for the respective layers.;2009
We describe a detailed cross-sectional self-report time study of laboratory physician tasks in a regionalized multisite academic setting using custom data collection templates programmed into personal digital assistants (PDAs). The 7-week study was completed by 56 medical and scientific staff (86% participation rate). Participants recorded 12781 PDA entries of specific tasks completed during the study period The mean number of entries per worked day per participant was 8.14 (range 1.96-14.33). Study results demonstrated that professional staff worked on average 53.5 hours per week. Percentage work time spent in each activity area was as follows: clinical direct 50.6% administration 18.5% clinical indirect 9.5% research 8.2% learning/continuing education 5.3% teaching 4.9% and quality assurance 3.1%. These percentages varied significantly by laboratory medicine subspecialty and by type of academic appointment. The findings confirm that activities not directly involved with patient care such as administration quality assurance teaching research and professional development typically occupy 40% to 50% of a laboratory physician's time.;2009
We describe a system that automatically learns effective and engaging dialogue strategies generated from a library or dialogue content using reinforcement learning from user feedback. Besides the more usual clarification and verification components of dialogue this library contains various social elements like greetings apologies small talk relational questions and jokes. We tested the method through an experimental dialogue system that encourages take-up of exercise and shows that the learned dialogue policy performs as well as one built by human experts for this system.;2009
We evaluated two strategies for alleviating working memory load for users of voice interfaces: presenting fewer options per turn and providing confirmations. Forty-eight users booked appointments using nine different dialogue systems which varied in the number of options presented and the confirmation strategy used. Participants also performed four cognitive tests and rated the usability of each dialogue system on a standardised questionnaire. When systems presented more options per turn and avoided explicit confirmation subdialogues both older and younger users booked appointments more quickly without compromising task success. Users with lower information processing speed were less likely to remember all relevant aspects of the appointment. Working memory span did not affect appointment recall. Older users were slightly less satisfied with the dialogue systems than younger users. We conclude that the number of options is less important than an accurate assessment of the actual cognitive demands of the task at hand. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2009
We explore the relationship between question answering and constraint relaxation in spoken dialogue systems and develop dialogue strategies for selecting and presenting information succinctly. In particular we describe methods for dealing with the results of database queries in information-seeking dialogues. Our goal is to structure the dialogue in such a way that the user is neither overwhelmed with information nor left uncertain as to how to refine the query further. We present two sets of evaluation results for a restaurant selection task: one is a system performance evaluation experiment involving twenty subjects the other is an experimental evaluation of the use of suggestions involving sixteen subjects.;2009
We obtained recommendations for a graphical user interface (GUI) design for a new medical monitoring system. Data were obtained from 26 combat-experienced medics. Volunteers were briefed on the medical monitoring system. They then completed a questionnaire on background medical treatment experience provided drawings on how and what information should be displayed on the GUI screens for use on a personal digital assistant and participated in focus group sessions with four to seven medics per group to obtain group consensus on what information the GUI screens should contain. Detailed displays on seven screens provide the medical and situational awareness information medics need for triage decisions and for early processing of a casualty. The created GUI screens are a combination of object-based and text-based information using a color-coded system. Medics believed the information displayed with these GUI designs would improve treatment of casualties on the battlefield.;2009
We propose a new Web page transformation method to facilitate Web browsing on handheld devices such as Personal Digital Assistants ( PDAs). In our approach an original Web page that does not fit on the screen is transformed into a set of subpages each of which fits on the screen. This transformation is done through slicing the original page into page blocks iteratively with several factors considered. These factors include the size of the screen the size of each page block the number of blocks in each transformed page the depth of the tree hierarchy that the transformed pages form as well as the semantic coherence between blocks. We call the tree hierarchy of the transformed pages an SP-tree. In an SP-tree an internal node consists of a textually enhanced thumbnail image with hyperlinks and a leaf node is a block extracted from a subpage of the original Web page. We adaptively adjust the fanout and the height of the SP-tree so that each thumbnail image is clear enough for users to read while at the same time the number of clicks needed to reach a leaf page is few. Through this transformation algorithm we preserve the contextual information in the original Web page and reduce scrolling. We have implemented this transformation module on a proxy server and have conducted usability studies on its performance. Our system achieved a shorter task completion time compared with that of transformations from the Opera browser in nine of ten tasks. The average improvement on familiar pages was 44%. The average improvement on unfamiliar pages was 37%. Subjective responses were positive.;2009
We propose a novel approach to developing a tractable affective dialogue model for probabilistic frame-based dialogue systems. The affective dialogue model based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and Dynamic Decision Network (DDN) techniques is composed of two main parts: the slot-level dialogue manager and the global dialogue manager. It has two new features: (1) being able to deal with a large number of slots and (2) being able to take into account some aspects of the user's affective state in deriving the adaptive dialogue strategies. Our implemented prototype dialogue manager can handle hundreds of slots where each individual slot might have hundreds of values. Our approach is illustrated through a route navigation example in the crisis management domain. We conducted various experiments to evaluate our approach and to compare it with approximate POMDP techniques and handcrafted policies. The experimental results showed that the DDN-POMDP policy outperforms three handcrafted policies when the user's action error is induced by stress as well as when the observation error increases. Further performance of the one-step look-ahead DDN-POMDP policy after optimizing its internal reward is close to state-of-the-art approximate POMDP counterparts.;2009
We sought to describe the prevalence and patterns of use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) among active nurse practitioners (NPs). A descriptive correlational survey was conducted among NPs in the United States (N = 126). Participants were randomly selected from members of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners who had listed a practice site on their application. Sixty-four percent of participants used PDAs. A drug reference was reported to be the most useful and frequently installed application. A large majority of PDA users believed that PDA use supported clinical decision making (91%) promoted patient safety (89%) and increased productivity (75%). Sixty-two percent predicted that PDA use would change their practice within the next 5 years. As innovative PDA applications with potential to improve patient outcomes become increasingly available handheld computer skills will be a fundamental practice competency. To prevent errors in clinical decision making with quick access to PDA reference materials NPs must critically evaluate the legitimacy and worth of PDA software programs. There is a critical need to evaluate the effectiveness of PDA use in clinical settings and develop an evidence base to guide use of the PDA in solving clinical problems.;2009
When speech-based interfaces are used for small handheld devices such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants in mobile environments with unknown noises and surrounding talkers all signals except the legitimate user's voice must be rejected as noise signals by the system. This paper proposes a new algorithm that defects the users voice in spatial and temporal domains using directional and spectral information. It rejects undesirable signals that originate from noise sources or surrounding talkers. Experimental results indicate the proposed algorithm reduces the voice activity detection error rate by 34.3% relative to the conventional methods.;2009
With the advent of the Internet personal digital assistants (PDAs) which were originally meant for management of personal information are now equipped with the features of network connection and wireless communication No longer restricted by time and space PDAs can access information anytime and anywhere thus resembling a palm top computer Nevertheless the upsurge of Information Appliances (IAs) has bred over optimism on the development of PDAs In terms of importance PDAs are inferior to mobile phones while in terms of functions they are less versatile than notebook PCs Such perspective however has neglected the uniqueness of PDAs In view of the sluggish sale of PDAs this study aims to explore how production satisfaction brand name and service convenience affect the desire to purchase PDAs which can serve as useful references for planning IA promotion strategies By utilizing the DMAIC methodology of 6 sigma a comprehensive assessment and improvement model is constructed This model enables enterprises to quickly and effectively measure analyze improve and control their service quality which would in turn promote the overall satisfaction of customers thus creating high value added quality competitiveness and enhancing the profitability of enterprises;2009
With the technology improving many content-services have been digitalized constantly ill Our daily life To be more convenient and efficient many kinds of high technological products have also been personalized mobilized and people call handle their businesses at any time from anywhere. For example mobile users can perform the Internet transactions via mobile devices (such as cell phone and Personal Digital Assistant). Nowadays the cell phone is not only used in communication but it can be combined with Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) functions. The progress of technology makes the commercial activities efficient moreover it also provides consumers with more convenient and intimate services. Oil the basis of the tendency we implement a digital value-added services platform via PDA in this research. We integrate the related cryptography mechanisms (for example: public key secret key cryptography system and digital signature) wireless and SQL technologies to construct a real-time and Secure mobile ticket system. The consumer call use a mobile device to get a requested value-added service Such that the buyers and sellers can perform a secure transaction. Therefore the security and reliability of the system are assured in our scheme.;2009
A design is presented for a cost-effective easy to use millimeter resolution electronic fish measuring board. The device is easily assembled from commercially available electronic components and a customized electronic control board. The principal component of this design is a magnetostrictive linear distance sensor. This sensor is an alternative to previous approaches in magnetic measuring technology that used magnetoresistive or Hall-effect sensors. The measuring device is connected to a personal computer or personal digital assistant running a data acquisition application. Length measurements are taken by momentarily placing a magnet on the length board sensor at the desired measurement location. The described electronic fish measuring board is a robust inexpensive and efficient alternative to other methods and devices used to rapidly collect relatively large numbers of high-resolution length measurements.

A low-profile ultra-wideband (UWB) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna for a personal digital assistant application is proposed. To improve the impedance bandwidth a 2 mm x 1 mm connecting strip is used on each antenna element. The isolation characteristic between the two antenna elements is improved by inserting two T-shaped stubs. The optimized design parameters were obtained through parametric analysis. The designed antenna has a 10-dB return loss bandwidth of 9 GHz (2.2-11.2 GHz) covering the WiBro Bluetooth WiMax S-DMB and UWB frequency bands with an isolation characteristic below -20 dB over the operating frequency. Additionally the envelope correlation coefficient is less than 0.12. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals Inc.

A network community refers to a special type of network structure that contains a group of nodes connected based on certain relationships or similar properties. Our ability to mine communities hidden inside networks will readily enable us to effectively understand and exploit such networks. So far various methods and algorithms have been developed to perform the task of community mining where it is often required that the networks are processed in a centralized manner and their structures will not dynamically change. However in the real world many applications involve distributed and dynamically evolving networks in which resources and controls are not only decentralized but also updated frequently. It would be difficult for the existing methods to deal with these types of networks since their global topological representations are either not available or too hard to obtain due to their huge size decentralization and/or dynamic updates. The aim of our work is to address the problem of mining communities from a distributed and dynamic network. It differs from the previous ones in that here we introduce the notion of self-organizing agent networks and provide an autonomy-oriented computing (AOC) approach to distributed and incremental mining of network communities. The AOC-based method utilizes reactive agents that can collectively detect and update community structures in a distributed and dynamically evolving network based only on their local views and interactions. While providing detailed formulations we present the results of our systematic validations using real-world benchmark networks as well as synthetic networks that include a distributed intelligent Portable Digital Assistant (iPDA) network example.;2010
A wideband built-in antenna with a new crossed C-shaped coupling feed structure for wireless terminals is presented. With the proposed design scheme a 10-band built-in antenna that covers LTE700/GSM850/GSM900/DCS1800/PCS1900/WCDMA/WiBro2350/Bluetooth/WiMAX2500/LTE2600 is experimentally tested. The antenna could be available for future 4G service and for current 2G/3G services. This novel 10-band built-in handset antenna is developed within the limits of a 50 x 14 x 16 mm(3) volume for recent smart phones or personal digital assistant (PDA) applications thereby achieving good agreement between measurement and simulation.;2010
After a radiological dispersal device (RDD) event it is possible for radionuclides to enter the human body through inhalation ingestion and skin and wound absorption. From a health physics perspective it is important to know the magnitude of the intake to perform dosimetric assessments. From a medical perspective removal of radionuclides leading to dose aversion (hence risk reduction) is of high importance. The efficacy of medical decorporation strategies is extremely dependent upon the time of treatment delivery after intake. The golden hour or more realistically 3-4 h is optimal when attempting to increase removal of radionuclides from extracellular fluids prior to cellular incorporation. To assist medical first response personnel in making timely decisions regarding appropriate treatment delivery modes it is desirable to have a software tool that compiles existing radionuclide decorporation therapy data and allows a user to perform simple diagnosis leading to optimized decorporation treatment strategies. In its most simple application the software is a large database of radionuclide decorporation strategies and treatments. The software can also be used in clinical interactive mode in which the user inputs the radionuclide estimated activity route of intake and time since exposure. The software makes suggestions as to the urgency of treatment (i.e. triage) and the suggested therapy. Current developments include risk assessment which impacts the potential risk of delivered therapy and resource allocation of therapeutic agents. The software developed for the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) is titled MEDECOR (MEdical DECORporation). The MEDECOR tool was designed for use on both personal digital assistant and laptop computer environments. The tool was designed using HTML/Jscript to allow for ease of portability amongst different computing platforms. This paper presents the features of MEDECOR results of testing at a major NATO exercise and future development of this tool into MEDECOR2. Health Phys. 99(4):581-590 2010;2010
Although fieldwork is always cited as an important component of geographic education there are many obstacles for executing high school fieldwork. Mobile electronic products are becoming popular and some schools are able to acquire these devices for mobile learning. This study attempts to provide a mobile-assisted means of guiding students through fieldwork without a teacher's presence. To explore these possibilities a PDA (personal digital assistant) program referred to as the Pocket Fieldwork Assistant (PFA) has been developed. A fieldwork course module that is concerned with local irrigation ditch issues is designed and implemented to evaluate how the PFA affects fieldwork learning in authentic settings.;2010
An initiative conflict is an overlap of speech in which both conversants try to steer the conversation in different directions. In this paper we investigate how conversants in human-human dialogue deal with such conflicts. First in investigating why initiative conflicts occur we find that the offsets of the utterances involved in initiative conflicts tend to be very short and that initiative conflicts seem more likely to occur when one of the conversants has an urgent conversational goal. These findings strongly suggest that initiative conflicts are unintentional collisions and that conversants try to prevent them from even occurring unless there is an urgent reason. Second in investigating how initiative conflicts are resolved we find that the overlaps tend to last less than two syllables that volume correlates with who wins initiative conflicts and that for longer overlaps the volume of the winner increases in the second half of the overlaps. These findings strongly suggest that initiative conflicts are quickly resolved through an interactive process using volume as one of the devices. Third we find that after an initiative conflict is resolved the winner sometimes repeats the words involved in the overlap and this happens more when the overlap is more likely to interfere with the other conversant's understanding. These findings will help its build next-generation mixed-initiative spoken dialogue systems that are natural and efficient to use. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
Artificial humans so-called Embodied Conversational Agents and humanoid robots are assumed to facilitate human-technology interaction referring to the unique human capacities of interpersonal communication and social information processing. While early research and development in artificial intelligence (AI) focused on processing and production of natural language the new AI has also taken into account the emotional and relational aspects of communication with an emphasis both on understanding and production of nonverbal behavior. This shift in attention in computer science and engineering is reflected in recent developments in psychology and social cognitive neuroscience. This article addresses key challenges which emerge from the goal to equip machines with socio-emotional intelligence and to enable them to interpret subtle nonverbal cues and to respond to social affordances with naturally appearing behavior from both perspectives. In particular we propose that the creation of credible artificial humans not only defines the ultimate test for our understanding of human communication and social cognition but also provides a unique research tool to improve our knowledge about the underlying psychological processes and neural mechanisms.

Aviation military police and health care personnel have been particularly interested in the operational impact of sleep restriction and work schedules given the potential severe consequences of making fatigue-related errors. Most studies examining the impact of sleep loss or circadian manipulations have been conducted in controlled laboratory settings using small sample sizes. This study examined whether the relationship between prior night sleep duration and performance on the psychomotor vigilance task could be reliably detected in a field study of healthy police academy recruits. Subjects (N = 189) were medically and psychiatrically healthy. Sleep-wake activity was assessed with wrist actigraphy for 7 days. Subjects performed the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) for 5 min on a personal digital assistant (PDA) device before and after their police academy workday and on comparable times during their days off. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of having >= 1 lapse on the PVT as a function of the previous night sleep duration during the 7 days of field testing. Valid estimates of sleep duration were obtained for 1082 nights of sleep. The probability of a lapse decreased by 3.5%/h sleep the night prior to testing. The overall probability of having a lapse decreased by 0.9%/h since awakening holding hours of sleep constant. Perceived stress was not associated with sleep duration or probability of performance lapse. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of detecting sleep and circadian effects on cognitive performance in large field studies. These findings have implications regarding the daytime functioning of police officers. (Author correspondence: Thomas. Neylan@ucsf.edu);2010
Background and objectives: Pharmacists use PDAs for performing various activities related to their profession. The objective of this study was to examine pharmacists' utilization pattern and interest in usage of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in various facets of health care. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by distributing a pre-validated 23-item instrument to a convenience sample of pharmacists (n = 295) in the Houston area. Usage frequency (0 = never to 5 = frequently) and interest in future use (1 = extremely disinterested to 5 = extremely interested) of PDAs for various activities were evaluated and compared across pharmacy practice settings. Results: Most pharmacists reported maximum use of PDAs as personal organizers (3.7 +/- 1.8) in obtaining drug information (2.9 +/- 1.8) and as medical calculators (2.6 +/- 1.9). Similar results were obtained while evaluating interest of pharmacists who did not have PDAs and have never used PDAs for these three activities. Hospital pharmacists owned and used PDAs significantly (P < 0.05) more often than community pharmacists. Conclusions: Pharmacists used PDAs for basic functions in their profession role. Application of PDA technology in community pharmacy settings may result in its better adoption in both the settings.;2010
Background: Application and assessment of the usefulness of image transfer through a mobile telephone in pediatric orthopaedic practice was investigated. Methods: Twenty patients with traumatic lesions requiring urgent consultation were included. Relevant x-rays were photographed and transferred using Multimedia Messaging Service to the orthopaedic surgeon at our department. The discussion on the need to transfer the patient for treatment and the final treatment was retrospectively scrutinized by 10 independent orthopaedic surgeons. The agreement on the diagnosis and the management plan proposed after image transfer were assessed. Results: The lesion concerned the lower limb in 6 cases upper limbs in 13 cases and the spine in 1 case in patients aged 2 to 16 years. The transmitted images were 160 x 120-pixel jpeg files in 1 case 240 x 180-pixel jpeg files in 8 cases 320 x 240-pixel jpeg files in 1 case and 640 x 480-pixel jpeg files in 10 cases. In all the cases studied all the investigators agreed that the images were good enough for doing the diagnosis even in cases of minor or nondisplaced fractures. The same decisions of transfer or management were taken in all the cases by all the investigators. Review of the transferred images versus the original full-scale images did not change the final diagnosis and management plan. Conclusions: In this study even in case of low-resolution images (160 x 120-pixel jpeg) images were of sufficiently high quality for interpretation. This enables rational management decisions to be made using this costless and widely available technology. In patients requiring surgical treatment a final operative decision is mandatory after transfer bedside examination and review of other data in addition to images. Teleconsultation using Multimedia Messaging Service is especially useful to improve remote management of orthopaedic patients in local hospitals or for decisions of transfer when surgical treatment is needed. Clinical Relevance: Level IV (case series).;2010
BACKGROUND: Black box warnings represent the strongest safety warning that the Food and Drug Administration can issue for a marketed prescription drug. Some black box warnings recommend against coadministration of specific medications due to an increased risk for serious perhaps life-threatening effects. OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of agreement in presence clinical severity scores level of documentation ratings and alert content among 3 leading drug interaction screening programs with regard to contraindicated comedications that are mentioned in black box warnings. METHODS: We reviewed the prescribing information for currently marketed prescription drugs with a black box warning that mentioned a contraindicated drug combination. We selected the drug interaction databases Facts & Comparisons 4.0 MICROMEDEX DRUG-REAX and Lexi-Comp Lexi-Interact to evaluate the interactions. Discrepancies in the inclusion of interactions and level of agreement in clinical severity scores and level of documentation ratings for each interaction were assessed using descriptive statistics Spearman's correlation coefficient Kendall-Stuart tau-c and Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: We identified 11 drugs with black box warnings that contained information on 59 unique contraindicated drug combinations only 68% of which were covered by any source. Lexi-Comp detected the most interactions (n = 29) and DRUG-REAX the least (n = 18). Only 3 drug combinations were detected and rated as contraindicated or potentially life-threatening in all 3 databases. The severity scores and level of documentation ratings varied widely. CONCLUSIONS: There are discrepancies among major drug interaction screening programs in the inclusion severity and level of documentation of contraindicated drug combinations mentioned in black box warnings. Further studies could explore the implications of these inconsistencies particularly with regard to the integration of black box warning information in clinical practice. Clinicians should consult multiple drug resources to maximize the potential for detecting a potentially severe drug interaction.;2010
Background: Data collection systems are very important for the practice of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). This study aimed to evaluate 3 PCA data collection systems and selected the most favorable system with the aid of multi-attribute utility (MAU) theory. Methods: We developed a questionnaire with 10 items to evaluate the PCA data collection system and 1 item for overall satisfaction based on MAU theory. Three systems were compared in the questionnaire including a paper record optic card reader and personal digital assistant (PDA). A pilot study demonstrated a good internal and test-retest reliability of the questionnaire. A weighted utility score combining the relative importance of individual items assigned by each participant and their responses to each question was calculated for each system. Sensitivity analyses with distinct weighting protocols were conducted to evaluate the stability of the final results. Results: Thirty potential users of a PCA data collection system were recruited in the study. The item easy to use had the highest median rank and received the heaviest mean weight among all items. MAU analysis showed that the PDA system had a higher utility score than that in the other 2 systems. Sensitivity analyses revealed that both inverse and reciprocal weighting processes favored the PDA system. High correlations between overall satisfaction and MAU scores from miscellaneous weighting protocols suggested a good predictive validity of our MAU-based questionnaire. Conclusion: The PDA system was selected as the most favorable PCA data collection system by the MAU analysis. The item easy to use was the most important attribute of the PCA data collection system. MAU theory can evaluate alternatives by taking into account individual preferences of stakeholders and aid in better decision-making. [J Chin Med Assoc 201073(10):533-539];2010
Background: Emerging technology such as an artificial pancreatic beta-cell is not likely to be affordable to people who live in developing nations in the next 20-30 years. However multiple-daily injection (MDI) therapy can be improved using similar advanced control algorithms designed for continuous glucose monitoring and continuous insulin infusion pumps. Methods: A simulation study of run-to-run control was developed for MDI therapy. Rapid-and slow-acting insulins were used in the protocol which uses pre-and postprandial glucose measurements. The key information for the synthesis of the control algorithm is the subject insulin sensitivity that is calculated for two cases: (a) when the subject's glycemia and insulin dosing information is known (sensitivity response) and (b) when there is no previous information about the subject's response to the insulin protocol. In the latter case this information needs to be estimated recursively using online data. After the sensitivity is recalculated the run-to-run correction scheme is updated obtaining an adaptive MDI therapy. The robustness of the advisory algorithm was evaluated by constant random parameter variations and superimposing sinusoidal oscillations on glucose-insulin model parameters to simulate intra-individual variability of the glucoregulatory system. Results: Optimal glycemic control has been achieved for both cases (a and b) despite variable meals (15% variation in carbohydrate content and 15-min variation in timing) and parametric variations in the glucose-insulin model. In Case (b) no profound hypoglycemic (< 60 mg/dL) or hyperglycemic (> 180 mg/dL) events were observed on average during all evaluations. Conclusions: This work shows that the run-to-run framework for insulin updating can be successfully extended to an adaptive MDI protocol. These results motivate the practical implementation of this scheme in portable units such as personal digital assistants or smartphones.;2010
Background: Geographical Reconnaissance (GR) operations using Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have been conducted in the elimination provinces of Temotu Solomon Islands and Tafea Republic of Vanuatu. These operations aimed to examine modern approaches to GR to define the spatial distribution of target populations to support contemporary malaria elimination interventions. Methods: Three GR surveys were carried out covering the outer islands of Temotu Province (October - November 2008) Santa Cruz Island Temotu Province (February 2009) and Tanna Island Tafea Province (July - September 2009). Integrated PDA/GPS handheld units were used in the field to rapidly map and enumerate households and collect associated population and household structure data to support priority elimination interventions including bed net distribution indoor residual spraying (IRS) and malaria case surveillance. Data were uploaded and analysed in customized Geographic Information System (GIS) databases to produce household distribution maps and generate relevant summary information pertaining to the GR operations. Following completion of field operations group discussions were also conducted to review GR approaches and technology implemented. Results: 10459 households were geo-referenced and mapped. A population of 43497 and 30663 household structures were recorded during the three GR surveys. The spatial distribution of the population was concentrated in coastal village clusters. Survey operations were completed over a combined total of 77 field days covering a total land mass area of approximately 1103.2 km(2). An average of 45 households 118 structures and a population of 184 people were recorded per handheld device per day. Geo-spatial household distribution maps were also produced immediately following the completion of GR fieldwork. An overall high acceptability of modern GR techniques and technology was observed by both field operations staff and communities. Conclusion: GR implemented using modern techniques has provided an effective and efficient operational tool for rapidly defining the spatial distribution of target populations in designated malaria elimination zones in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The data generated are being used for the strategic implementation and scaling-up of priority interventions and will be essential for establishing future surveillance using spatial decision support systems.;2010
Background: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are an efficacious intervention for malaria prevention. During a national immunization campaign in Mozambique vouchers which were to be redeemed at a later date for free ITNs were distributed in Manica and Sofala provinces. A survey to evaluate ITN ownership and usage post-campaign was conducted. Methods: Four districts in each province and four enumeration areas (EAs) in each district were selected using probability proportional to size. Within each EA 32 households (HHs) were selected using a simple random sample. Interviews to assess ownership and usage were conducted in each of the selected HHs using personal digital assistants. Results: Valid interviews were completed for 947 (92.5%) (440 in Manica and 507 in Sofala) of the 1024 selected HHs. Among participating HHs 65.0% in Manica and 63.1% in Sofala reported that at least one child under five years of age slept in the house the previous night. HH ownership of at least one bed net of any kind was 20.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.9%-43.6%) and 35.6% (95% CI: 27.8%-44.3%) pre-campaign and 55.1% (95% CI: 43.6%-66.1%) and 59.6 (95% CI: 42.4%-74.7%) post-campaign in Manica and Sofala respectively. Post-campaign HH ownership of at least one ITN was 50.2% (95% CI: 41.8%-58.5%) for both provinces combined. In addition 60.3% (95% CI: 50.6%-69.2%) of children under five years of age slept under an ITN the previous night. Conclusions: This ITN distribution increased bed net ownership and usage rates. Integration of ITN distribution with immunization campaigns presents an opportunity for reaching malaria control targets and should continue to be considered.;2010
Background: Split liver transplantation (SLT) is technically demanding and requires good communication between transplant centers. The recipient surgeon receiving a shipped split liver needs detailed information on allocation of inflow and outflow vessels. We describe the first use of an image transmission system to facilitate SLT. Methods: Twenty cadaver livers undergoing ex situ splitting were studied. Fifteen were shared between the geographically separate Birmingham adult and pediatric centers and five were shared with other UK centers. Results: A total of six to eight images of each split graft were taken with a camera at standardized settings using the National Organ Retrieval Imaging System (NORIS) showing details of appearance size and anatomy of allocated inflow and outflow vessels. These were uploaded using a personal digital assistant to a secure website (http://www.noris.org.uk). The remote recipient surgeon then viewed these images by logging onto the password-protected website. Minimum time interval between division of the hilar vessels and completion of the split procedure was two h allowing remote surgeon to view their allocated shipped'' graft in advance of commencing surgery. Conclusion: This advanced yet simple image transmission system has the potential for routine application in transplant surgery not only for splitting but also for reporting injuries and graft steatosis.;2010
Background: Suboptimal diet and physical inactivity are prevalent co-occurring chronic disease risk factors yet little is known about how to maximize multiple risk behavior change. Make Better Choices a randomized controlled trial tests competing hypotheses about the optimal way to promote healthy change in four bundled risk behaviors: high saturated fat intake low fruit and vegetable intake low physical activity and high sedentary leisure screen time. The study aim is to determine which combination of two behavior change goals - one dietary one activity - yields greatest overall healthy lifestyle change. Methods/Design: Adults (n = 200) with poor quality diet and sedentary lifestyle will be recruited and screened for study eligibility. Participants will be trained to record their diet and activities onto a personal data assistant and use it to complete two weeks of baseline. Those who continue to show all four risk behaviors after baseline recording will be randomized to one of four behavior change prescriptions: 1) increase fruits and vegetables and increase physical activity 2) decrease saturated fat and increase physical activity 3) increase fruits and vegetable and decrease saturated fat or 4) decrease saturated fat and decrease sedentary activity. They will use decision support feedback on the personal digital assistant and receive counseling from a coach to alter their diet and activity during a 3-week prescription period when payment is contingent upon meeting behavior change goals. They will continue recording on an intermittent schedule during a 4.5-month maintenance period when payment is not contingent upon goal attainment. The primary outcome is overall healthy lifestyle change aggregated across all four risk behaviors. Discussion: The Make Better Choices trial tests a disseminable lifestyle intervention supported by handheld technology. Findings will fill a gap in knowledge about optimal goal prescription to facilitate simultaneous diet and activity change. Results will shed light on which goal prescription maximizes healthful lifestyle change.;2010
Background: Technology is becoming an important medium for supporting patients in health care. However successful application depends on user acceptability. The Advanced Symptom Management System (ASyMS (c)) involves patients reporting cancer chemotherapy-related symptoms using mobile phone technology. Objective: The aim of this article was to report a study of how young people were involved in the development of ASyMS B using the Medical Research Council framework for evaluating complex interventions. Methods: A convenience sample of young people aged 13 to 18 years undergoing cancer chemotherapy were recruited from 2 principal cancer treatment centers in London. Results: In phase 1 young people selected 5 symptoms from an adapted version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale that were most important to them. In phase 2 young people completed the ASyMS (c)-YG PDA (personal digital assistant) questionnaire daily on days 1 to 14 of a cycle of chemotherapy and pre/post-use questionnaires. In phase 1 5 young people chose diarrhea nausea vomiting constipation and weight loss as the most important symptoms. In phase 2 25 young people reported positively to using PDA technology found ASyMS (c)-YG simple and easy to complete and liked that they were monitored at home. In addition to the 5 core symptoms the ASyMS (c)-YG reports showed the number (n = 37) of other symptoms young people experienced. Conclusions: This early development work indicates the acceptability of ASyMS (c)-YG and has informed an exploratory trial (phase 3) and randomized controlled trial (stage 4). Implications for Practice: This study reaffirms the importance of promoting communication between young people and health professionals.;2010
Background: The adequacy of thromboprophylaxis prescriptions in acutely ill hospitalized medical patients needs improvement. Objective: To prospectively assess the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis adequacy of various clinical decision support systems (CDSS) with the aim of increasing the use of explicit criteria for thromboprophylaxis prescription in nine Swiss medical services. Methods: We randomly assigned medical services to a pocket digital assistant program (PDA) pocket cards ( PC) and no CDSS ( controls). In centers using an electronic chart an e-alert system (eAlerts) was developed. After 4 months we compared post-CDSS with baseline thromboprophylaxis adequacy for the various CDSS and control groups. Results: Overall 1085 patients were included (395 controls 196 PC 168 PDA 326 eAlerts) 651 pre- and 434 post-CDSS implementation: 472 (43.5%) presented a risk of VTE justifying thromboprophylaxis (31.8% pre 61.1% post) and 556 (51.2%) received thromboprophylaxis (54.2% pre 46.8% post). The overall adequacy (% patients with adequate prescription) of pre- and post-CDSS implementation was 56.2 and 50.7 for controls (P = 0.29) 67.3 and 45.3 for PC (P = 0.002) 66.0 and 64.9 for PDA (P = 0.99) 50.5 and 56.2 for eAlerts (P = 0.37) respectively eAlerts limited overprescription (56% pre 31% post P = 0.01). Conclusion: While pocket cards and handhelds did not improve thromboprophylaxis adequacy eAlerts had a modest effect particularly on the reduction of overprescription. This effect only partially contributes to the improvement of patient safety and more work is needed towards institution-tailored tools.;2010
Background: The University of Queensland has developed the Clinical Practice Performance electronic Portfolio (CPPeP) as a learning and assessment tool for third year nursing students. To promote effective use of the CPPeP in the clinical setting barriers must be identified and strategies developed to overcome them. Methods: A 24-question survey exploring the use and perceptions of the CPPeP was administered to 42 third year nursing students. Questions explored actual barriers encountered while eight open-ended questions were thematically analysed for perceived barriers. Results: A 100% response rate was achieved. Students were comfortable with working with computers. Twenty nine students (69%) encountered specific barriers. Of the 152 written comments to the open-ended questions perceived barriers were evident in 72 of them. Barriers experienced related to gaining access finding time and staff attitude. The majority of students made their portfolio entries at home. Conclusion: Students enjoyed using the CPPeP but competed with staff for the limited numbers of computers available. Heavy workloads and 'busyness' of the wards also prohibited access along with negative staff attitudes and reluctance of registered nurses to engage as student preceptors. The issue of overcoming barriers is more complex than simply providing more computers or overcoming staff prejudices. Finding time is a barrier not easily overcome given the current and projected nursing shortage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
Background: The use of insecticidal bed nets is found to be an effective public health tool for control of malaria especially for under-five children and pregnant women. BRAC an indigenous Bangladeshi non-governmental development organization started working in the East African state of Uganda in June 2006. As part of its efforts to improve the health and well-being of its participants BRAC Uganda has been distributing long lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLIN) at a subsidized price through health volunteers since February 2008. This study was conducted in March-April 2009 to examine how equitable the programme had been in consistence with BRAC Uganda's pro-poor policy. Methodology/Principal Findings: Information on possession of LLINs and relevant knowledge on its proper use and maintenance was collected from households either with an under-five child and/or a pregnant woman. The sample included three villages from each of the 10 branch offices where BRAC Uganda's community-based health programme was operating. Data were collected by trained enumerators through face-to-face interviews using a hand-held personal digital assistant (PDA). Findings reveal that the study population had superficial knowledge on malaria and its transmission including the use and maintenance of LLINs. The households' rate of possession of bed nets (41-59%) and the proportion of under-five children (17-19%) and pregnant women (25-27%) who reported sleeping under an LLIN were not encouraging. Inequity was observed in the number of LLINs possessed by the households in the knowledge on its use and maintenance and between the two programme areas. Conclusions/Significance: The BRAC Uganda's LLINs distribution at a subsidized price appeared to be inadequate and inequitable and BRAC's knowledge dissemination is insufficient for initiating preventive actions such as proper use of LLINs to interrupt malaria transmission. Findings contribute to the on-going debate on LLINs distribution in Africa and make a strong case for its free distribution.;2010
Behavior models implemented within Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) require nonverbal communication to be tightly coordinated with speech. In this paper we present an empirical study seeking to explore the influence of the temporal coordination between speech and facial expressions of emotions on the perception of these emotions by users (measuring their performance in this task the perceived realism of behavior and user preferences). We generated five different conditions of temporal coordination between facial expression and speech: facial expression displayed before a speech utterance at the beginning of the utterance throughout at the end of or following the utterance. 23 subjects participated in the experiment and saw these 5 conditions applied to the display of 6 emotions (fear joy anger disgust surprise and sadness). Subjects recognized emotions most efficiently when facial expressions were displayed at the end of the spoken sentence. However the combination users viewed as most realistic preferred over others was the display of the facial expression throughout speech utterance. We review existing literature to position our work and discuss the relationship between realism and communication performance. We also provide animation guidelines and draw some avenues for future work.;2010
Black and White smokers may experience aspects of nicotine dependence including craving differently. This study used a naturalistic technique ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to explore differences in craving mood expectancy and smoking enjoyment between Black and White smokers. Participants carried personal digital assistants (PDAs) programmed to obtain multiple daily assessments. Black smokers reported higher craving after smoking and at random assessment times and higher cigarette enjoyment. No differences were found in mood or expectancy. Racial differences in psychological factors related to smoking are explored in the contexts of genetic sociological and psychophysiological distinctions. Implications for practice and research are discussed.;2010
Christian Medical College (CMC) India and Tufts University School of Medicine USA have developed an 'institutional hub and spokes' model (campus-based e-learning supporting m-learning in the field) to facilitate clinical education and training at remote secondary hospital sites across India. Iterative research design development and testing merged three key elements for effective mobile learning: an underlying learning management system to organize data mobile access to a knowledge repository using commonly owned phones and mobile applications that match the learner learning theory and mode of learning based on student-articulated needs. CMC is institutionalizing academic and technical support for e-learning and m-learning ensuring future sustainability. Assessing and sharing best practices for mobile-supported training and resources will leverage strengths and build capacity across the CMC-secondary hospital mobile/e-learning network. This model can advance interdisciplinary health training initiatives in developing countries improving clinical services and health for underserved populations across the world.;2010
COLVARD MD NAIMAN M DANZIGER L HANLEY L Handheld directed energy sensor for environmental monitoring and clinician safety. Aviat Space Environ Med 2010 81:602-4. Introduction: Directed energy (DE) research and development is generating more powerful portable devices designed to support operational environmental clinical point detection and remote-sensing applications. These same DE devices present potential for injury thereby impacting medical operations. The environmental surveillance and clinical communities require handheld sensor platforms that afford preemptive detection and monitoring of potentially hazardous exposures to DE and other electromagnetic (EM) frequencies. Methods: A personal digital assistant (PDA) was interfaced with a wavelength sensor board via a multifunction data acquisition card to passively detect wavelengths in the 480-950 nm range. A 9V DC battery coupled to a voltage up-converter with a manual ON/OFF switch powered the sensor board. The sensor board was integrated with a standard operating system-based FDA. Graphical programming software integrated the data acquisition card with the FDA. Results: The DE wavelength sensor/FDA platform detected and relayed laser radiation information from 480 to 950 nm ranges with graphical data output to the FDA screen. Discussion: This project demonstrated the technical ability to detect anthropogenic DE frequency signatures using a handheld battery-driven DE sensor platform. Laboratory and field assessment studies are underway to validate operational applications. This DE-sensing prototype is designed explicitly for DE medical measurement and signatures intelligence (MED MASINT) to meet the protection needs of environmental and clinical Operators.;2010
Conversation is an essential component of social behavior one of the primary means by which humans express intentions beliefs emotions attitudes and personality. Thus the development of systems to support natural conversational interaction has been a long term research goal. In natural conversation humans adapt to one another across many levels of utterance production via processes variously described as linguistic style matching entrainment alignment audience design and accommodation. A number of recent studies strongly suggest that dialogue systems that adapted to the user in a similar way would be more effective. However a major research challenge in this area is the ability to dynamically generate user-adaptive utterance variations. As part of a personality-based user adaptation framework this article describes PERSONAGE a highly parameterizable generator which provides a large number of parameters to support adaptation to a user's linguistic style. We show how we can systematically apply results from psycholinguistic studies that document the linguistic reflexes of personality in order to develop models to control PERSONAGE'S parameters and produce utterances matching particular personality profiles. When we evaluate these outputs with human judges the results indicate that humans perceive the personality of system utterances in the way that the system intended.;2010
Depression affects approximately 15% of the US population and is recognized as an important risk factor for poor outcomes among patients with various illnesses. Automated health education and behavior change programs have the potential to help address many of the shortcomings in health care. However the role of these systems in the care of patients with depression has been insufficiently examined. In the current study we sought to evaluate how hospitalized medical patients would respond to a computer animated conversational agent that has been developed to provide information in an empathic fashion about a patient's hospital discharge plan. In particular we sought to examine how patients who have a high level of depressive symptoms respond to this system. Therapeutic alliance - the trust and belief that a patient and provider have in working together to achieve a desired therapeutic outcome - was used as the primary outcome measure since it has been shown to be important in predicting outcomes across a wide range of health problems including depression. In an evaluation of 139 hospital patients who interacted with the agent at the time of discharge all patients regardless of depressive symptoms rated the agent very high on measures of satisfaction and ease of use and most preferred receiving their discharge information from the agent compared to their doctors or nurses in the hospital. In addition we found that patients with symptoms indicative of major depression rated the agent significantly higher on therapeutic alliance compared to patients who did not have major depressive symptoms. We conclude that empathic agents represent a promising technology for patient assessment education and counseling for those most in need of comfort and caring in the inpatient setting.

Diabetes is difficult to control and it is important to manage the diabetic's blood sugar level and prevent the associated complications by appropriate diabetic treatment. This paper proposes a system that can provide appropriate management for diabetes patients according to their blood sugar level. The system is designed to send the information about the blood sugar levels blood pressure food consumption exercise etc. of diabetes patients and manage the treatment by recommending and monitoring food consumption physical activity insulin dosage etc. so that the patient can better manage their condition. The system is based on rules and the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier algorithm to obtain the optimum treatment recommendation. Also a monitoring system for diabetes patients is implemented using Web Services and Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) programming.;2010
During face-to-face conversation our body is continually in motion displaying various head gesture and posture movements. Based on findings describing the communicative functions served by these nonverbal behaviors many virtual agent systems have modeled them to make the virtual agent look more effective and believable. One channel of nonverbal behaviors that has received less attention is head movements despite the important functions served by them. The goal for this work is to build a domain-independent model of speaker's head movements that could be used to generate head movements for virtual agents. In this paper we present a machine learning approach for learning models of head movements by focusing on when speaker head nods should occur and conduct evaluation studies that compare the nods generated by this work to our previous approach of using handcrafted rules [1]. To learn patterns of speaker head nods we use a gesture corpus and rely on the linguistic and affective features of the utterance. We describe the feature selection process and training process for learning hidden Markov models and compare the results of the learned models under varying conditions. The results show that we can predict speaker head nods with high precision (.84) and recall (.89) rates even without a deep representation of the surface text and that using affective information can help improve the prediction of the head nods (precision: .89 recall: .90). The evaluation study shows that the nods generated by the machine learning approach are perceived to be more natural in terms of nod timing than the nods generated by the rule-based approach.;2010

The main characteristics of Elckerlyc are that (1) it is designed specifically for continuous interaction with tight temporal coordination between the behavior of a VH and its interaction partner (2) it provides a mix between the precise temporal and spatial control offered by procedural animation and the physical realism of physical simulation and (3) it is designed to be highly modular and extensible implementing the architecture proposed in SAIBA.;2010
Embedded devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) pocket PCs palmtops and handheld PCs are increasingly using flash memory for the permanent storage of databases. Databases achieve their fast data access speeds by using a memory manager that manages data pages in a memory buffer. The buffer manager uses a page replacement policy to evict pages when the memory buffer is full. An eviction of a dirty page will result in a write to flash memory. Unfortunately writing to flash memory consumes a lot more energy than reading. Much of the previous work in page replacement policies has focused on reducing the number of page reads rather than writes. One of the few existing works to consider the effects of flash memory's hardware constraints for database design is Lee et. al.'s in-page Logging (IPL) approach [ Lee and Moon 2007]. They demonstrated IPL significantly outperforms traditional disk-based databases when running on flash memory. However they do not consider the energy efficiency of their approach in terms of the behavior of the page replacement policy. This article addresses this issue by presenting the Multi-Buffer Manager which is customized for flash databases that use a logging-based approach for managing updates such as IPL. Extensive experiments show the page replacement policy used plays a pivotal role in the performance of the flash database system. In particular our Multi-Buffer Manager can reduce energy consumption by up to 40% compared to the state-of-the-art clean first flash-based buffer replacement policy (CFLRU).;2010
Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) are computer-animated characters that simulate face-to-face conversation with patients. These agents can be programmed with best practices in human-human health communication and used for automated health education and behavior change counseling interventions. Evidence is presented from two ongoing clinical trials demonstrating that patients at different levels of health literacy find these agents acceptable and easy to use for automated health communication interventions. Innovative computer interface systems can be used to ensure that inadequate health literacy not serve as a barrier to interventions using health information technology.;2010
Emotional corpora provide an important empirical foundation for investigation when researchers aim at implementing emotion-aware spoken dialog systems. One of the fundamental research questions is how to acquire an appropriate realistic emotion corpus. The primary aim of this paper is to address the methodological desiderata in producing emotion corpora in human-machine interaction (HMI). It proposes a substantial refinement of the Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) technique in order that a scenario designed to elicit affected speech in HMI could result in realistic and useful data. In addition the paper reports about the NIMITEK corpus of affected behavior in HMI produced during a refined WOZ simulation. The evaluation of the corpus with respect to the perception of its emotional content demonstrated that the corpus contains recordings of emotions that were overtly signaled. The range of emotional reactions is indicative of the kind of emotional reactions than can be expected to occur in the interaction with the sort of spoken dialog systems considered in this study. Since the subjects were not restricted by given predetermined linguistic constraints on the language to use their utterances are indicative of the way in which nontrained nontechnical users probably like to converse with conversational agents as well.;2010
Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that autonomous artificial entities so-called embodied conversational agents elicit social behavior on the part of the human interlocutor. Various theoretical approaches have tried to explain this phenomenon: According to the Threshold Model of Social Influence (Blascovich et al. 2002) the social influence of real persons who are represented by avatars will always be high whereas the influence of an artificial entity depends on the realism of its behavior. Conversely the Ethopoeia concept (Nass & Moon 2000) predicts that automatic social reactions are triggered by situations as soon as they include social cues. The presented study evaluates whether participant S belief in interacting with either an avatar (a virtual representation of a human) or an agent (autonomous virtual person) lead to different social effects. We used a 2 x 2 design with two levels of agency (agent or avatar) and two levels of behavioral realism (showing feedback behavior versus showing no behavior). We found that the belief of interacting with either an avatar or an agent barely resulted in differences with regard to the evaluation of the virtual character or behavioral reactions whereas higher behavioral realism affected both. It is discussed to what extent the results thus support the Ethopoeia concept. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
For the small-scale and scattered fresh cucumber production in China the result that production record-keeping and its transfer are inefficient have prevented the wide application of traceability systems in China. With the mobility and computability Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) provides a new way for agricultural information collection to solve the above problems. Thus a PDA-based Record-keeping and Decision-support System (PRDS) for traceability in cucumber production was developed on Windows Mobile platform invoking a Geographic Information System (GIS) control. For improving the decision making feasibility of PRDS the fertilization recommendation model and pesticide usage early warning model were developed by using the Technical Specification of Balanced Fertilization by Soil Testing and the Guideline for Safety Application of Pesticides in China. The architecture of PRDS was provided. With Unified Modeling Language (UML) a requirement model including two types of users and 17 use cases was described and a static class model was also designed which consisted of table class table operation class algorithm class and interface class. Based on these models the functions of system setup map management data management production record-keeping and decision-support and query etc. were implemented by adopting Hosting MapInfo MapX Mobile Controls on the .NET Compact Framework 2.0 and the data synchronization was realized by Remote Data Access (RDA). Two agricultural production enterprises were chosen as case study to evaluate the system by questionnaires. The results show that the efficiency of production record-keeping and decision-support is improved by the simple and friendly system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2010
Healthcare is an increasingly collaborative enterprise involving broad range of healthcare services provided by many individuals and organizations. Apart from the provision of healthcare services to patients during hospitalization the ability to assist people who have healthcare needs at their homes (e.g. the elderly) has become an increasingly critical issue. Provision of such personalized medical care services to patients requires readily access to integrated healthcare services ubiquitously. The integration of mobile and wireless devices with Grid technology can provide ubiquitous and pervasive access to Grid services. This article presents MASPortal a Grid portal application for the assistance of people who are in need of medical advice at their homes. MASPortal is designed for use with wireless Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and provides remote access to an automated medical diagnostic and treatment advice system via an adaptive and easy to use interface. MASPortal has been implemented with a multilayered security infrastructure in order to ensure secure access to healthcare processes and sensitive patient data.;2010
Human natural face-to-face communication is characterized by inter-personal coordination. In this paper phenomena are analyzed that yield coordination of behaviors beliefs and attitudes between interaction partners which can be tied to a concept of establishing social resonance. It is discussed whether these mechanisms can and should be transferred to conversation with artificial interlocutors like ECAs or humanoid robots. It is argued that one major step in this direction is embodied coordination mutual adaptations that are mediated by flexible modules for the top-down production and bottom-up perception of expressive conversational behavior that ground in and crucially coalesce in the same sensorimotor structures. Work on modeling this for ECAs with a focus on coverbal gestures is presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2010
In many scenes with human characters interacting groups are an important factor for maintaining a sense of realism. However little is known about what makes these characters appear realistic. In this paper we investigate human sensitivity to audio mismatches (i.e. when individuals' voices are not matched to their gestures) and visual desynchronization (i.e. when the body motions of the individuals in a group are mis-aligned in time) in virtual human conversers. Using motion capture data from a range of both polite conversations and arguments we conduct a series of perceptual experiments and determine some factors that contribute to the plausibility of virtual conversing groups. We found that participants are more sensitive to visual desynchronization of body motions than to mismatches between the characters' gestures and their voices. Furthermore synthetic conversations can appear sufficiently realistic once there is an appropriate balance between talker and listener roles. This is regardless of body motion desynchronization or mismatched audio.;2010

In recent years consumer electronic devices have been expanding their application domains from traditional consumer electronic devices such as cellular phones PDAs(Personal Digital Assistants) PMPs(Portable Multimedia Players) Navigation to Next Generation Personal Computers(NGPCs) such as eating consumer electronic devices implanted consumer electronic devices wearable consumer electronic devices. A wearable consumer electronic device is a computer that is subsumed into the personal space of the user controlled by the user and is always on and always accessible. Therefore among the most salient aspect of wearable consumer electronic devices should be small form factor and long battery lifetime. In this paper we propose a novel low-power real-time operating system (RTOS) specialized for the ARC(Actual Remote Control). An ARC is a wearable wristwatch-type remote controller it also can serve as a universal remote control for various consumer electronic devices. The proposed RTOS has about 9KB footprints and is equipped with low-power techniques composed of the dynamic power management and the device power management. Experimental results with wearable application show that we can save energy up to 47 % using the proposed low-power techniques(1).;2010
In this article we share our experiences of a large-scale five-year innovative programme to introduce mobile learning into health and social care (HSC) practice placement learning and assessment that bridges the divide between the university classroom and the practice setting in which these students learn. The outputs are from the Assessment Learning in Practice Settings (ALPS) Centre for Excellence in Teaching Learning (CETL) which is working towards a framework of interprofessional assessment of Common Competences in the HSC professions. The mobile assessment process and tools that have been developed and implemented and the outcomes of the first-stage evaluation of the mobile assessment tools are discussed from the student perspective.;2010
In this paper we describe an algorithm for generating distinctive behavior for Embodied Conversational Agents. To this aim we introduce the concepts of agent's general behavior tendency named Baseline and local behavior tendency called in turn Dynamicline. Depending on the communicative intentions of the agent the Baseline is modulated. The obtained behavior tendency corresponds to the Dynamicline which is then used to determine the nonverbal signals and their expressivity the agent will produce to communicate its intentions. We also propose a system to extract the movement expressivity of a human user standing in front of a camera. The extracted characteristics are then used to characterize the agent's Baseline. We end the paper by presenting an evaluation study of our model.;2010
In this paper we present an attempt to develop a speech recognition module for the Romanian language in order to be used in a dialogue system. The main characteristics of such a dialogue system are first discussed. Further we explain the design and acquisition of a spontaneous speech database for training the decoder: the design guidelines in developing the database as well as several practical issues encountered along with some triphones balancing statistics arc pointed out. Then the speech recognition architecture (based on components in the Hidden Markov Modeling Toolkit - HTK) is described in detail emphasizing the two aspects training and decoding. In the next section a discussion of several preliminary recognition results is provided emphasizing current limitations and the need to significantly increase the size of the database. A set of conclusions and perspectives are offered at the end of the paper.;2010
In this paper we present an innovative work on a multiagent joking conversational system. In our research so far we have shown that implementing humor into a chatterbot can visibly improve its performance. The results presented in this paper are the outcome of the next step of our work. They show that a multiagent system combining a conversational agent a pun generator and an emotiveness analysis engine works reasonably well in interactions with users. In the setup used in this research the emotiveness analysis agent analyses users' utterances and decides whether it is appropriate to tell a pun. Depending on the results of this analysis the agent chooses either the pun generator if the decision is that a joke should be told or the non-humor-equipped agent when the decision is different. Two evaluation experiments were conducted: user (first person) focused and automatic (emotiveness-analysis-based). In both we compared the performance of the multiagent joking system and a baseline (non-humorous) conversation agent. The results show that in both cases the humor-equipped engine was evaluated as better than the baseline agent. The results are discussed and some ideas for the future are given.;2010
In this paper we present our embodied conversational agent (ECA) capable of displaying a vast set of facial expressions to communicate its emotional states as well as its social relations. Our agent is able to superpose and mask its emotional states as well as fake or inhibit them. We defined complex facial expressions as expressions arising from these displays. In the following we describe a model based on fuzzy methods that enables to generate complex facial expressions of emotions. It uses fuzzy similarity to compute the degree of resemblance between facial expressions of the ECA. We also present an algorithm that adapts the facial behaviour of the agent depending on its social relationship with the interactants. This last algorithm is based on the theory of politeness by Brown and Levinson (1987). It outputs complex facial expressions that are socially adequate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we describe two series of experiments that examine audiovisual face-to-face interaction between naive human viewers and either a human interlocutor or a virtual conversational agent. The main objective is to analyze the interplay between speech activity and mutual gaze patterns during mediated face-to-face interactions. We first quantify the impact of deictic gaze patterns of our agent. We further aim at refining our experimental knowledge on mutual gaze patterns during human face-to-face interaction by using new technological devices such as non-invasive eye trackers and pinhole cameras and at quantifying the impact of a selection of cognitive states and communicative functions on recorded gaze patterns.

In this paper we present a weakly supervised learning approach for spoken language understanding in domain-specific dialogue systems. We model the task of spoken language understanding as a two-stage classification problem. Firstly the topic classifier is used to identify the topic of an input utterance. Secondly with the restriction of the recognized target topic the slot classifiers are trained to extract the corresponding slot-value pairs. It is mainly data-driven and requires only minimally annotated corpus for training whilst retaining the understanding robustness and deepness for spoken language. More importantly it allows that weakly supervised strategies are employed for training the two kinds of classifiers which could significantly reduce the number of labeled sentences. We investigated active learning and naive self-training for the two kinds of classifiers. Also we propose a practical method for bootstrapping topic-dependent slot classifiers from a small amount of labeled sentences. Experiments have been conducted in the context of the Chinese public transportation information inquiry domain and the English DARPA Communicator domain. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed SLU framework and demonstrate the possibility to reduce human labeling efforts significantly. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work we elaborate on a novel image-based system for creating video-realistic eye animations to arbitrary spoken output. These animations are useful to give a face to multimedia applications such as virtual operators in dialog systems. Our eye animation system consists of two parts: eye control unit and rendering engine which synthesizes eye animations by combining 3D and image-based models. The designed eye control unit is based on eye movement physiology and the statistical analysis of recorded human subjects. As already analyzed in previous publications eye movements vary while listening and talking. We focus on the latter and are the first to design a new model which fully automatically couples eye blinks and movements with phonetic and prosodic information extracted from spoken language. We extended the already known simple gaze model by refining mutual gaze to better model human eye movements. Furthermore we improved the eye movement models by considering head tilts torsion and eyelid movements. Mainly due to our integrated blink and gaze model and to the control of eye movements based on spoken language subjective tests indicate that participants are not able to distinguish between real eye motions and our animations which has not been achieved before.;2010
Interventions to improve pediatric blood pressure (BP) screening have not been well studied. The authors measured staff acceptance of 2 simple in-office interventions and measured the effect on physician recognition of elevated BP measurements. Group 1 used simplified normative pediatric BP tables affixed to the growth chart group 2 used a personal digital assistant program (PDA) to calculate BP percentiles as part of the vital signs and group 3 served as the control. Group detection rates by compliant (C) and noncompliant (NC) with the intervention were: (1) (BP table) C = 18% NC = 12% (2) (PDA) C = 33% NC = 26% and (3) (control) 18%. There was no statistically significant intervention effect with documented compliance (P =.27) nor was there an effect in the noncompliant records (P = .12). Although the interventions were used inconsistently their presence in the medical record did not improve performance. Future education and interventions are needed to reduce barriers to elevated pediatric BP recognition.;2010
Introduction: Inappropriate medication among elderly people increases the risk of adverse drug-drug interactions drug-related falls and hospital admissions. In order to prevent these effects it is necessary to obtain a pro. le of the patients' medication. A personal digital assistant (PDA) can be used as a medical decision support system (MDSS) to obtain a pro. le of the patients' medication and to check for inappropriate drugs and drug combinations and to reduce medication errors. Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate nurses' experiences of using a MDSS in a PDA with a barcode reader in order to obtain profiles of the patients' medication regarding drug-drug interactions therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly in home care. Methods: The LIFe-reader (R) is a MDSS in a PDA with a barcode reader. By scanning the drug packages in the patients' home the LIFe-reader (R) obtained profiles of the patients' medication and checked for drug-drug interactions therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly people. The LIFe-reader (R) also contained e. g. drug information and medical reference works. Nurses (n = 15) used the LIFe-reader (R) for five weeks during their nursing home care practice assignment. The nurses answered questionnaires about the content and functions of the LIFe-reader (R) before during and after the nursing home care practice assignment and were interviewed in focus groups. Descriptive statistics were used and content analysis was applied for qualitative data. Results: By using the LIFe-reader (R) the majority of the nurses found it easy to obtain profiles of the patients' medication and check for drug-drug interactions therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly people. Most nurses regarded the LIFe-reader (R) to reduce drug-related risks of falling and some thought it could reduce the drug-related admissions to hospitals. The scanning function was described as easy and time saving although not always possible to use. The LIFe-reader (R) was regarded as a useful and user-friendly MDSS but more content and functions were requested. We found that the LIFe-reader (R) has the potential to be a useful and user-friendly MDSS for nurses in home care when obtaining profiles of the patients' medication regarding drug-drug interactions therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly. A regular scanning of the patients' drugs in their home might support nurses and general practitioners (GPs) in reducing the inappropriate use of drugs. If the LIFe-reader (R) should be used in a larger scale among nurses more content and functions are necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
Is there any evidence that e-health-using information technology to manage patient care-can have a positive impact in developing countries? Our systematic review of evaluations of e-health implementations in developing countries found that systems that improve communication between institutions assist in ordering and managing medications and help monitor and detect patients who might abandon care show promise. Evaluations of personal digital assistants and mobile devices convincingly demonstrate that such devices can be very effective in improving data collection time and quality. Donors and funders should require and sponsor outside evaluations to ensure that future e-health investments are well-targeted.;2010
It is well known that help prompts shape how users talk to spoken dialogue systems. This study investigated the effect of help prompt placement on older users' interaction with a smart home interface. In the dynamic help condition help was only given in response to system errors in the inherent help condition it was also given at the start of each task. Fifteen older and sixteen younger users interacted with a smart home system using two different scenarios. Each scenario consisted of several tasks. The linguistic style users employed to communicate with the system (interaction style) was measured using the ratio of commands to the overall utterance length (keyword ratio) and the percentage of content words in the user's utterance that could be understood by the system (shared vocabulary). While the timing of help prompts did not affect the interaction style of younger users it was early task-specific help supported older users in adapting their interaction style to the system's capabilities. Well-placed help prompts can significantly increase the usability of spoken dialogue systems for older people.;2010
Knowledge of factors associated with the use of technology could inform the design of technology-based behavioral interventions. This study examined modifiable and nonmodifiable factors associated with technology-based self-monitoring. 123 participants with type 2 diabetes self-monitored diet using a personal digital assistant in a 6-month behavioral intervention. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine probability of nonadherent and suboptimally adherent behavior relative to adherent behavior. Sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with probability of self-monitoring. Probability of adherence generally was greater in the weeks preceding no group session and lower in the weeks following no group session or following skipped sessions. Non-modifiable factors suggested by the literature to be associated with poorer access to technology (lower income older age minority race and lower education) were not associated with probability of self-monitoring in this population.;2010
Many modern mobile devices such as mobile phones or Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are able to run Java applications such as games Internet browsers chat tools and so on. These applications perform some operations on the mobile device that are critical from the security point of view such as connecting to the Internet sending and receiving SMS messages connecting to other devices through the Bluetooth interface browsing the user's contact list and so on. Hence an adequate security support is required to protect the device from malicious applications. This paper proposes an enhanced security support for next generation Java Micro Edition platform. This support performs a runtime monitoring of the operations performed by the Java applications and enforces a security policy that defines which operations applications are allowed to perform. Two possible design approaches for the security support are presented and compared. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
Many researchers in the Human Robot Interaction (HRI) and Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) domains try to build robots and agents that exhibit human-like behavior in real-world close encounter situations. One major requirement for comparing such robots and agents is to have an objective quantitative metric for measuring naturalness in various kinds of interactions. Some researchers have already suggested techniques for measuring stress level awareness etc using physiological signals like Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP). One problem of available techniques is that they are only tested with extreme situations and cannot according to the analysis provided in this paper distinguish the response of human subjects in natural interaction situations. One other problem of the available techniques is that most of them require calibration and some times ad-hoc adjustment for every subject. This paper explores the usefulness of various kinds of physiological signals and statistics in distinguishing natural and unnatural partner behavior in a close encounter situation. The paper also explores the usefulness of these statistics in various time slots of the interaction. Based on this analysis a regressor was designed to measure naturalness in close encounter situations and was evaluated using human-human and human-robot interactions and shown to achieve statistically significant distinction between natural and unnatural situations.;2010
Measurement of quality of life is becoming increasingly important in health care. Self-reported quality of life is the preferred method of gathering this information but children are often excluded from this process their input being replaced by parent-proxy report. This feasibility study tested assessment of daily quality-of-life by a self-reported computerized method in boys with neuromuscular disorders. To establish feasibility the method was required to be engaging consistent and convenient. Ten boys aged 9-16 years were given a personal digital assistant (PDA) and prompted randomly eight times/day for 1 week to answer 19 questions about their daily experiences (including happiness mood self-esteem location and activity). Subjects completed sampling with an acceptable response rate (79%). Split-week reliability analysis for participant variability (r = 0.45-0.88) indicated acceptable consistency. Participants reported that the method was easy and convenient and analysis of standardized mean scores supported internal validity. The computerized method to assess daily quality of life from the child's perspective was feasible and may be useful to understand the impact of disease progression and interventions on day-to-day function.;2010
Methods. Forty-seven patients were included before initiation of adalimumab therapy and assessed at baseline and after 3 months. SJC and TJC were registered by the patients and thereafter by an experienced rheumatology specialist. Changes were correlated using Spearman's rank correlation test. Results. The correlations between SJC and TJC derived by the physician and the patient at baseline were excellent (r = 0.78 and 0.87 respectively P < 0.01 for both). After 3 months the correlations were less strong (0.645 and 0.745 respectively P < 0.001 for both). When using the patient-derived SJC/TJC for calculation of the DAS-28 (patDAS-28) similar values were obtained and correlations between DAS-28 and patDAS-28 were excellent (r = 0.91 at baseline r = 0.90 at 3 months). According to the EULAR response criteria the percentage of responders at the group level was nearly identical although there was some disagreement at the individual level when DAS-28 and patDAS-28 were used to determine response to therapy. Conclusion. Patient-reported SJC and TJC can in research settings be used instead of physician-reported ones. Patient-derived SJC and TJC may also make it possible for rheumatologists to obtain quantitative joint count recordings much more frequently than is feasible for traditional joint counts.;2010
Mobile devices can be used to deliver psychosocial interventions yet there is little prior application in severe mental illness. We provide the rationale design and preliminary data from 3 ongoing clinical trials of mobile interventions developed for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Project 1 used a personal digital assistant to prompt engagement in personalized self-management behaviors based on real-time data. Project 2 employed experience sampling through text messages to facilitate case management. Project 3 was built on group functional skills training for schizophrenia by incorporating between-session mobile phone contacts with therapists. Preliminary findings were of minimal participant attrition and no broken devices yet several operational and technical barriers needed to be addressed. Adherence was similar to that reported in nonpsychiatric populations with high participant satisfaction. Therefore mobile devices seem feasible and acceptable in augmenting psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness with future research in establishing efficacy cost effectiveness and ethical and safety protocols.;2010
Mobile devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are becoming increasingly popular tools to access the Internet Unfortunately the experience of users attempting to access web pages with these mobile devices has been less than satisfactory because of their small display areas slow communications links and low computing power In this paper we propose a trained scorer to estimate the mobile friendliness scores of web pages providing an indication of their suitability for mobile devices These scores help mobile friendly pages receive higher ranks in search results when mobile users seek information on the web Our experiments show that the search results re ranked by our mobile friendliness scores increase mobile user satisfaction.;2010
OBJECTIVE. Orthopedic injury and intracranial hemorrhage are commonly encountered in emergency radiology and accurate and timely diagnosis is important. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the diagnostic accuracy of handheld computing devices is comparable to that of monitors that might be used in emergency teleconsultation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Two handheld devices a Dell Axim personal digital assistant (PDA) and an Apple iPod Touch device were studied. The diagnostic efficacy of each device was tested against that of secondary-class monitors (primary class being clinical workstation display) for each of two image types-posteroanterior wrist radiographs and slices from CT of the brain-yielding four separate observer performance studies. Participants read a bank of 30 wrist or brain images searching for a specific abnormality (distal radial fracture fresh intracranial bleed) and rated their confidence in their decisions. A total of 168 readings by examining radiologists of the American Board of Radiology were gathered and the results were subjected to receiver operating characteristics analysis. RESULTS. In the PDA brain CT study the scores of PDA readings were significantly higher than those of monitor readings for all observers (p <= 0.01) and for radiologists who were not neuroradiology specialists (p <= 0.05). No statistically significant differences between handheld device and monitor findings were found for the PDA wrist images or in the iPod Touch device studies although some comparisons approached significance. CONCLUSION. Handheld devices show promise in the field of emergency teleconsultation for detection of basic orthopedic injuries and intracranial hemorrhage. Further investigation is warranted.;2010
Objective To evaluate drug interaction software programs and determine their accuracy in identifying drug-drug interactions that may occur in intensive care units. Setting The study was developed in Brazil. Method Drug interaction software programs were identified through a bibliographic search in PUBMED and in LILACS (database related to the health sciences published in Latin American and Caribbean countries). The programs' sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive values were determined to assess their accuracy in detecting drug-drug interactions. The accuracy of the software programs identified was determined using 100 clinically important interactions and 100 clinically unimportant ones. Stockley's Drug Interactions 8th edition was employed as the gold standard in the identification of drug-drug interaction. Main outcome Sensitivity specificity positive and negative predictive values. Results The programs studied were: Drug Interaction Checker (DIC) Drug-Reax (DR) and Lexi-Interact (LI). DR displayed the highest sensitivity (0.88) and DIC showed the lowest (0.69). A close similarity was observed among the programs regarding specificity (0.88-0.92) and positive predictive values (0.88-0.89). The DIC had the lowest negative predictive value (0.75) and DR the highest (0.91). Conclusion The DR and LI programs displayed appropriate sensitivity and specificity for identifying drug-drug interactions of interest in intensive care units. Drug interaction software programs help pharmacists and health care teams in the prevention and recognition of drug-drug interactions and optimize safety and quality of care delivered in intensive care units.;2010
Objective: The Dietary Intake Monitoring Application (DIMA) is an electronic dietary self-monitor developed for use on a personal digital assistant (PDA). This paper describes how computer information numerical and visual literacy were considered in development of DIMA. Methods: An iterative participatory design approach was used. Forty individuals receiving hemodialysis at an urban inner-city facility primarily middle-aged and African American were recruited. Results: Computer literacy was considered by assessing abilities to complete traditional/nontraditional PDA tasks. Information literacy was enhanced by including a Universal-Product-Code (UPC) scanner picture icons for food with no UPC code voice recorder and culturally sensitive food icons. Numerical literacy was enhanced by designing DIMA to compute real-time totals that allowed individuals to see their consumption relative to their dietary prescription. Visual literacy was considered by designing the graphical interface to convey intake data over a 24-h period that could be accurately interpreted by patients. Pictorial icons for feedback graphs used objects understood by patients. Practice implications: Preliminary data indicate the application is extremely helpful for individuals as they self-monitor their intake. If desired DIMA could also be used for dietary counseling.

Objective: This study examined the feasibility of using wireless mobile devices (MDs) to collect daily alcohol information among college students in particular examining feasibility in the context of costs associated with the use of wireless MDs. This study reports on practical aspects of using MDs to collect alcohol data including compliance technical success user preferences for completing MD-based assessments and cost. Setting: The study took place at a large public university in the south-eastern United States. Design: A two-group randomized design was used. A daily assessment of alcohol use administered using wireless MDs was completed by a group of college students (n=86) for 30 days and compared to a paper-based (PB) daily assessment of alcohol use completed by a second group of college students (n=83) over the same time period. Results: Completion rates for the MD assessment (85.8 per cent) were comparable to the PB assessment (97.6 per cent) given the differences in mode of administration. Participants found the MDs easy to use (83.7 per cent) easy to read (94.2 per cent) and on average liked completing the daily MD assessment (M 4.47 SD 1.16) significantly more than respondents liked completing the PB assessment (M 3.88 SD 1.08 t [164] 3.84 p < 0.001). Few participants in the MD group reported that they were uncomfortable (9.3 per cent) or nervous (2.3 per cent) completing daily assessments using the MDs. Conclusion: Results indicate that the feasibility of using MDs for data collection may be influenced by user preferences and should be tested on different health behaviours in more diverse populations.;2010
Objective: To assess the feasibility of iPhone-based teleradiology as a potential solution for the diagnosis of acute cervico-dorsal spine trauma. Materials and Methods: We have developed a solution that allows visualization of images on the iPhone. Our system allows rapid remote secure visualization of medical images without storing patient data on the iPhone. This retrospective study is comprised of cervico-dorsal computed tomogram (CT) scan examination of 75 consecutive patients having clinically suspected cervico-dorsal spine fracture. Two radiologists reviewed CT scan images on the iPhone. Computed tomogram spine scans were analyzed for vertebral body fracture and posterior elements fractures any associated subluxation-dislocation and cord lesion. The total time taken from the launch of viewing application on the iPhone until interpretation was recorded. The results were compared with that of a diagnostic workstation monitor. Inter-rater agreement was assessed. Results: The sensitivity and accuracy of detecting vertebral body fractures was 80% and 97% by both readers using the iPhone system with a perfect inter-rater agreement (kappa: I). The sensitivity and accuracy of detecting posterior elements fracture was 75% and 98% for Reader 1 and 50% and 97% for Reader 2 using the iPhone. There was good inter-rater agreement (kappa: 0.66) between both readers. No statistically significant difference was noted between time on the workstation and the iPhone system. Conclusion: iPhone-based teleradiology system is accurate in the diagnosis of acute cervico-dorsal spinal trauma. It allows rapid remote secure visualization of medical images without storing patient data on the iPhone.;2010
Objective: To compare the morning and afternoon/evening functioning of children with ADHD treated in the community with either atomoxetine or long-acting stimulants and reported to be doing well. Method: 109 8- to 12-year-olds and their mothers participated in one of three groups: stimulants (STIM N = 26) atomoxetine (ATMX N = 25) or comparison (COMP N = 58). Mothers completed morning and evening electronic diaries installed on personal digital assistants throughout an entire week rating the child's behaviors and moods as well as their own moods and perceptions. Results: There was no evidence that ongoing pharmacotherapy fully normalized the behaviors of children with ADHD: Mothers in both ADHD groups reported higher rates of child inattention hyperactivity/impulsivity oppositionality and negative affect and lower levels of parenting efficacy and positive affect than did COMP mothers. Although the behavioral profiles were generally comparable for the STIM and ATMX groups there were indications of better functioning in the ATMX group during mornings only. Conclusion: Children treated in the community with either STIM or ATMX appear to have similar behavioral profiles suggesting that medication decisions be guided by other factors such as comorbid disorders child and parent preferences and effects on nontargeted behaviors and moods.

Objective: To examine whether physicians' use of information technology (IT) was associated with better knowledge of drug costs. Study Design/Methods: A 2007 statewide survey of 247 primary care physicians in Hawaii regarding IT use and self-reported knowledge of formularies copayments and retail prices. Results: Approximately 8 in 10 physicians regularly used IT in clinical care: 60% Internet 54% e-prescribing 43% electronic health records (EHRs) and 37% personal digital assistants (PDAs). However fewer than 1 in 5 often knew drug costs when prescribing and more than 90% said lack of knowledge of formularies and copayments remained a barrier to considering drug costs for patients. In multivariate analyses adjusting for sex practice size years in practice number of formularies and use of clinical resources (eg pharmacists) use of the Internet-but not e-prescribing EHRs or PDAs-was associated with physicians reporting slightly better knowledge of copayments (adjusted predicted percentage of 23% vs 11% P = .04). No type of IT was associated with better knowledge of formularies or retail prices. Conclusions: Despite high rates of IT use there was only a modest association between physicians' use of IT and better knowledge of drug costs. Future investments in health IT should consider how IT design can be improved to make it easier for physicians to access cost information at the point of care.

Objective: To measure prevalence of HIV and syphilis and describe characteristics of sex work among female sex workers (FSWs) in Hargeisa Somaliland Somalia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey recruited 237 FSWs using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). A face-to-face structured interview using handheld-assisted personal interviewing (HAPI) on personal digital assistants (PDAs) was completed and blood collected for serological testing. Results: FSWs 15-19 years old accounted for 6.9% of the population 20-24 year-old constituted an additional 18.0%. The majority (86.6%) never attended school. International (59.0%) and interzonal (10.7%) migration was common. Most (95.7%) reported no other source of income 13.8% had five or more clients in the last 7 days. A minority (38.4%) had heard of STIs even fewer (6.9%) held no misconceptions about HIV. Only 24% of FSW reported using a condom at last transactional sex and 4% reported ever been tested for HIV. HIV prevalence was 5.2% and syphilis prevalence was 3.1%. Conclusion: Sex work in Hargeisa Somaliland Somalia is characterized by high numbers of sexual acts and extremely low knowledge of HIV. This study illustrates the need for targeted HIV prevention interventions focusing on HIV testing risk-reduction awareness raising and review of condom availability and distribution mechanisms among FSWs and males engaging with FSWs.

Objectives In-patient rounds are a major educational and patient care-related activity in teaching hospitals. This exploratory study was conducted to gain better understanding of team interactions during rounds and to assess student and resident perceptions of the utility of this activity. Methods Data were collected by a non-participant observer using a novel personal digital assistant (PDA)-based data collection system. Medical students and residents completed surveys related to the utility of rounds for patient care education and ward administration. Analyses included descriptive and correlational statistics and the use of social network analysis to describe and measure patterns of interaction. Results Eighteen different rounds were observed. On average rounds were 106 minutes long and included discussion of 22.1 patients. Three different patterns of verbal interaction were observed. In most cases the attending physician was most talkative and many students and residents spoke infrequently. More time was devoted to patients discussed earlier in the round regardless of diagnosis. Observed teaching was primarily factual and teacher-centred. Attending physician-dominated sessions were rated more highly for educational utility than those that were more interactive. Conclusions In-patient rounds are an example of an opportunity for powerful work-based learning. In this study we used a novel method of observational data collection and analysis to examine this activity and found that it may not always live up to its educational potential. Rounds are time-consuming and are generally dominated by the attending physician. Individuals who are not directly involved in a case are often minimally involved. Participants felt that rounds were most useful for patient care and contrary to expectations students and residents viewed attending physician-dominated sessions as more educational. To improve the educational impact of rounds the order of patient discussion should be planned to highlight specific teaching points preceptors (teaching staff) should ensure that all team members are actively engaged in the process and learning should be made explicit.;2010
Objectives: To assess (1) preference of parental use of an electronic diary (e-diary) over a paper diary to record continuous infant and caregiver behaviors over 7 days (2) whether e-diary recordings would differ in systematic ways from those obtained by paper diaries and (3) frequency of diary entries when parents provide entries when convenient. Methods: Mothers of normal newborns were randomized at 5 weeks infant age to a paper diary first (n = 34) or e-diary first (n = 35) group. With 3 days between mothers completed 7-day recordings on both the paper Baby's Day Diary and an analogous personal digital assistant e-diary for infant (sleep awake alert feeding fussing crying inconsolable crying) and caregiver (carrying/holding moving) behaviors and completed post diary ease-of-use ratings and poststudy preference ratings. Results: Mothers found e-diaries less bothersome but similarly disruptive and enjoyable to paper diaries. At study end more found e-diaries easier to use less bothersome and more efficient. E-diary behaviors were consistently more frequent but rarely different in duration then paper diary behaviors. Time-stamped e-diary entries (1) generally declined across weeks (2) were higher if e-diaries were used first and (3) settled at a modal 2 to 3 entries/day by the second week. Conclusions: For behavioral recording of infant and caregiver behaviors mothers generally expressed more approval for e-diaries than paper diaries but neither was considered onerous. E-diaries consistently report more frequent but similar durations of behaviors. If recording when convenient daily diary entries trend toward 2 to 3 entries a day. The e-diary results provide convergent evidence that paper diary recordings of common infant and caregiver behavior durations provide good estimates of durations but that behavioral frequencies may be underestimated.;2010
Objectives: To assess whether community-based care delivered by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs) could replace clinic-based HIV care. Design: Prospective cluster randomized controlled clinical trial. Setting: Villages surrounding 1 rural clinic in western Kenya. Subjects: HIV-infected adults clinically stable on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Intervention: The intervention group received monthly Personal Digital Assistant supported home assessments by PLWAs with clinic appointments every 3 months. The control group received standard of care monthly clinic visits. Main Outcomes Measured: Viral load CD4 count Karnofsky score stability of ART regimen opportunistic infections pregnancies and number of clinic visits. Results: After 1 year there were no significant intervention-control differences with regard to detectable viral load mean CD4 count decline in Karnofsky score change in ART regimen new opportunistic infection or pregnancy rate. Intervention patients made half as many clinic visits as did controls (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Community-based care by PLWAs resulted in similar clinical outcomes as usual care but with half the number of clinic visits. This pilot study suggests that task-shifting and mobile technologies can deliver safe and effective community-based care to PLWAs expediting ART rollout and increasing access to treatment while expanding the capacity of health care institutions in resource-constrained environments.;2010
Over the last two years the Korean Expressway Corporation (KEC) has developed a location-based dynamic route guidance system. The targets of the new system are the users of mobile-phones the internet and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant) etc. Spatially the system covers 2804 km of expressway and 484 km of national highway where the travel time collection systems are installed. The developed routing system is in many aspects different from the existing telematics-related services in Korea. It is based on predicted traffic information rather than real-time traffic information and provides web and location based in-vehicle route guidance system. It utilizes GML (Geographical Markup Language) and GIS (Geographical Information System) in order to create GML DB (Data Base) and follows the standard format of the ISO (International Standard Organization) for GDF (Geographic Data File). Initial results of the proposed system including the accuracy of route travel time forecasts and the soundness of suggested routes were found to be acceptable. After development the KEC has successfully tested a pilot service of the new system and is currently preparing for a full-scale implementation.;2010
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) were first used by the public in the early 1990s Initially used as a device to manage personal information these devices quickly evolved Currently PDAs are capable of storing and exchanging large amounts of information which truly make them handheld computers As such they have great value for professional use Health care professionals require access to ever-expanding knowledge and PDAs or other handheld computer devices can serve as valuable tools for education information storage and retrieval and clinical practice This article describes the use of PDAs by undergraduate and graduate nursing students during their educational process A descriptive study was conducted at a small private university school of nursing at which all nursing students receive PDAs prior to their first clinical experiences Findings from the study indicated that students used their PDAs for both classroom and clinical activities and that drug reference software was the most frequently used software application Information was also obtained about the facilitators and barriers to PDA use (Index words Personal digital assistants Nursing education Students Information) J Prof Nurs 26371-376 2010 (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved;2010
Pervasive healthcare support through mobile information technology solutions is playing an increasing role in the attempt to improve healthcare and reduce costs. Despite the apparent attractiveness many mobile applications have failed or have not been implemented as predicted. Among factors possibly leading to such outcomes technology adoption is a key problem. This must be investigated early in the development process because healthcare is a particularly sensitive area with vital social implications. Moreover it is important to investigate technology acceptance using the support of scientific tools validated for relevant information systems research. This article presents an empirical study based on the Technology Acceptance Model 2 in mobile homecare nursing. The study elicited the perceptions of 91 Canadian nurses who used personal digital assistants for 1 month in their daily activities. A partial least squares modeling data analysis revealed that nurse's perception of usefulness is the main factor in the adoption of mobile technology having subjective norm and image within the organization as significant antecedents. Overall this study was the first attempt at investigating scientifically through a pertinent information systems research model user adoption of mobile systems by homecare nursing personnel.;2010
Possibilities of modeling in order to obtain a program for investments and its financing are presented. We illustrate starting from two case study the mode of simultaneous programming by using an heuristic model conceived by Dean and a linear programming model. For the second model the results obtained in conversational system are explained. The parametric analysis of resources (feasible financing) and of the unit income obtained by purchasing the investment objects pointing out the consequences of the different variations upon the objective function value is achieved.;2010
Problem Field trials require extensive data preparation and complex logistics. The use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) can bypass many of the traditional steps that are necessary in a paper-based data entry system. Approach We programmed designed and supervised the use of PDAs for a large survey enumeration and mass vaccination campaign. Local setting The project was implemented in Zanzibar in the United Republic of Tanzania. Zanzibar is composed of two main islands Unguja and Pemba where outbreaks of cholera have been reported since the 1970s. Relevant changes PDAs allowed us to digitize information at the initial point of contact with the respondents. Immediate response by the system in case of error helped ensure the quality and reliability of the data. PDAs provided quick data summaries that allowed subsequent research activities to be implemented in a timely fashion. Lessons learnt Portability immediate recording and linking of information enhanced structure data collection in our study. PDAs could be more useful than paper-based systems for data collection in the field especially in impoverished settings in developing countries.;2010
Product information given in purchase situations influences purchase behavior. In online purchase situations the use of recommendation agents increases the value of product information as information becomes adaptive and thus more relevant to consumers' information needs. Correspondingly mobile recommendation agents (MRAs) may also increase the value of product information in bricks-and-mortar stores. In this sense product information is not only adaptive but can also be requested at any place such as in front of products consumers are interested in. Because unprecedented we investigate the use of a MRA that is virtually bound to a physical product via an RFID-enabled mobile device and provides product information. Based on Theory of Planned Behavior Innovation Diffusion Theory and Technology Acceptance Model we develop a model to better understand the impact of MRAs on usage intentions product purchases and store preferences of consumers. This model is then tested in a lab experiment (n = 47). Among high usability scores results indicate that perceived usefulness of a MRA influences product purchases predicts usage intentions and store preferences of consumers. Thus new business models for retail stores can be considered in which MRAs satisfy both the information needs of consumers and the communication needs of retailers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Proxy signatures have found extensive use in authenticating agents acting on behalf of users in applications such as grid computing communications systems personal digital assistants information management and e-commerce. Importance of proxy signatures has been repeatedly highlighted by applied cryptographers through different variations namely threshold proxy signatures blind proxy signatures and so forth. Unfortunately most recent constructions of proxy signatures only improve on minor weaknesses of previously built schemes and most often do not deliver formal security guarantees. In this study the authors propose a technique to construct provably secure proxy signature schemes using trapdoor hash functions that can be used to authenticate and authorise agents acting on behalf of users in agent-based computing systems. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach for creating practical instances by constructing a discrete log-based instantiation of the proposed generic technique that achieves superior performance in terms of verification overhead and signature size compared with existing proxy signature schemes. Formal definitions security specifications and a detailed theoretical analysis including correctness security and performance of the proposed proxy signature scheme have been provided.;2010
Purpose - Conversational agents are natural language interaction interfaces designed to simulate conversation with a real person. This paper seeks to investigate current development and applications of these systems worldwide while focusing on their availability in Canadian libraries. It aims to argue that it is both timely and conceivable for Canadian libraries to consider adopting conversational agents to enhance not replace face-to-face human interaction. Potential users include library web site tour guides automated virtual reference and readers' advisory librarians and virtual story-tellers. To provide background and justification for this argument the paper seeks to review agents from classic implementations to state-of-the-art prototypes: how they interact with users produce language and control conversational behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The web sites of the 20 largest Canadian libraries were surveyed to assess the extent to which specific language-related technologies are offered in Canada including conversational agents. An exemplified taxonomy of four pragmatic purposes that conversational agents currently serve outside libraries educational informational assistive and socially interactive is proposed and translated into library settings. Findings - As of early 2010 artificially intelligent conversational systems have been found to be virtually non-existent in Canadian libraries while other innovative technologies proliferate (e.g. social media tools). These findings motivate the need for a broader awareness and discussion within the US community of these systems' applicability and potential for library purposes. Originality/value - This paper is intended for reflective information professionals who seek a greater understanding of the issues related to adopting conversational agents in libraries as this topic is scarcely covered in the LIS literature. The pros and cons are discussed and insights offered into perceptions of intelligence (artificial or not) as well as the fundamentally social nature of human-computer interaction.;2010
Purpose The purposes of this study were to develop a taxonomy for detection of errors related to hypertension management and to apply the taxonomy to retrospectively analyze the documentation of nurses in Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) training. Method We developed the Hypertension Diagnosis and Management Error Taxonomy and applied it in a sample of adult patient encounters (N=15862) that were documented in a personal digital assistant-based clinical log by registered nurses in APN training. We used Standard Query Language queries to retrieve hypertension-related data from the central database. The data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Result Blood pressure was documented in 77.5% (n=12297) of encounters 21% had high blood pressure values. Missed diagnosis incomplete diagnosis and misdiagnosis rates were 63.7% 6.8% and 7.5% respectively. In terms of treatment the omission rates were 17.9% for essential medications and 69.9% for essential patient teaching. Contraindicated anti-hypertensive medications were documented in 12% of encounters with co-occurring diagnoses of hypertension and asthma. Conclusion The Hypertension Diagnosis and Management Error Taxonomy was useful for identifying errors based on documentation in a clinical log. The results provide an initial understanding of the nature of errors associated with hypertension diagnosis and management of nurses in APN training. The information gained from this study can contribute to educational interventions that promote APN competencies in identification and management of hypertension as well as overall patient safety and informatics competencies.

Purpose. The current status of external and internal workload and productivity measurement systems and strategies to improve their use to maximize overall pharmacy department operational performance and staffing effectiveness are described. Summary. The use of operational bench-marking is increasing within health systems as a tool for continuously measuring and improving departmental performance and evaluating departmental success. Unfortunately software used for benchmarking purposes is available through a limited number of commercial vendors and consultants and these systems are unable to effectively measure department operations and overall performance. The theoretical value of benchmarking and productivity measurement systems including a description of the various definitions tools and data sources for comparing pharmacy productivity data is summarized. The limitations of commercially available vendor productivity monitoring systems and desired strategies for improving their use are also reviewed. Preferred productivity and cost metrics for measuring pharmacy department effectiveness are suggested and strategies for obtaining value from external and internal productivity monitoring systems are explored. Conclusion. Challenges with external operational benchmarking and internal productivity monitoring systems are numerous. These systems rarely measure the quality of pharmacy services provided and their effect on patient care outcomes and the total cost of care. Benchmarking vendors must modernize their software and develop internal checks to confirm data integrity in order to make their products more useful and reliable. In addition data supporting the patient care role of the pharmacist should be integrated into all productivity monitoring systems and be used to demonstrate the positive impact of pharmacy services on the total cost and quality of patient care.;2010
Purpose: Previous studies have found that inappropriate assessment of cancer pain can lead to inadequate pain management. To improve assessment it may be helpful to collect real-time data in a natural environment using computerized ecological momentary assessment (cEMA). Therefore the aim of the study was to develop a personal digital assistant (PDA) system to collect information on symptoms such as pain and mood states in patients with cancer using cEMA. Methods: Following a pilot study in inpatients with cancer the second phase of the study involved patients with terminal cancer receiving home hospice care. These patients were asked to record their symptoms in a PDA (a palm-sized portable device) several times per day for a week when they took rescue medications and when an alarm sounded. At the end of the week an interview on the usability of the device was conducted and overall response rates were calculated. Results: Fifteen patients completed the second phase of the study. Their median age was 64 years and the median survival time after the study period was 22 days. The overall response rates were 90.3% to the sound of the alarm and 80.2% after taking rescue medications. The user-friendliness of the device was rated as 8.8 on a scale of 0 (worst) to 10 (best). Conclusions: The cEMA technique using a PDA might be applicable to patients with cancer in palliative care to evaluate symptoms in a natural setting. This system may also be useful for managing symptoms such as pain and mood states in patients with cancer.;2010
PURPOSE: This study was designed to raise awareness of the materials devices and Internet resources available to improve adherence to use of medications for the treatment of glaucoma and to review new devices under development. METHODS: A review of current indexed literature and Internet resources was conducted. RESULTS: A variety of educational brochures pamphlets and fact sheets promoting adherence to ocular hypotensive medications are available through multiple organizations and are easily accessed and ordered on the Internet. Video and Web-based patient educational tools have been designed to support patient adherence to glaucoma management plans and promote open dialogue between patients and providers. Reminder and recall systems that integrate with office software can be sent to cell phones as well as e-mails and personal digital assistant (PDAs) alerting patients to upcoming appointments and reminding them to instill their drops. Bottle devices with dosing support (timers with audible and visual signals and dispensing aids) and electronic monitoring have been shown to promote adherence. New products currently under development to improve the delivery of medications include nanoparticles punctal plugs and contact lenses that release glaucoma medications. CONCLUSIONS: Many educational materials services Internet resources and devices are available to optometrists to encourage patient adherence to glaucoma treatment and management.

Purpose: To evaluate the usability of mobile information terminals such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) or Tablet personal computers to improve access to information resources for nurses and to explore the relationship between PDA or Tablet-supported information resources and outcomes. Background: The authors evaluated an initiative of the Nursing Secretariat Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care which provided nurses with PDAs and Tablet PCs to enable Internet access to information resources. Nurses had access to drug and medical reference information best practice guidelines (BPGs) and to abstracts of recent research studies. Method: The authors took place over a 12-month period. Diffusion of Innovation theory and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) model guided the selection of variables for study. A longitudinal design involving questionnaires was used to evaluate the impact of the mobile technologies on barriers to research utilization perceived quality of care and on nurses' job satisfaction. The setting was 29 acute care long-term care home care and correctional organizations in Ontario Canada. The sample consisted of 488 frontline-nurses. Results: Nurses most frequently consulted drug and medical reference information Google and Nursing PLUS. Overall nurses were most satisfied with the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) BPGs and rated the RNAO BPGs as the easiest resource to use. Among the PDA and Tablet users there was a significant improvement in research awareness/values and in communication of research. There was also for the PDA users only a significant improvement over time in perceived quality of care and job satisfaction but primarily in long-term care settings. Implications: It is feasible to provide nurses with access to evidence-based practice resources via mobile information technologies to reduce the barriers to research utilization.;2010
Recently a patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 has been increasing in Japan. The patient should be managed not only by a specialist but also by himself focusing his attention on the improvement of his lifestyle at home. In the present study we tried to develop a health management support system by which a diabetic patient in early stage can easily enter his daily life information i.e. the biological information such as the data of blood sugar levels and blood pressure levels etc. the information of exercise and diet and send the information to the medical institution with a personal digital assistant (PDA). Afterwards the patient can receive health instruction information by the physician in charge for self-care at his home with a PDA. The daily life information sent from the patient is stored in a server installed at the medical institution and analyzed. The physician can obtain the results of analysis by using a PC and send the instruction information necessary for patient management to the patient at home by using e-mail after diagnosing the patient's condition by the system. To evaluate usability of the developed patient information input system with a PDA an experiment was conducted by corporation of 20 volunteers who were possible self management and whose age's range from 20s to 60s by questionnaire survey. As a result almost examinees answered that lifestyle information could be easily entered by the sense like a mobile-phone and lots of positive opinions were obtained.;2010
Recently more and more researchers have been exploring uses of mobile technology that support new instructional strategies. Based on research findings related to peer and self assessment this study developed a Mobile Assessment Participation System (MAPS) using Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) as the platform In addition. the study proposes an implementation model of the MAPS that should facilitate the effectiveness of self- and peer-assessment in classrooms The researcher argues that teachers and students can benefit from MAPS in various regards including more flexible assessment arrangement more efficient use of time and more opportunities for student reflection on learning and assessment. Thirty-seven students taking teacher-education courses with the researcher participated in this study and these students employed the MAPS to conduct two-round assessment activities that would help these students assess both their own and one another's final projects Both the students' valid responses in a survey herein and scores obtained from the assessment activities confirmed the benefits of the MAPS and its implementation model Yet the students voiced such concerns as the objectivity of peer-assessment and the difficulty of providing constructive feedback and the correlation analysis indicated a lack of consistency between teacher-grading and student-grading (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Relational agents are computational artifacts such as animated screen-based characters or social robots that are designed to establish a sense of rapport trust and even therapeutic alliance with patients using ideal therapeutic relationships between human counselors and patients as role models. We describe the development and evaluation of several such agents designed for health counseling and behavioral-change interventions in which a therapeutic alliance is established with patients in order to enhance the efficacy of the intervention. We also discuss the promise of using such agents as adjuncts to clinical psychiatry a range of possible applications and some of the challenges and ethical issues in developing and fielding them in psychiatric interventions.</.;2010
SETTING : Improved documentation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and care among tuberculosis (TB) patients is needed to strengthen TB-HIV programs. In 2007 Kenya piloted the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) instead of paper registers to collect TB-HIV surveillance data from TB clinics. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability data quality and usefulness of PDAs. DESIGN: We interviewed four of 31 district coordinators who collected data in PDAs for patients initiating TB treatment from April to June 2007. In 10 of 93 clinics we randomly selected patient records for comparison with corresponding records in paper registers or PDAs. Using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests we compared missing data proportions in paper registers with PDAs. We evaluated PDA usefulness by analyzing PDA data from all 93 clinics. RESULTS: PDAs were well accepted. Patient records were more frequently missing (28/97 vs. 1/112 P < 0.001) and data fields more frequently incomplete (148/1449 vs. 167/2331 P = 0.03) in PDAs compared with paper registers. PDAs however facilitated clinic-level analyses: 48/93 (52%) clinics were not reaching the targets of testing of TB patients for HIV and 8 (9%) clinics were providing <80% of TB-HIV co-infected patients with cotrimoxazole (CTX). CONCLUSION: PDAs had high rates of missing data but helped identify clinics that were undertesting for HIV or underprescribing CTX.;2010
Several studies have shown that body satisfaction affects interpersonal functioning. However few have studied the specific interpersonal correlates of another important body image dimension appearance investment-that is the importance a woman places on appearance. We used an experience sampling design with PDA (personal digital assistant) devices to assess how 92 college women's appearance investment is related to perceptions of everyday social interactions and to investigate the association of these perceptions with mood and self-esteem. For 1 week participants completed electronic diaries of their mood self-esteem and perceptions of one-on-one interactions. High appearance investment was associated with a stronger relationship between perceived communion of the interaction and negative mood and self-esteem. Notably highly appearance-invested women did not report differences in average momentary levels of perceived communion or agency in interactions negative mood or self-esteem when compared to women with lower appearance investment. In contrast women with low body satisfaction reported lower average perceptions of communion and self-esteem as well as higher average negative mood compared to women with higher body satisfaction but no relationships among perceptions and self-esteem and mood were found. Thus self-esteem and negative mood in women high in appearance investment might be contingent on perceptions of communion in interactions even though they appear to have average levels of mood and self-esteem in general. This mood and self-esteem contingency could predispose appearance-invested women to psychological distress or eating pathology.;2010
Small devices such its personal digital assistants (PDAs) are widely used to access the World Wide Web (Web). However accessing the Web from small devices is affected by poor interface bandwidth Such its Small keyboards and limited pointing devices. There is little empirical work investigating the input difficulties caused by such insufficient facilities however anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a link between able-bodied users of the mobile Web and motor impaired users of the Web oil desktop computers. This being the case we could transfer the solutions which already exists for motor impaired users into the mobile Web and vice versa. This paper presents a user study that investigates the input errors of mobile Web users in both typing and pointing. The study identifies six types of typing errors and three types of pointing errors shared between our two user domains. We find that mobile Web users often confuse the different characters located oil the same key press keys that are adjacent to the target key and miss certain key presses. When using a stylus they also click in the wrong places slide the Stylus during multiple clicks and make errors when dragging. Our results confirm that despite using different input devices mobile Web users share common problems with motor impaired desktop users and we therefore surmise that it will be beneficial to transfer available Solutions between these user domains in order to address their common problems.

So far predictions of user quality judgments in response to spoken dialog systems have been achieved on the basis of interaction parameters describing the dialog e.g. in the PARADISE framework. These parameters do not take into account the temporal position of events happening in the dialog. It seems promising to apply sequence classification algorithms to the raw annotations of the data instead of interaction parameters describing the overall dialog. As dialogs can be of very different length Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Markov Chains (MC) are handy because they describe the likelihood of traversing to a state given only the previous state and the transition probability thus they can be trained and applied to sequences of different lengths. This paper analyzes the feasibility of predicting user judgments with HMMs and MCs. In order to test the models we acquire data with different types of users forcing users to do as similar interactions as possible and asking for user judgments after each turn. This allows comparing predicted distributions of judgments to the distributions measured empirically. We also apply the models to less rich corpora and compare them with results from Linear Regression models as used in the PARADISE framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2010
Spoken dialog systems have difficulty selecting which action to take in a given situation because recognition and understanding errors are prevalent due to noise and unexpected inputs. To solve this problem this paper presents a hybrid approach to improving robustness of the dialog manager by using agenda-based and example-based dialog modeling. This approach can exploit it-best hypotheses to determine the current dialog state in the dialog manager and keep track of the dialog state using a discourse interpretation algorithm based on an agenda graph and a focus stack. Given the agenda graph and multiple recognition hypotheses the system can predict the next action to maximize multi-level score functions and trigger error recovery strategies to handle exceptional cases due to misunderstandings or unexpected focus shifts. The proposed method was tested by developing a spoken dialog system for a building guidance domain in an intelligent service robot. This system was then evaluated by simulated and real users. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively develop robust dialog management for spoken dialog systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
Tailoring the linguistic content of automatically generated descriptions to the preferences of a target user has been well demonstrated to be an effective way to produce higher-quality output that may even have a greater impact on user behaviour. It is known that the non-verbal behaviour of an embodied agent can have a significant effect on users' responses to content presented by that agent. However to date no-one has examined the contribution of non-verbal behaviour to the effectiveness of user tailoring in automatically generated embodied output. We describe a series of experiments designed to address this question. We begin by introducing a multimodal dialogue system designed to generate descriptions and comparisons tailored to user preferences and demonstrate that the user-preference tailoring is detectable to an overhearer when the output is presented as synthesised speech. We then present a multimodal corpus consisting of the annotated facial expressions used by a speaker to accompany the generated tailored descriptions and verify that the most characteristic positive and negative expressions used by that speaker are identifiable when resynthesised on an artificial talking head. Finally we combine the corpus-derived facial displays with the tailored descriptions to test whether the addition of the non-verbal channel improves users' ability to detect the intended tailoring comparing two strategies for selecting the displays: one based on a simple corpus-derived rule and one making direct use of the full corpus data. The performance of the subjects who saw displays selected by the rule-based strategy was not significantly different than that of the subjects who got only the linguistic content while the subjects who saw the data-driven displays were significantly worse at detecting the correctly tailored output. We propose a possible explanation for this result and also make recommendations for developers of future systems that may make use of an embodied agent to present user-tailored content.;2010
Teaching pendant is a handheld device by which a human can control a robot The main functions of a teaching pendant are moving the robot teaching it about the locations running robot programs and jogging the axes A teaching pendant is usually connected to the robot by a cable. The cable connection and the size of the teaching pendant generally do not pose a problem when the robot controller is separate from the robot. However a large teaching pendant connected by a cable is not suitable for a self-propelled mobile robot with an internal controller This paper describes the Communication network of a personal data assistant (PDA) as a wireless teaching pendant for a mobile shipbuilding welding robot with embedded controller system that welds and moves autonomously inside the double hull structure of a ship A double hull is a closed structure that has only a few access holes. it is very difficult and dangerous to weld components inside a double hull structure because of fumes. poisonous gas. and high temperatures. Using a wireless teaching pendant has the following advantages: (1) there are no limits to the welding activities that can take place (2) the safety level increases because no workers are in close proximity to the robot (3) workers are far away from the dangerous environmental conditions (4) it is possible to reduce the weight of the cable connected to the robot and (5) it is possible to reduce the weight of the robot because of the reduced load of the teaching pendant and the cable. We demonstrate the functionality and performance capabilities of our wireless teaching pendant through field-testing experiments (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
The accelerated rapid development of wireless network and mobile computing technologies has increased the convenience of mobile information services for obtaining useful information in our daily lives. The technology has thus become an essential research issue. In particular location-based services (LBSs) on mobile devices can convey location related information to individual users thus helping users to obtain helpful and adaptive information. Accordingly this study presents an intelligent location-based service system to provide local news with summaries to personal handheld PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) device based on the user's location. First this study proposes a novel multi-document news summarization scheme based on fuzzy synthetic evaluation. This scheme identifies a key paragraph in a news story as a summary based on three evaluation scores in order to dispatch news information to mobile devices with small screens. Furthermore to sense a user's location precisely the study also develops a practicable location-awareness scheme based on GPS (Global Positioning System) signals to identify the position of a user in the Taiwan area. Finally an intelligent location-based mobile news service system with automatic news summarization for location-based news services was implemented by combining the proposed multi-document news summarization and user location schemes. The proportion of satisfactory news summaries is up to 86% and the accuracy of the user location-awareness scheme is up to 90% according to experimental results in multi-document summarization and user location identification. These experimental results show that the proposed system can be successfully applied in real-world applications for personalized location-based news services. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the study was to determine the influence of textual feedback on the content and outcome of spoken interaction with a natural language dialogue system. More specifically the assumption that textual feedback could disrupt spoken interaction was tested in a human-computer dialogue situation. In total 48 adult participants familiar with the system had to find restaurants based on simple or difficult scenarios using a real natural language service system in a speech-only (phone) speech plus textual dialogue history (multimodal) or text-only (web) modality. The linguistic contents of the dialogues differed as a function of modality but were similar whether the textual feedback was included in the spoken condition or not. These results add to burgeoning research efforts on multimodal feedback in suggesting that textual feedback may have little or no detrimental effect on information searching with a real system. Statement of Relevance: The results suggest that adding textual feedback to interfaces for human-computer dialogue could enhance spoken interaction rather than create interference. The literature currently suggests that adding textual feedback to tasks that depend on the visual sense benefits human-computer interaction. The addition of textual output when the spoken modality is heavily taxed by the task was investigated.;2010
The amount of data published on the Semantic Web has witnessed a tremendous growth in the last years to which the Linked Open Data (LOD) project has contributed significantly. While the Semantic Web was originally conceived of as an extension to the Web by addition of machine-readable data allowing automatic processing by machines the question how humans can benefit from all the data published on the Web is becoming an important one. In the light of this question it seems crucial to make accessing the data on the Web as easy and intuitive as possible by adapting to the cognitive and information processing capabilities of humans. In this short position paper we argue that one interesting and promising approach in this direction is to allow people to access semantic data on the Web through multimodal interaction with embodied virtual characters.;2010
The AVLaughterCycle project aims at developing an audiovisual laughing machine able to detect and respond to user's laughs. Laughter is an important cue to reinforce the engagement in human-computer interactions. As a first step toward this goal we have implemented a system capable of recording the laugh of a user and responding to it with a similar laugh. The output laugh is automatically selected from an audiovisual laughter database by analyzing acoustic similarities with the input laugh. It is displayed by an Embodied Conversational Agent animated using the audio-synchronized facial movements of the subject who originally uttered the laugh. The application is fully implemented works in real time and a large audiovisual laughter database has been recorded as part of the project. This paper presents AVLaughterCycle its underlying components the freely available laughter database and the application architecture. The paper also includes evaluations of several core components of the application. Objective tests show that the similarity search engine though simple significantly outperforms chance for grouping laughs by speaker or type. This result can be considered as a first measurement for computing acoustic similarities between laughs. A subjective evaluation has also been conducted to measure the influence of the visual cues on the users' evaluation of similarity between laughs.;2010
The evaluation of subjective aspects of HCI such as human-likeness likeability or users' emotions towards computers is still quite a neglected issue especially in the field of non-task oriented conversational systems (chatterbots). In this paper we try to bridge this gap by proposing a new methodology of evaluation. The methods presented were tested in our research on humor-equipped chatterbots. We describe them in details discuss their drawbacks and usability. In one of the presented methods we used an emotiveness analysis system which itself can be considered an AI tool as it was used to detect users' emotions towards conversational systems and to perform their automatic evaluation. We also propose some methods that we have not used yet which however seem applicable in this field such as brain scanning techniques. Finally we give some ideas that should be addressed in the future.;2010
The increase in animal vehicle collisions (AVCs) on U.S roadways raises significant concerns for human safety property damage and injury costs and viability of wildlife populations Valuable AVC data can be obtained from documentation of Instances and locations of annual carcasses on the roadway but most transportation organizations do not systematically record these data In 2006 accidents reported by police in Virginia rep resented less than 14% of the 45000 deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) estimated from insurance industry claims A project was carried out to test a personal digital assistant (PDA) enabled with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver for the collection and analyses of animal carcass removals from the roadway and to initiate the integration of this data collection method into regular practice by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) VDOT maintenance personnel collected 8 months of spatially accurate carcass removal data by using GPS enabled PDAs DVC estimates from this procedure were more than nine times greater than the number reported by police Given the findings and efforts from the study VDOT plans to Integrate collection of carcass removal data with PDAs Into regular practice The procedures described in the report can guide other states interested in implementing a systematic and spatially accurate method for collecting AVC data. Implementing mitigation in high-density AVC areas can ultimately lead to fewer AVCs and associated reductions in human deaths injuries and financial losses improved traffic operations a reduction in maintenance costs related to carcass removal and disposal and wildlife conservation;2010
The posture of a user is one of the contextual information that can be used for mobile applications and the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis. This paper describes a method for monitoring the posture of a user during operation of a mobile device in three activities such as sitting standing and walking. The user posture monitoring system (UPMS) proposed in this paper is based on two major technologies. The first involves a tilt-angle measurement algorithm (TAMA) using an accelerometer. Unlike most previous studies it is based on a relative computation using the dot product from the time-series acceleration data. Because TAMA does not require a physical calibration by a user it is more robust and accurate compared to other methods that rely on absolute computations. The second technology is an effective signal-processing method that eliminates the motion acceleration component of the accelerometer signal using a second-order Butterworth low-pass filter (SLPF). Because the posture of a user is only related to the gravity acceleration component the motion acceleration components should be removed. The TAMA and UPMS are implemented on a personal digital assistant (PDA). They are evaluated to verify the possibility of application to a mobile device. Additionally a posture-based intelligent control interface in context-aware computing that reacts to the posture of a PDA user is implemented on the PDA to complement the poor user interface (UI) of the mobile device and its results are presented.;2010
The purpose of this paper is to develop a robot that actively communicates with a human and explicitly extracts information from the human mind that is rarely expressed as verbal information The spoken dialogue system for information collection must independently decide whether it may or may not start communicating with human In this paper we assume that the system begins to communicate with a human sitting and working at a desk analyze the relationship between his behavioral pattern and the decisions made by the other humans I e whether Or not to communicate with the working man and construct the decision model for the system to start communicating with the human using hidden Markov model;2010
The purpose of this study was to determine if race/ethnicity payer type or nursing specialty affected depression screening rates in primary care settings in which nurses received a reminder to screen. The sample comprised 4160 encounters in which nurses enrolled in advanced practice training were prompted to screen for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2/PHQ-9 integrated into a personal digital assistant-based clinical decision support system for depression screening and management. Nurses chose to screen in response to 52.5% of reminders. Adjusted odds ratios showed that payer type and nurse specialty but not race/ethnicity significantly predicted proportion of patients screened.;2010
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) with picture auditory and video prompts would serve as a portable self-prompting device to facilitate independent task performance by high school age students with moderate intellectual disabilities. A multiple probe design was used across three cooking recipes and replicated across three students to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-prompting program. Results indicate that students were able to independently use a PDA to self-prompt completion of the three cooking recipes without the need for external adult prompting to maintain use of the device over time and to self-adjust the levels of prompts used within and across recipes.;2010
The use of new technologies particularly virtual reality is not new in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD): VR is used to facilitate the activation of the traumatic event during exposure therapy. However during the therapy VR is a new and distinct realm separate from the emotions and behaviors experienced by the patient in the real world: the behavior of the patient in VR has no direct effects on the real-life experience the emotions and problems experienced by the patient in the real world are not directly addressed in the VR exposure. In this article we suggest that the use of a new technological paradigm Interreality may improve the clinical outcome of PTSD. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and real worlds: (a) behavior in the physical world influences the experience in the virtual one (b) behavior in the virtual world influences the experience in the real one. This is achieved through 3D shared virtual worlds biosensors and activity sensors (from the real to the virtual world) and personal digital assistants and/or mobile phones (from the virtual world to the real one). We describe different technologies that are involved in the Interreality vision and its clinical rationale. To illustrate the concept of Interreality in practice a clinical scenario is also presented and discussed: Rosa a 55-year-old nurse involved in a major car accident.;2010
This article describes a Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE) practitioner's approach to the preliminary design and implementation of a C2 system focusing on how the CSE approach guided the system design features. The Virtual Assistants and Persistent Sentinels project was built as a concept demonstrator to investigate the efficacy of a CSE approach to building C2 systems. The project team adopted the Decision-Centered Design (DCD) Methodology (Crandall Klein Hoffman 2006). Guided by the DCD process from preparation to application design this article describes 3 examples of transitions from macrocognitive challenges to design prototypes. Preliminary evaluation was conducted using cognitive indicators (Long Cox 2007) to evaluate if system features hindered cognitive performance as well as by obtaining feedback from subject matter experts through a cognitive wall walk.;2010
This article introduces an effective job analysis method for examining how people spend their working time that is the tasks they perform the time each accounts for and how they perceive these. Based on the principles of work sampling it addresses several disadvantages of existing techniques. Self-report data are collected using mini portable computers (personal digital assistants PDAs) the efficiency of which enables a more comprehensive approach to be adopted. A key feature of the method is the use of multilevel categories to examine work tasks from multiple perspectives simultaneously in a detailed manner. The article describes the development of the method illustrates its procedures and analyses using sample research data and evaluates its use as an organizational research tool. Furthermore it provides detailed and accessible descriptions of the numerous methodological and technical procedures common to all work sampling approaches and discusses the various associated issues.

This paper addresses modeling user behavior in interactions between two people who do not share a common spoken language and communicate with the aid of an automated bidirectional speech translation system. These interaction settings are complex. The translation machine attempts to bridge the language gap by mediating the verbal communication noting however that the technology may not be always perfect. In a step toward understanding user behavior in this mediated communication scenario usability data from doctor-patient dialogs involving a two way English-Persian speech translation system are analyzed. We specifically consider user behavior in light of potential uncertainty in the communication between the interlocutors. We analyze the Retry (Repeat and Rephrase) versus Accept behaviors in the mediated verbal channel and as a result identify three user types - Accommodating Normal and Picky and propose a dynamic Bayesian network model of user behavior. To validate the model we performed offline and online experiments. The experimental results using offline data show that correct user type is clearly identified as a user keeps his/her consistent behavior in a given interaction condition. In the online experiment agent feedback was presented to users according to the user types. We show high user satisfaction and interaction efficiency in the analysis of user interview video data questionnaire and log data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
This paper analyzes and compares the data gathered from two previously conducted Artificial Linguistic Internet Chat Entity (ALICE) chatterbot studies that were focused on response accuracy and user satisfaction measures for six chatterbots. These chatterbots were further loaded with varying degrees of conversational telecommunications and terrorism knowledge. From our prior experiments using 347 participants we obtained 33 446 human/chatterbot interactions. It was found that asking the ALICE chatterbots are and where questions resulted in higher response satisfaction levels as compared to other interrogative-style inputs because of their acceptability to vague binary or cliched chatterbot responses. We also found a relationship between the length of a query and the users perceived satisfaction of the chatterbot response where shorter queries led to more satisfying responses.;2010
This paper deals with automatic dialogue act (DA) recognition. Dialogue acts are sentence-level units that represent states of a dialogue such as questions statements hesitations etc. The knowledge of dialogue act realizations in a discourse or dialogue is part of the speech understanding and dialogue analysis process. It is of great importance for many applications: dialogue systems speech recognition automatic machine translation etc. The main goal of this paper is to study the existing works about DA recognition and to discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks. A major concern in the DA recognition domain is that although a few DA annotation schemes seem now to emerge as standards most of the time these DA tag-sets have to be adapted to the specificities of a given application which prevents the deployment of standardized DA databases and evaluation procedures. The focus of this review is put on the various kinds of information that can be used to recognize DAs such as prosody lexical etc. and on the types of models proposed so far to capture this information. Combining these information sources tends to appear nowadays as a prerequisite to recognize DAs.;2010
This paper describes a statistically motivated framework for performing real-time dialogue state updates and policy learning in a spoken dialogue system. The framework is based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) which provides a well-founded statistical model of spoken dialogue management. However exact belief state updates in a POMDP model are computationally intractable so approximate methods must be used. This paper presents a tractable method based on the loopy belief propagation algorithm. Various simplifications are made which improve the efficiency significantly compared to the original algorithm as well as compared to other POMDP-based dialogue state updating approaches. A second contribution of this paper is a method for learning in spoken dialogue systems which uses a component-based policy with the episodic Natural Actor Critic algorithm. The framework proposed in this paper was tested on both simulations and in a user trial. Both indicated that using Bayesian updates of the dialogue state significantly outperforms traditional definitions of the dialogue state. Policy learning worked effectively and the learned policy outperformed all others on simulations. In user trials the learned policy was also competitive although its optimality was less conclusive. Overall the Bayesian update of dialogue state framework was shown to be a feasible and effective approach to building real-world POMDP-based dialogue systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes the development of a global positioning system enhanced data collection tool for the assessment of vehicle exhaust emissions. This involves the collection of activity and travel data on a personal digital assistant with built-in global positioning system receiver. By converting the second-by-second global positioning system based travel data into emissions estimates are made of the exhausts produced by individual vehicle trips. Differences in travel behaviour and vehicle emissions were examined by gender and trip purpose. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
This paper describes the Virtual Guide a multimodal dialogue system represented by an embodied conversational agent that can help users to find their way in a virtual environment while adapting its affective linguistic style to that of the user. We discuss the modular architecture of the system and describe the entire loop from multimodal input analysis to multimodal output generation. We also describe how the Virtual Guide detects the level of politeness of the user's utterances in real-time during the dialogue and aligns its own language to that of the user using different politeness strategies. Finally we report on our first user tests and discuss some potential extensions to improve the system.;2010
This paper examines the effective deployment of conversational agents in virtual worlds from the perspective of researchers/practitioners in cognitive psychology computing science learning technologies and engineering. From a cognitive perspective the major challenge lies in the coordination and management of the various channels of information associated with conversation/communication and integrating this information with the virtual space of the environment and the belief space of the user. From computing science the requirements include conversational competency use of nonverbal cues animation consistent with affective states believability domain competency and user adaptability. From a learning technologies perspective the challenge is to maximise the considerable affordances provided by conversational avatars in virtual worlds balanced against ecologically valid investigations regarding utility. Finally the engineering perspective focuses on the technical competency required to implement effective and functional agents and the associated costs to enable student access. Taken together the four perspectives draw attention to the quality of the agent-user interaction how theory practice and research are closely intertwined and the multidisciplinary nature of this area with opportunities for cross fertilisation and collaboration.;2010
This paper explains how Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) can provide a principled mathematical framework for modelling the inherent uncertainty in spoken dialogue systems. It briefly summarises the basic mathematics and explains why exact optimisation is intractable. It then describes in some detail a form of approximation called the Hidden Information State model which does scale and which can be used to build practical systems. A prototype HIS system for the tourist information domain is evaluated and compared with a baseline MDP system using both user simulations and a live user trial. The results give strong support to the central contention that the POMDP-based framework is both a tractable and powerful approach to building more robust spoken dialogue systems.

This paper explores the use of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and their visual communicative ability to improve interaction with spoken language dialogue systems (SLDSs) through an experimental case study in the application context of secure access by speaker verification followed by remote home automation control. After identifying a set of typical interaction problems with SLDSs and associated with each of them a particular ECA gesture or behaviour we conducted a comparative evaluation based on ITU recommendations for the evaluation of spoken dialogue systems. User tests were carried out dividing the test users into two groups each facing a different interface setup: one with an ECA and the other only with voice output. The ECA group encountered fewer interaction problems. Users' impressions however were similar in both groups with a slight advantage observed for the ECA group. In particular the ECA seems to help users to better understand the flow of the dialogue and reduce confusion. Results also suggest that rejection (based on privacy and security concerns) is a dimension in its own right that may influence subjective evaluation parameters closely related to user acceptance.;2010
This paper presents a passive auto-focus camera control system which can easily achieve the function of auto-focus with no necessary of any active component (e.g. infrared or ultrasonic sensor) in comparison with the conventional active focus system. To implement the technique we developed the hardware system including the adjustable lens with CMOS sensor and servo motor an 8051 image capture micro-controller a field programmable gate array (FPGA) sharpness measurement circuit a pulse width modulation (PWM) controller and a personal digital assistant (PDA) image displayer was constructed. The discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) the morphology edge enhancement sharpness measurement algorithms and the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network were used in developing the control mechanism of the system. Compared with other passive auto-focus methods the method we proposed has the advantages of lower computational complexity and easier hardware implementation. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a wavelet-based speech coding strategy for cochlear implants. In addition it describes the real-time implementation of this strategy on a personal digital assistant (PDA) platform. Three wavelet packet decomposition tree structures are considered and their performance in terms of computational complexity spectral leakage fixed-point accuracy and real-time processing are compared to other commonly used strategies in cochlear implants. A real-time mechanism is introduced for updating the wavelet coefficients recursively. It is shown that the proposed strategy achieves higher analysis rates than the existing strategies while being able to run in real time on a PDA platform. In addition it is shown that this strategy leads to a lower amount of spectral leakage. The PDA implementation is made interactive to allow users to easily manipulate the parameters involved and study their effects.;2010
This paper proposes a new technique to increase the robustness of spoken dialogue systems employing an automatic procedure that aims to correct frames incorrectly generated by the system's component that deals with spoken language understanding. To do this the technique carries out a training that takes into account knowledge of previous system misunderstandings. The correction is transparent for the user as he is not aware of some mistakes made by the speech recogniser and thus interaction with the system can proceed more naturally. Experiments have been carried out using two spoken dialogue systems previously developed in our lab: Saplen and Viajero which employ prompt-dependent and prompt-independent language models for speech recognition. The results obtained from 10000 simulated dialogues show that the technique improves the performance of the two systems for both kinds of language modelling especially for the prompt-independent language model. Using this type of model the Saplen system increases sentence understanding by 19.54% task completion by 26.25% word accuracy by 7.53% and implicit recovery of speech recognition errors by 20.3% whereas for the Viajero system these figures increase by 14.93% 18.06% 6.98% and 15.63% respectively.

This paper proposes one of a response production method on chatting system automatically. Our approach is applied to Japanese language. This is not necessary that it achieve a task. The responses support our conversation flow and let us produce a new topic. The system will get much information for the speaker by performing much conversation with this system. Based on the much information by a conversation with the system the flexible reply for a speaker will come to be possible. In the present paper we propose a response by association of the input sentence. For example we associate medical treatment with hospital. We reply then using the association word. If like humans a machine can reply using the association word it will return various flexible responses.;2010
This paper reports outcomes of a project in which five teachers developed a web-based user guide to integrating new technologies in secondary science teaching. The guide aimed to support the initial education of trainee teachers and the professional development of mentors in working with and understanding the affordances of new technologies. In developing the guide each teacher researched trialled in their lessons and wrote about a different technology namely wikis digital video podcasts personal digital assistants and games consoles. By collecting data alongside this process this paper examines teachers' and pupils' perceptions of the affordances of such technologies in the science classroom. The authors undertook individual interviews with teachers and focus group interviews with students. Pupils' and teachers' perceptions clustered around four main themes: construction and social construction of learning differentiation assessment and motivation and engagement.;2010
This paper suggests a social-psychological framework for understanding the usability of mobile computers. This framework complements and extends extant sociological explanations of mobile computing. Sociological explanations satisfy principles of pragmatism and ubiquity in judging the usability of mobile computers. The paper argues that sociological explanations are inadequate and draws upon the historical epistemology of perception to propose social-psychological explanations to complement them. By this epistemology a user's perception is deemed as a mode of action that is mediated by historical or functional representations. These issues are illustrated in an empirical case of the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in hospitals of the British National Health Service. The historical epistemology of perception suggests the principle of representation to complement the existing principles of ubiquity and pragmatism. This suggestion is derived from an analysis of the complementation between the user's perception work and movement which are conscious actions enacted concurrently during the use of mobile computers. Implications for the implementation and evaluation of mobile computing projects are provided.;2010
This paper tries to use USB and personal digital assistant to develop a novel power quality (PQ) monitoring platform and then integrates GPRS technique into the proposed PQ platform to realize a wide-area PQ monitoring and report-back system. The works of this paper can be divided into three parts. First a small-scale PQ monitoring platform with appropriately designed I/O interfaces and peripherals is designed and implemented. Next a GPRS module which can be integrated into the designed PQ monitoring platform is developed. Finally a web server with well-designed database and web human-machine interfaces used to record abnormal PQ data and display PQ data are designed. The proposed GPRS-based wide-area PQ monitoring and report-back system can be used for PQ monitoring with minimum cost and maximum efficiency. All the functions implemented in this paper can realize the novel real-time and wide-area PQ monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This research aims at defining a real-time probabilistic model of user's engagement in advice-giving dialogues. We propose an approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to describe the differences in the dialogue pattern due to the different level of engagement experienced by the users. We train our HMM models on a corpus of natural dialogues with an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) in the domain of healthy-eating. The dialogues are coded in terms of Dialogue Acts associated to each system or user move. Results are quite encouraging: HMMs are a powerful formalism for describing the differences in the dialogue patterns due to the different level of engagement of users and they can be successfully employed in real-time user's engagement detection. Though the HMM learning process shows a lack of robustness when using low-dimensional and skewed corpora. Therefore we plan a further validation of our approach with larger corpora in the near future.;2010
This study developed a Mobile Plant Learning System (MPLS) that provides instructors with the ways and means to facilitate student learning in an elementary-school-level botany course. The MPLS represented in this study was implemented to address problems that arise with the use of a didactic approach to teaching and learning botany as is typically used in elementary schools in Taiwan. To extend opportunities for learning beyond the classroom this study used personal digital assistants (PDAs) equipped with the MPLS which provided both teachers and students access to plant information while in the field. A quasi-experimental research design was used to investigate the effectiveness of using the MPLS to support student learning. The responses to questionnaires and inter-views indicate that students valued the outdoor learning activities made possible by use of the PDA and its functions. Pre- and post-test results demonstrated that students also benefitted academically from the use of the MPLS and the PDA. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010
This study evaluated the reliability of the 5-min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) in a single-sex Australian primary school. Seventy-five male students (mean age = 11.82 years SD = 1.12) completed two 5-min PVTs using a Palm personal digital assistant (PDA) in (1) an isolated setting and (2) a classroom setting. Of this group of students a subsample of 37 students completed a test-retest reliability trial within the classroom setting. Using a mixed-model analysis there was no significant difference in the mean response time (RT) or number of lapses (RTs > 500 msec) between the isolated and the classroom setting. There was however an order effect for the number of lapses in the isolated setting with the number of lapses being greater if the isolated test was conducted second. Test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) in the classroom setting indicated moderate to high reliability (mean RT = .84 lapses = .59). Bland-Altman analysis showed no systematic difference between the two settings. Findings suggest that the 5-min PDA PVT is a reliable measure of sustained attention in the classroom setting in this sample of primary-aged schoolchildren. The results provide further evidence for the versatility of this measuring device for larger interventions outside the laboratory.;2010
To enhance scheduling efficiency and data security we propose a Priority/MLS/AL framework for supporting transaction scheduling in wireless environments. In this framework we divide users into three priority levels and data objects into four security levels. Mobile stations used in the experiments are cellular phones personal digital assistants laptops and personal computers. Altruistic locking is used as a mechanism for reserving data objects. We adopt an algorithmic approach to implement the system. The system behavior is simulated showing that the framework proposed will enhance scheduling performance and data security. Better access control is achieved and deadlocks are avoided.;2010
To tackle the vocabulary problem in conversational systems previous work has applied unsupervised learning approaches on co-occurring speech and eye gaze during interaction to automatically acquire new words. Although these approaches have shown promiseseveral issues related to human language behavior and human-machine conversation have not been addressed. First psycholinguistic studies have shown certain temporal regularities between human eye movement and language production. While these regularities can potentially guide the acquisition process they have not been incorporated in the previous unsupervised approaches. Second conversational systems generally have an existing knowledge base about the domain and vocabulary. While the existing knowledge can potentially help bootstrap and constrain the acquired new words it has not been incorporated in the previous models. Third eye gaze could serve different functions in human-machine conversation. Some gaze streams may not be closely coupled with speech stream and thus are potentially detrimental to word acquisition. Automated recognition of closely-coupled speech-gaze streams based on conversation context is important. To address these issues we developed new approaches that incorporate user language behavior domain knowledge and conversation context in word acquisition. We evaluated these approaches in the context of situated dialogue in a virtual world. Our experimental results have shown that incorporating the above three types of contextual information significantly improves word acquisition performance.;2010
Tracing defected bobbins back to spindles of spinning frames using RFID technology The winding device is able to detect the defected bobbins according to the requirements of quality control however Cannot deduce on which of the spinning frame's spindles they were produced. In Order to solve this problem a special Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and an embedded software used for identifying the individual bobbins associated to the serial number of spindles and the code of the spinning frames utilizing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. The PDA could trace the defected bobbin from the winder to the spindle that produced it This method solved the problem of the old system which needed to use a PC in order to manage the serial number of the spindles. It also improved the spinning frame's maintenance and increased the quality of the spun Yarn.;2010
Transit agencies conduct origin destination on-board surveys periodically to gather information regarding travel patterns and demographic data of their users and to collect customer satisfaction information. These surveys constitute a highly valuable means of obtaining important information on an agency's customers to provide a basis for effective transit planning and for regional travel demand modeling efforts. This paper describes the application of innovative technologies in the data collection process to improve data quality data completeness and data collection management. This includes the simultaneous collection of boarding and alighting count data at the stop level using Global Positioning System enabled personal digital assistants association of distributed surveys to boarding locations and a web-based sample and productivity management system. These technologies allow for automatic collection of boarding location arrival and departure times and transit trip times. An imputation procedure was developed to derive the most likely alighting location of each collected sample. Joint application of these technologies reduces survey length and thereby minimizes respondent burden.;2010
Ubiquitous computing and mobile technologies provide a new perspective for designing innovative outdoor learning experiences. The purpose of this study is to propose a formative assessment design for integrating PDAs into ecology observations. Three learning activities were conducted in this study. An action research approach was applied to continually revise the worksheet designs. Twenty-seven 5(th) and 6(th) graders' observation skills using PDAs and their extended inquiry performance using e-diaries were assessed. An e-library and online scoring and feedback systems were developed accordingly. The results suggest that the embedded formative assessment designs were effective for guiding and supporting the students' learning progress. The activity worksheets successfully helped the students focus their outdoor learning attention on the target tasks. The e-library provided reliable resources to clarify their observed descriptions while the automatic scoring and feedback systems were especially helpful in sustaining the students' persistent effort. Most students demonstrated substantial improvements in their observation skills and extended their inquiry abilities. The well designed online formative assessment embedded in the activity worksheet is very promising for PDA integrated learning.;2010
Users of small computational devices such as Mobile telephones or Personal Digital Assistants are situationally impaired by both the device and the context of the device's use. This paper describes empirical work which makes the link between the behaviour of motor impaired desktop users and non-impaired users of small-devices. This is important because it may. therefore be possible to leverage existing solutions for motor-impaired users into the small-device domain. We find that there is significant overlap in the extent of the problems encountered but not the magnitude. Eight of the 11 existing errors made by motor-impaired users were also present in our small-device study in which two additional error types key ambiguity and landing errors were also observed. In addition small-device rates for common error types were higher than those of desktop users with no impairment but lower than those of desktop users with motor impairments. We suggest that this difference is because all users were seated to maintain constancy between studies and assert that this magnitude difference will equalise once the small-device is used in a mobile context.

We address the issue of out of grammar (OOG) utterances in spoken dialogue systems by generating help messages Help message generation for OOG utterances is a challenge because language under standing based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) of OOG utterances is usually erroneous important words are often misrecognized or missing from such utterances Our grammar verification method uses a weighted finite state transducer to accurately identify the grammar rule that the user Intended to use tor the utterance even if important words are missing from the ASR results We then use a ranking algorithm Rank Boost to rank help message candidates in order of likely usefulness Its features include the grammar verification results and the utterance history representing the user s experience;2010
We assessed the feasibility of using a camcorder mobile phone for teleconsulting about cardiac echocardiography. The diagnostic performance of evaluating left ventricle (LV) systolic function was measured by three emergency medicine physicians. A total of 138 short echocardiography video sequences (from 70 subjects) was selected from previous emergency room ultrasound examinations. The measurement of LV ejection fraction based on the transmitted video displayed on a mobile phone was compared with the original video displayed on the LCD monitor of the ultrasound machine. The image quality was evaluated using the double stimulation impairment scale (DSIS). All observers showed high sensitivity. There was an improvement in specificity with the observer's increasing experience of cardiac ultrasound. Although the image quality of video on the mobile phone was lower than that of the original a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in diagnostic performance. Immediate basic teleconsulting of echocardiography movies is possible using current commercially-available mobile phone systems.;2010
We describe a study that examined the distinctiveness of momentary positive and negative affect (PA and NA) and their relationships with blood pressure and heart rate at work in a sample of 67 full-time employees who provided psychological and physiological measurements multiple times a day over 10 working days. These employees recorded their subjective ratings on personal digital assistant devices programmed specifically for this study and assessed their blood pressure and heart rate using automatic recording devices at each measurement period. Results support the distinctiveness of PA and NA. First within-individual factor analyses confirmed the existence of two underlying factors in the momentary affect ratings. Second the within-individual correlations between PA and NA scores (-.14) and among the two latent constructs (-.13) were both low in magnitude. Finally as predicted by theory NA was significantly related to blood pressure within individuals whereas PA and blood pressure were unrelated (both PA and NA were related to heart rate within individuals as predicted).;2010
We describe an animated conversational computer agent designed to promote antipsychotic medication adherence among patients with schizophrenia. In addition to medication adherence the agent also promotes physical activity and system usage and includes verbal and nonverbal behavior designed to foster a therapeutic alliance with patients. We discuss special considerations in designing interventions for this patient population and challenges in developing and evaluating conversational agents in the mental health domain. Results from a pilot evaluation study of the agent indicate that it is accepted and effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2010
We describe an approach to integrate dialogue management machine-learning and action planning in a system for dialogue between a human and a robot. Case-based techniques are used because they permit life-long learning from experience and demand little prior knowledge and few static hand-written structures. This approach has been developed through the work on an experimental dialogue system called CEDERIC that is connected to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A single case base and case-based reasoning engine is used both for understanding and for planning actions by the UAV. Dialogue experiments both with experienced and novice users where the users have solved tasks by dialogue with this system showed very adequate success rates.;2010
We describe an evaluation of spoken dialogue strategies designed using hierarchical reinforcement learning agents. The dialogue strategies were learnt in a simulated environment and tested in a laboratory setting with 32 users. These dialogues were used to evaluate three types of machine dialogue behaviour: hand-coded fully-learnt and semi-learnt. These experiments also served to evaluate the realism of simulated dialogues using two proposed metrics contrasted with 'Precision-Recall'. The learnt dialogue behaviours used the Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) model and we report the first evaluation of this model in a realistic conversational environment. Experimental results in the travel planning domain provide evidence to support the following claims: (a) hierarchical semi-learnt dialogue agents are a better alternative (with higher overall performance) than deterministic or fully-learnt behaviour (b) spoken dialogue strategies learnt with highly coherent user behaviour and conservative recognition error rates (keyword error rate of 20%) can outperform a reasonable hand-coded strategy and (c) hierarchical reinforcement learning dialogue agents are feasible and promising for the (semi) automatic design of optimized dialogue behaviours in larger-scale systems.

We describe how the interaction mode with an embodied conversational agent (ECA) affects the users' perception of the agent and their behavior during interaction and propose a method to recognize the social attitude of users towards the agent from their verbal behavior. A corpus of human-ECA dialogues was collected with a Wizard-of-Oz study in which the input mode of the user moves was varied (written vs. speech-based). After labeling the corpus we evaluated the relationship between input mode and social attitude of users towards the agent. The results show that by increasing naturalness of interaction spoken input produces a warmer attitude of users and a richer language: this effect is more evident for users with a background in humanities. Recognition of signs of social attitude is needed for adapting the ECA's verbal and nonverbal behavior. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2010
We describe the feasibility of audio-enhanced personal digital assistants (ADPAs) for data collection with 60 Latino migrant farmworkers. All participants chose to complete APDA surveys rather than using paper-and-pencil. No one left the study prematurely: two (3%) data cases were lost due to technical difficulties. Across all data.27% missing data were observed : nine missing responses on eight items. Participants took 19 minutes on average to complete the 58-question survey. The factor most influential for completion was education level. APDA methodology enabled both English- and Spanish-speaking Latino migrant farmworkers to become active research participants with minimal loss of data. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals Inc.

We developed a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA)-based teleradiology terminal which allowed a secure connection to the hospital's Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) through the DICOM protocol. Ten members of the hospital's medical staff completed a questionnaire about its mobility usability stability performance and diagnostic efficiency in a real health-care environment. There was a high degree of satisfaction with the system's mobility (mean score 4.1 SD 1.0 on a five-point scale) usability (mean score 4.2 SD 1.1) stability (mean score 3.9 SD 0.4) and performance (mean score 4.2 SD 0.6). The system was evaluated as a tool for providing assistance in diagnosing thyroid nodules from ultrasound images. A total of 144 ultrasound images with thyroid nodules were assessed by an expert. Six image quality attributes were evaluated. The physician concluded that the ultrasound thyroid images on the PDA screen were of similar quality to those displayed on a diagnostic visual display unit screen. However the expert found difficulties in diagnosing microcalcification internal echo texture and vascularity. The PDA terminal provided rapid secure and convenient portable access to PACS images and the image quality was sufficient for diagnostic interpretation of ultrasound images of the thyroid.;2010
We evaluated the efficacy of a vocational training program including behavioral skills training and a performance cue system (i.e. a proprietary iPhone application adapted for the study) to teach targeted social-vocational skills to six young adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. In two separate studies participants were employed to assist in the delivery of a fire safety education program. Participants were asked to wear an inflatable firefighter WalkAround (R) mascot costume and to perform 63 scripted behaviors in coordination with a fire prevention specialist who was the lead program presenter. In Study 1 three participants were initially exposed to established company training procedures comprised of behavioral skills training components to determine whether they met mastery of the skills. If necessary to reach criteria participants were then exposed to a performance cue system. In Study 2 three additional participants were provided with the performance cue system alone and then behavioral skills training if required. A single case multiple-baseline design across subjects was used to evaluate efficacy of each intervention. Results indicate that 5 of 6 participants reached criterion only after introduction of the cue system while the sixth reached criterion with behavioral skills training alone. The program received high satisfaction ratings from participants their parents and consumers. Implications and potential use of the PCS in other employment settings are discussed.

We investigate the impact of three different factors on the quality of talking heads as metaphors of a spoken dialogue system in the smart home domain. The main focus lies on the effect of voice and head characteristics on audio and video quality as well as overall quality. Furthermore the influence of interactivity and of media context on user perception is analysed. For this purpose two subsequent experiments were conducted: the first was designed as a non-interactive rating test of videos of talking heads while the second experiment was interactive. Here the participants had to solve a number of tasks in dialogue with a talking head. To assess the impact of the media context redundant information was provided via an additional visual output channel to half of the participants. As a secondary effect the importance of participants' gender is examined. It is shown that perceived quality differences observed in the non-interactive setting are blurred when the interactivity and media contexts provide distraction from the talking head. Furthermore a simple additional feedback screen improves the perceived quality of the talking heads. Gender effects are negligible concerning the ratings in interaction but female and male participants exhibit different behaviour in the experiment. This advocates for more realistic evaluation settings in order to increase the external validity of the obtained quality judgements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2010
We investigate the use of different machine learning methods in combination with feature selection techniques to explore human multimodal dialogue strategies and the use of those strategies for automated dialogue systems. We learn policies from data collected in a Wizard-of-Oz study where different human 'wizards' decide whether to ask a clarification request in a multimodal manner or else to use speech alone. We first describe the data collection the coding scheme and annotated corpus and the validation of the multimodal annotations. We then show that there is a uniform multimodal dialogue strategy across wizards which is based on multiple features in the dialogue context. These are generic features available at runtime which can be implemented in dialogue systems. Our prediction models (for human wizard behaviour) achieve a weighted f-score of 88.6 per cent (which is a 25.6 per cent improvement over the majority baseline). We interpret and discuss the learned strategy. We conclude that human wizard behaviour is not optimal for automatic dialogue systems and argue for the use of automatic optimization methods such as Reinforcement Learning. Throughout the investigation we also discuss the issues arising from using small initial Wizard-of-Oz data sets and we show that feature engineering is an essential step when learning dialogue strategies From such limited data.;2010
We present the MATCH corpus a unique data set of 447 dialogues in which 26 older and 24 younger adults interact with nine different spoken dialogue systems. The systems varied in the number of options presented and the confirmation strategy used. The corpus also contains information about the users' cognitive abilities and detailed usability assessments of each dialogue system. The corpus which was collected using a Wizard-of-Oz methodology has been fully transcribed and annotated with dialogue acts and Information State Update (ISU) representations of dialogue context. Dialogue act and ISU annotations were performed semi-automatically. In addition to describing the corpus collection and annotation we present a quantitative analysis of the interaction behaviour of older and younger users and discuss further applications of the corpus. We expect that the corpus will provide a key resource for modelling older people's interaction with spoken dialogue systems.;2010
We propose an efficient technique of dialogue management for an information navigation system based oil a document knowledge base. The system can use ASR N-best hypotheses and contextual information to perform robustly for fragmental speech input and erroneous output of automatic speech recognition (ASR). It also has several choices in generating responses or confirmations. We formulate the optimization of these choices based oil a Bayes risk criterion which is defined based on a reward for correct information presentation and a penalty for redundant turns. The parameters for the dialogue management we propose can be adaptively tuned by online learning. We evaluated this strategy with our spoken dialogue system called Dialogue Navigator for Kyoto City which generates responses based oil the document retrieval and also has question-answering capability. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was demonstrated by the increased success rate of dialogue and the reduced number of turns for information access through an experiment with a large number of utterances by real users.

When conveying information about spatial situations and goals speakers adapt flexibly to their addressee in order to reach the communicative goal efficiently and effortlessly. Our aim is to equip a dialogue system with the abilities required for such a natural adaptive dialogue. In this paper we investigate the strategies people use to convey route information in relation to a map by presenting two parallel studies involving human-human and human-computer interaction. We compare the instructions given to a human interaction partner with those given to a dialogue system which reacts by basic verbal responses and dynamic visualization of the route in the map. The language produced by human route givers is analyzed with respect to a range of communicative as well as cognitively crucial features particularly perspective choice and references to locations across levels of granularity. Results reveal that speakers produce systematically different instructions with respect to these features depending on the nature of the interaction partner human or dialogue system. Our further analysis of clarification and reference resolution strategies produced by human route followers provides insights into dialogue strategies that future systems should be equipped with.

A basic goal in human-robot interaction is to establish such a communication mode between the two parties that the humans perceive it as effective and natural effective in the sense of being responsive to the information needs of the humans and natural in the sense of communicating information in modes familiar to humans. This paper sets the framework for a robot guide to visitors in art collections and other assistive environments which incorporates the principles of effectiveness and naturalness. The human-robot interaction takes place in natural language in the form of a dialogue session during which the robot describes exhibits but also recommends exhibits that might be of interest to the visitors. It is also possible for the robot to explain its reasoning to the visitors with a view to increasing transparency and consequently trust in the robot's suggestions. Furthermore the robot leads the visitors to the location of the desired exhibit. The framework is general enough to be implemented in different hardware including portable computational devices. The framework is based on a cognitive model comprised of four modules: a reactive a deliberative a reflective and an affective one. An initial implementation of a dialogue system realising this cognitive model is presented. main ontology.;2011
A common task for spoken dialog systems (SDS) is to help users select a suitable option (e.g. flight hotel and restaurant) from the set of options available. As the number of options increases the system must have strategies for generating summaries that enable the user to browse the option space efficiently and successfully. In the user-model based summarize and refine approach (UMSR Demberg and Moore 2006) options are clustered to maximize utility with respect to a user model and linguistic devices such as discourse cues and adverbials are used to highlight the trade-offs among the presented items. In a Wizard-of-Oz experiment we show that the UMSR approach leads to improvements in task success efficiency and user satisfaction compared to an approach that clusters the available options to maximize coverage of the domain (Polifroni et al. 2003). In both a laboratory experiment and a web-based experimental paradigm employing the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform we show that the discourse cues in UMSR summaries help users compare different options and choose between options even though they do not improve verbatim recall. This effect was observed for both written and spoken stimuli. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011
A previous line of research suggests that interlocutors identify appropriate places to speak by cues in the behaviour of the preceding speaker. If used in combination these cues have an additive effect on listeners' turn-taking attempts. The present study further explores these findings by examining the effect of such turn-taking cues experimentally. The objective is to investigate the possibilities of generating turn-taking cues with a synthetic voice. Thus in addition to stimuli realized with a human voice the experiment included dialogues where one of the speakers is replaced with a synthesis. The turn-taking cues investigated include intonation phrase-final lengthening semantic completeness stereotyped lexical expressions and non-lexical speech production phenomena such as lexical repetitions breathing and lip-smacks. The results show that the turn-taking cues realized with a synthetic voice affect the judgements similar to the corresponding human version and there is no difference in reaction times between these two conditions. Furthermore the results support Duncan's findings: the more turn-taking cues with the same pragmatic function turn-yielding or turn-holding the higher the agreement among subjects on the expected outcome. In addition the number of turn-taking cues affects the reaction times for these decisions. Thus the more cues the faster the reaction time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2011
A well-known ambiguity in the term 'argument' is that of argument as an inferential structure and argument as a kind of dialogue. In the first sense an argument is a structure with a conclusion supported by one or more grounds which may or may not be supported by further grounds. Rules for the construction and criteria for the quality of arguments in this sense are a matter of logic. In the second sense arguments have been studied as a form of dialogical interaction in which human or artificial agents aim to resolve a conflict of opinion by verbal means. Rules for conducting such dialogues and criteria for their quality are part of dialogue theory. Usually formal accounts of argumentation dialogues in logic and artificial intelligence presuppose an argument-based logic. That is the ways in which dialogue participants support and attack claims are modelled as the construction of explicit arguments and counterarguments (in the inferential sense). However in this paper formal models of argumentation dialogues are discussed that do not presuppose arguments as inferential structures. The motivation for such models is that there are forms of inference that are not most naturally cast in the form of arguments (such as abduction statistical reasoning and coherence-based reasoning) but that can still be the subject of argumentative dialogue. Some recent work in artificial intelligence is discussed which embeds non-argumentative inference in an argumentative dialogue system and some general observations are drawn from this discussion.;2011
Aim The aim of this study was to describe one nurse's experience of using a personal digital assistant (PDA) in nursing practice. Background Nurses handle large amounts of information and a PDA may contain valuable information that nurses need in their daily work. Methods In this qualitative single case study data were collected through an open-ended interview with one registered nurse and were analysed by content analysis. Results The findings show that the PDA provides immediate access to information anywhere and at anytime with advantages for both the nurse and for her patients. The PDA increased her confidence and efficiency in practice it was easier to keep up-to-date and spend more time with the patient. Furthermore the PDA was perceived as improving patient safety and patient participation. Conclusions The PDA requires improved content and more functions. Ease of use should also be improved. This study indicates that PDAs could be valuable and may inspire further research. Implications for nursing management The incorporation of a multifunctional PDA is an important issue for nursing management as it could both change and provide new possibilities for nursing practice. The use of PDAs could also aid decision-making improve patient safety and benefit patient outcomes.;2011
Aim This study's purpose was to assess the characteristics of personal digital assistant (PDA) uptake and use in both clinical and classroom work for baccalaureate student nurses (BSN) within a rural Texas university. Background Patient care has become more complicated risk prone automated and costly. Efficiencies at the bedside are needed to continue to provide safe and successful within this environment. Method Purposive sample of nursing students using PDAs throughout their educational processes conducted at three campus sites. The initial sample size was 105 students followed by 94 students at end of the first semester and 75 students at curriculum completion at the end of a 2-year period. Students completed structured and open-ended questions to assess their perspectives on PDA usage. Results Student uptake varied in relation to overall competency with minimal to high utilization noted and was influenced by the current product costs. Conclusions PDAs are developing into useful clinical tools by providing quick and important information for safer care. Implications for nursing management Using bedside PDAs effectively assists with maintaining patient safety efficiency of care delivery and staff satisfaction. This study evaluates the initial implementation of PDAs by students our future multitasking nurses.;2011
Although mobile technology has the potential to promote patient safety by increasing accuracy and efficiency faculty may find instituting a personal digital assistant (PDA) program overwhelming. In addition there is a dearth of information on how students are using this technology. The authors discuss the implementation of a PDA program that required all nursing students entering their first clinical rotation to purchase a PDA loaded with nursing software and describe how the students used this technology. Lessons learned along the way are emphasized to help faculty develop implement and/or improve their school's PDA/software program.;2011
An efficient calibration algorithm for an ambulatory audiometric test system is proposed. This system utilizes a personal digital assistant (PDA) device to generate the correct sound pressure level (SPL) from an audiometric transducer such as an earphone. The calibrated sound intensities for an audio-logical examination can be obtained in terms of the sound pressure levels of pure-tonal sinusoidal signals in eight-banded frequency ranges (250 500 1 000 2 000 3 000 4 000 6 000 and 8 000 Hz) and with mapping of the input sound pressure levels by the weight coefficients that are tuned by the delta learning rule. With this scheme the sound intensities which evoke eight-banded sound pressure levels by 5 dB steps from a minimum of 25 dB to a maximum of 80 dB can be generated without volume displacement. Consequently these sound intensities can be utilized to accurately determine the hearing threshold of a subject in the ambulatory audiometric testing environment.;2011
Animal studies have shown that life span is extended by caloric restriction (CR). This manuscript describes the design and methodology of an innovative CR intervention which is the treatment arm of the CALERIE Study. This study is a multi-center randomized controlled trial examining the effects of 2 years of CR on biomarkers of longevity among non-obese (BMI >= 22 kg/m(2) and < 28 kg/m(2)) adults. CALERIE is the first investigation of the effects of long-term CR on the aging process in non-obese humans. 220 healthy volunteers across 3 sites were recruited beginning in May 2007. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio between the CR or control group (i.e. ad libitum diet). An intensive intervention was designed to assist participants in adhering to the 25% CR prescription for a two-year duration. The intervention was designed to optimize the likelihood that 25% CR would be achieved through a variety of nutritional and behavioral strategies several of which are innovative methods for achieving CR. The intervention includes the following components: an intensive mixed format schedule of group/individual sessions meal provision phase with exposure to various diets Personal Digital Assistants to monitor caloric intake unique portion estimation training tailored treatment using a computer tracking system toolbox strategies and algorithms as well as comprehensive coverage of nutrition and behavioral topics in order to assist participants in meeting their CR goal. This manuscript provides an overview of the CR intensive intervention and may be of assistance for other researchers and clinicians in designing future trials. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Applications with intelligent conversational virtual humans called Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) seek to bring human-like abilities into machines and establish natural human-computer interaction. In this paper we discuss realization of ECA multimodal behaviors which include speech and nonverbal behaviors. We devise RealActor an open-source multi-platform animation system for real-time multimodal behavior realization for ECAs. The system employs a novel solution for synchronizing gestures and speech using neural networks. It also employs an adaptive face animation model based on Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to synthesize face expressions. Our aim is to provide a generic animation system which can help researchers create believable and expressive ECAs.;2011
Assisted-Global Navigation Satellite Systems (A-GNSS) or Assisted-Global Positioning Systems (A-GPS) in particular are now commonly accepted as an effective way to reduce the time-to-first-fix (TTFF) in GNSS-unfriendly environments e.g. in areas of weak GNSS signals. Today's location-based service (LBS) devices such as GPS-enabled mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDA) rely on A-GPS however such commercial devices are equipped with an integrated A-GPS chip that makes customisation very difficult. The Open Source GNSS Reference Server (OSGRS) provided by the University of New South Wales is an open source Java application that can generate the necessary data for A-GPS clients. The GNSS Reference Interface Protocol (GRIP) based on extensible mark-up language (XML) is employed as the OSGRS interface protocol. This paper describes the current status of OSGRS: a client simulator is available open-source client software which supports four different types of A-GPS-enabled receivers has been developed and used to test OSGRS. The performance of the OSGRS is analysed based on intensive tests. The challenges for OSGRS and future work are also discussed.;2011
Automated approaches to promoting health behavior change such as exercise diet and medication adherence promotion have the potential for significant positive impact on society. We describe a theory-driven computational model of dialogue that simulates a human health counselor who is helping his or her clients to change via a series of conversations over time. Applications built using this model can be used to change the health behavior of patients and consumers at low cost over a wide range of media including the web and the phone. The model is implemented using an OWL ontology of health behavior change concepts and a public standard task modeling language (ANSI/CEA-2018). We demonstrate the power of modeling dialogue using an ontology and task model by showing how an exercise promotion system developed in the framework was re-purposed for diet promotion with 98% reuse of the abstract models. Evaluations of these two systems are presented demonstrating high levels of fidelity to best practices in health behavior change counseling. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2011
Background. Little is known regarding barriers to guideline adherence in the nephrology community. We set out to identify perceived barriers to evidence-based medicine (EBM) and measurement of continuous quality indicators (CQI) in an international cohort of peritoneal dialysis (PD) practitioners. Methods. Subscribers to an online nephrology education site (Nephrology Now) were invited to participate in an online survey. Nephrology Now is a non-profit monthly mailing list that highlights clinically relevant articles in nephrology. Four hundred and seventy-five physicians supplying PD care participated in an online survey assessing their use of EBM and CQI in their PD practice. Ordinal logistic regression was utilized to determine relationships between baseline characteristics and EBM and CQI practices. Results. The majority of physicians were nephrologists (89.7%) and 50.4% worked in an academic centre. Respondents were from the following geographic regions: 13.5% Canadian 24% American 23.8% European 4.4% Australian 5.3% South American 10.7% African and 12.2% Asian. Adherence to PD clinical practice guidelines were generally strong however lower adherence was associated with countries with lower healthcare expenditure not using personal digital assistant (PDA) the longer the physician had been practising and smaller (< 20 patients per centre) PD practice. Conclusions. International variation in guideline adherence may be influenced by a country's healthcare expenditure physician's PDA use and experience and size of PD practice which may impact future guideline development and implementation.;2011
Background: Assessment of pain in children is an important aspect of pain management and can be performed by observational methods or by self-assessment. The Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) is a self-report tool which has strong positive correlations with other well established self-report pain intensity measures. It has been recommended for measuring pain intensity in school-aged children (4 years and older). The objective of this study is to compare the concordance and the preference for two versions electronic and paper of the FPS-R and to determine whether an electronic version of the FPS-R can be used by children aged 4 and older. Methods: The study is an observational multicenter randomized cross-over controlled open trial. Medical and surgical patients in two pediatric hospitals (N = 202 age 4-12 years mean age 8.3 years 58% male) provided self-reports of their present pain using the FPS-R on a personal digital assistant (PDA) and on a paper version. Paper and electronic versions of the FPS-R were administered by a nurse in a randomized order: half the patients were given the PDA version first and the other half the paper version first. The time between the administrations was planned to be less than 30 minutes but not simultaneous. Two hundred and thirty-seven patients were enrolled 35 were excluded from analysis because of misunderstanding of instructions or abnormal time between the two assessments. Results: Final population for analysis comprised 202 children. The overall weighted Kappa was 0.846 (95% CI: 0.795 0.896) and the Spearman correlation between scores on the two versions was r(s) = 0.911 (p < 0.0001). The mean difference of pain scores was less than 0.1 out of 10 which was neither statistically nor clinically significant 83.2% of children chose the same face on both versions of the FPS-R. Preference was not modified by order sex age hospitalization unit (medical or surgical units) or previous analgesics. The PDA was preferred by 87.4% of the children who expressed a preference. Conclusion: The electronic version of the FPS-R can be recommended for use with children aged 4 to 12 either in clinical trials or in hospitals to monitor pain intensity.;2011
Background: Automatic DSP (digital signal processing) features widely available in hearing aids today are useful because they alleviate the need for the hearing aid wearer to manually adjust the hearing aid as listening conditions change. Although the theoretical basis for the design of these features may be sound little is known about their behavior in the real world. Data logging offers a glimpse into the life of the individual hearing aid wearer but there are no published data to date that provide a frame of reference for the interpretation of this information. Further data logging in hearing aids provides only aggregate summaries for individual features ignoring complex interactions including the differences between the left and right sides of a bilateral pair. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the typical behavior of three automatic DSP hearing aid features-expansion directionality and noise management-in daily life. Data Collection and Analysis: Ten individuals with hearing impairment were fitted bilaterally with BTE (behind the ear) hearing aids. The hearing aids were programmed for the individual's hearing loss with expansion directionality and noise management set to activate automatically. A PDA (personal digital assistant) logged the input level and status of expansion directionality and noise management from both devices at 5 sec intervals. Data were gathered in this manner over a period of 4-5 wk. Results: A total of 741 hr of hearing aid use were logged 50% of which were spent in environments no louder than 50 dB SPL. Expansion directionality and noise management were active 45 10 and 21% of the time respectively the median amount of gain reduction for noise management was similar to 1 dB. Although expansion and noise management were always active at the low and high input levels respectively activation of directionality never exceeded 50%. Expansion and noise management were sometimes active simultaneously as were directionality and noise management. Bilateral agreement in feature activation typically exceeded 80% except when the input level was at the cusp of a threshold for activation of a specific feature and at high input levels.;2011
Background: Despite advances in technology hearing aid users continue to express a desire for some control over their devices. Access to a suitable control can significantly affect overall satisfaction with amplification yet little is known about the circumstances that drive hearing aid users to manipulate controls. Such information would be useful in guiding clinical decisions about the selection of controls and synchronization of their operation in a bilateral pair of hearing aids. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the real-world use of multimemory (MM) and volume (VC) controls and environmental characteristics that may influence their use. Research Design: Real-time data about MM and VC usage were gathered in the real world. Subjective reports of the environmental characteristics were obtained. This design allowed examination of the nature of hearing aid adjustments as well as exploration of factors affecting them. Study Sample: Ten adults with bilaterally symmetric mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study. All had previous experience with hearing aids. Intervention: Participants were fitted bilaterally with BTE (behind-the-ear) hearing aids equipped with an MM button and/or VC wheel. The devices were connected to a PDA (personal digital assistant) that logged data from the hearing aids and stored surveys completed by participants in various listening situations. Data Collection and Analysis: The following data were obtained from the PDA: (1) MM and VC settings in the left and right devices (2) broadband input level at the microphone of the left and right devices and (3) participant reports of the presence distance and location of signal and background noise. Prevalence of nondefault settings and bilateral symmetry of hearing aid adjustments were summarized descriptively while the influence of environmental characteristics on hearing aid adjustments was analyzed using non-parametric methods. Results: Over 4-5 wk 912 hr of data were logged and 184 surveys completed. Results showed that (1) the default (i.e. the programmed or use) setting was preferred most often (2) the preferred hearing aid settings were mostly bilaterally symmetrical and (3) nondefault settings were often used in difficult listening situations. Conclusions: The findings of this study generally support the use of synchronized MMs and/or VCs although there may be exceptions to their utility.;2011
Background: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are an important cause of adverse drug reactions. The pharmacoepidemiology of such interactions in hospitals in Uganda is not known. Objectives: To determine the prevalence clinical importance and factors associated with potential DDIs at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) western Uganda. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 235 randomly selected hospitalization episodes (medication charts and medical notes) from MRRH over a 1-year period from January to December 2008. We collected data on demographics medications principal diagnosis co-morbid conditions and the length of hospital stay. Epocrates Rx (R) was used to identify and classify potential DDIs according to mechanism and management strategy. Descriptive statistics were generated and logistic regression used to determine associated factors. Results: Overall prevalence of potential DDIs was approximately 23% (54 medication charts with at least one potential DDI out of 235 hospitalization episodes). Majority were postulated to occur through a pharmacodynamic mechanism (10.6%) and most required either use with caution (11.9%) or modify treatment/monitor (10.6%) as a suggested management strategy. After adjusting for confounders: age sex hospital department and number of co-morbid conditions a principal diagnosis of a cardiovascular disease (OR 6.52 95% CI 1.32-32.14) and having 4 or more medicines on the chart (OR 4.30 95% CI 1.98-9.34) were associated with the presence of a potential DDI. Conclusion: Potential DDIs frequently occur at MRRH although most are not clinically significant. Patients with cardiovascular diseases and those who are prescribed multiple medications need to be monitored more closely.;2011
Background: Hand-held mobile learning technology provides opportunities for clinically relevant self-instructional modules to augment traditional bedside teaching. Using this technology as a teaching tool has not been well studied. We sought to evaluate medical students' case presentation performance and perception when viewing short just-in-time mobile learning videos using the iPod touch prior to patient encounters. Methods: Twenty-two fourth-year medical students were randomized to receive or not to receive instruction by video using the iPod Touch prior to patient encounters. After seeing a patient they presented the case to their faculty who completed a standard data collection sheet. Students were surveyed on their perceived confidence and effectiveness after using these videos. Results: Twenty-two students completed a total of 67 patient encounters. There was a statistically significant improvement in presentations when the videos were viewed for the first time (p=0.032). There was no difference when the presentations were summed for the entire rotation (p=0.671). The reliable (alpha=0.97) survey indicated that the videos were a useful teaching tool and gave students more confidence in their presentations. Conclusion: Medical student patient presentations were improved with the use of mobile instructional videos following first time use suggesting mobile learning videos may be useful in medical student education. Clinical educators should consider whether in an instance where live bedside or direct interactive teaching is unavailable using just-in-time educational videos on a handheld device might be useful as a supplemental instructional strategy.;2011
Background: Healthcare professionals in hospital care increasingly use small-screen handheld computers. Studies that have investigated doctors' concerns about handheld usage have mainly focused on technical organizational and performance issues. Very few have looked at the effects of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) on the interaction between physician and patient. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the effects of PDA usage on the physicians' prescription work their concerns about using it in point-of-care situations and the effects on the patient-physician dialog. Methods: We used a qualitative and comparative approach where 14 physicians each carried out four simulated ward rounds in which they modified the medication of patient actors using a paper-based medical chart and three versions of a PDA-based system. We analyzed ward round video recordings semi-structured interviews with the doctors and focus group using approaches based on ethnomethodology and grounded theory. Results: Physicians used PDA and paper differently. Physicians' actions as well as their non-verbal communication were less transparent and clear for the patient when using a PDA. Doctors were worried about distractions from the handheld device and about a negative impact on the physician-patient conversation. In general physicians were more comfortable with paper but preferred PDA because it offered an undo function and reduced the need to memorize drug names and dosages by providing concrete alternatives in the user interface. Conclusions: Despite the many benefits PDA usage at the point-of-care comes with the increased risk of distractions for physicians and can cause a negative patient experience. Designers of point-of-care systems need to be aware of and address the problems with handhelds and learn from the attributes and access capabilities of paper charts.;2011
Background: In 2009 the first national long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) distribution campaign in Senegal resulted in the distribution of 2.2 million LLINs in two phases to children aged 6-59 months. Door-to-door teams visited all households to administer vitamin A and mebendazole and to give a coupon to redeem later for an LLIN. Methods: A nationwide community-based two-stage cluster survey was conducted with clusters selected within regions by probability proportional to size sampling followed by GPS-assisted mapping simple random selection of households in each cluster and administration of a questionnaire using personal digital assistants (PDAs). The questionnaire followed the Malaria Indicator Survey format with rosters of household members and bed nets and questions on campaign participation. Results: There were 3280 households in 112 clusters representing 33993 people. Most (92.1%) guardians of eligible children had heard about the campaign the primary sources being health workers (33.7%) neighbours (26.2%) and radio (22.0%). Of eligible children 82.4% received mebendazole 83.8% received vitamin A and 75.4% received LLINs. Almost all (91.4%) LLINs received during the campaign remained in the household of those not remaining 74.4% had been given away and none were reported sold. At least one insecticide-treated net (ITN) was present in 82.3% of all households 89.2% of households with a child < 5 years and 57.5% of households without a child < 5 years. Just over half (52.4%) of ITNs had been received during the campaign. Considering possible indicators of universal coverage 39.8% of households owned at least one ITN per two people 21.6% owned at least one ITN per sleeping space and 34.7% of the general population slept under an ITN the night before the survey. In addition 45.6% of children < 5 years and 49.2% of pregnant women had slept under an ITN. Conclusions: The nationwide integrated LLIN distribution campaign allowed household ITN ownership of one or more ITNs to surpass the RBM target of 80% set for 2010 though additional distribution strategies are needed to reach populations missed by the targeted campaign and to reach the universal coverage targets of one ITN per sleeping space and 80% of the population using an ITN.;2011
BACKGROUND: Little information exists on which third-year medical students will become worthy proteges. METHODS: Performance and encounter metrics for 4 classes of medical students were correlated with the students who matched into a surgery residency. RESULTS: Overall 68 of 422 (16%) graduating seniors matched into a surgery residency. Male students were twice as likely as female students to match in surgery were and most (81%) matching students took their general surgery rotation at the university hospital. Students who took certain elective rotations (eg urology and orthopedics) tended to enter those surgical professions. Grades test scores clinical performance oral presentation skills and encounter data were not predictive of which students would enter the surgical profession. CONCLUSION: For surgeons who are willing to mentor medical students our data suggest that currently the selection of medical students worthy of surgeon mentor's time will remain an art.

Background: Obese adults struggle to make the changes necessary to achieve even modest weight loss though a decrease in weight by as little as 10% can have significant health benefits. Failure to meet weight loss goals may in part be associated with barriers to obesity treatment. Wide-spread dissemination of evidence-based obesity treatment faces multiple challenges including cost access and implementing the programmatic characteristics on a large scale. Aims: The PDA+: A Personal Digital Assistant for Obesity Treatment randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to test whether a PDA-based behavioral intervention enhances the effectiveness of the existing group weight loss treatment program at VA Medical Centers Managing Overweight/Obese Veterans Everywhere (MOVE!). We also aim to introduce technology as a way to overcome systemic barriers of traditional obesity treatment. Methods/Design: Veterans enrolled in the MOVE! group at the Hines Hospital VAMC with BMI >= 25 and <= 40 and weigh < 400 pounds experience chronic pain (>= 4 on the NRS-I scale for >= 6 months prior to enrollment) and are able to participate in a moderate intensity exercise program will be recruited and screened for eligibility. Participants will be randomized to receive either: a) MOVE! treatment alone (Standard Care) or b) Standard Care plus PDA (PDA+). Those randomized to PDA+ will record dietary intake physical activity and weight on the PDA. In addition they will also record mood and pain intensity and receive biweekly telephone support for the first 6-months of the 12-month study. All participants will attend in-person lab sessions every three months to complete questionnaires and for the collection of anthropomorphic data. Weight loss and decrease in pain level intensity are the primary outcomes. Discussion: The PDA+ trial represents an important step in understanding ways to improve the use of technology in obesity treatment. The trial will address barriers to obesity care by implementing effective behavioral components of a weight loss intervention and delivering high intensity low cost obesity treatment. This RCT also tests an intervention approach supported by handheld technology in a population traditionally considered to have lower levels of technology literacy.;2011
Background: Remote monitoring is one modality of structured care in chronic heart failure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a new wireless telemonitoring system via a mobile phone network. Methods: Portable home devices for electrocardiogram blood pressure body weight and self-assessment measurements were connected (via Bluetooth (R)) to a personal digital assistant (PDA) that performs automated encrypted transmission via mobile phone. Two telemedical centres were set-up. Results: 30 healthy volunteers were enrolled and followed for 26 days. A total of 4002 single measurements were taken 133 +/- 37 per person. No data was lost or incorrectly allocated. 880 of 937 (94%) of the ECG recordings had sufficient diagnostic quality for rhythm analysis and single beat measurements. 50 continuous ECG-streams (312 min) without disruption were performed. Total system availability was 96.6% including that of the mobile phone network. Conclusions: Mobile phone technology is suitable for continuous and secure medical data transmission. To evaluate the clinical use in chronic heart failure patients a large multicentre randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00543881) was started. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Background-This study was designed to determine whether physician-led remote telemedical management (RTM) compared with usual care would result in reduced mortality in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Methods and Results-We enrolled 710 stable chronic HF patients in New York Heart Association functional class II or III with a left ventricular ejection fraction <35% and a history of HF decompensation within the previous 2 years or with a left ventricular ejection fraction <= 25%. Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1) to RTM or usual care. Remote telemedical management used portable devices for ECG blood pressure and body weight measurements connected to a personal digital assistant that sent automated encrypted transmission via cell phones to the telemedical centers. The primary end point was death from any cause. The first secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for HF. Baseline characteristics were similar between the RTM (n = 354) and control (n = 356) groups. Of the patients assigned to RTM 287 (81%) were at least 70% compliant with daily data transfers and no break for >30 days (except during hospitalizations). The median follow-up was 26 months (minimum 12) and was 99.9% complete. Compared with usual care RTM had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.97 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.41 P=0.87) or on cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.89 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.19 P=0.44). Conclusions-In ambulatory patients with chronic HF RTM compared with usual care was not associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality.;2011
Connecting the physical and the digital world is an upcoming trend that enables numberless use-cases. It can be used to acquire related information by taking and sending pictures to the server for example getting book reviews by a photo of the cover. In this paper we present a novel approach of collaborative interaction model combining tangible user interface and mobile augmented reality. This model is aware of a user's context through the user-centric integration and inference of contextual information in smart space. It has a camera-based architecture that captures an image to recognize smart object and generates user interface. Our proposed matching approach was based on identifying semi-local visual parts from multiple query images. Experiments on two real-world datasets showed that this approach was superior to conventional solutions.;2011
CONROY M. B. K. YANG O. U. ELCI K. P. GABRIEL M. A. STYN J. WANG A. M. KRISKA S. M. SEREIKA and L. E. BURKE. Physical Activity Self-Monitoring and Weight Loss: 6-Month Results of the SMART Trial. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. Vol. 43 No. 8 pp. 1568-1574 2011. Introduction: Weight loss has been associated with higher physical activity (PA) levels and frequent dietary self-monitoring. Less is known about how PA self-monitoring affects adherence to PA goals PA levels and weight change. Methods: The SMART Trial is a clinical weight loss trial in which 210 overweight adults were randomized equally to one of three arms: 1) paper record (PR) 2) personal digital assistant with self-monitoring software (PDA) and 3) PDA with daily tailored feedback message (PDA + FB). PA self-monitoring and adherence to PA goals were based on entries in weekly submitted diaries. PA levels were measured via self-report by the past 6-month Modifiable Activity Questionnaire at baseline and 6 months. Results: Data are presented on 189 participants with complete 6-month PA data (84% female 77% white mean age = 47.3 +/- 8.8 yr mean body mass index = 34.1 +/- 4.5 kg.m(-2)). Median PA level was 7.96 MET.h.wk(-1) at baseline and 13.4 MET.h.wk(-1) at 6 months with significant PA increases in all three arms. PDA + FB arm had a higher mean number of weekly self-monitoring entries than the PR arm (3.4 vs 2.4 P = 0.003) and were more likely to maintain high (i.e. 100%) adherence to PA goals over time than the PDA (P = 0.02) or PR arms (P = 0.0003). Both PA self-monitoring and adherence to PA goals were related to higher PA levels at 6 months. A higher mean rate of PA self-monitoring was associated with a greater percentage of weight decrease (rho = -0.49 P < 0.0001) at 6 months. Conclusions: PA self-monitoring and adherence to PA goals were more likely in participants in the PDA + FB arm and in turn predicted higher PA levels and weight loss.;2011
Contemporary theoretical models of paranoia suggest that negative emotions perceptual anomalies and recent life events are important predictors of experiencing persecutory ideation. In the current experience sampling study these factors are examined prospectively for the first time as predictors of the occurrence of persecutory ideation as well as persecutory belief conviction and associated distress in real time in the context of daily life. One hundred and forty five community-dwelling participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed self-report assessments generated by a personal digital assistant multiple times a day for 1 week. Their responses were time lagged to allow examination of dynamic prospective relationships between variables as they occur within days. Approximately half of the participants reported having some persecutory thoughts with a total of 378 reported occurrences of persecutory thoughts across participants during the week. Negative emotional states of anxiety and sadness were significant predictors of the occurrence of subsequent persecutory ideation but hallucinations and recent life events were not. In a subsample of people who had multiple persecutory thoughts anxiety was a significant predictor of belief conviction and associated distress while sadness was only predictive of distress. The findings are consistent with recent cognitive theory that proposes a causal role for negative emotional states in the formation and maintenance of persecutory ideation and suggest that persecutory ideation may be addressed indirectly by interventions targeting anxiety and depression.;2011
Continuous technological advances have allowed that mobile devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) can execute sophisticated applications that more often than not must be equipped with a layer of security that should include the confidentiality and the authentication services within its repertory. Nevertheless when compared against front-end computing devices most PDAs are still seen as constrained devices with limited processing and storage capabilities. In order to achieve Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC) which was an open problem proposed by Adi Shamir in 1984 Boneh and Franklin presented in Crypto 2001 a solution that uses bilinear pairings as its main building block. Since then IBC has become an active area of investigation where many efficient IBC security protocols are proposed year after year. In this paper we present a cryptographic application that allows the secure exchange of documents from a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) that is wirelessly connected to other nodes. The architecture of our application is inspired by the traditional PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) email security protocol. Our application achieves identity-based authentication and confidentiality functionalities at the 80-bit security level through the usage of a cryptographic library that was coded in C++. Our library can perform basic primitives such as bilinear pairings defined over the binary field F(2)233 and the ternary field F(3)97 as well as other required primitives known as map-to-point hash functions. We report the timings achieved by our application and we show that they compare well against other similar works published in the open literature.;2011
Conversation provides an excellent means of communication for almost all people. Consequently a conversational interface is an excellent mechanism for allowing people to interact with systems. Conversational systems are an active research area but a wide range of systems can be developed with current technology. More sophisticated interfaces can take considerable effort but simple interfaces can be developed quite rapidly. This paper provides an introduction to the current state of the art of conversational systems and interfaces. It describes a methodology for developing conversational interfaces and gives an example of an interface for a state benefits website. The paper discusses how this interface could improve access for a wide range of people and how further development of this interface would allow a larger range of people to use the system with enhanced functionality.;2011
Conversational systems are gaining popularity rapidly. Consequently the believability of the conversational systems or chatterbots is becoming increasingly important. Recent research has proven that learning chatterbots tend to be rated as being more believable by users. Based on Raj's Model for Chatterbot Trust we present a model for allowing chatterbots to determine the degree of contradictions in contradictory statements when learning thereby allowing them to potentially learn more accurately via a form of discourse. Some information that is learnt by a chatterbot may be contradicted by other information presented subsequently. Choosing correctly which information to use is critical in chatterbot believability. Our model uses sentence structures and patterns to compute contradiction degrees that can be used to overcome the limitations of Raj's Trust Model which takes any contradictory information as being equally contradictory as opposed to some contradictions being greater than others and therefore having a greater impact on the actions that the chatterbot should take. This paper also presents the relevant proofs and tests of the contradiction degree model as well as a potential implementation method to integrate our model with Raj's Trust Model.;2011
Cooking themselves is very important and difficult for elderly and disabled people in daily life. This paper presents a cooking robot for those people who are confined to wheelchairs. The robot can automatically load ingredients cook Chinese dishes take cooked foods out deliver dishes to the table self-clean collect used ingredient box components and so on. Its structure and interface is designed based on the barrier-free design principles. Elderly and disabled people can only click one button in the friendly Graphic User Interface of a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to launch the cooking processes and several classic Chinese dishes would be placed in front of them one after another within few minutes. Experiments show that the robot can meet their special needs and the involved aid activities are easy and effective for elderly and disabled people.;2011
Current healthcare literature lacks development and evaluation methods for research and practice measures administered by technology. Researchers with varying levels of informatics experience are developing technology-delivered measures because of the numerous advantages they offer. Hasty development of technology-delivered measures can present issues that negatively influence administration and psychometric properties. The Method for Technology-delivered Healthcare Measures is designed to systematically guide the development and evaluation of technology-delivered measures. The five-step Method for Technology-delivered Healthcare Measures includes establishment of content e-Health literacy technology delivery expert usability and participant usability. Background information and Method for Technology-delivered Healthcare Measures steps are detailed.;2011
Detection thresholds for gaps and overlaps that is acoustic and perceived silences and stretches of overlapping speech in speaker changes were determined. Subliminal gaps and overlaps were categorized as no-gap-no-overlaps. The established gap and overlap detection thresholds both corresponded to the duration of a long vowel or about 120 ms. These detection thresholds are valuable for mapping the perceptual speaker change categories gaps overlaps and no-gap-no-overlaps into the acoustic domain. Furthermore the detection thresholds allow generation and understanding of gaps overlaps and no-gap-no-overlaps in human-like spoken dialogue systems. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

Due to the rapid technological advances in mobile and wireless networking devices personal computing has moved towards into ad hoc and pervasive environments. Today the dynamic nature of mobile applications and services have integrated them far more in end-users' lives. Organizations need an effective way of handling their information system for their employees and customers. Mobile devices such as notebook computers Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) smart phones owned by the corporate and individual users should be adaptable into the existing business environment. In this paper we present a hash-based framework namely SCDE (Shared Corporate Data Extraction) using the current ontological architectures of the corporate domains. This study presents a semantic hashing mechanism formulating an effective search query and assists users with an easier query builder interface. It also extends the features of the user preferences sub-ontology and provides an effective performance against well-known weaknesses of mobile devices. Our model also supports future plans of users' interaction with semantic structures knowledge sharing and new business opportunities for Corporate Information Management Systems.;2011
Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are designed to provide natural and intuitive communication with a human user. One major current topic in agent design consequently is to enhance their believability often by incorporating internal models of emotions or motivations. As psychological theories often lack the necessary details for direct implementation many agent modelers currently rely on models that are rather marginal in current psychological research or models that are created ad hoc with little theoretical and empirical foundation. The goal of this article is both to raise psychologists' awareness of the central challenges in the process of creating psychologically believable agents and to recommend existing psychological frameworks to the virtual agentscommunity that seem particularly useful for implementation in ECAs. Special attention is paid to a computationally detailed model of basic social motives that seems particularly useful for implementation: the Zurich model of social motivation.;2011
Emotion is a research area that has received much attention during the last 10 years both in the context of speech synthesis image understanding as well as in automatic speech recognition interactive dialogues systems and wearable computing. There are promising studies on the emotional behaviour of people mainly based on human observations. Only a few are based on automatic machine detection due to the lack of Information Technology and Engineering (ITE) techniques that can make available a deeper and large-scale noninvasive analysis and evaluation of people's emotional behaviour and provide tools and support for helping them to overcome social barriers. The present paper reports a study for extracting and associating emotional meta-features to support the development of emotionally rich man-machine interfaces (interactive dialogue systems and intelligent avatars).;2011
For many forms of e-learning environments the system's behavior can be viewed as a sequential decision process wherein at each discrete step the system is responsible for selecting the next action to take. Pedagogical strategies are policies to decide the next system action when there are multiple ones available. In this project we present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for inducing effective pedagogical strategies and empirical evaluations of the induced strategies. This paper addresses the technical challenges in applying RL to Cordillera a Natural Language Tutoring System teaching students introductory college physics. The algorithm chosen for this project is a model-based RL approach Policy Iteration and the training corpus for the RL approach is an exploratory corpus which was collected by letting the system make random decisions when interacting with real students. Overall our results show that by using a rather small training corpus the RL-induced strategies indeed measurably improved the effectiveness of Cordillera in that the RL-induced policies improved students' learning gains significantly.;2011
Human-robot interaction (HRI)(1) is one of the main fields in the study and research of robotics. Within this field dialogue systems and interaction by voice play an important role. When speaking about human-robot natural dialogue we assume that the robot has the capability to accurately recognize what the human wants to transmit verbally and even its semantic meaning but this is not always achieved. In this article we describe the steps and requirements that we went through in order to endow the personal social robot Maggie developed at the University Carlos III of Madrid with the capability of understanding the natural language spoken by any human. We have analyzed the different possibilities offered by current software/hardware alternatives by testing them in real environments. We have obtained accurate data related to the speech recognition capabilities in different environments using the most modern audio acquisition systems and analyzing not so typical parameters such as user age gender intonation volume and language. Finally we propose a new model to classify recognition results as accepted or rejected based on a second automatic speech recognition (ASR) opinion. This new approach takes into account the precalculated success rate in noise intervals for each recognition framework decreasing the rate of false positives and false negatives.;2011
If a spoken dialog system can respond to a user as naturally as a human the interaction will appear smoother. In this research we aim to develop a spoken dialog system that emulates human behavior in a dialog. The proposed system makes use of a decision tree to generate responses at the appropriate times. These responses include 'aizuchi' (back-channel) 'repetition' 'collaborative completion' etc. At each time interval the decision tree generates the response timing features referring to the pitch and energy contours recognition hypotheses and the preparation status of the response generator. A subjective evaluation shows that there is a high degree of naturalness in the timing of ordinary responses and aizuchi and that the spoken dialog system exhibits user-friendly behavior. The recorded voice system was preferred to a text-to-speech system (synthesized speech) and almost all subjects felt familiarity with the aizuchi. (C) 2010 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

In spoken dialog systems information must be presented sequentially making it difficult to quickly browse through a large number of options. Recent studies have shown that user satisfaction is negatively correlated with dialog duration suggesting that systems should be designed to maximize the efficiency of the interactions. Analysis of the logs of 2000 dialogs between users and nine different dialog systems reveals that a large percentage of the time is spent on the information presentation phase thus there is potentially a large pay-off to be gained from optimizing information presentation in spoken dialog systems. This article proposes a method that improves the efficiency of coping with large numbers of diverse options by selecting options and then structuring them based on a model of the user's preferences. This enables the dialog system to automatically determine trade-offs between alternative options that are relevant to the user and present these trade-offs explicitly. Multiple attractive options are thereby structured such that the user can gradually refine her request to find the optimal trade-off. To evaluate and challenge our approach we conducted a series of experiments that test the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results show that basing the content structuring and content selection process on a user model increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the user's interaction. Users complete their tasks more successfully and more quickly. Furthermore user surveys revealed that participants found that the user-model based system presents complex trade-offs understandably and increases overall user satisfaction. The experiments also indicate that presenting users with a brief overview of options that do not fit their requirements significantly improves the user's overview of available options also making them feel more confident in having been presented with all relevant options.;2011
In this paper we address the problem of personalization and automatic generation of museum visits with mobile devices guidance. We propose here a ubiquitous software and hardware infrastructure that supports in a collaborative way the generation of museum handheld-based visits. Particularly we define the problem to be solved as an instance of the Orienteering Problem. We present an implementation of a distributed algorithm in which every computing element of the ubiquitous infrastructure contributes to the generation of sub-optimal solutions that meet the user requirements. Finally we discuss some experimental results that validate the proposed ideas and the results obtained by a questionnaire answered by real visitors. This questionnaire was filled in during the largest deployment of this technology in Spain in which 100 Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) were made available to visitors as part of the exhibition Sorolla: Vision of Spain.

In this paper we propose a method for predicting the user mental state for the development of more efficient and usable spoken dialogue systems. This prediction carried out for each user turn in the dialogue makes it possible to adapt the system dynamically to the user needs. The mental state is built on the basis of the emotional state of the user and their intention and is recognized by means of a module conceived as an intermediate phase between natural language understanding and the dialogue management in the architecture of the systems. We have implemented the method in the UAH system for which the evaluation results with both simulated and real users show that taking into account the user's mental state improves system performance as well as its perceived quality.;2011
In this paper we propose a privacy-preserving emergency call scheme called PEC enabling patients in life-threatening emergencies to fast and accurately transmit emergency data to the nearby helpers via mobile healthcare social networks (MHSNs). Once an emergency happens the personal digital assistant (PDA) of the patient runs the PEC to collect the emergency data including emergency location patient health record as well as patient physiological condition. The PEC then generates an emergency call with the emergency data inside and epidemically disseminates it to every user in the patient's neighborhood. If a physician happens to be nearby the PEC ensures the time used to notify the physician of the emergency is the shortest. We show via theoretical analysis that the PEC is able to provide fine-grained access control on the emergency data where the access policy is set by patients themselves. Moreover the PEC can withstand multiple types of attacks such as identity theft attack forgery attack and collusion attack. We also devise an effective revocation mechanism to make the revocable PEC (rPEC) resistant to inside attacks. In addition we demonstrate via simulation that the PEC can significantly reduce the response time of emergency care in MHSNs.;2011
Intelligent agent-based assistants are systems that try to simplify peoples work based on computers. Recent research on intelligent assistance has presented significant results in several and different situations. Building such a system is a difficult task that requires expertise in numerous artificial intelligence and engineering disciplines. A key point in this kind of system is knowledge handling. The use of ontologies for representing domain knowledge and for supporting reasoning is becoming wide-spread in many areas including intelligent assistance. In this paper we present how ontologies can be used to support intelligent assistance in a multi-agent system context. We show how ontologies may be spread over the multi-agent system architecture highlighting their role controlling user interaction and service description. We present in detail an ontology-based conversational interface for personal assistants showing how to design an ontology for semantic interpretation and how the interpretation process uses it for semantic analysis. We also present how ontologies are used to describe decentralized services based on a multi-agent architecture.;2011
Introduction. Cancer patients are at high risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Clinicians need to know the magnitude of DDIs so as to better manage their patients' drug therapies. We have previously created a novel interaction database for oncology prescriptions (OncoRx). In this project we leverage on 3G networks to further develop this database into an iPhone-specific application for the mobile internet (OncoRx-MI). Methodology. Data on anticancer drugs (ACDs) chemotherapy regimens (CRegs) and DDIs with psychotropics were compiled from various hardcopy and online resources and published articles from PubMed Scopus and Science Direct. The database and iPhone web documents were designed using Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 and associated with a combination of open-source programming scripts. Results. OncoRx-MI currently detects over 5000 DDIs (69.3% pharmacokinetic 30.7% pharmacodynamic) between 256 single-agent and combination CRegs with 51 psychotropic drugs. OncoRx-MI fits the iPhone screen configuration and displays information regarding the regimen pharmacokinetics of the drugs and detected DDIs in tabular format for improved usability. Conclusion. OncoRx-MI is the first mobile DDI application of its kind which detects interactions for combination CRegs. Future versions will include DDIs with other drug categories. Usability studies on its impact in clinical practice will also be carried out.;2011
Lithium-ion secondary batteries are commonly used in electric vehicles smart phones personal digital assistants (PDA) notebooks and electric cars. These lithium-ion secondary batteries must charge and discharge rapidly causing the interior temperature to rise quickly raising a safety issue. Over-charging results in an unstable voltage and current causing potential safety problems such as thermal runaways and explosions. Thus a micro flexible temperature sensor for the in in-situ monitoring of temperature inside a lithium-ion secondary battery must be developed. In this work flexible micro temperature sensors were integrated into a lithium-ion secondary battery using the micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) process for monitoring temperature in situ.;2011
Many handheld devices with stylus pens are available in the market however there have been few studies which examine the effects of the size of the stylus pen on user performance and subjective preferences for handheld device interfaces for various age groups. Two experiments (pen-length experiment and pen-tip width/pen-width experiment) were conducted to determine the most suitable dimensions (pen-length pen-tip width and pen-width) for a stylus pen among young adult child and older users. In pen-length experiment five pen-lengths (7 9 11 13 and 15 cm) were evaluated for young adult child and older users respectively. In pen-tip width/pen-width experiment six combinations of three pen-tip widths (0.5 1.0 and 1.5 mm) and two pen-widths (4 and 7 mm) were compared for young adult child and older users respectively. In both experiments subjects conducted pointing steering and writing tasks on a PDA. The results were assessed in terms of user performance and subjective evaluations for all three pointing steering and writing tasks. We determined that the most suitable dimensions of the pen are as follows: pen-length 11-15 cm pen-tip width 1.0-1.5 mm and pen-width 7 mm for older users for child users pen-length 7-13 cm pen-tip width 1.0-1.5 mm and pen-width 4 mm and for young adult users pen-length 11 cm pen-tip width 0.5 mm and pen-width 7 mm.;2011
Mobile electronic displays for geographic orientation and navigation are used increasingly in various civil and military domains. But it is still unclear which displays and kinds of map presentation suit best for specific purposes. In the present experiment a head-mounted display (HMD) and a display from a personal digital assistant (PDA) were compared in a simulated geographic orientation task in an urban environment. Furthermore the effect of three kinds of map presentation (egocentric geocentric and geocentric with colour cues) was analysed. The simulated orientation task was projected on a screen and participants controlled their locomotion within the urban area by means of a joystick. Task completion time peripheral attention workload fatigue and simulator sickness were registered as dependent variables. In comparison to the geocentric map the egocentric map showed a significant shorter task completion time and the geocentric map with colour cues a significant higher peripheral attention. Task completion time of the HMD and the PDA did not differ significantly. However peripheral attention and most indices of workload fatigue and simulator sickness were significantly better for the PDA. Therefore the results recommend to apply PDAs and egocentric maps for comparable orientation tasks.;2011
Modeling interaction with robots raises new and different challenges for dialogue modeling than traditional dialogue modeling with less-embodied machines. We present four case studies of implementing a typical human-robot interaction (HRI) scenario with different state-of-the-art dialogue frameworks in order to identify challenges and pitfalls specific to HRI and potential solutions. The results are discussed with a special focus on the interplay between dialogue and task modeling on robots.;2011
Multimodal conversational spoken dialogues using physical and virtual agents provide a potential interface to motivate and support users in the domain of health and fitness. This paper describes how such multimodal conversational Companions can be implemented to support their owners in various pervasive and mobile settings. We present concrete system architectures virtual physical and mobile multimodal interfaces and interaction management techniques for such Companions. In particular how knowledge representation and separation of low-level interaction modelling from high-level reasoning at the domain level makes it possible to implement distributed but still coherent interaction with Companions. The distribution is enabled by using a dialogue plan to communicate information from domain level planner to dialogue management and from there to a separate mobile interface. The model enables each part of the system to handle the same information from its own perspective without containing overlapping logic and makes it possible to separate task-specific and conversational dialogue management from each other. In addition to technical descriptions results from the first evaluations of the Companions interfaces are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an integral part of a conversation and by proxy an integral part of a chatterbot. Building a complete vocabulary for a chatterbot is a prohibitively time and effort intensive endeavor and thus makes a learning chatterbot a much more efficient alternative. Learning can be performed from many facets including individual words to phrases and concepts. From the perspective of words the grammatical parts of speech become important since they allow meaning and structure to be derived from a sentence. Verbs tend to be unique since they have different forms namely participles and tenses. As such we present an algorithm to derive the base verb from any participle or tense.;2011
Network effects and standards competition introduce significant market uncertainty creating a substantial challenge to the success of innovating firms. Although the literature has highlighted the importance of establishing a large installed-user base (the number of users adopting the same product) in such markets the authors draw attention to a different but potentially important market force: the supporting-firm base which they define as the number of firms supporting the same technological standard. They test their proposed hypotheses using data from two markets: the floppy disk drive and personal digital assistant markets. Their results show that (1) consumer product valuation is positively affected not only by the installed-user base but also by the supporting-firm base (2) the two positive effects interact with each other and the nature of the interaction changes over the evolution of the market (i.e. they strengthen each other's impact in the early stage but weaken each other's impact in the late stage of the product life cycle) and (3) not all supporting firms are equally valuable to the innovator specifically consumers are affected more by firms exclusively supporting a single standard than by firms supporting multiple standards and by incumbents than by new entrants.;2011
Objective To compare patients' opinions about family physicians looking up medical information during consultations with family physicians' expectations of how patients would respond to their using sources to find answers to medical questions. Design Survey. Setting North York Ont. Participants One hundred fifty-three family practice patients 54 family physicians and 21 family practice residents. Main outcome measures Patients' self-reported confidence in their family physicians and their perceptions of the quality of care after seeing physicians look up medical information both without specifying the physician's source of information and with reference to several specific information media. Family physicians' predictions for how patients would respond to their using resources to answer medical questions. Results When the information source used by physicians was not specified 9% and 7% of patients reported decreased confidence and perceived lower quality of care respectively. When the information source used by physicians was specified the proportions of negative responses for patients' confidence and their perceptions of quality of care were 39% and 31% respectively for Internet search engines (ISEs) 8% and 7% for online resources designed for physicians (ORDP) 27% and 27% for personal digital assistants (PDAs) and 10% and 9% for hard-copy medical textbooks (HMTs). When the information source was not specified 32% and 12% of physicians expected patients to report negative responses for confidence and perceptions of quality of care respectively. When the information source was specified 51% and 33% of physicians expected patients to report negative responses for confidence and perceptions of quality of care respectively for their use of ISEs 16% and 8% for ORDP 20% and 12% for PDAs and 36% and 21% for HMTs. Younger patients were more likely to respond negatively to physicians' use of resources especially if the source was an ISE (P < .001). Physicians earlier in their careers were more likely to expect negative patient responses (P < .05). Conclusion Family physicians overestimated the decrease in patients' confidence caused by seeing them look up medical questions. While most patients responded positively a substantial proportion of younger patients reported decreased confidence. Patients believed the best sources of information were ORDP and HMTs.;2011
Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness and impact of a customized Web-based software program implemented in 2006 for school-wide documentation of clinical interventions by pharmacy practice faculty members pharmacy residents and student pharmacists. Methods. The implementation process directed by a committee of faculty members and school administrators included preparation and refinement of the software user training development of forms and reports and integration of the documentation process within the curriculum. Results. Use of the documentation tool consistently increased from May 2007 to December 2010. Over 187000 interventions were documented with over $6.2 million in associated cost avoidance. Conclusions. Successful implementation of a school-wide documentation tool required considerable time from the oversight committee and a comprehensive training program for all users with ongoing monitoring of data collection practices. Data collected proved to be useful to show the impact of faculty members residents and student pharmacists at affiliated training sites.;2011
Objective: Despite evidence demonstrating elevated comorbidity between schizophrenia and substance use disorders the underlying mechanisms of association remain poorly understood. The brief time intervals that characterize interactions between substance use and psychotic symptoms in daily life are inaccessible to standard research protocols. The authors used electronic personal digital assistants (PDAs) to examine the temporal association of diverse forms of substance use with psychotic symptoms and psychological states in natural contexts. Method: Of 199 community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were contacted to participate in the study 92% accepted and 73% completed the study. The 145 participants who completed the study provided reports of substance use psychotic symptoms mood and event negativity multiple times per day over 7 consecutive days through PDAs. Results: Participants responded to 72% of the electronic interviews (N=2737) across daily life contexts. Strong within-day prospective associations were observed in both directions between substance use and negative psychological states or psychotic symptoms but considerable variation was observed by substance type. Consistent with the notion of self-medication alcohol use was most likely to follow increases in anxious mood or psychotic symptoms. Cannabis and other illicit substances demonstrating more complex patterns were more likely to follow certain psychological states but were also associated with the later onset of psychotic symptoms. Conclusions: The dynamic interplay of substance use and psychotic symptoms is in many cases consistent with both causal and self-medication mechanisms and these patterns of association should be considered in the design of treatment and prevention strategies.;2011
Objective: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic and often disabling disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in alleviating IBS symptoms. The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility and the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral e-intervention using personal digital assistants (PDAs) on the self-management of IBS patients. Methods: A feasibility trial was conducted with 38 control group patients receiving standard care and 37 intervention group patients receiving standard care supplemented with a 4-week CBT intervention on PDAs. All patients fulfilled the diagnostic Rome III criteria for IBS. At baseline 4-week and 3-month follow-up patients' abdominal pain dysfunctional cognitions IBS quality of life and pain catastrophizing thoughts were assessed using written questionnaires. Results: Between-group comparisons between baseline and 4 weeks showed more overall quality of life improvement more improvement in catastrophizing thoughts and more pain improvement in the intervention group. Only improvement in catastrophizing thoughts persisted in the long-term. No significant differences between groups were found for dysfunctional cognitions. As all 37 intervention group patients completed the intervention and completed diaries three times a day for 4 weeks the e-health intervention seems feasible. Conclusions: A cognitive-behavioral intervention on pocket-type computers appears feasible and efficacious for improving IBS-related complaints and cognitions in the short-term. The intervention group improved on several aspects but most on catastrophizing thoughts and these improvements even persisted after 3 months. Future studies should focus on unravelling the effective components of this innovative e-health intervention. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2011
Objective: The dialysis dietary regimen is complicated and computer-based dietary self-monitoring may be useful for helping dialysis patients manage their dietary regimen. In this report we describe dietary self-monitoring rates among study participants randomized to the intervention arms of 2 pilot studies. Methods: Both studies tested similar interventions involving dietary counseling paired with personal digital assistant-based self-monitoring. One study was performed in hemodialysis (HD) and one in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Results: HD intervention participants entered an average of 244.9 meals (median = 288 interquartile range [IQR]: 186 to 342) over the 16-week intervention 2.2 meals per day (median = 2.6 IQR: 1.7 to 3.1) and 73% of expected meals (median = 86 IQR: 55 to 102) assuming intake of 3 meals per day. At least some meals were entered in 87% of the observed weeks (median = 100% IQR: 81 to 100). PD intervention participants entered an average of 212.1 meals (median = 203 IQR: 110 to 312) over the 16-week intervention 1.9 meals per day (median = 1.8 IQR: 1 to 2.8) and 63% of expected meals (median = 60 IQR: 33 to 93) assuming 3 meals per day. At least some meals were entered in 80% of the observed weeks (median = 94 IQR: 50 to 100). Conclusion: These HD and PD patients demonstrated excellent rates of self-monitoring. Additional research with a larger sample is required to confirm these findings. (C) 2011 by the National Kidney Foundation Inc. All rights reserved.;2011
Objective: To describe the prevalence and patterns of rape perpetration in a randomly selected sample of men from the general adult population to explore factors associated with rape and to describe how men explained their acts of rape. Design: Cross-sectional household study with a two-stage randomly selected sample of men. Methods: 1737 South African men aged 18-49 completed a questionnaire administered using an Audio-enhanced Personal Digital Assistant. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify factors associated with rape perpetration. Results: In all 27.6% (466/1686) of men had raped a woman whether an intimate partner stranger or acquaintance and whether perpetrated alone or with accomplices and 4.7% had raped in the last 12 months. First rapes for 75% were perpetrated before age 20 and 53.9% (251) of those raping did so on multiple occasions. The logistic regression model showed that having raped was associated with greater adversity in childhood having been raped by a man and higher maternal education. It was associated with less equitable views on gender relations having had more partners and many more gender inequitable practices including transactional sex and physical partner violence. Also drug use gang membership and a higher score on the dimensions of psychopathic personality namely blame externalisation and Machiavellian egocentricity. Asked about why they did it the most common motivations stemmed from ideas of sexual entitlement. Conclusions: Perpetration of rape is so prevalent that population-based measures of prevention are essential to complement criminal justice system responses. Our findings show the importance of measures to build gender equity and change dominant ideas of masculinity and gender relations as part of rape prevention. Reducing men's exposure to trauma in childhood is also critically important.;2011
Objective: To determine whether automated reminders from 2 contemporary personal digital assistant (PDA) devices produce higher rates of timely task completion in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Setting: Outpatient and community rehabilitation settings. Participants: Thirty-six adults aged 18 to 66 years with TBI and self-determined complaints of memory impairment. Measures: Timely completion rates for assigned memory tasks under 4 randomly assigned memory aid conditions. Results: Significantly higher completion rates were found when using either PDA device when compared with a combined baseline and paper memory aid condition (for Palm OS device Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] = 2.14 P < .0005 CI [confidence interval] = 1.77-2.59 for Microsoft Pocket PCOS device IRR = 1.47 P < .001 CI = 1.18-1.82). A significant difference in completion rates was also found between the 2 PDA devices (IRR = 1.46 P < .0005 CI = 1.26-1.70) with the Palm version producing the better scores. Conclusions: Substantially higher rates of task completion (more than double in some cases) when using either PDA device suggest that rehabilitation clinicians can make productive use of PDA-based memory aids in their TBI patient populations. The strength of the effects of PDA device usage argues for further investigation of the impact of device usage on quality-of-life and costs of care and of personal and caregiver factors predictive of successful and sustained device usage.;2011
Objective: To examine (i) situational characteristics of young adults' eating occasions including away-from-home eating social influences and multi-tasking and (ii) how these characteristics are associated with specific foods/beverages consumed. Design: Participants logged numerous characteristics of eating occasions (n 1237) in real time over 7 d. Setting: Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area (Minnesota USA). Subjects: Forty-eight participants aged 18-23 years. Results: Half of all eating occasions (46%) occurred alone 26% occurred while watching television and 36% involved other multi-tasking. Most participants (63%) did not think about their food choices in advance of eating occasions. Eating that occurred in the absence of television viewing and/or other multi-tasking was less likely to include sweetened beverages and more likely to include items like water fruit vegetables cereal grains and entrees. Eating occasions occurring alone and/or those occurring at home were more likely to include snack foods that required little preparation (e.g. cookies baked goods) and less likely to include more traditional meal items (e.g. fruits vegetables entre items). Conclusions: Overall a large proportion of young adults' eating occasions occurred alone while engaging in other activities and with little advanced planning. Although many young adults' eating occasions consist of a wide range of highly processed energy-dense convenience products more traditional meal settings (i.e. eating at home with others in the absence of multi-tasking) may result in more structured mealtimes and better food choices such as more fruits and vegetables. Effective behavioural strategies promoting positive eating patterns including home meal preparation are urgently needed among young adults.;2011
Objective: To examine the effects of a medication review project by geriatricians and geriatric medicine fellows on polypharmacy in a teaching nursing home. Design: Quality improvement intervention study Setting: Long-term care facility in Honolulu HI Participants: Seventy-four patients with the Minimum Data Set quality indicator criteria of polypharmacy (9 or more medications). Intervention: Geriatric medicine fellows and faculty reviewed each patient's medication list consulted the updated Beers Criteria and Epocrates online drug-drug interaction program and recommended medication changes to the patients' primary care physicians. Measurements: Descriptive statistics including means standard deviations and sums of variables were obtained for the number of medications in the following categories: total number scheduled pro re nata high risk contraindicated with potential drug-drug interactions and with no indication. Results: Of 160 patients residing in a nursing home 74 were on 9 or more medications. After the intervention the mean number of medications per patient in the following categories decreased significantly: total number (16.64 to 15.54 P < .001) scheduled (11.3 to 10.99 P < .001) pro re nata (5.33 to 4.56 P < .001) high risk (0.94 to 0.73 P < .001) contraindicated (0.29 to 0.13 P = .004) with potential drug-drug interactions (6.1 to 4.83 P < .001) and with no indication (3.34 to 3.29 P = .045). Conclusion: Polypharmacy in long-term care is prevalent and can lead to increased adverse effects and potentially inappropriate prescriptions. This study demonstrates an effective geriatrician-led intervention that both reduced polypharmacy and provided core competency training for geriatric medicine fellows.

Objective: To investigate the associations between intimate partner violence rape and HIV among South African men. Design: Cross-sectional study involving a randomly-selected sample of men. Methods: We tested hypotheses that perpetration of physical intimate partner violence and rape were associated with prevalent HIV infections in a cross-sectional household study of 1229 South African men aged 18-49. Violence perpetration was elicited in response to a questionnaire administered using an Audio-enhanced Personal Digital Assistant and blood samples were tested for HIV. A multivariable logistic regression model was built to identify factors associated with HIV. Results: 18.3% of men had HIV. 29.6% (358/1211) of men disclosed rape perpetration 5.2% (63/1208) rape in the past year and 30.7% (362/1180) of had been physically violent towards an intimate partner more than once. Overall rape perpetration was not associated with HIV. The model of factors associated with having HIV showed men under 25 years who had been physically violent towards partners were more likely to have HIV than men under 25 who had not (aOR 2.08 95% CI 1.07-4.06 p = 0.03). We failed to detect any association in older men. Conclusions: Perpetration of physical IPV is associated with HIV sero-prevalence in young men after adjusting for other risk factors. This contributes to our understanding of why women who experience violence have a higher HIV prevalence. Rape perpetration was not associated but the HIV prevalence among men who had raped was very high. HIV prevention in young men must seek to change ideals of masculinity in which male partner violence is rooted.;2011
Objectives: To describe the development cost effectiveness and implementation of a PDA based electronic system to collect verify and manage data from a multi-site study on HIV/AIDS stigma and pregnancy in a rural resource-poor area. Methods: We worked within a large prevention of mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) program in nine rural health facilities to implement a PDA-based data collection system and to study the feasibility of its use in a multisite HIV research study in rural Kenya. The PDAs were programmed for collecting screening and eligibility data and responses to structured interviews on HIV/AIDS stigma and violence in three local languages. Results: Between November 2007 and December 2008 nine PDAs were used by Clinic and Community Health Assistants to enrol 1270 participants on to the PMTCT program. Successes included: capacity-building of interviewers low cost of implementation quick turnaround time of data entry with good data quality and convenience. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing PDAs for data collection in a multi-site observational study on HIV/AIDS stigma conducted in remote rural health facilities in Kenya. However appropriate and frequent data backup protocols need to be established and paper forms are still needed as backup tools in resource-poor settings.;2011
Objectives: To evaluate the validity reliability responsiveness and mode preference of electronic data capture (EDC) using the Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) numerical rating scale (NRS) 3.1 Osteoarthritis (OA) Index on Motorola V3 mobile phones. Study Design and Setting: Patients with OA undergoing hip or knee joint replacement were assessed preoperatively and 3-4 months postoperatively completing the WOMAC Index in paper (p-WOMAC) and electronic (m-WOMAC) format in random order. Results: Data were successfully and securely transmitted from patients in Australia to a server in the United States. Pearson correlations between the summated total index scores (TISs) for the p-WOMAC and m-WOMAC pre- and postsurgery were 0.98 and 0.99 (P < 0.0001). There were no clinically important or statistically significant between-method differences in the adjusted total summated scores pre- and postsurgery (adjusted mean differences = 4.44 P = 0.474 and 1.73 P = 0.781 respectively). Internal consistency estimates of m-WOMAC reliability were 0.87-0.98. The m-WOMAC detected clinically important statistically significant (P < 0.0001) improvements in pain stiffness function and TIS. No statistically significant differences in mode preference were detected. Conclusions: There was close agreement and no significant differences between m-WOMAC and p-WOMAC scores. This study confirms the validity reliability and responsiveness of the Exco InTouch-engineered Java-based m-WOMAC Index application. EDC with the m-WOMAC Index provides unique opportunities for using quantitative measurement in clinical research and practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2011
One of the first steps in building a spoken language understanding (SLU) module for dialogue systems is the extraction of flat concepts out of a given word sequence usually provided by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In this paper six different modeling approaches are investigated to tackle the task of concept tagging. These methods include classical well-known generative and discriminative methods like Finite State Transducers (FSTs) Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) or Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as techniques recently applied to natural language processing such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). Following a detailed description of the models experimental and comparative results are presented on three corpora in different languages and with different complexity. The French MEDIA corpus has already been exploited during an evaluation campaign and so a direct comparison with existing benchmarks is possible. Recently collected Italian and Polish corpora are used to test the robustness and portability of the modeling approaches. For all tasks manual transcriptions as well as ASR inputs are considered. Additionally to single systems methods for system combination are investigated. The best performing model on all tasks is based on conditional random fields. On the MEDIA evaluation corpus a concept error rate of 12.6% could be achieved. Here additionally to attribute names attribute values have been extracted using a combination of a rule-based and a statistical approach. Applying system combination using weighted ROVER with all six systems the concept error rate (CER) drops to 12.0%.;2011
Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have received significant interest in research on spoken dialogue systems due to among many benefits its ability to naturally model the dialogue strategy selection problem under unreliable automated speech recognition. However the POMDP approaches are essentially model-based and as a result the dialogue strategy computed from POMDP is still subject to the correctness of the model. In this paper we extend some of the previous MDP user models to POMDPs and evaluate the effects of user models on the dialogue strategy computed from POMDPs. We experimentally show that the strategies computed from POMDPs perform better than those from MDPs and the strategies computed from poor user models fail severely when tested on different user models. This paper further investigates the evaluation methods for dialogue strategies and proposes a method based on the bias-variance analysis for reliably estimating the dialogue performance.;2011
People in dialog use a rich set of nonverbal behaviors including variations in the prosody of their utterances. Such behaviors often emotion-related call for appropriate responses but today's spoken dialog systems lack the ability to do this. Recent work has shown how to recognize user emotions from prosody and how to express system-side emotions with prosody but demonstrations of how to combine these functions to improve the user experience have been lacking. Working with a corpus of conversations with students about graduate school we analyzed the emotional states of the interlocutors utterance-by-utterance using three dimensions: activation evaluation and power. We found that the emotional coloring of the speaker's utterance could be largely predicted from the emotion shown by her interlocutor in the immediately previous utterance. This finding enabled us to build Gracie the first spoken dialog system that recognizes a user's emotional state from his or her speech and gives a response with appropriate emotional coloring. Evaluation with 36 subjects showed that they felt significantly more rapport with Gracie than with either of two controls. This shows that dialog systems can tap into this important level of interpersonal interaction using today's technology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2011
Pharmacists' clinical interventions have been the subject of a substantial body of literature that focuses on the process and outcomes of establishing an intervention documentation program within the acute care setting. Few reports describe intervention documentation as a component of doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) programs none describe the process of selecting an intervention documentation application to support the complete array of pharmacy practice and experiential sites. The process that a school of pharmacy followed to select and implement a school-wide intervention system to document the clinical and financial impact of an experiential program is described. Goals included finding a tool that allowed documentation from all experiential sites and the ability to assign dollar savings (hard and soft) to all documented interventions. The paper provides guidance for other colleges and schools of pharmacy in selecting a clinical intervention documentation system for program-wide use.;2011
Portable electronic communication devices can be used for many purposes and they are capable of integrating with ubiquitous computing (UC) infrastructures to carry on mobile multimedia communications. As those devices become prevalent they incur potential network security threatening to organizations. Nowadays the Skype is the most popular P2P VoIP application program which is being used by millions of global users to place IP phone calls transfer files or communicate via instant messaging (IM). This phenomenon already generates imminent network security issues that are indispensable to digital forensics researchers or the law enforcement agencies worldwide. Cellular phones smart phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are the representative ones of those devices and there are some open sources or commercial software toolkits that can be utilized to proceed the forensics investigation concerning the electronic crimes in next generation communications (NGCs). A case review was conducted to illustrate the hidden digital trails within the PDA from the Registry of the Windows Mobile and volatile data in the RAM to discover the possible network security leakage scenarios that resulted in the vandalism of intangible digital assets of the organization.

Purpose: Handheld computers have potential to improve HIV/AIDS programs in healthcare settings in low-resource countries by improving the speed and accuracy of collecting data. However the acceptability of the technology (i.e. user attitude and reaction) is critical for its successful implementation. Acceptability is particularly critical for HIV/AIDS behavioral data as it depends on respondents giving accurate information about a highly sensitive topic - sexual behavior. Methods: To explore the acceptability of handheld computers for HIV/AIDS data collection and to identify potential barriers to acceptance five focus groups of 8-10 participants each were conducted in Luanda Angola. Facilitators presented Palm Tungsten E handhelds to the focus groups probed participants' perceptions of the handheld computer and asked how they felt about disclosing intimate sexual behavior to an interviewer using a handheld computer. Discussions were conducted in Portuguese the official language of Angola and audio-taped. They were then transcribed and translated into English for analysis. Results: In total 49 people participated in the focus groups. PDAs were understood through the lens of social and cultural beliefs. Themes that emerged were suspicion of outsiders concern with longevity views on progress and development and concern about social status. Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that personal and cultural beliefs influence participant acceptance of PDAs in Angola. While PDAs provide great advantages in terms of speed and efficiency of data collection these barriers if left unaddressed may lead to biased reporting of HIV/AIDS risk data. An understanding of the barriers and why they are relevant in Angola may help researchers and practitioners to reduce the impact of these barriers on HIV/AIDS data collection.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate if and how an artificially intelligent chat agent (chatbot) that answers questions about sex drugs and alcohol is used and evaluated by adolescents especially in comparison with information lines and search engines. Methods: A sample of 929 adolescents (64% girls mean age = 15) varying in urbanization level and educational level participated in this study. Use of the chatbot was objectively tracked through server registrations (e. g. frequency and duration of conversations with the chatbot the number and topics of queries) and a web-based questionnaire was used to evaluate the chatbot (e. g. the perception of anonymity conciseness ease of use fun quality and quantity of information and speed) and to compare it with information lines and search engines. Results: The chatbot reached high school attendees in general and not only adolescents with previous experience related to sex drugs or alcohol this is promising from an informed decision-making point of view. Frequency (M = 11) and duration of conversations (3:57 minutes) was high and the chatbot was evaluated positively especially in comparison with information lines and search engines. Conclusion: The use of chatbots within the field of health promotion has a large potential to reach a varied group of adolescents and to provide them with answers to their questions related to sex drugs and alcohol.

Purpose: To determine if using personal digital assistants (PDAs) increased accuracy and efficiency of clinical decisions made by novice nurse practitioners (NPs). Design: Experimental with a repeated measures design. Methods: The study sample included 40 novice NPs. Data were collected from December 2003 to March 2004 following a stratified random assignment of the subjects to a textbook or PDA group. Participants identified appropriate laboratory value assessments diagnosis and medication decisions using the assigned resources when given two randomly administered clinical scenarios. Accuracy was determined by the correct response score to each clinical question. The completion of the scenario was timed by the investigator. Length of time necessary to answer each part of the scenario determined efficiency. Data analysis included mixed design repeated measures analysis of variance. Findings: There was a significant interaction and difference in accuracy in the laboratory analysis section of the case scenarios (F(138) = 21.256 p < .001) in the PDA group when compared with the textbook group. There were no differences in accuracy by section. In three of six efficiency variables measured the PDA users were significantly more efficient. Conclusions: In both laboratory values and one of the treatment sections the PDA users were more efficient in determining an answer to the clinical questions. Accuracy of PDA users was equal to textbook users. Clinical Relevance: The findings lend support to benefits for novice practitioners using PDAs when evaluating clinical situations both in accessing certain correct information and doing this in a timely manner.;2011
Purpose: To develop implement and test a novel audience response system (ARS) that allows image based interaction for radiology education. Methods: The ARS developed in this project is based on standard Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) (HP iPAQ 114 classic handheld) running Microsoft (R) Windows Mobile (R) 6 Classic with a large 3.5 in. TFT touch screen (320 x 240 pixel resolution) high luminance and integrated IEEE 802.11b/g wireless. For software development Visual Studio 2008 professional (Microsoft) was used and all components were written in C#. Two test sessions were conducted to test the software technically followed by two real classroom tests in a radiology class for medical students on thoracic radiology. Results: The novel ARS called I2Vote was successfully implemented and provided an easy to use stable setup. The acceptance of both students and teachers was very high and the interaction with the students improved because of the anonymous interaction possibility. Conclusion: An easy to use handheld based ARS that enables interactive image-based teaching is achieved. The system effectively adds an extra dimension to the use of an ARS.

Rationale aims and objectives Understanding how to structure educational interventions and resources to facilitate physical therapists' application of the research literature is required. The objective of this study was to explore physical therapists' preferences for strategies to facilitate their access to evaluation and implementation of the stroke research literature in clinical practice. Methods In-depth qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 23 physical therapists who treat people with stroke in Ontario Canada and who had participated in a previous survey on evidence-based practice. Data were analysed using a constant comparative approach to identify emergent themes. Results Participants preferred online access to research summaries or systematic reviews to save time to filter and critique research articles. To enable access in the workplace an acceptable computer-to-staff ratio permission to access web sites and protected work time were suggested. Participants considered personal digital assistants as excellent tools for quick access to online resources but were unsure of their advantage over a desktop computer. Therapists favoured use of non-technical language glossaries of research terms and quality ratings of studies to ease understanding and appraisal. Teleconferencing or videoconferencing overcame geographical but not scheduling barriers to accessing education. To achieve behaviour change in clinical practice therapists preferred multiple interactive face-to-face education sessions in a group format with opportunities for case-based learning and practice of new skills. Conclusion Physical therapists prefer technology-assisted access to resources and education and favour attending multiple interactive expert-facilitated education sessions incorporating opportunities for case-based learning and practice of new skills to change behaviour related to evidence-based practice.;2011
Recently there has been a rabid development of new technology devices that were proved to have significant effects on education one of which is known as Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). PDAs offer new possibilities for providing better learning experiences and more learning opportunities in the sector of higher education. A quantitative design was utilised to examine university students' attitudes towards the use of PDAs. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to obtain data from participants. The sample was comprised of 250 participants. Gender age and school major were selected as student's demographic variables for the study. The data were analysed by calculating frequencies percentages and by via conducting t-test and One-Way ANOVA. The results of this study revealed that firstly the university students' attitudes towards PDA usage are positive secondly attitudes were significantly different in accordance with students' gender it was found that males' attitude scores are significantly higher than that of the females and thirdly no significant differences were found in students' attitudes towards the PDA in terms of age and school variables. Besides the findings indicated that university students were overall satisfied with their earlier experience of using PDAs for learning purposes.;2011
Routing the act of moving information from a source node to a destination node across any kind of network is one of the major issues in computer network literature. Ad hoc wireless networks are increasing in popularity because of the spread of laptops sensor devices personal digital assistants and other mobile electronic devices. These devices will eventually need to communicate with each other without an adequate infrastructure to rely on. For mobile ad hoc networks the complexity of routing increases because of its characteristics such as dynamic topology absence of centralized authority time varying quality of service (QoS) requirements etc. The biggest challenge in this kind of networks is to find a path between communication end points satisfying user's QoS requirement in spite of frequent path failures because of node mobility. Recent advances in wireless technology and availability of mobile computing devices with networking capabilities have generated a lot of interest in wireless ad hoc networks for QoS-based real-time multimedia applications. In this article we are proposing AMQR an ant-based multiobjective on demand QoS routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc network which will be highly adaptive efficient scalable and mainly reduces end-to-end delay in high mobility cases.;2011
Self-monitoring has traditionally been done using a paper record which can be tedious and burdensome. A personal digital assistant (PDA) with dietary software can provide an alternative to a paper record. The study aimed to describe the differences in dietary changes at 6 months between participants randomly assigned to use a paper record or PDA for self-monitoring in a clinical trial of weight-loss treatment. Self-monitoring adherence and changes in weight and diet were assessed between 2006 and 2009. The sample (n=192) was 84% female and 78% white with a mean age of 49 years and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) of 34.1. At baseline the groups did not differ in energy intake percent calories from fat and number of servings of the examined food groups. At 6 months both groups had significant reductions in weight energy intake and percent calories from total fat and saturated fatty acids (P < 0.001) no between-group differences were found. Compared to the paper record group the PDA group significantly increased consumption of fruit (P=0.02) and vegetables (P=0.04) and decreased consumption of refined grains (P=0.02). Interactions among self-monitoring and the two groups were found in relation to changes in percent calories from total fat (P=0.02) monounsaturated fatty acids (P=0.002) and trans-fatty acids (P=0.04). Frequent self-monitoring was significantly associated with total sugar (P=0.02) and added sugar (P=0.01) intake in both groups. Our findings suggest that use of a PDA for self-monitoring might improve self-awareness of behavior and dietary changes. J Am Diet Assoc. 2011111:583.588.;2011
Self-monitoring is the centerpiece of behavioral weight loss intervention programs This article presents a systematic review of the literature on three components of self-monitoring in behavioral weight loss studies diet exercise and self weighing This review included articles that were published between 1993 and 2009 that reported on the relationship between weight loss and these self-monitoring strategies Of the 22 studies identified 15 focused on dietary self-monitoring one on self-monitoring exercise and six on self weighing A wide array of methods was used to perform self-monitoring the paper diary was used most often Adherence to self-monitoring was reported most frequently as the number of diaries completed or the frequency of log ins or reported weights The use of technology which included the Internet personal digital assistants and electronic digital scales were reported in five studies Descriptive designs were used in the earlier studies whereas more recent reports involved prospective studies and randomized trials that examined the effect of self-monitoring on weight loss A significant association between self-monitoring and weight loss was consistently found however the level of evidence was weak because of methodologic limitations The most significant limitations of the reviewed studies were the homogenous samples and reliance on self-report In all but two studies the samples were predominantly white and women This review highlights the need for studies in more diverse populations for objective measures of adherence to self-monitoring and for studies that establish the required dose of self-monitoring for successful outcomes J Am Diet Assoc 2011111 92 102;2011
Sentence and short-text semantic similarity measures are becoming an important part of many natural language processing tasks such as text summarization and conversational agents. This paper presents SyMSS a new method for computing short-text and sentence semantic similarity. The method is based on the notion that the meaning of a sentence is made up of not only the meanings of its individual words but also the structural way the words are combined. Thus SyMSS captures and combines syntactic and semantic information to compute the semantic similarity of two sentences. Semantic information is obtained from a lexical database. Syntactic information is obtained through a deep parsing process that finds the phrases in each sentence. Wills this information the proposed method measures the semantic similarity between concepts that play the same syntactic role. Psychological plausibility is added to the method by using previous findings about how humans weight different syntactic roles when computing semantic similarity. The results show that SyMSS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of rank correlation with human intuition thus proving the importance of syntactic information in sentence semantic similarity computation.

Smartphones are a new technology similar to PDAs but with expanded functions and greater Internet access. This article explores the potential uses and issues surrounding the use of smartphones in nursing education. While the functions of smartphones such as sending text messages viewing videos and access to the Internet may seem purely recreational they can be used within the nursing curriculum to engage students and reinforce learning at any time or location. Smartphones can be used for quick access to educational materials and guidelines during clinical class or clinical conference. Students can review instructional videos prior to performing skills and readily reach their clinical instructor via text message. Downloadable applications subscriptions and reference materials expand the smartphone functions even further. Common concerns about requiring smartphones in nursing education include cost disease transmission and equipment interference however there are many ways to overcome these barriers and provide students with constant access to current clinical evidence.;2011
Spoken dialog systems have been a holy grail of computer science since Turing devised his test for intelligence and an icon of science fiction from well before that. Although there are machines you can talk to - interactive voice response (IVR) systems which answer phones voice command systems in cars and the Furby toy come to mind - holding a conversation with a machine spoken or typed is still highly problematic. It seems there is something fundamental we don't understand about the way humans use language. One popular approach is to ignore our ignorance and assume that machines can figure it out for themselves using machine learning or some form of statistical modeling of a corpus of text. Corpus analysis however like archeology attempts to understand human action by looking at what we leave behind. Instead we take a software agents approach and model the language production process. The SERA project is our latest effort looking at what other disciplines can tell us about language use in context. We find that naturally published work focuses on the interesting while the engineering challenge is to capture the essential but often mundane. This paper proposes a narrative approach based on Vygotsky's view of psychology that captures the big picture. The paper finishes with an outline for a tool that merges the functionality of more conventional annotation tools with that of existing scripting environments for conversational agents.;2011
Technology may improve self-monitoring adherence and dietary changes in weight loss treatment. Our study aimed to investigate whether using a personal digital assistant (PDA) with dietary and exercise software with and without a feedback message compared to using a paper diary/record (PR) results in greater weight loss and improved self-monitoring adherence. Healthy adults (N = 210) with a mean BMI of 34.01 kg/m(2) were randomized to one of three self-monitoring approaches: PR (n = 72) PDA with self-monitoring software (n = 68) or PDA with self-monitoring software and daily feedback messages (PDA+FB n = 70). All participants received standard behavioral treatment. Self-monitoring adherence and change in body weight waist circumference and diet were assessed at 6 months retention was 91%. All participants had a significant weight loss (P < 0.01) but weight loss did not differ among groups. A higher proportion of PDA+FB participants (63%) achieved >= 5% weight loss in comparison to the PR group (46%) (P < 0.05) and PDA group (49%) (P = 0.09). Median percent self-monitoring adherence over the 6 months was higher in the PDA groups (PDA 80% PDA+FB 90%) than in the PR group (55%) (P < 0.01). Waist circumference decreased more in the PDA groups than the PR group (P = 0.02). Similarly the PDA groups reduced energy and saturated fat intake more than the PR group (P < 0.05). Self-monitoring adherence was greater in the PDA groups with the greatest weight change observed in the PDA+FB group.;2011
The automatic recognition of user's communicative style within a spoken dialog system framework including the affective aspects has received increased attention in the past few years. For dialog systems it is important to know not only what was said but also how something was communicated so that the system can engage the user in a richer and more natural interaction. This paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting frustration politeness and neutral attitudes from a child's speech communication cues elicited in spontaneous dialog interactions with computer characters. Several information sources such as acoustic lexical and contextual features as well as their combinations are used for this purpose. The study is based on a Wizard-of-Oz dialog corpus of 103 children 7-14 years of age playing a voice activated computer game. Three-way classification experiments as well as pairwise classification between polite vs. others and frustrated vs. others were performed. Experimental results show that lexical information has more discriminative power than acoustic and contextual cues for detection of politeness whereas context and acoustic features perform best for frustration detection. Furthermore the fusion of acoustic lexical and contextual information provided significantly better classification results. Results also showed that classification performance varies with age and gender. Specifically for the politeness detection task higher classification accuracy was achieved for females and 10-11 years-olds compared to males and other age groups respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The cue-reactivity paradigm has been used extensively in laboratory settings to study cue-specific craving responses to drug-related cues. However this procedure has been used in only one study to assess craving in the drug user's natural environment (Warthen & Tiffany 2009). The present study combined cue-reactivity with ecological momentary assessment (CREMA) to evaluate smokers' cue reactions in natural environments as a further validation and extension of this procedure. A total of 66 daily cigarette smokers carried a personal digital assistant (PDA) and had the opportunity to respond to 32 cue-reactivity sessions across 8 days. Cues were presented through in vivo and photographic modes. During in vivo sessions participants handled and looked at a cigarette or neutral object while during photographic sessions participants looked at a smoking-related or neutral photograph on the PDA. Craving and mood were assessed before and after cue presentations. Cues were also presented in the laboratory both before (Lab 0 and after (Lab II) the 8-day CREMA procedure. Participants completed over 90% of cue-reactivity sessions delivered with the CREMA procedure. Analyses revealed robust cue-reactivity in the natural environment and laboratory across both modes of presentation. Photographic cues elicited significantly stronger cue-reactivity effects than in vivo cues across all sessions. The CREMA procedure has been shown to elicit robust cue-reactivity effects across multiple modes of cue presentation. Results support the use of the CREMA procedure for examining cue-specific craving in the natural environment of smokers.;2011
The development of embodied conversational agents (ECA) as companions brings several challenges for both affective and conversational dialogue. These include challenges in generating appropriate affective responses selecting the overall shape of the dialogue providing prompt system response times and handling interruptions. We present an implementation of such a companion showing the development of individual modules that attempt to address these challenges. Further to resolve resulting conflicts we present encompassing interaction strategies that attempt to balance the competing requirements along with dialogues from our working prototype to illustrate these interaction strategies in operation. Finally we provide the results of an evaluation of the companion using an evaluation methodology created for conversational dialogue and including analysis using appropriateness annotation.;2011
The IEEE 802.15.6 standard is a communication standard optimized for low-power and short-range in-body/on-body nodes to serve a variety of medical consumer electronics and entertainment applications. Providing high mobility with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) to a WBAN user in heterogeneous wireless networks is a challenging task. A WBAN uses a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to gather data from body sensors and forwards it to a remote server through wide range wireless networks. In this paper we present a coexistence study of WBAN with Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) and Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWANs). The main issue is interworking of WBAN in heterogenous wireless networks including seamless handover QoS emergency services cooperation and security. We propose a Seamless Interworking Architecture (SIA) for WBAN in heterogenous wireless networks based on a cost function. The cost function is based on power consumption and data throughput costs. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms typical approaches in terms of throughput delay and packet loss rate.;2011
The Internet is making a significant transition from primarily a network of desktop computers to a network variety of connected information devices such as personal digital assistants and global positioning system-based devices. On the other hand new paradigms such as overlay networks are defining service-based logical architecture for the network services that make locating content and routing more efficient. Along with Internet2's proposed service-based routing overlay networks will create a new set of challenges in the provision and management of content over the network. However a lack of proper infrastructure investment incentive may lead to an environment where network growth may not keep pace with the service requirements. In this paper we present an analysis of investment incentives for network infrastructure owners under two different pricing strategies: congestion-based negative externality pricing and the prevalent flat-rate pricing. We develop a theoretically motivated gradient-based heuristic to compute maximum capacity that a network provider will be willing to invest in under different pricing schemes. The heuristic appropriates different capacities to different network components based on demand for these components. We then use a simulation model to compare the impact of dynamic congestion-based pricing with flat-rate pricing on the choice of capacity level by the infrastructure provider. The simulation model implements the heuristic and ensures that near-optimal level of capacity is allocated to each network component by checking theoretical optimality conditions. We investigate the impact of a variety of factors including the per unit cost of capacity of a network resource average value of the users' requests average level of users' tolerance for delay and the level of exogenous demand for services on the network. Our results indicate that relationships between these factors are crucial in determining which of the two pricing schemes results in a higher level of socially optimal network capacity. The simulation results provide a possible explanation for the evolution of the Internet pricing from time-based to flat-rate pricing. The results also indicate that regardless of how these factors are related the average stream of the net benefits realized under congestion-based pricing tends to be higher than the average net benefits realized under flat-rate pricing. These central results point to the fallacy of the arguments presented by the supporters of net neutrality that do not consider the incentives for private investment in network capacity.;2011
The literature on social agents has put forward a number of requirements that social agents need to fulfill. In this paper we analyze the kinds of reasons and motivations that lie behind the statement of these requirements. In a second part of the paper we look at how one can go about engineering the social agents. We introduce a general language in which to express dialogue rules and some tools that support the development of dialogue systems.;2011
The mobile-enterprise concept has emerged as an innovation with the increasing use of personal digital assistant (PDA) on wireless data networks. To realize the concept simply use the PDA to search for information is not enough where an intelligent paradigm is required to deal with the request for information as well as the command execution in a distributed information system. This paper proposes a mobile-enterprise multi-agent paradigm (MMAP) which is an agent-based intelligent solution provider developed for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to increase their flexibility and competitiveness in the market. The system is driven by intelligent software agents. Their design and prototype implementation are demonstrated in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011
The objective of this pilot study was to identify if notebook accessories (ergonomic chair desktop monitor and notebook riser) combined with a wireless keyboard mouse and participatory ergonomics training would have the greatest impact on reducing self-reported upper extremity musculoskeletal discomfort in university students. In addition to pre-post computing and health surveys the Ecological Momentary Assessment was used to capture change in discomfort over time using a personal digital assistant (PDA) as the e-diary. The PDA was programmed with a survey containing 45 questions. Four groups of university students were randomised to either intervention (three external computer accessories) or to control. Participants reported less discomfort with the ergonomic chair and notebook riser based on the pre-post survey data and the e-diary/PDA ANOVA analysis. However the PDA data adjusted for the effect of hours per day of computer use showed no benefit of the chair and limited benefit from the riser. Statement of Relevance: University students' use of notebook computers has increased. This study found evidence of a positive effect of an adjustable chair or notebook riser when combined with ergonomic training on reducing discomfort. Daily notebook computer use of 4 h was confirmed as a risk factor. Without some form of ergonomic intervention these students are likely to enter the workforce with poor computing habits which places them on the road to future injuries as technology continues to play a dominant role in their lives.;2011
The present paper describes the design of two stimulators (bench-top and portable) which can be used for animal studies in cochlear implants. The bench-top stimulator is controlled by a high-speed digital output board manufactured by National Instruments and is electrically isolated. The portable stimulator is controlled by a personal digital assistant (PDA) and is based on a custom interface board that communicates with the signal processor in the PDA through the secure digital IO (SDIO) slot. Both stimulators can provide 8 charge-balanced bipolar channels of pulsatile and analog-like electrical stimulation delivered simultaneously interleaved or using a combination of both modes. Flexibility is provided into the construction of arbitrary but charge-balanced pulse shapes which can be either symmetric or asymmetric. Published by Elsevier Ltd.;2011
The present study evaluated whether the strength of relationship between contextual cues (presence of company and mood) and state body dissatisfaction varied as a function of individual differences in key trait measures (body shame body surveillance tendencies internalization of appearance standards and trait affect) which have been linked to trait body dissatisfaction. Fifty-five undergraduate women completed a questionnaire containing the trait-based measures and then carried a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) for a 7-day period. The PDA prompted participants six times daily to self-report their current mood and state body dissatisfaction. Multi-level modeling revealed that individual differences in body shame predicted inter-individual variability in the strength of the relationships between presence of company and state body dissatisfaction and positive mood and state body dissatisfaction. Trait positive affect also explained variance in the positive mood state-body dissatisfaction relationship. The implications of the findings for prevention of body image disturbances are discussed.

The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of implementing a life course perspective model that includes a reproductive life plan to improve health outcomes especially in populations at risk for adverse outcomes. A reproductive life plan is a comprehensive strategy that can be incorporated into nursing practice at all levels to improve birth outcomes. Health care providers especially nurses should incorporate reproductive life planning into their daily encounters with patients.;2011
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of a Personal Digital Assistant with multiple prompt levels to increase completion of novel task boxes and transitioning within and between tasks. The study used a multiple probe design across three sets of task boxes replicated with three students with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Results indicated that: task completion was higher for two of the students compared to baseline conditions using a picture-based task strip all students were able to complete a greater number of between task transitions using the PDA students performed within task transitions equally as well using the PDA and the task strip and one student began to self-fade use of more intrusive prompt levels.;2011
The purpose of this study was to evaluate use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) with picture auditory and video prompts as a portable self-prompting device to facilitate independent pedestrian travel by three high school age students with moderate intellectual disabilities. Using a multiple probe design across three destinations and their respective landmarks the self-prompting device was evaluated for its effectiveness in increasing independent travel across multiple destinations. Results indicate that students were able to independently use the PDA to self-prompt pedestrian travel (walking) without the need for external adult prompting to maintain use of the device over time and to self-adjust the level of prompt used across the different pedestrian routes.;2011
The rapid diffusion of communication technology has provided opportunities to enhance the delivery of mental health care. We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct a qualitative review of randomized controlled trials that reported on the efficacy of mobile phones or handheld computers used to enhance the treatment of psychiatric disorders. We identified eight randomized controlled trials. Five studies used mobile phones to target smoking cessation. Those receiving the smoking cessation intervention were significantly more likely to achieve abstinence compared with those under the control condition. Three studies used non-personal digital assistant (PDA) handheld computers targeting anxiety. Compared with those in the control condition those who received the non-PDA handheld computer intervention had significant improvement in anxiety outcomes in only one of the three studies. The limited number of rigorous evaluations of mobile phone PDA or smartphone interventions for mental health problems underscores the opportunities to enhance our interventions using the available tools of contemporary technology.;2011
The screen interface has been believed to be the major barrier for the adoption of PDAs in healthcare. The study objectives were to design a set of screen interface design principles for complex documentation using PDAs and to examine nurses' perception of the ease of use and usefulness of the application. A 21-page Chinese version of the interRAI MDS-HC home-care assessment tool composed of more than 250 assessment questions was used for the application. A WiFi Palm-based PDA was used. A convenience sample of 60 subjects primarily nurses newly trained to use the MDS-HC assessment tool were invited to evaluate the PDA system in terms of Davis' Technology Acceptance Model. The final information structure of the PDA application consisted of 18 categories composed of 262 questions over 63 screens. Subjects could move to any assessment question in less than two taps without a memory burden and finish the question in one tap. Respectively close to 95% and 93% of the subjects agreed that overall the system was easy to use and useful for their work. We conclude the screen interface challenge for complex documentation using PDAs can be improved and managed to achieve to a very high usability.;2011
The use of handheld computers in educational contexts has increased considerably in recent years and their value as a teaching tool has been confirmed by many positive experiences particular within collaborative learning systems (Mobile Computer Supported Collaborative Learning [MCSCL]). The cost of the devices has hindered widespread use in schools however and cell phones have emerged as an attractive alternative. To test their functionality as a platform for collaborative educational activities the authors adapted an existing Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) application for use on cell phones equipped with Wi-Fi. This article examines the problems of developing applications for this alternative technology and reports on a usability analysis of a collaborative classroom activity for teaching physics. The results confirm the viability of the cell phone platform taking due account of the device's processing network and interface limitations. With an appropriate design users quickly master the technology though a certain decline in efficiency relative to PDAs is observed.;2011
There has been a great interest in publish/subscribe systems in recent years. This interest coupled with the pervasiveness of light-weight electronic devices such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants has opened a new arena in publish/subscribe networks. Currently many broker overlay networks are static and rarely change in structure. Often a network overlay structure is predefined or manually modified. This paper presents a dynamic broker network for disseminating critical lab and patient information in a Healthcare information system. The reported work builds upon previous network optimization research on ad hoc publish/subscribe networks. The underlying framework utilizes user-defined cost functions to satisfy quality of service constraints. In essence the broker network optimization problem is reduced to an incremental search problem to generate low cost network configurations. Certain reliability issues are also addressed by providing a scheduling algorithm to selectively retransmit information and handle broker connectivity failures.;2011
This article analyzes paradata or data on survey processes from the 2008 Albany Youth Health Survey to examine the ''usability'' of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in collecting health and behavioral information among inner-city adolescents. Two parallel sets of data analysis were conducted: one at a subject level and a second at a survey question/item level. Outcomes related to usability issues included difficulty with practice questions time spent on the survey/item responding before completion of the audio and revisiting a question. Overall participants had relatively few usability issues with the PDAs. At the subject level participants with lower academic performance were more likely to have difficulty with practice questions revisit a question and take more time. The variable-level analysis showed that an increasing level of variable type complexity was negatively associated with a question being revisited and positively associated with completion time. This study suggests that PDAs and other types of handheld computers can be used to collect sensitive data among urban adolescents. Increased practice time to orient certain respondents on certain types of questions on PDA-administered surveys may increase the ability to collect valid and reliable data on sensitive topics.;2011
This article describes how a school of nursing implemented an innovative program to introduce personal digital assistants to undergraduate and graduate nursing students. Undergraduate students studying pharmacology and nurse practitioner graduate students in an adult health course were asked to purchase a personal digital assistant privately or through the university bookstore. Faculty selected an appropriate software package. After students were oriented to the hardware and software package innovative teaching strategies were implemented to help guide students to use their mobile devices to access clinically relevant information. Student feedback about this experience was positive. The most important elements for successful adoption of personal digital assistants are to provide training for both faculty and students and to develop learning opportunities using the technology. Use of mobile technologies is an important competency that will improve the quality of nursing practice and therefore should be included in nursing curricula.;2011
This article presents recommendations for the design of conceptual models for applications via handheld devices such as personal digital assistants and some mobile phones. The recommendations were developed over a number of years through experience that involves design of conceptual models and applications of these multimedia representations with students in schools and higher education. Three sets of design recommendations are discussed: design presentation of conceptual models small screen design and design in relation to specific learning uses. These recommendations should prove useful to designers of multimedia resources and professionals engaged in instructional uses of these representations. The article calls for researchers to pay more attention to the design of conceptual models and other forms of multimedia resources and their instructional uses.;2011
This is an unusual moment in the history of psychology because of landmark advances in digital information technologies computational linguistics and other fields that use the computer to analyze language discourse and behavior. The technologies developed from this interdisciplinary fusion are helping students learn and think in ways that are sensitive to their cognitive and emotional states. Recent projects have developed computer technologies that help us understand the nature of conversational discourse and text comprehension in addition to improving learning. AutoTutor and other systems with conversational agents (i.e. talking heads) help students learn by holding conversations in natural language. One version of AutoTutor is sensitive to the emotions of students in addition to their cognitive states. Coh-Metrix analyzes texts on multiple levels of language and discourse such as text genre cohesion syntax and word characteristics. Coh-Metrix can assist students teachers principals and policymakers when they make decisions on the right text to assign to the right student at the right time. Computers are not perfect conversation partners and comprehenders of text but the current systems are undeniably useful.;2011
This paper argues that some traditional fallacies should be considered as reasonable arguments when used as part of a properly conducted dialog. It is shown that argumentation schemes formal dialog models and profiles of dialog are useful tools for studying properties of defeasible reasoning and fallacies. It is explained how defeasible reasoning of the most common sort can deteriorate into fallacious argumentation in some instances. Conditions are formulated that can be used as normative tools to judge whether a given defeasible argument is fallacious or not. It is shown that three leading violations of proper dialog standards for defeasible reasoning necessary to see how fallacies work are: (a) improper failure to retract a commitment (b) failure of openness to defeat and (c) illicit reversal of burden of proof.;2011
This paper argues that the problems of dialogue management (DM) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) in dialogue systems are closely related and can be fruitfully treated statistically in a joint optimisation framework such as that provided by Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first review recent results and methods in automatic learning of dialogue management strategies for spoken and multimodal dialogue systems and then show how these techniques can also be used for the related problem of Natural Language Generation. This approach promises a number of theoretical and practical benefits such as fine-grained adaptation generalisation and automatic (global) optimisation and we compare it to related work in statistical/trainable NLG. A demonstration of the proposed approach is then developed showing combined DM and NLG policy learning for adaptive information presentation decisions. A joint DM and NLG policy learned in the framework shows a statistically significant 27% relative increase in reward over a baseline policy which is learned in the same way only without the joint optimisation. We thereby show that that NLG problems can be approached statistically in combination with dialogue management decisions and we show how to jointly optimise NLG and DM using Reinforcement Learning.

This paper builds a dialectical system of explanation with speech act rules that define the kinds of moves allowed like requesting and offering an explanation. Pre and post-condition rules for the speech acts determine when a particular speech act can be put forward as a move in the dialogue and what type of move or moves must follow it. A successful explanation has been achieved when there has been a transfer of understanding from the party giving the explanation to the party asking for it. The dialogue has an opening stage an explanation stage and a closing stage. Whether a transfer of understanding has taken place is tested by a dialectical shift to an examination dialogue.;2011
This paper describes an initial prototype of the Companions project (www.companions-project.org): the Senior Companion (SC) designed to be a platform to display novel approaches to: (1) The use of Information Extraction (IE) techniques to extract the content of incoming dialogue utterances after an ASR phase. (2) The conversion of the input to RDF form to allow the generation of new facts from existing ones under the control of a Dialogue Manager (DM) that also has access to stored knowledge and knowledge accessed in real time from the web all in RDF form. (3) A DM expressed as a stack and network virtual machine that models mixed initiative in dialogue control. (4) A tuned dialogue act detector based on corpus evidence. The prototype platform was evaluated and we describe this it is also designed to support more extensive forms of emotion detection carried by both speech and lexical content as well as extended forms of machine learning. We describe preliminary studies and results for these in particular a novel approach to enabling reinforcement learning for open dialogue systems through the detection of emotion in the speech signal and its deployment as a form of a learned DM at a higher level than the DM virtual machine and able to direct the SC's responses to a more emotionally appropriate part of its repertoire.

This paper outlines a research project conducted at Leeds University School of Medicine with Assessment & Learning in Practice Settings Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning collaboration between the Universities of Leeds Huddersfield Bradford Leeds Metropolitan University and the University of York St John. The research conducted is a proof of concept examining the impact of delivering competency based assessment via personal digital assistants (PDAs) amongst a group of final year undergraduate medical students. This evaluation reports the student experience of mobile technology for assessment with positive effects concluding that overall the students found completing assessments using a PDA straight forward and that the structured format of the assessment resulted in an increased improved level of feedback allowing students to improve their skills during the placement. A relationship between using the PDA for learning and setting goals for achievement was clearly demonstrated.;2011
This paper presents an intelligence model for conversational service robots. It employs modules called experts each of which is specialized to execute certain kinds of tasks such as performing physical behaviors and engaging in dialogues. Some of the experts take charge in understanding human utterances and deciding robot utterances or actions. The model enables switching and canceling tasks based on recognized human intentions as well as parallel execution of several tasks. This model specifies the interface that an expert must have and any kind of expert can be employed if it conforms to the interface. This feature makes the model extensible. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a novel user intention simulation method which is data-driven but can integrate diverse user discourse knowledge to simulate various types of user behaviors. A method of data-driven user intention modeling based on logistic regression is introduced in the Markov logic framework. Human dialog knowledge is designed into two layers domain and discourse knowledge and integrated with the data-driven model in generation time. Three types of user knowledge i.e. cooperative corrective and self-directing are designed and integrated to generate behaviors of corresponding user-types. In experiments to investigate the patterns of simulated users the approach successfully generated cooperative corrective and self-directing user intention patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a technique to enhance emotion detection in spoken dialogue systems by means of two modules that combine different information sources. The first one called Fusion-0 combines emotion predictions generated by a set of classifiers that deal with different kinds of information about each sentence uttered by the user. To do this the module employs several methods for information fusion that produce other predictions about the emotional state of the user. The predictions are the input to the second information fusion module called Fusion-1 where they are combined to deduce the emotional state of the user. Fusion-0 represents a method employed in previous studies to enhance classification rates whereas Fusion-1 represents the novelty of the technique which is the combination of emotion predictions generated by Fusion-0. One advantage of the technique is that it can be applied as a posterior processing stage to any other methods that combine information from different information sources at the decision level. This is so because the technique works on the predictions (outputs) of the methods without interfering in the procedure used to obtain these predictions. Another advantage is that the technique can be implemented as a modular architecture which facilitates the setting up within a spoken dialogue system as well as the deduction of the emotional state of the user in real time. Experiments have been carried out considering classifiers to deal with prosodic acoustic lexical and dialogue acts information and three methods to combine information: multiplication of probabilities average of probabilities and unweighted vote. The results show that the technique enhances the classification rates of the standard fusion by 2.27% and 3.38% absolute in experiments carried out considering two and three emotion categories respectively.

This research which aims to find out the factors that motivate students with hearing impairment to use PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) a product of mobile technology in instructional activities interactions with their peers and instructors and in their daily lives and the factors that hinder these individuals from using PDA was designed as an action research. The research was conducted with 12 students with hearing impairment taking BIL151Fundamentals of Information Technology-I course in School for the Handicapped Department of Applied Fine Arts at Anadolu University. The participants used the HP IPAO hw6915 modeled PDAs for education and social interaction purposes in the activities carried out in the scope of the research for 16 weeks. For data collection reflections gathered with questionnaire and critic event method were employed. The quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics while the qualitative data obtained from one sample t-test were analyzed with content analysis done in an inductive approach. The research was supported by TUBITAK The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (Project Number: 107K022). This article presents the findings of the project that show the situations that motivate and hinder students with hearing impairment to use PDA.;2011
This study designed a chatbot system Confucius as a MSN virtual learning companion to examine how specific application design variables within educational software affect the learning process of subjects as defined by the cognitive continuum of field-dependent and field-independent learners. 104 college students participated in a 12 week Microsoft certification course that used Confucius as an adjunct to classroom instruction. The study considered to what extent the two distinct learning modes offered by Confucius would affect the learning gains of two distinct cognitive styles. Each of the two learning modes available within the Confucius was designed to conform to the specific requirements of field-independent or field-dependent learners. The results of this study reveal that a discussion mode offers far greater benefit to field-dependent learners than to those whose cognitive style is field-independent. Conversely a lecture mode is substantially more beneficial to field-independent learners than to field-dependent learners.;2011
This study investigated whether the modality effect of content presentation modes on students' cognitive load and listening comprehension depends on the moderating effect of the learners' language proficiencies in a mobile learning context. One hundred and sixty-two students majoring in English in a technology university used personal digital assistants (PDAs) as the learning tool for a mobile listening comprehension activity. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two presentation modes: (1) a single mode in which students were engaged in auditory materials only and (2) a dual mode in which they were exposed to audio and textual inputs simultaneously. Hierarchical regression was employed to examine the moderating effect of the learners' proficiencies. The results confirmed the moderator role of English proficiency on cognitive load: students with lower proficiency appeared to be more perceptive of the text aid. However the moderating effect was not obtained on the task performance in that students provided with the dual mode outperformed their single mode counterpart across the proficiency level. This study recommends that written text be displayed when students are engaged in a mobile English listening comprehension task to reduce learners' cognitive load. The study also provides pedagogical implications for mobile language learning.;2011
Today many people in the world without any (or with little) knowledge about video recording thanks to the widespread use of mobile devices (personal digital assistants mobile phones etc.) take videos. However the unwanted movements of their hands typically blur and introduce disturbing jerkiness in the recorded sequences. Many video stabilization techniques have been hence developed with different performances but only fast strategies can be implemented on embedded devices. A fundamental issue is the overall robustness with respect to different scene contents (indoor outdoor etc.) and conditions (illumination changes moving objects etc.). In this paper we propose a fast and robust image alignment algorithm for video stabilization purposes. Our contribution is twofold: a fast and accurate block-based local motion estimator together with a robust alignment algorithm based on voting. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both local and global motion estimators.;2011
Tutorial Dialog Systems that employ Conversational Agents (CAs) to deliver instructional content to learners in one-on-one tutoring settings have been shown to be effective in multiple learning domains by multiple research groups. Our work focuses on extending this successful learning technology to collaborative learning settings involving two or more learners interacting with one or more agents. Experience from extending existing techniques for developing conversational agents into multiple-learner settings highlights two underlying assumptions from the one-learner setting that do not generalize well to the multiuser setting and thus cause difficulties. These assumptions include what we refer to as the near-even participation assumption and the known addressee assumption. A new software architecture called Basilica that allows us to address and overcome these limitations is a major contribution of this article. The Basilica architecture adopts an object-oriented approach to represent agents as a network composed of what we refer to as behavioral components because they enable the agents to engage in rich conversational behaviors. Additionally we describe three specific conversational agents built using Basilica in order to illustrate the desirable properties of this new architecture.;2011
Up to 29% of patients with epilepsy report prodromal sensations more than 30 minutes prior to seizures. We developed and implemented an objective methodology to prospectively assess the sensitivity and specificity of these subjective experiences using personal digital assistants (PDAs). The key property in contrast to paper-based diaries is the internal recording of the patient's entering time of prodromes and seizures. Of 500 patients with epilepsy interviewed 31 claimed to sense prodromal symptoms at least 30 minutes before seizure onset. Eleven of them agreed to participate in a 4-week study to objectively measure their prospective prediction performance. In 9 patients returning data the majority of prodrome entries were not followed by seizures or were identified only retrospectively. Statistical analysis revealed that no patient could outperform a nonspecific random predictor when predicting seizures based on the occurrence of prodromes and that the group performance matched precisely the expected result for a by-chance prediction. These results question the predictive value of prodromes and the specificity of their occurrence in the preictal period. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.;2011
We address the problem of inferring a speaker's level of certainty based on prosodic information in the speech signal which has application in speech-based dialogue systems. We show that using phrase-level prosodic features centered around the phrases causing uncertainty in addition to utterance-level prosodic features improves our model's level of certainty classification. In addition our models can be used to predict which phrase a person is uncertain about. These results rely on a novel method for eliciting utterances of varying levels of certainty that allows us to compare the utility of contextually-based feature sets. We elicit level of certainty ratings from both the speakers themselves and a panel of listeners finding that there is often a mismatch between speakers' internal states and their perceived states and highlighting the importance of this distinction.;2011
We describe the design and evaluation of two different dynamic student uncertainty adaptations in wizarded versions of a spoken dialogue tutoring system. The two adaptive systems adapt to each student turn based on its uncertainty after an unseen human wizard performs speech recognition and natural language understanding and annotates the turn for uncertainty. The design of our two uncertainty adaptations is based on a hypothesis in the literature that uncertainty is an opportunity to learn both adaptations use additional substantive content to respond to uncertain turns but the two adaptations vary in the complexity of these responses. The evaluation of our two uncertainty adaptations represents one of the first controlled experiments to investigate whether substantive dynamic responses to student affect can significantly improve performance in computer tutors. To our knowledge we are the first study to show that dynamically responding to uncertainty can significantly improve learning during computer tutoring. We also highlight our ongoing evaluation of our uncertainty-adaptive systems with respect to other important performance metrics and we discuss how our corpus can be used by the wider computer speech and language community as a linguistic resource supporting further research on effective affect-adaptive spoken dialogue systems in general.

We evaluate the performance of a spoken dialogue system that provides substantive dynamic responses to automatically detected user affective states. We then present a detailed system error analysis that reveals challenges for real-time affect detection and adaptation. This research is situated in the tutoring domain where the user is a student and the spoken dialogue system is a tutor. Our adaptive system detects uncertainty in each student turn via a model that combines a machine learning approach with hedging phrase heuristics the learned model uses acoustic-prosodic and lexical features extracted from the speech signal as well as dialogue features. The adaptive system varies its content based on the automatic uncertainty and correctness labels for each turn. Our controlled experimental evaluation shows that the adaptive system yields higher global performance than two non-adaptive control systems but the difference is only significant for a subset of students. Our system error analysis indicates that noisy affect labeling is a major performance bottleneck yielding fewer than expected adaptations thus lower than expected performance. However the percentage of received adaptation correlates with higher performance over all students. Moreover when uncertainty is accurately recognized and adapted to local performance is significantly improved. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2011
We have created an automated kiosk that uses embodied intelligent agents to interview individuals and detect changes in arousal behavior and cognitive effort by using psychophysiological information systems. In this paper we describe the system and propose a unique class of intelligent agents which are described as Special Purpose Embodied Conversational Intelligence with Environmental Sensors (SPECIES). SPECIES agents use heterogeneous sensors to detect human physiology and behavior during interactions and they affect their environment by influencing human behavior using various embodied states (i.e. gender and demeanor) messages and recommendations. Based on the SPECIES paradigm we present three studies that evaluate different portions of the model and these studies are used as foundational research for the development of the automated kiosk. The first study evaluates human computer interaction and how SPECIES agents can change perceptions of information systems by varying appearance and demeanor. Instantiations that had the agents embodied as males were perceived as more powerful while female embodied agents were perceived as more likable. Similarly smiling agents were perceived as more likable than neutral demeanor agents. The second study demonstrated that a single sensor measuring vocal pitch provides SPECIES with environmental awareness of human stress and deception. The final study ties the first two studies together and demonstrates an avatar-based kiosk that asks questions and measures the responses using vocalic measurements.;2011
We investigated in two picture-word-interference experiments whether there is evidence for composition during compound production (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2 we tried to determine the level at which composition takes place. In Experiment 1 shared morphemes between distractor and target (HANDTASCHE handbag) sped up naming regardless of category membership: semantically opaque (Plaudertasche chatterbox) and semantically transparent distractors (Reisetasche travelling bag) facilitated picture naming to a comparable degree. In Experiment 2 targets (BROTMESSER bread knife) were combined with a simple word distractor (Kuchen cake) categorically related to a target compound constituent but not related to the compound as a whole. This target was further paired with a categorically related compound distractor (Kochloffel wooden spoon). The simple word distractor was also paired with a categorically related compound constituent (BROT bread). Whenever distractor (e. g. Kochloffel Kuchen) and target (BROTMESSER BROT respectively) were categorically related semantic inhibition was observed. Distractors (e. g. Kuchen) related to only one compound constituent did not affect compound production. Taken together our results indicate that during compound production a single lemma node is activated and that morphological composition takes place at the form level of representation. Current lexical selection mechanisms in language production models are not supported by these data.;2011
When developing human computer conversational systems the complex co-acting processes of human human dialogue present a significant challenge. Para-linguistic features establish rapport between individuals and direct the conversation in directions that cannot be captured by semantic analysis alone. This paper attempts to address part of this challenge by considering the role of para-linguistic features in establishing and manipulating social dominance. We propose that social dominance can be understood as an interaction affordance revealing action potentials for each signalling participant and can be detected as a feature of rapport not of the individual. An analysis of F0 and long-term averaged spectra (LTAS) correlation values for conversational pairs reveals a high degree of accommodation. The nature of this accommodation demonstrates that others will adjust their speech to match the current dominant individual. We conclude by exploring the implications of these results on the role of rapport and outline potential advances for the detection of emotion in speech by encompassing the entirety of pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional space.

While different user simulations are built to assist dialog system development there is an increasing need to quickly assess the quality of the user simulations reliably. Previous studies have proposed several automatic evaluation measures for this purpose. However the validity of these evaluation measures has not been fully proven. We present an assessment study in which human judgments are collected on user simulation qualities as the gold standard to validate automatic evaluation measures. We show that a ranking model can be built using the automatic measures to predict the rankings of the simulations in the same order as the human judgments. We further show that the ranking model can be improved by using a simple feature that utilizes time-series analysis.;2011
While mobile phones have found broad application in bringing health financial and other services to the developing world usability remains a major hurdle for novice and low-literacy populations. In this article we take two steps to evaluate and improve the usability of mobile interfaces for such users. First we offer an ethnographic study of the usability barriers facing 90 low-literacy subjects in India Kenya the Philippines and South Africa. Then via two studies involving over 70 subjects in India we quantitatively compare the usability of different points in the mobile design space. In addition to text interfaces such as electronic forms SMS and USSD we consider three text-free interfaces: a spoken dialog system a graphical interface and a live operator. Our results confirm that textual interfaces are unusable by first-time low-literacy users and error prone for literate but novice users. In the context of healthcare we find that a live operator is up to ten times more accurate than text-based interfaces and can also be cost effective in countries such as India. In the context of mobile banking we find that task completion is highest with a graphical interface but those who understand the spoken dialog system can use it more quickly due to their comfort and familiarity with speech. We synthesize our findings into a set of design recommendations.;2011
A conventional Nursing Information System (NIS) which supports the role of nurse in some areas is typically deployed as an immobile system. However the traditional information system can't response to patients' conditions in real-time causing delays on the availability of this information. With the advances of information technology mobile devices are increasingly being used to extend the human mind's limited capacity to recall and process large numbers of relevant variables and to support information management general administration and clinical practice. Unfortunately there have been few studies about the combination of a well-designed small-screen interface with a personal digital assistant (PDA) in clinical nursing. Some researchers found that user interface design is an important factor in determining the usability and potential use of a mobile system. Therefore this study proposed a systematic approach to the development of a mobile nursing information system (MNIS) based on Mobile Human-Computer Interaction (M-HCI) for use in clinical nursing. The system combines principles of small-screen interface design with user-specified requirements. In addition the iconic functions were designed with metaphor concept that will help users learn the system more quickly with less working-memory. An experiment involving learnability testing thinking aloud and a questionnaire investigation was conducted for evaluating the effect of MNIS on PDA. The results show that the proposed MNIS is good on learning and higher satisfaction on symbol investigation terminology and system information.;2012
A dialog system is an intelligent program that helps users easily access information stored in a knowledge base by formulating requests in their natural language. A dialog system needs an intention prediction module for use as a preprocessor to reduce the search space of an automatic speech recognizer. To satisfy these needs we propose a statistical model to predict speakers' intentions. The proposed model represents a dialog history with various levels of linguistic features. The proposed model predicts the user's next intention by giving the linguistic features as inputs to a statistical machine learning model. In experiments conducted in a schedule management domain the proposed model showed a higher average precision than the previous model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2012
A high-level dialogue system involves symbolic reasoning and deep understanding of user input and its object is to handle complex dialogue phenomena such as inference and negotiation. However it is difficult for high-level dialogue techniques to be extended toward a practical dialogue system that must generate effective responses in a real environment because the high-level dialogue techniques are based on only a narrow band of knowledge and a complicated model. This paper proposes a new dialogue model based on plan-recognition model that is one of high-level techniques. We simplify the plan-recognition model which includes well-defined recipes and inference rules to be applied to a practical dialogue system. In addition we use a multi-level inference schema that employs a discourse stack and a confirmation strategy for effectively recognizing the user's deep intention. As a result the proposed dialogue system is successfully embedded into a multi-modal interaction system for human-robot interaction.;2012
A novel approach for robust dialogue act detection in a spoken dialogue system is proposed. Shallow representation named partial sentence trees are employed to represent automatic speech recognition outputs. Parsing results of partial sentences can be decomposed into derivation rules which turn out to be salient features for dialogue act detection. Data-driven dialogue acts are learned via an unsupervised learning algorithm called spectral clustering in a vector space whose axes correspond to derivation rules. The proposed method is evaluated in a Mandarin spoken dialogue system for tourist-information services. Combined with information obtained from the automatic speech recognition module and from a Markov model on dialogue act sequence the proposed method achieves a detection accuracy of 85.1% which is significantly better than the baseline performance of 62.3% using a na < ve Bayes classifier. Furthermore the average number of turns per dialogue session also decreases significantly with the improved detection accuracy.;2012
A novel compact MIMO antenna for personal digital assistant (PDA) and pad computer is proposed. The proposed antenna is composed by two multipatch monopole antennas which are placed 90. apart for orthogonal radiation. To strengthen the isolation a T-shaped ground branch with proper dimension is used to generate an additional coupling path to lower the mutual coupling (below -15 dB) especially at GSM850/900 band. The proposed MIMO antenna is fabricated and tested both the simulated and the measured results are presented and some parametric studies are also demonstrated. In addition there are some advantages about the proposed antenna such as simple structure easy fabrication and low cost.;2012
A speech-act is a linguistic action intended by a speaker. Speech-act classification is essential to the generation and understanding of utterances within any natural language dialogue system as the speech act of an utterance is closely tied to a user intention. Lexical information provides the most crucial clue for speech-act classification and contextual information offers additional complementary clues. In this study we concentrate on how to effectively utilize contextual information for speech-act classification. Our proposed model exploits adjacency pairs and a discourse stack to apply contextual information to speech-act classification. Experimental results show that the proposed model yields significant improvements in comparison with other speech-act classification models as well as a baseline model which does not utilize contextual information.;2012
A virtual assistant is being developed for use by astronauts as they use rovers to explore the surface of other planets. This interactive database called the Virtual Camera (VC) is an interactive database that allows the user to have better situational awareness for exploration. It can be used for training data analysis and augmentation of actual surface exploration. This paper describes the development efforts and Human-Computer Interaction considerations for implementing a first-generation VC on a tablet mobile computer device. Scenarios for use will be presented. Evaluation and success criteria such as efficiency in terms of processing time and precision situational awareness learnability usability and robustness will also be presented. Initial testing and the impact of HCI design considerations of manipulation and improvement in situational awareness using a prototype VC will be discussed.;2012
Although there have been enormous investments into English education all around the world not many differences have been made to change the English instruction style. Considering the shortcomings for the current teaching-learning methodology we have been investigating advanced computer-assisted language learning (CALL) systems. This paper aims at summarizing a set of POSTECH approaches including theories technologies systems and field studies and providing relevant pointers. On top of the state-of-the-art technologies of spoken dialog system a variety of adaptations have been applied to overcome some problems caused by numerous errors and variations naturally produced by non-native speakers. Furthermore a number of methods have been developed for generating educational feedback that help learners develop to be proficient. Integrating these efforts resulted in intelligent educational robots - Mero and Engkey - and virtual 3D language learning games Pomy. To verify the effects of our approaches on students' communicative abilities we have conducted a field study at an elementary school in Korea. The results showed that our CALL approaches can be enjoyable and fruitful activities for students. Although the results of this study bring us a step closer to understanding computer-based education more studies are needed to consolidate the findings.;2012
An experience sampling study assessed the relation between psychological functioning in daily life and emotional expressivity as measured by the emotional expressivity scale (EES). Four hundred and twenty-nine participants carried personal digital assistants that signaled them 8 times daily to complete questionnaires assessing affect activities and social contact. As predicted participants high in emotional expressivity were more likely to have elevated state positive affect but not negative affect. These participants were also less likely to be alone and more likely to demonstrate better social functioning when with others. Cross-level interactions indicated that emotional expressivity moderated the association of social context and functioning in the moment. The findings support the validity of the EES as a measure of emotional expressivity and demonstrate the utility of experience sampling for describing personality traits in daily life.

As the ubiquitous access to vast and remote information sources from portable devices becomes commonplace the need from users to perform searches in keyboard-unfriendly situations grows substantially thus triggering the increased demand of voice search sessions. This paper proposes a methodology that addresses different dimensions of scalability of mixed-initiative voice search in automatic spoken dialog systems. The strategy is based on splitting the complexity of the fully-constrained grammar (one that tightly covers the entire hypothesis space) into a fixed/low complexity phonotactic grammar followed by an index mechanism that dynamically assembles a second-pass grammar that consists of only a handful of hypotheses. The experimental analysis demonstrates different dimensions of scalability achieved by the proposed method using actual WHITEPAGEs-residential data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2012
Background Behavioral research to improve lifestyle in broadly defined populations of patients with type 2 diabetes is limited. Objective We evaluated a behavioral intervention featuring technology-based self-monitoring on biophysiologic outcomes of glycemic control and markers of cardiovascular risk Design In this single-site randomized clinical trial participants were stratified by good and poor glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin <8% or >= 8%) and absence or presence of kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate >= 60 or <60 mL/min) and randomized within strata. Measurements were obtained at 0 3 and 6 months. Participants/setting Self-referred community-dwelling adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Intervention The intervention group received Social Cognitive Theory-based counseling paired with technology-based self-monitoring and results were compared with an attention control group. Main outcome measures Glycated hemoglobin fasting serum glucose lipid levels blood pressure weight body mass index and waist circumference were evaluated. Statistical analyses performed Mean differences within and between randomization groups were compared over time. Intervention effects over time were estimated using random intercept models. Results Two hundred ninety-six subjects were randomized 256(86.5%) completed 3-month and 246 (83.1%) completed 6-month assessments. Glycated hemoglobin was reduced in the intervention group by 0.5% at 3 months and 0.6% at 6 months (P<0.001 for each) and the control group by 0.3% (P<0.001) at 3 months and 0.2% (P<0.05) at 6 months but between-group differences were not significant. In those with baseline glycated hemoglobin >= 8% and estimated glomerular filtration rate >= 60 mL/min glycated hemoglobin was reduced in the intervention group by 1.5% at 3 months and 1.8% at 6 months (P<0.001 for each) and the control group by 0.9% (P<0.001) at 3 months and 0.8% (P<0.05) at 6 months but between-group differences were not significant. In random intercept models the estimated reduction in glycated hemoglobin of 0.29% was not significant. Conclusions Two behavioral approaches to improving general lifestyle management in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus were effective in improving glycemic control but no significant between-group differences were observed.

Background: Clinicians and researchers working with dementia caregivers typically assess caregiver stress in a clinic or research center but caregivers' stress is rooted at home where they provide care. This study aimed to compare ratings of stress-related measures obtained in research settings and in the home using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Methods: EMA of 18 caregivers (mean age 66.4 years +/- 7.8 89% females) and 23 non-caregivers (mean age 66.4 years +/- 7.9 87% females) was implemented using a personal digital assistant. Subjects rated their perceived stress fatigue coping with current situation mindfulness and situational demand once in the research center and again at 3-4 semi-random points during a day at home. The data from several assessments conducted at home were averaged for statistical analyses and compared with the data collected in the research center. Results: The testing environment had a differential effect on caregivers and non-caregivers for the ratings of perceived stress (p < 0.01) and situational demand (p = 0.01). When tested in the research center ratings for all measures were similar between groups but when tested at home caregivers rated their perceived stress as higher than non-caregivers (p = 0.02). Overall caregivers reported higher perceived stress at home than in the research center (p = 0.02) and non-caregivers reported greater situational demand in the research center than at home (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The assessment method and environment affect stress-related outcomes. Evaluating participants in their natural environment provides a more sensitive measure of stress-related outcomes. EMA provides a convenient way to gather data when evaluating dementia caregivers.;2012
Background: Examination of mediating behavioral factors could explain how an intervention works and thus provide guidance to optimize behavioral weight-loss programs. This study examined the mediating role of adherence to self-monitoring of diet and physical activity on weight loss in a behavioral weight-loss trial testing the use of personal digital assistants (PDA) for self-monitoring. Methods: Mediation analysis was conducted to examine the possible mediating role of adherence to self-monitoring of diet and physical activity between treatments using varying self-monitoring methods (paper record PDA and PDA with daily tailored feedback messages) and weight loss. Findings: The sample (N=210) was predominantly white (78%) and female (85%). Compared to a paper record using a PDA for self-monitoring diet (P=0.027) and physical activity (P=0.014) had significant direct effects on weight loss at 12 months as well as a significant indirect effect on outcomes through improved adherence to self-monitoring (P-S<0.001). Receiving an automated daily feedback message via PDA only had a significant indirect effect on weight through self-monitoring adherence to diet (P=0.004) and physical activity (P=0.002). Conclusions: Adherence to self-monitoring of diet and physical activity is important as the underlying mechanism in this technology-supported behavioral weight-loss intervention.;2012
Background: Global coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment is recommended to guide primary preventive pharmacotherapy. However little is known about physicians' understanding and use of global CHD risk assessment. Our objective was to examine US physicians' awareness use and attitudes regarding global CHD risk assessment in clinical practice and how these vary by provider specialty. Methods: Using a web-based survey of US family physicians general internists and cardiologists we examined awareness of tools available to calculate CHD risk method and use of CHD risk assessment attitudes towards CHD risk assessment and frequency of using CHD risk assessment to guide recommendations of aspirin lipid-lowering and blood pressure (BP) lowering therapies for primary prevention. Characteristics of physicians indicating they use CHD risk assessments were compared in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Results: A total of 952 physicians completed the questionnaire with 92% reporting awareness of tools available to calculate CHD global risk. Among those aware of such tools over 80% agreed that CHD risk calculation is useful improves patient care and leads to better decisions about recommending preventive therapies. However only 41% use CHD risk assessment in practice. The most commonly reported barrier to CHD risk assessment is that it is too time consuming. Among respondents who calculate global CHD risk 69% indicated they use it to guide lipid lowering therapy recommendations 54% use it to guide aspirin therapy recommendations and 48% use it to guide BP lowering therapy. Only 40% of respondents who use global CHD risk routinely tell patients their risk. Use of a personal digital assistant or smart phone was associated with reported use of CHD risk assessment (adjusted OR 1.58 95% CI 1.17-2.12). Conclusions: Reported awareness of tools to calculate global CHD risk appears high but the majority of physicians in this sample do not use CHD risk assessments in practice. A minority of physicians in this sample use global CHD risk to guide prescription decisions or to motivate patients. Educational interventions and system improvements to improve physicians' effective use of global CHD risk assessment should be developed and tested.;2012
Background: Increased adverse pregnancy outcomes related to psychiatric and psychosocial problems can be observed for urban areas when compared to national averages. We developed a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based self-report screening model that produces tailored intervention advices. After having adapted the model to local care pathways we tested the reliability validity and feasibility of the model in routine antenatal care. Methods: Observational study among pregnant women in a Dutch urban area included women with a booking visit. Women answered questions posed by the PDA-tool while waiting for their appointment. If the tool suggested specific interventions (screen result) this was discussed during booking visit. A randomly selected subsample of participants completed the questionnaire again at a subsequent pregnancy check (retest). After the study was conducted prenatal caregivers and assistants were interviewed for feasibility judgments. Psychometric and diagnostic performance of this approach was established. Results: Response rate among invited pregnant women was 94% on weighted average (n = 621). Internal reliability ranged 0.88-0.90 test-retest reliability ranged 0.64-1.00. Positive predictive value was 86% and negative predictive value was 97%. No interpractice psychometrical differences were observed. Migrant women more often received an intervention advice than native women (p < 0.001). The approach was well accepted among prenatal caregivers for its time efficiency and patient-friendliness. Conclusion: Psychometric properties of our screen-and-advice tool were favorable under routine conditions and the feasibility of this integral approach appeared good. The technical flexibility renders the model suitable for broader application. Local care pathways can easily be incorporated. We suggest implementation of this model in prenatal care in urbanized settings in order to make tailored mental healthcare broadly available.;2012
Background: Mobile technology is increasingly being used by clinicians to access up-to-date information for patient care. These offer learning opportunities in the clinical setting for medical students but the underlying pedagogic theories are not clear. A conceptual framework is needed to understand these further. Our initial questions were how the medical students used the technology how it enabled them to learn and what theoretical underpinning supported the learning. Methods: 387 medical students were provided with a personal digital assistant (PDA) loaded with medical resources for the duration of their clinical studies. Outcomes were assessed by a mixed-methods triangulation approach using qualitative and quantitative analysis of surveys focus groups and usage tracking data. Results: Learning occurred in context with timely access to key facts and through consolidation of knowledge via repetition. The PDA was an important addition to the learning ecology rather than a replacement. Contextual factors impacted on use both positively and negatively. Barriers included concerns of interrupting the clinical interaction and of negative responses from teachers and patients. Students preferred a future involving smartphone platforms. Conclusions: This is the first study to describe the learning ecology and pedagogic basis behind the use of mobile learning technologies in a large cohort of undergraduate medical students in the clinical environment. We have developed a model for mobile learning in the clinical setting that shows how different theories contribute to its use taking into account positive and negative contextual factors. The lessons from this study are transferable internationally to other health care professions and to the development of similar initiatives with newer technology such as smartphones or tablet computers.;2012
Background: Regular physical activity has established physical and mental health benefits however merely one quarter of the U. S. adult population meets national physical activity recommendations. In an effort to engage individuals who do not meet these guidelines researchers have utilized popular emerging technologies including mobile devices (ie personal digital assistants [PDAs] mobile phones). This study is the first to synthesize current research focused on the use of mobile devices for increasing physical activity. Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis of research utilizing mobile devices to influence physical activity behavior. The aims of this review were to: (1) examine the efficacy of mobile devices in the physical activity setting (2) explore and discuss implementation of device features across studies and (3) make recommendations for future intervention development. Methods: We searched electronic databases (PubMed PsychINFO SCOPUS) and identified publications through reference lists and requests to experts in the field of mobile health. Studies were included that provided original data and aimed to influence physical activity through dissemination or collection of intervention materials with a mobile device. Data were extracted to calculate effect sizes for individual studies as were study descriptives. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software suite. Study quality was assessed using the quality of execution portion of the Guide to Community Preventative Services data extraction form. Results: Four studies were of  good quality and seven of fair quality. In total 1351 individuals participated in 11 unique studies from which 18 effects were extracted and synthesized yielding an overall weight mean effect size of g = 0.54 (95% CI = 0.17 to 0.91 P =.01). Conclusions: Research utilizing mobile devices is gaining in popularity and this study suggests that this platform is an effective means for influencing physical activity behavior. Our focus must be on the best possible use of these tools to measure and understand behavior. Therefore theoretically grounded behavior change interventions that recognize and act on the potential of smartphone technology could provide investigators with an effective tool for increasing physical activity.

Background: Smartphone usage has spread to many settings including that of healthcare with numerous potential and realised benefits. The ability to download custom-built software applications (apps) has created a new wealth of clinical resources available to healthcare staff providing evidence-based decisional tools to reduce medical errors. Previous literature has examined how smartphones can be utilised by both medical student and doctor populations to enhance educational and workplace activities with the potential to improve overall patient care. However this literature has not examined smartphone acceptance and patterns of medical app usage within the student and junior doctor populations. Methods: An online survey of medical student and foundation level junior doctor cohorts was undertaken within one United Kingdom healthcare region. Participants were asked whether they owned a Smartphone and if they used apps on their Smartphones to support their education and practice activities. Frequency of use and type of app used was also investigated. Open response questions explored participants' views on apps that were desired or recommended and the characteristics of apps that were useful. Results: 257 medical students and 131 junior doctors responded equating to a response rate of 15.0% and 21.8% respectively. 79.0% (n=203/257) of medical students and 74.8% (n=98/131) of junior doctors owned a smartphone with 56.6% (n=115/203) of students and 68.4% (n=67/98) of doctors owning an iPhone. The majority of students and doctors owned 1-5 medical related applications with very few owning more than 10 and iPhone owners significantly more likely to own apps (Chi sq p<0.001). Both populations showed similar trends of app usage of several times a day. Over 24hours apps were used for between 1-30 minutes for students and 1-20 minutes for doctors students used disease diagnosis/management and drug reference apps with doctors favouring clinical score/calculator apps. Conclusions: This study found a high level of smartphone ownership and usage among medical students and junior doctors. Both groups endorse the development of more apps to support their education and clinical practice.;2012
Background: The Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) is a longitudinal data collection process that systematically and continuously monitors population dynamics for a specified population in a geographically defined area that lacks an effective system for registering demographic information and vital events. Methods: HDSS programs have been run in 2 regions in Kenya: in Mbita district in Nyanza province and Kwale district in Coast Province. The 2 areas have different disease burdens and cultures. Vital events were obtained by using personal digital assistants and global positioning system devices. Additional health-related surveys have been conducted bimonthly using various PDA-assisted survey software. Results: The Mbita HDSS covers 55 929 individuals and the Kwale HDSS covers 42 585 individuals. In the Mbita HDSS the life expectancy was 61.0 years for females and 57.5 years for males. Under-5 mortality was 91.5 per 1000 live births and infant mortality was 47.0 per 1000 live births. The total fertility rate was 3.7 per woman. Data from the Kwale HDSS were not available because it has been running for less than I year at the time of this report. Conclusions: Our HDSS programs are based on a computer-assisted survey system that provides a rapid and flexible data collection platform in areas that lack an effective basic resident registration system. Although the HDSS areas are not representative of the entire country they provide a base for several epidemiologic and social study programs and for practical community support programs that seek to improve the health of the people in these areas.;2012
Background: The use of mobile devices are ubiquitous in medical-care professional settings but information on privacy and security concerns of mobile devices for medical students is scarce. Aims: To gain baseline information about third-year medical students' mobile device use and knowledge of privacy and security issues concerning mobile devices. Methods: We surveyed 67 third-year medical students at a Midwestern university on their use of mobile devices and knowledge of how to protect information available through mobile devices. Students were also presented with clinical scenarios to rate their level of concern in regards to privacy and security of information. Results: The most used features of mobile devices were: voice-to-voice (100%) text messaging (SMS) (94%) Internet (76.9%) and email (69.3%). For locking of one's personal mobile phone 54.1% never physically lock their phone and 58% never electronically lock their personal PDA. Scenarios considering definitely privacy concerns include emailing patient information intact (66.7%) and posting de-identified information on YouTube (45.2%) or Facebook (42.2%). Conclusions: As the ease of sharing data increases with the use of mobile devices students need more education and training on possible privacy and security risks posed with mobile devices.;2012
Background: There is growing awareness of the role of information technology in evidence-based practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of organizational context and nurse characteristics in explaining variation in nurses' use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile Tablet PCs for accessing evidence-based information. The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) model provided the framework for studying the impact of providing nurses with PDA-supported evidence-based practice resources and for studying the organizational technological and human resource variables that impact nurses' use patterns. Methods: A survey design was used involving baseline and follow-up questionnaires. The setting included 24 organizations representing three sectors: hospitals long-term care (LTC) facilities and community organizations (home care and public health). The sample consisted of 710 participants (response rate 58%) at Time 1 and 469 for whom both Time 1 and Time 2 follow-up data were obtained (response rate 66%). A hierarchical regression model (HLM) was used to evaluate the effect of predictors from all levels simultaneously. Results: The Chi square result indicated PDA users reported using their device more frequently than Tablet PC users (p = 0.001). Frequency of device use was explained by 'breadth of device functions' and PDA versus Tablet PC. Frequency of Best Practice Guideline use was explained by 'willingness to implement research' 'structural and electronic resources' 'organizational slack time' 'breadth of device functions' (positive effects) and 'slack staff' (negative effect). Frequency of Nursing Plus database use was explained by 'culture' 'structural and electronic resources' and 'breadth of device functions' (positive effects) and 'slack staff' (negative). 'Organizational culture' (positive) 'breadth of device functions' (positive) and 'slack staff' (negative) were associated with frequency of Lexi/PEPID drug dictionary use. Conclusion: Access to PDAs and Tablet PCs supported nurses' self-reported use of information resources. Several of the organizational context variables and one individual nurse variable explained variation in the frequency of information resource use.;2012
BACKGROUND: With the passage of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act widespread adoption of certain health information technologies such as electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) is imminent. Drug-drug interaction (DDI) screening and medication history information are commonly incorporated into health information exchange systems to improve medical decision making safety and quality of care but the value of these features is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of providing access to an early generation electronic medication management program with medication history accessible to prescribers via a wireless handheld personal digital assistant (PDA) device on the incidence of potential DDIs (i.e. DDIs that may or may not cause patient harm). METHODS: This study employed a retrospective pre-intervention/post-intervention study design with a comparison group to evaluate the effectiveness of a wireless handheld medication management program in preventing serious potential DDIs. Licensed prescribers in a state Medicaid program who wrote prescriptions during the period from August 2003 through June 2006 were included in this study. The intervention (PDA) group consisted of clinicians who requested and were granted access to the wireless handheld device containing prescription drug history between August 1 2004 and June 30 2005. Initially the device contained 100-day patient-specific medication history but other functionalities were added during the study period including the ability to check for drug-drug interactions and e-prescribing. The comparison group consisted of prescribers who sent a request to obtain but did not receive the wireless handheld device during the same time period. Baseline prescribing patterns of 25 previously identified clinically important potential DDIs were assessed over two 12-month periods one period prior to (baseline) and one period after (follow-up) an index date (date of device deployment for PDA group date of request for comparison group). A random-effects negative binomial model was used to analyze the primary outcome the number of potential DDIs per prescriber per 12-month time period. A secondary outcome of interest the likelihood that a prescriber would prescribe at least 1 potentially interacting medication pair during the baseline and follow-up periods was analyzed using a random-effects logistic model. RESULTS: A total of 1615 prescribers constituted the PDA group and 600 prescribers made up the comparison group. Prescribers in the 2 groups were significantly different in their specialty practice areas (P<0.001) number of pharmacy claims at baseline (P<0.001) and the likelihood of prescribing at least 1 potential DDI combination during the 1-year baseline period (P=0.003). However the prescriber groups were similar in their average age (P=0.241) and geographic location (P=0.181). The most widely prescribed potential DDIs included those involving warfarin with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thyroid hormones. The median number of patient medication history updates requested per PDA group prescriber during follow-up was 24 (range 0 to 1073). At baseline 1104 (68.4%) of the PDA group and 449(74.8%) of the comparison group had no potential DDIs. During the next year 1131 (70.0%) and 462 (77.0%) of the PDA group and comparison group respectively had no DDIs. The incidence rate ratio was 1.01 (95% CI=0.87-1.17) for the PDA group relative to the comparison group for change in number of potential DDIs. In the logistic regression model the odds of prescribing at least 1 potential DDI did not significantly differ by group (odds ratio=1.26 95% CI=0.96-1.66). These results indicate that there was no significant difference between the intervention and comparison group with regard to the change in the rate of potential DDIs between the baseline and follow-up periods. CONCLUSION: A stand-alone medication management program in a wireless PDA device was not frequently used by most prescribers to update patient medication histories and was not associated with a reduction in the rate of prescribing potentially clinically important DDIs.

Conversational agents are attributed humanlike characteristics: in particular they are often assumed to have a gender. There is evidence that gender sets up expectations that have an impact on user experiences with agents. The objective of this paper is to explore gender affordances of conversational agents. Our examination takes a holistic approach to the analysis of the application of gender stereotypes to nine chatterbots: six embodied (three male and three female) two disembodied (male and female) and a robot embodiment. Building on social psychology research we test the persistence of gender stereotypes in the selection of conversation topics and in the elicitation of disinhibition and verbal abuse. Our study is based on quantitative textual analysis of interaction logs. A dictionary of English sexual slang and derogatory terms was developed for this study. Results show that gender stereotypes tend to affect interaction more at the relational (style) level then at the referential (content) level of conversation. People attribute negative stereotypes to female-presenting chatterbots more often than they do to male-presenting chatterbots and female-presenting chatterbots are more often the objects of implicit and explicit sexual attention and swear words. We conclude by calling for a more informed analysis of user interactions that considers the full range of user interactions. (C) 2012 British Informatics Society Limited. All rights reserved.;2012
Convincing conversational agents require a coherent set of behavioral responses that can be interpreted by a human observer as indicative of a personality. This paper discusses the continued development and subsequent evaluation of virtual agents based on sound psychological principles. We use Eysenck's theoretical basis to explain aspects of the characterization of our agents and we describe an architecture where personality affects the agent's global behavior quality as well as their back-channel productions. Drawing on psychological research we evaluate perception of our agents' personalities and credibility by human viewers (N = 187). Our results suggest that we succeeded in validating theoretically grounded indicators of personality in our virtual agents and that it is feasible to place our characters on Eysenck's scales. A key finding is that the presence of behavioral characteristics reinforces the prescribed personality profiles that are already emerging from the still images. Our long-term goal is to enhance agents' ability to sustain realistic interaction with human users and we discuss how this preliminary work may be further developed to include more systematic variation of Eysenck's personality scales.;2012
Creating interactive applications with multiple virtual characters comes along with many challenges that are related to different areas of expertise. The definition of context-sensitive interactive behavior requires expert programmers and often results in hard-to-maintain code. To tackle these challenges we suggest a visual authoring approach for virtual character applications and present a revised version of our SceneMaker tool. In SceneMaker a separation of content and logic is enforced. In the revised version the Visual SceneMaker we introduce concurrency and specific history structures as key concepts to facilitate (1) clearly structured interactive behavior definition (2) multiple character modeling and (3) extensions to existing applications. The new integrated developer environment allows sceneflow visualization and runtime modifications to support the development of interactive character applications in a rapid prototyping style. Finally we present the result of a user study which evaluates usability and the key concepts of the authoring tool.;2012
Current development platforms for designing spoken dialog services feature different kinds of strategies to help designers build test and deploy their applications. In general these platforms are made up of several assistants that handle the different design stages (e.g. definition of the dialog flow prompt and grammar definition database connection or to debug and test the running of the application). In spite of all the advances in this area in general the process of designing spoken-based dialog services is a time consuming task that needs to be accelerated. In this paper we describe a complete development platform that reduces the design time by using different types of acceleration strategies based on using information from the data model structure and database contents as well as cumulative information obtained throughout the successive steps in the design. Thanks to these accelerations the interaction with the platform is simplified and the design is reduced in most cases to simple confirmations to the proposals that the platform automatically provides at each stage. Different kinds of proposals are available to complete the application flow such as the possibility of selecting which information slots should be requested to the user together predefined templates for common dialogs the most probable actions that make up each state defined in the flow different solutions to solve specific speech-modality problems such as the presentation of the lists of retrieved results after querying the backend database. The platform also includes accelerations for creating speech grammars and prompts and the SQL queries for accessing the database at runtime. Finally we will describe the setup and results obtained in a simultaneous summative subjective and objective evaluations with different designers used to test the usability of the proposed accelerations as well as their contribution to reducing the design time and interaction.

During human communication every spoken message is intrinsically modulated within different verbal and nonverbal cues that are externalized through various aspects of speech and facial gestures. These communication channels are strongly interrelated which suggests that generating human-like behavior requires a careful study of their relationship. Neglecting the mutual influence of different communicative channels in the modeling of natural behavior for a conversational agent may result in unrealistic behaviors that can affect the intended visual perception of the animation. This relationship exists both between audiovisual information and within different visual aspects. This paper explores the idea of using joint models to preserve the coupling not only between speech and facial expression but also within facial gestures. As a case study the paper focuses on building a speech-driven facial animation framework to generate natural head and eyebrow motions. We propose three dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) which make different assumptions about the coupling between speech eyebrow and head motion. Synthesized animations are produced based on the MPEG-4 facial animation standard using the audiovisual IEMOCAP database. The experimental results based on perceptual evaluations reveal that the proposed joint models (speech/eyebrow/head) outperform audiovisual models that are separately trained (speech/head and speech/eyebrow).;2012
Educators in medicine psychology and the military want to provide their students with interpersonal skills practice. Virtual humans offer structured learning of interview skills can facilitate learning about unusual conditions and are always available. However the creation of virtual humans with the ability to understand and respond to natural language requires costly engineering by conversation knowledge engineers (generally computer scientists) and incurs logistical cost for acquiring domain knowledge from domain experts (educators). We address these problems using a novel crowdsourcing method entitled Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling. This method facilitates collaborative development of virtual humans by two groups of end-users: domain experts (educators) and domain novices (students). We implemented this method in a web-based authoring tool called Virtual People Factory. Using Virtual People Factory medical and pharmacy educators are now creating natural language virtual patient interactions on their own. This article presents the theoretical background for Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling the implementation of the Virtual People Factory authoring tool and five case studies showing that Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling has addressed the logistical cost for acquiring knowledge.

Empathetic behavior has been suggested to be one effective way for Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) to provide feedback to learners' emotions. An issue that has been raised is the effective integration of parallel and reactive empathy. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of ECAs' emotional facial and tone of voice expressions combined with empathetic verbal behavior when displayed as feedback to students' fear sad and happy emotions in the context of a self-assessment test. Three identical female agents were used for this experiment: 1) an ECA performing parallel empathy combined with neutral emotional expressions 2) an ECA performing parallel empathy displaying emotional expressions that were relevant to the emotional state of the student and 3) an ECA performing parallel empathy by displaying relevant emotional expressions followed by emotional expressions of reactive empathy with the goal of altering the student's emotional state. Results indicate that an agent performing parallel empathy displaying emotional expressions relevant to the emotional state of the student may cause this emotion to persist. Moreover the agent performing parallel and then reactive empathy appeared to be effective in altering an emotional state of fear to a neutral one.;2012
Gutierrez J. Gomez-Munoz V. Villa-Medina F. and Porta-Gandara MA. 2012. Wireless beach profiler. Journal of Coastal Research 28(4) 868-873. West Palm Beach (Florida) ISSN 0749-0208. A wireless beach profiler was designed using a vertically aligned accelerometer to estimate slopes along several points of the beach. The accelerometer output from each point was measured as a tilt angle by a microcontroller and transmitted to a personal digital assistant via a radio frequency wireless link. The digital assistant was used to store the data file for subsequent analysis. The device was mounted on a metal board and pulled along a perpendicular path to the beach where the sampling points were located. The system included a global positioning system (GPS) receiver to record the actual path traversed. The results of this proposed profiling system were compared with an electronic distance meter and with the Emery method. The wireless beach profiler was also evaluated on a robotic vehicle to automate the process. Results showed that this profiler system is a reliable alternative because of its accuracy portability and cost.;2012
How to design highly reputable and hot-selling products is an essential issue in product design. Whether consumers choose a product depends largely on their perception of the product image. A consumer-oriented design approach presented in this paper helps product designers incorporate consumers' perceptions of product forms in the design process. The consumer-oriented design approach uses quantification theory type I grey prediction (the linear modeling technique) and neural networks (the nonlinear modeling technique) to determine the optimal form combination of product design for matching a given product image. An experimental study based on the concept of Kansei Engineering is conducted to collect numerical data for examining the relationship between consumers' perception of product image and product form elements of personal digital assistants (PDAs). The result of performance comparison shows that the QTTI model is good enough to help product designers determine the optimal form combination of product design. Although the PDA form design is used as a case study the approach is applicable to other consumer products with various design elements and product images. The approach provides an effective mechanism for facilitating the consumer-oriented product design process.;2012
Identificator is a web-based tool used to help non experts in identifying plant diseases based on the selection of pictures and/or short text descriptions (when no suitable images exist) representing the symptoms on a specific sample of plant organs. The system is based on a multi-access key of identification and specifically on the selection of pictures by the user and can be used remotely from a desktop as well as from a smart phone or personal digital assistant. The system was developed following a simple approach: visual identification where images and/or short descriptions are used to uniquely identify diseases when possible and suggest refining the visual identification process in cases of ambiguous identification. It has been designed in a way that allows easy definition of additional diseases by uploading the correct images and defining the identification rules and diseases. In this way the system may aid growers in identifying various diseases when using the system remotely while the system is developed and maintained centrally. This approach may ease the process of manual visual disease identification until machine vision technology is mature enough to perform this task automatically. We tested the system for visual identification of strawberry diseases using a computer and samples of infected plants. The evaluation showed that it is effective and accurate in enabling its users to identify strawberry diseases. (C) 2012 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.;2012
In dialogue systems it is important to label the dialogue turns with dialogue-related meaning. Each turn is usually divided into segments and these segments are labelled with dialogue acts (DAs). A DA is a representation of the functional role of the segment. Each segment is labelled with one DA representing its role in the ongoing discourse. The sequence of DAs given a dialogue turn is used by the dialogue manager to understand the turn. Probabilistic models that perform DA labelling can be used on segmented or unsegmented turns. The last option is more likely for a practical dialogue system but it provides poorer results. In that case a hypothesis for the number of segments can be provided to improve the results. We propose some methods to estimate the probability of the number of segments based on the transcription of the turn. The new labelling model includes the estimation of the probability of the number of segments in the turn. We tested this new approach with two different dialogue corpora: SWITCHBOARD and DIHANA. The results show that this inclusion significantly improves the labelling accuracy.;2012
In recent years high rates of failure of technology-based products have spurred interest in understanding the psychological and sociological barriers to consumer learning of technological innovations. The main focus of this research was to examine the learning process and consumers coping mechanisms when they encounter technological innovations. A study was designed to understand the learning process in real time as consumers engaged in a set of activities associated with the novel interface. The goal was to investigate how consumers cope with high levels of complexity during their initial interactions with a technology-based product and how their coping strategies may hinder the learning process. Verbal protocol measures were used in order to understand the consumer's learning process as he or she interacts with a technology-based product in real time. They were told that they would have to think aloud while performing certain tasks and that their thoughts would be recorded for further analysis. The personal digital assistant (PDA) with handwriting recognition as its interface was chosen for this study. The main task for the participants was to learn how to use Graffiti writing-i.e. the product's handwriting recognition software. We proceeded to a thematic analysis in which interpretations were generated by the researchers going back and forth between the transcribed texts the developing interpretation the new interface itself and also the relevant literature. The results suggest that the new product's interface serves to structure the consumer's learning process even as he or she responds in relatively unstructured ways. The findings identify three basic factors that interfere with the learning process during consumers' initial interactions with a technological innovation: interface and functionality practices social influence and causal attributions. Specifically the results suggest that in designing technology-based products there is a gap between the levels of know-how between the manufacturer and the user. The challenge for manufacturers is to understand the consumer's learning experience and coping strategies and provide mechanisms that would make the transition easy and intuitive. This could be achieved by incorporating into the new interface some degree of flexibility that will allow consumers to modify tasks based on their preferences or by including indicators that will provide feedback to the user. Furthermore in the context of communication strategies in order to minimize the negative impact that prior knowledge and social influence may have on learning marketers could communicate specific steps describing how to use the new interface.;2012
In this paper a Bayesian Networks-based solution for dialogue modelling is presented. This solution is combined with carefully designed contextual information handling strategies. With the purpose of validating these solutions and introducing a spoken dialogue system for controlling a Hi-Fi audio system as the selected prototype a real-user evaluation has been conducted. Two different versions of the prototype are compared. Each version corresponds to a different implementation of the algorithm for the management of the actuation order the algorithm for deciding the proper order to carry out the actions required by the user. The evaluation is carried out in terms of a battery of both subjective and objective metrics collected from speakers interacting with the Hi-Fi audio box through predefined scenarios. Defined metrics have been specifically adapted to measure: first the usefulness and the actual relevance of the proposed solutions and secondly their joint performance through their intelligent combination mainly measured as the level achieved with regard to the user satisfaction. A thorough and comprehensive study of the main differences between both approaches is presented. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests are also included to measure the effects of both: the system used and the type of scenario factors simultaneously. Finally the effect of bringing this flexibility robustness and naturalness into our home dialogue system is also analyzed through the results obtained. These results show that the intelligence of our speech interface has been well perceived highlighting its excellent ease of use and its good acceptance by users therefore validating the approached dialogue management solutions and demonstrating that a more natural flexible and robust dialogue is possible thanks to them.

In this paper we investigate the effect of level of understanding revealed by feedback in the form of clarification requests from a route follower on a route giver's spatial perspective choice in their response in route instruction dialogues. In an experiment varying the level of understanding displayed by route follower clarification requests (the independent variable) route giver perspective switching in response to this feedback is investigated. Three levels of understanding displayed by feedback are investigated: (1) low-level clarification requests indicating that the instruction was not processed (2) semantic-level clarification requests indicating that the spatial direction given in the instruction could not be resolved as the speaker of the clarification request could not interpret which perspective was intended and (3) high-level feedback which indicates that the route giver's instruction was understood but which note an obstacle to following the instruction. Results show that perspective choice which is a conceptual feature of language use is sensitive to perceived level of addressee understanding. We found that route givers consistently switch perspectives in responding to semantic-level clarification requests but not in response to low-level ones and also that switching occurs more for high-level feedback than for low-level feedback. We address how dialogue systems can take advantage of these findings by modelling our results in an Information State model of dialogue presenting update rules for response generation which account for our findings and also update rules which enable generation of the feedback themselves.;2012
In this paper we investigate whether conventional text categorization methods may suffice to infer different verbal intelligence levels. This research goal relies on the hypothesis that the vocabulary that speakers make use of reflects their verbal intelligence levels. Automatic verbal intelligence estimation of users in a spoken language dialog system may be useful when defining an optimal dialog strategy by improving its adaptation capabilities. The work is based on a corpus containing descriptions (i.e. monologs) of a short film by test persons yielding different educational backgrounds and the verbal intelligence scores of the speakers. First a one-way analysis of variance was performed to compare the monologs with the film transcription and to demonstrate that there are differences in the vocabulary used by the test persons yielding different verbal intelligence levels. Then for the classification task the monologs were represented as feature vectors using the classical TF-IDF weighting scheme. The Naive Bayes k-nearest neighbors and Rocchio classifiers were tested. In this paper we describe and compare these classification approaches define the optimal classification parameters and discuss the classification results obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we focus on an agent-based architecture for task-oriented dialogue management. We present our deliberation process based on optimizing the length of a dialogue in terms of its turns needed to accomplish a task. As innovative features the manager accommodates a lounge strategy for passing initiative back to the user and a two-layered structure for dialogue context representation. We show that applying the lounge strategy during a dialogue leads to improving the information exchange rate by approximately 5% compared to common dialogue strategies alternative. Furthermore we present two of our dialogues and analyze them with respect to the agent description. At the end of the paper we suggest future extensions and modifications to the architecture and conclude. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012
In this paper we investigate the user's reactions to received suggestion by an Embodied Conversational Agent playing the role of artificial therapist in the healthy eating domain. Specifically we analyse the behaviour of people who voluntarily requested to receive information from the agent and we compare it with the results of a previous evaluation experiment in which subjects were not properly motivated to interact with the agent because they were selected for evaluating the system. This study is part of an ongoing research aimed at developing an intelligent virtual agent that applies natural argumentation techniques to persuade the users to improve their eating habits.;2012
In this paper we propose a novel co-occurrence probabilities based similarity measure for inducing semantic classes. Clustering with the new similarity measure outperforms the widely used distance based on Kullback-Leibler divergence in precision recall and F1 evaluation. In our experiments we induced semantic classes from unannotated in-domain corpus and then used the induced classes and structures to generate large in-domain corpus which was then used for language model adaptation. Character recognition rate was improved from 85.2% to 91%. We imply a new measure to solve the lack of domain data problem by first induction then generation for a dialogue system.;2012
In this study an application that allows a mobile phone to be used as a biometric-capture device is shown. The main contribution of our proposal is that this capture and later recognition can be performed during a standard web session using the same architecture that is used in a personal computer (PC) thus allowing a multiplatform (PC personal digital assistant (PDA) mobile phone etc.) biometric web access. The review which is from both an academic and commercial point of view of the biometry and mobile device state of the art shows that in other related works the biometric capture and recognition is either performed locally in the mobile or remotely but using special communication protocols and/or connection ports with the server. The second main contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the present mobile web-browser limitations thus it is concluded that in general it is impossible to use the same technologies that can be used to capture biometrics in PC platforms (i.e. Applet Java ActiveX Control JavaScript or Flash) therefore new solutions as shown here are needed.;2012
INES (INtelligent Educational System) is an operative prototype of an e-learning platform. This platform includes several tools and technologies such as: (i) semantic management of users and contents (ii) conversational agents to communicate with students in natural language (iii) BDI-based (Believes Desires Intentions) agents which shape the tutoring module of the system (iv) an inference engine and (v) ontologies to semantically model the users their activities and the learning contents. The main contribution of this paper is the intelligent tutoring module of the system. Briefly the tasks of this module are to recognize each student (checking his/her system credentials) and to obtain information about his/her learning progress. So it can be able to suggest to each student specific tasks to achieve his/her particular learning objectives based on several parameters related to the existing learning paths and the student's profile.

Interaction with users is a powerful strategy that potentially yields better information retrieval for all types of media including text images and videos. While spoken document retrieval (SDR) is a crucial technology for multimedia access in the network era it is also more challenging than text information retrieval because of the inevitable recognition errors. It is therefore reasonable to consider interactive functionalities for SDR systems. We propose an interactive SDR approach in which given the user's query the system returns not only the retrieval results but also a short list of key terms describing distinct topics. The user selects these key terms to expand the query if the retrieval results are not satisfactory. The entire retrieval process is organized around a hierarchy of key terms that define the allowable state transitions this is modeled by a Markov decision process which is popularly used in spoken dialogue systems. By reinforcement learning with simulated users the key terms on the short list are properly ranked such that the retrieval success rate is maximized while the number of interactive steps is minimized. Significant improvements over existing approaches were observed in preliminary experiments performed on information needs provided by real users. A prototype system was also implemented.;2012
Internet security has become a serious issue for anyone connected to the Internet. To avoid unauthorized people accessing an information system keystroke dynamics-based authentication (KDA) systems combine password knowledge with typing characteristics to enhance the security of general password authentication systems. However some portable computational devices have no computer keyboard for example personal digital assistants and mobile phones. That is KDA systems cannot successfully work while the enrollment phase is implemented based on a standard desktop keyboard. This reduces the portability of the KDA system. This paper adopts rhythms clicked by a mouse as another identifiable factor. Mouse clicks can be replaced by a stylus on non-keyboard device numeral buttons on mobile phones or fingers on touch screens to enhance system portability. In our proposed system the click data are based on the time instances during pressing and releasing the mouse button. Five features based on these time periods are calculated using this data. We invited twenty-five users to participate in our experiment. The experimental results showed that our authentication system can achieve a good accuracy. Our experiments also showed that the rhythm clicked by a mouse can function as the second identifiable factor in general password authentication systems or as the standby identifiable factor in KDA systems.;2012
Introduction The use of innovative technologies is deemed to improve dietary assessment in various research settings. However their relative merits in nutritional epidemiological studies which require accurate quantitative estimates of the usual intake at individual level still need to be evaluated. Objective To report on the inventory of available innovative technologies for dietary assessment and to critically evaluate their strengths and weaknesses as compared with the conventional methodologies (i.e. Food Frequency Questionnaires food records 24-hour dietary recalls) used in epidemiological studies. Methods A list of currently available technologies was identified from English-language journals using PubMed and Web of Science. The search criteria were principally based on the date of publication (between 1995 and 2011) and pre-defined search keywords. Results Six main groups of innovative technologies were identified ('Personal Digital Assistant-' 'Mobile-phone-' 'Interactive computer-' 'Web-' 'Camera- and tape-recorder-' and 'Scan- and sensor-based' technologies). Compared with the conventional food records Personal Digital Assistant and mobile phone devices seem to improve the recording through the possibility for 'real-time' recording at eating events but their validity to estimate individual dietary intakes was low to moderate. In 24-hour dietary recalls there is still limited knowledge regarding the accuracy of fully automated approaches and methodological problems such as the inaccuracy in self-reported portion sizes might be more critical than in interview-based applications. In contrast measurement errors in innovative web-based and in conventional paper-based Food Frequency Questionnaires are most likely similar suggesting that the underlying methodology is unchanged by the technology. Conclusions Most of the new technologies in dietary assessment were seen to have overlapping methodological features with the conventional methods predominantly used for nutritional epidemiology. Their main potential to enhance dietary assessment is through more cost- and time-effective less laborious ways of data collection and higher subject acceptance though their integration in epidemiological studies would need additional considerations such as the study objectives the target population and the financial resources available. However even in innovative technologies the inherent individual bias related to self-reported dietary intake will not be resolved. More research is therefore crucial to investigate the validity of innovative dietary assessment technologies.;2012
Introduction: A growing body of research points to regular comprehensive mental health screening in primary care practices as an effective tool but a thorough and efficient approach is not yet widely used. The purpose of this report is to describe the pattern of mental health-related concerns protective and social risk factors reported by adolescents during routine well-child visits in primary care settings and their occurrence among teens that screen positive for either depression or anxiety with brief validated measures. Methods: A personal digital assistant-based questionnaire was administered as part of clinical care to adolescents 11 to 18 years old (N = 2184) attending preventive well-child visits in 13 pediatric and family medicine primary care practices in a northern New England practice-based research network over 18 months (2008 to 2009). Depressive and anxiety-related symptoms were assessed using the 2-question versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale respectively. Analyses determined the role that the protective and social risk factors played in determining who screens positive for depression and anxiety. Results: In the fully adjusted model risk factors that were significant (P < .05) predictors for a positive screen of depression included substance use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.05) stress (AOR 3.59) anger (AOR 1.94) and worries about family alcohol and drug use (AOR 2.69). Among protective factors that is those that reduce the risk of depression age (AOR 0.87 for younger patients) having parents who listen (AOR 0.34) and having more assets (AOR 0.65) were significant. Significant predictors of screening positive for anxiety included substance use (AOR 1.97) stress (AOR 6.10) anger (AOR 2.31) trouble sleeping (AOR 1.75) and the sex of the adolescent (AOR 1.87 for girls). Although having parents who listen was still a significant protective factor for anxiety (AOR 2.26) other assets were not significant. Conclusions: Comprehensive primary care mental health screening that considers both anxiety and depression while including strength-based and psychosocial support questions is a helpful adjunct to clinical practices and has been done routinely by using an electronic tool at the point of care. Because certain common somatic and emotional concerns can precede depression and anxiety routine screening for these issues along with depression and anxiety screening is suggested.

iPhone Siri demonstratively introduced natural language processing. Still a gadget the idea revived one of the old promises of computers as personal assistants. Does it have the potential of fulfilling the already burgeoning imagination related to this promise? The authors believe that while still dependent on the evolution of artificial intelligence the virtual assistant may find support in the already maturing technologies of augmented reality and more important in the changing global network with the semantic web. Internet of things and geo-location. Bluntly speaking its feasibility and acceptability may not even have to wait for the promised IBM computer with human brain capabilities but rather build on a more friendly interaction with the Google search engine. The article provides a narrative scenario of the deep economic and social transformations and even turbulence that the so called imaginary friend may produce. Not discarding but creatively integrating some of the archetypes of futuristic literature the story positions these entities as the foreground of a deep integration of networks with the added turmoil caused by economic interests that go beyond individuals' sense-making capacity. This article is one of the follow-ups of the international foresight workshop Crazy futures coordinated by Ziauddin Sardar and George Cairns in a small resort on the Danube Delta in July 2011 a workshop organised as part of the project Quality and Leadership for Romanian Higher Education.

Language serves many functions for humans but three of the most important are coordination learning and friendship. All of those functions were well served by the conversations from which this special issue emerged a conference Grounding language in perception and (inter) action held at Gordon College in June 2009. The conference brought together researchers primarily from three research traditions dynamical systems theory distributed language and ecological psychology and each of these perspectives is reviewed and illustrated in this special issue. The particular focus of this issue though is the role of conversations in humans caring for each other and the ecosystems of which they are a part. Emergency medical care parents and children playing and students learning a second language are among the contexts of caring considered. Also considered are ways in which symbol systems emerge ways in which language extends and alters perception-action systems and ways in which infant-caregiver relations (i.e. first friendships) are constituted. The various articles explore how language is situated culturally embodied emergent and distributed (Zukow-Goldring this issue) how language is a crucial dimension of the extended phenotype of humans how language increases our ability to care for each other our common tasks and the (real or virtual) ecosystems we inhabit: and how language emerges as we coordinate and share perception and action skills.

LARSEN A-C. Nursing Inquiry 2012 19: 334344 Trappings of technology: casting palliative care nursing as legal relations Community palliative care nurses in Perth have joined the throng of healthcare workers relying on personal digital assistants (PDAs) to store access and send client information in real time. This paper is guided by Heideggers approach to technologies and Habermas insights into the role of law in administering social welfare programs to reveal how new ethical and legal understandings regarding patient information add to nursings professional responsibilities. This qualitative research interprets data from interviews with twenty community palliative care nurses about clients legal rights to informational privacy and confidentiality. It explores nurses views of their nursing responsibilities regarding clients legal rights liability issues bureaucratic monitoring and enforcement procedures. It concludes that nurses and clients are construed as legal subjects entrenched in legal relations that have magnified since these nurses began using PDAs in 2005/2006.;2012
Learning and dialogue may naturally engender feelings and expressions of uncertainty for a variety of reasons and purposes. Yet little research has examined how patterns of linguistic uncertainty are enacted and changed over time as students reciprocally influence one another and the dialogical system they are creating. This study describes the occurrence of uncertainty expressions of graduate students collaborating in computer-mediated discussions to negotiate and construct understandings of new concepts from course readings. We report on how often uncertainty was expressed in online synchronous and asynchronous discussions and the characteristics of its expression. We also explore the antecedents and consequences of such expression. Findings indicate that students expressed uncertainty often and in many ways and that such expression seemed to be integrated in a dynamic system of influences on the conversation. We conclude that the ability to deal with and express uncertainty appropriately is an important skill in online academic contexts that may be related to the intellectual work of students in the process of appropriating the discourse of their academic disciplines as they make meaning of scholarly texts.;2012
Many veterans returning from service in Afghanistan or Iraq suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or mild traumatic brain injury. Treating these conditions can be challenging because of high rates of relapse and associated memory impairments. We report on a pilot study that assessed the utility of mobile health (mHealth) technologies including personal digital assistant-based ecological momentary assessment and two-way interactive text (SMS) messaging for providing treatment feedback to clinicians encouraging and motivating veterans throughout treatment and monitoring participants for relapse after treatment discharge. The results of the pilot suggest that mHealth technologies are feasible adjuncts to traditional mental treatment in the veteran population. Additional work is needed to establish the degree of clinical and economic value.;2012
New clinical treatment concepts and the implementation of algorithms usually require extensive documentation for scientifical evaluation and quality assurance. A consequent electronic documentation approach potentially facilitates data integrity and availablity and decreases the amount of time spent with manual transfer from paper data into computer systems. The development and the components of the Heidelberg PDA-based Clinical Documentation Suite are described. This system allows electronic documentation and post-processing in a timely manner using an affordable standard Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). It features almost universal customizability to new documentation requirements and can be used with only minimal prior training. Initial experiences are reported and prospective improvement possibilities are discussed.;2012
Nowadays process-aware information systems (PAISs) are widely used for the management of administrative processes characterized by clear and well-defined structures. Besides those scenarios PAISs can be used also in mobile and pervasive scenarios where process participants can be only equipped with smart devices such as personal digital assistants. None of existing PAISs can be entirely deployed on smart devices making unfeasible its usage in highly mobile scenarios. This paper presents ROME4EU a mobile PAIS developed for being applied to the coordination of emergency operators and an extensive validation of the system both in term of performances and usability/acceptability by the users.

Objective: Conversational agency is our invented term that orients us to ways in which clients participate in therapeutic dialogues. In this study we examined how clients' conversational correctives and initiatives influenced collaborative therapeutic consultations. Methods: Thirty-five single-session lifestyle consultations were videotaped in which adult clients volunteered to discuss concerns of non-clinical severity with a counselor. We discursively microanalyzed excerpts where clients initiated topic shifts or corrected counselor misunderstandings and how counselors responded to them. Results: Clients were actively involved in co-managing conversational developments during the consultations. They influenced the content and course of the conversations with the counselors by correcting interrupting or speaking from positions contrary or unrelated to those of the counselors. Conclusion: Clients observably influenced the conversational agenda through their correctives and. initiatives if counselors were responsive during face-to-face consultations. Practice implications: Clinicians should demonstrate increased sensitivity and relational responsivity by intentionally engaging with clients' agentive contributions to consultative dialogues.

Objective: Early HIV testing and diagnosis are paramount for increasing treatment initiation among children necessary for their survival and improved health. However uptake of pediatric HIV testing is low in high-prevalence areas. We present data on attitudes towards pediatric testing from a nationally representative survey in Zimbabwe. Methods: All 18-24 year olds and a proportion of 25-49 year olds living in randomly selected enumeration areas from all ten Zimbabwe provinces were invited to self-complete an anonymous questionnaire on a personal digital assistant and 16719 people agreed to participate (75% of eligibles). Results: Most people think children can benefit from HIV testing (91%) 81% of people who looked after children know how to access testing for their children and 92% would feel happier if their children were tested. Notably 42% fear that if tested children may be discriminated against by some community members and 28% fear their children are HIV positive. People who fear discrimination against children who have tested for HIV are more likely than their counterparts to perceive their community as stigmatizing against HIV positive people (43% vs. 29%). They are also less likely to report positive attitudes to HIV themselves (49% vs. 74%). Only 28% think it is possible for children HIV-infected at birth to live into adolescence without treatment. Approximately 70% of people (irrespective of whether they are themselves parents) think HIV-infected children in their communities can access testing and treatment. Conclusions: Pediatric HIV testing is the essential gateway to prevention and care services. Our data indicate positive attitudes to testing children suggesting a conducive environment for increasing uptake of pediatric testing in Zimbabwe. However there is a need to better understand the barriers to pediatric testing such as stigma and discrimination and address the gaps in knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS in children.;2012
Objective: Physical activity (PA) is essential for successful aging and for the prevention and management of common chronic diseases. The empirical support for the beneficial effects of PA on vasomotor symptoms has however been mixed. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of acute aerobic exercise and daily PA on menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Methods: Community-dwelling midlife women (N = 121 age range 40-60 y) not using hormone therapy were recruited for a 15-day daily diary study. Women completed psychological cardiorespiratory fitness body composition and hormonal status screening followed by a 15-day prospective assessment in a real-life setting using a personal digital assistant. Participants also completed a 30-minute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise bout on a treadmill between days 5 and 8. Daily PA was assessed objectively through accelerometry and all symptomatic women (n = 92) completed two 24-hour Biolog sternal skin conductance recordings of hot flashes (HFs)-one at baseline and one immediately after treadmill exercise. Results: Both total objective (P = 0.054) and total subjective (P < 0.05) HFs decreased after the acute exercise bout. At the between-person level daily PA was not associated with self-reported HFs. However at the within-person level performing more moderate physical activity than usual was associated with more self-reported HFs in women with lower fitness levels. Conclusions: Moderate aerobic exercise decreases objective and subjective HFs 24 hours after exercise however in women with lower fitness levels more daily moderate PA leads to more self-reported symptoms.;2012
Objective: The last decade has seen the introduction of new technology which has transformed many aspects of our culture commerce communication and education. This study examined how medical teachers and learners are using mobile computing devices such as the iPhone in medical education and practice and how they envision them being used in the future. Design: Semistructured interviews were conducted with medical students residents and faculty to examine participants' attitudes about the current and future use of mobile computing devices in medical education and practice. A thematic approach was used to summarise ideas and concepts expressed and to develop an online survey. A mixed methods approach was used to integrate qualitative and quantitative findings. Setting and participants: Medical students residents and faculty at a large Canadian medical school in 2011. Results: Interviews were conducted with 18 participants ( 10 students 7 residents and 1 faculty member). Only 213 participants responded to the online survey ( 76 students 65 residents and 41 faculty members). Over 85% of participants reported using a mobile-computing device. The main uses described for mobile devices related to information management communication and time management. Advantages identified were portability flexibility access to multimedia and the ability to look up information quickly. Challenges identified included: superficial learning not understanding how to find good learning resources distraction inappropriate use and concerns about access and privacy. Both medical students and physicians expressed the view that the use of these devices in medical education and practice will increase in the future. Conclusions: This new technology offers the potential to enhance learning and patient care but also has potential problems associated with its use. It is important for leadership in medical schools and healthcare organisations to set the agenda in this rapidly developing area to maximise the benefits of this powerful new technology while avoiding unintended consequences.;2012
Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a personal digital assistant (PDA) on independent transitioning between activities in a day treatment centre for youth with high-functioning ASD. Methods: Within a multiple baseline design across four participants data were collected on participant's transitioning and staff's prompting behaviour. Intervention by staff consisted of one technical instruction session on use of the PDA and non-specific instruction following incorrect transitions while not using the PDA in the natural setting. Results: Analysis revealed a significant increase in percentage independent daily transitions which resulted from the independent use of the PDA. The change in staff's prompt use during intervention was mainly the result of a significant decrease in the use of non-specific prompts in correcting participant's transition behaviour. Conclusion: A brief intervention was effective in improving independent transitioning using a PDA. Findings are evaluated in light of their clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.;2012
Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of an Inpatient Diabetes Management Program (IDMP) on physician knowledge and inpatient glycemic control. Methods: Residents assigned to General Internal Medicine inpatient services were randomized to receive the IDMP (IDMP group) or usual education only (non-IDMP group). Both groups received an overview of inpatient diabetes management in conjunction with reminders of existing order sets on the hospital Web site. The IDMP group received print copies of the program and access to an electronic version for a personal digital assistant (PDA). A Diabetes Knowledge Test (DKT) was administered at baseline and at the end of the 1-month rotation. The frequency of hyperglycemia among patients under surveillance by each group was compared by using capillary blood glucose values and a dispersion index of glycemic variability. IDMP users completed a questionnaire related to the program. Results: Twenty-two residents participated (11 in the IDMP group and 11 in the non-IDMP group). Overall Diabetes Knowledge Test scores improved in both groups (IDMP: 69% +/- 1.7% versus 83% +/- 2.1% P = .003 non-IDMP: 76% +/- 1.2% versus 84% +/- 1.4% P = .02). The percentage of correct responses for management of corticosteroid-associated hyperglycemia (P = .004) and preoperative glycemic management (P = .006) improved in only the IDMP group. The frequency of hyperglycemia (blood glucose level > 180 mg/dL) and the dispersion index (5.3 +/- 7.6 versus 3.7 +/- 5.6 P = .2) were similar between the 2 groups. Conclusion: An IDMP was effective at improving physician knowledge for managing hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients treated with corticosteroids or in preparation for surgical procedures. Educational programs directed at improving overall health care provider knowledge for inpatient glycemic management may be beneficial however improvements in knowledge do not necessarily result in improved glycemic outcomes.

Objectives: Because audiometric evaluation symptom histories questionnaires and similar standard assessment tools may not adequately sample the effects of chronic tinnitus on day-to-day activities there is a need for alternative methodological approaches to study the impact of tinnitus on day-to-day life. An innovative methodological approach that has shown great promise in the study of chronic health problems characterized by reported temporal and/or situational variability in symptoms and distress is known as ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA involves the real-time measurement of states situational factors and symptoms by individuals as they go about their day-to-day activities. The objective of this pilot investigation was to explore the feasibility of using EMA methods to examine within-and between-day effects of tinnitus. Design: This study was conducted in three phases: (1) design and development of an EMA methodology that could be used to assess effects of tinnitus (2) refinement of the methodology through the use of two focus groups and (3) field-test the methodology with individuals who experienced bothersome tinnitus. For Phase 3 each of the 24 participants wore throughout their waking hours for 2 weeks a personal digital assistant that produced alerts four times a day. The alerts prompted participants to respond to 19 questions including 9 relating to situational and mood factors and 10 comprising the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory-Screening version (THI-S). To evaluate for potential reactive effects of performing the EMA protocol each participant completed the paper-and-pencil version of the full 25-item THI before and after the 2-week EMA period. Results: Participants responded to the alerts with a 90% compliance rate providing a total of 1210 completed surveys. At the time of their response participants indicated that they were in their house or apartment (67.7%) alone (50.2%) happy (50%) and calm (54.5%). Across most responses participants could hear their tinnitus (97%) and the loudness of their tinnitus averaged 4.7 on a 7-point increasing-loudness scale. The mean THI-S index score (out of a possible maximum 40 points for greatest tinnitus severity) was 17.0 (moderate self-perceived tinnitus handicap). Repeated THI-S index scores varied considerably both within and between participants. Mean 25-item THI scores were not significantly different before and after the EMA period suggesting little reactivity of the EMA. Conclusions: The high compliance rate positive feedback from participants lack of reactivity as a result of performing the EMA protocol and data collected indicate that EMA methodology is feasible with patients who have tinnitus. Outcome data obtained with this methodology cannot be obtained any other way because retrospective questionnaires cannot capture the day-to-day reactions. This methodology has the potential to provide more in-depth and accurate assessments of patients receiving therapy for tinnitus.;2012
Objectives: Measurement of outcomes has become increasingly important to assess the benefit of audiologic rehabilitation including hearing aids in adults. Data from questionnaires however are based on retrospective recall of events and experiences and often can be inaccurate. Questionnaires also do not capture the daily variation that typically occurs in relevant events and experiences. Clinical researchers in a variety of fields have turned to a methodology known as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess quotidian experiences associated with health problems. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using EMA to obtain real-time responses from hearing aid users describing their experiences with challenging hearing situations. Design: This study required three phases: (1) develop EMA methodology to assess hearing difficulties experienced by hearing aid users (2) make use of focus groups to refine the methodology and (3) test the methodology with 24 hearing aid users. Phase 3 participants carried a personal digital assistant 12 hr per day for 2 weeks. The personal digital assistant alerted participants to respond to questions four times a day. Each assessment started with a question to determine whether a hearing problem was experienced since the last alert. If yes then up to 23 questions (depending on contingent response branching) obtained details about the situation. If no then up to 11 questions obtained information that would help to explain why hearing was not a problem. Each participant completed the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE) both before and after the 2-week EMA testing period to evaluate for reactivity (exacerbation of self-perceived hearing problems that could result from the repeated assessments). Results: Participants responded to the alerts with a 77% compliance rate providing a total of 991 completed momentary assessments (mean = 43.1 per participant). A substantial amount of data were obtained with the methodology. It is important to note that participants reported a hearing problem situation since the last alert 37.6% of the time (372 responses). The most common problem situation involved face-to-face conversation (53.8% of the time). The next most common problem situation was telephone conversation (17.2%) followed by TV radio iPod etc. (15.3%) environmental sounds (9.7%) and movies lecture etc. (4.0%). Comparison of pre- and post-EMA mean HHIE scores revealed no significant difference (p > 0.05) indicating that reactivity did not occur for this group. It should be noted however that 37.5% of participants reported a greater sense of awareness regarding their hearing loss and use of hearing aids. Conclusions: Results showed participants were compliant gave positive feedback and did not demonstrate reactivity based on pre- and post-HHIE scores. We conclude that EMA methodology is feasible with patients who use hearing aids and could potentially inform hearing healthcare (HHC) services. The next step is to develop and evaluate EMA protocols that provide detailed daily patient information to audiologists at each stage of HHC. The advantages of such an approach would be to obtain real-life outcome measures and to determine within-and between-day variability in outcomes and associated factors. Such information at present is not available from patients who seek and use HHC services.;2012
Objectives: Patients with cancer who use complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) in conjunction with chemotherapy treatment are at risk of manifesting anticancer drug-CAM interactions (DCIs) which may lead to negative therapeutic outcomes. This article describes a novel iPhone application developed for the Mobile Internet called OncoRx-MI which identifies DCIs of single-agent and multiple-agent chemotherapy regimen (CReg) prescriptions. Methods: Drug- CAM- and DCI-related information was compiled from various hardcopy and softcopy sources and published literature from PubMed. Overall management plans for the CRegs were then developed. The iPhone Web documents were constructed using Adobe software and programming scripts and mounted onto a third-party server. DCI searches are based on CReg acronyms and OncoRx-MI is designed to fit the iPhone screen configuration for improved usability. A small usability study was also carried out and the user feedback presented. Results: OncoRx-MI is able to detect over 2700 interactions between 256 CRegs and 166 CAMs making up a total of over 4400 DCI pairs. The CAMs are classified into seven categories based on their uses in supportive care and non-cancer-related CAMs are also included. The majority of the DCIs are pharmacokinetic in nature (79%) involving the induction and inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isozymes and p-glycoprotein. Pharmacodynamic DCIs include hepatotoxicity (39%) altered corticosteroid efficacies (30%) and increased risks of hypoglycemia (4%) hypertensive crisis (2%) bleeding and serotonin syndrome (1% each). Conclusions: OncoRx-MI is the first mobile application of its kind that allows searching of DCIs for CRegs through 3G networks and is intended to improve pharmaceutical care of patients with cancer by assisting health care practitioners in managing CReg interactions in their clinical practices.;2012
Point-of-care access to current medical information is easily available to the practitioner through the use of smartphones iPads and other personal digital assistants. There are numerous mobile applications (apps) that provide easy-to-use and often well-referenced medical guidance for the infectious diseases practitioner. We reviewed 6 commonly utilized mobile apps available for handheld devices: the Emergency Medicine Residents' Association's (EMRA's) Antibiotic Guide Epocrates Deluxe Johns Hopkins Antibiotic Guide Sanford Guide the Medscape mobile app and the Infectious Diseases Compendium. We evaluated several basic infectious diseases topics (including but not limited to endocarditis vancomycin and Acinetobacter infection) and attempted to objectively score them for metrics that would help the provider determine which mobile app would be most useful for his or her practice. The Johns Hopkins Antibiotic Guide and the Sanford Guide had the highest cumulative scores whereas EMRA scored the lowest. We found that no single app will meet all of the needs of an infectious diseases physician. Each app delivers content in a unique way and would meet divergent needs for all practitioners from the experienced clinician to the trainee. The ability to rapidly access trusted medical knowledge at the point of care can help all healthcare providers better treat their patients' infections.;2012
Pronunciation errors may be caused by several different deviations from the target such as voicing intonation insertions or deletions of segments or that the articulators are placed incorrectly. Computer-animated pronunciation teachers could potentially provide important assistance on correcting all these types of deviations but they have an additional benefit for articulatory errors. By making parts of the face transparent they can show the correct position and shape of the tongue and provide audiovisual feedback on how to change erroneous articulations. Such a scenario however requires firstly that the learner's current articulation can be estimated with precision and secondly that the learner is able to imitate the articulatory changes suggested in the audiovisual feedback. This article discusses both these aspects with one experiment on estimating the important articulatory features from a speaker through acoustic-to-articulatory inversion and one user test with a virtual pronunciation teacher in which the articulatory changes made by seven learners who receive audiovisual feedback are monitored using ultrasound imaging.;2012
Purpose - This paper aims to describe a pilot at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for a chatbot that answers questions about the library and library resources. Design/methodology/approach - The chatbot was developed using a SQL database to store the question and answers using artificial intelligence mark-up language metadata. The user interface was built using PHP adapted from Program-O. The open source PHP program was modified to support better display and the launching of URLs within the chatbot screen. Database content was created by mining library websites for information and analyzing chat logs. Findings - The chatbot answers questions from a variety of users from around the world. It has attracted an unexpected number of social chatters which required some additional metadata to accommodate personal chatting and to guide questions back to the intent of the project. The majority of questions are directional or factual questions that Pixel can handle. The database proved to be practical to build and revise as library resources and personnel changed. Practical implications - The chathot provides a 24 hour seven day a week service that is consistent can be enhanced as resources services or staff change and provides a playful interface that engages users. It replaces complicated navigation systems and scrolling through search results with more targeted answers and has the ability to refer questions to librarians. Originality/value - Although chatbots have been around for several decades there is a scarcity of reports in published library literature about their use in libraries.;2012
Purpose: This article describes the development and implementation of integrated use of personal handheld devices (personal digital assistants PDAs) and high-fidelity simulation in an advanced health assessment course in a graduate family nurse practitioner (NP) program. A teaching tool was developed that can be utilized as a template for clinical case scenarios blending these separate technologies. Data sources: Review of the evidence-based literature including peer-reviewed articles and reviews. Conclusions: Blending the technologies of high-fidelity simulation and handheld devices (PDAs) provided a positive learning experience for graduate NP students in a teaching laboratory setting. Combining both technologies in clinical case scenarios offered a more real-world learning experience with a focus on point-of-care service and integration of interview and physical assessment skills with existing standards of care and external clinical resources. Faculty modeling and advance training with PDA technology was crucial to success. Implications for practice: Faculty developed a general template tool and systems-based clinical scenarios integrating PDA and high-fidelity simulation. Faculty observations the general template tool and one scenario example are included in this article.

Purpose: This study explored the impact of personal digital assistant (PDA) features users' perceptions and other factors that may have hindered PDA acceptability and usability as technology advances in e-health diabetes self-management. Study Design and Results: An ongoing study on PDA usage is set within the context of the advancements of Web 2.0 for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) self-management e-interventions. Advancements in technology as it relates to the future of T2DM mobile applications are discussed as possible deterrents of PDA acceptability and usability. Conclusions: This case study illustrates the importance of addressing factors that may impede the adoption of electronic devices intended for sustained health behavior change. Recognizing the importance of individual perception within the context of rapid technological advancements is imperative for designing future health interventions. Incorporating electronic devices that individuals are more inclined to utilize such as smartphones as the platform for health interventions is a promising strategy to improve acceptability and usability allowing researchers to more accurately assess the health benefits of self-management programs.;2012
Purpose: To examine daily-and event-level associations of substance use with occurrence of sex and condom nonuse among depressed youth. Methods: Depressed sexually active outpatients aged 15-22 years reported alcohol use marijuana use and sex on a personal digital assistant for 2 weeks. If they reported sex participants indicated partner type and condom use. Data were analyzed for participants who reported both substance use and sex events (N = 39) using generalized estimating equations. Daily-level models compared the likelihood of sex and of condom nonuse between days on which participants did or did not use substances. Event-level models examined the likelihood of sex in the 2 6 and 12 hours after substance use and the likelihood of condom nonuse if substances were used in the preceding 2 6 and 12 hours. Results: Participants reported 307 sex events (180 unprotected) and 391 substance use events on 572 days. Substance use was associated with increased odds of sex on the same day but not after adjusting for weekend. Depressed youth were less likely to have sex within 2 hours after substance use and more likely to have sex within 12 hours after marijuana use. There was no main effect of substance use on condom nonuse however there was a significant interaction such that on weekdays condom nonuse was less likely when substances were used within 6 hours before sex. Conclusions: The findings from this small predominantly female sample suggest that contextual factors not intoxication influence associations of substance use with sexual behavior in depressed youth.

Rationale and Objectives: Studies have highlighted the potential of handheld viewing devices for rapid diagnosis and increased smart-phone usage among physicians and radiologists is known as is the clinical applicability of hand-held devices for computed tomography (CT) spinal injury cases. Magnetic resonance (MR) however is the accepted gold standard for spinal imaging providing visualization of both ligament and spinal cord pathology. This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of the iPad the most probable alternative display device outside the radiology environment and financially viable alternative when reviewing emergency spinal MR images in comparison with secondary-class LCD devices in the case of the interpretation of CT and MR imaging examinations. Materials and Methods: In total 31 MR cases including both positives (n = 13) containing one of four possible presentations: spinal cord compression cauda equine syndrome spinal cord hemorrhage or spinal cord edema and controls (n = 18) were reviewed. Ziltron iPad software facilitated the display of cases and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Thirteen American Board of Radiology board-certified radiologists reviewed all cases on both displays. Standardized viewing conditions were maintained. Results: Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz multireader-multicase (DBM MRMC) analysis was performed including random readers/random cases fixed readers/random cases and random readers/fixed cases. No differences of statistical significance (P <=.05) could be found in terms of area under the curve sensitivity and specificity between the iPad and secondary-class display. Conclusion: The iPad performed with equal diagnostic accuracy when compared with the secondary-class LCD device after DBM MRMC analysis demonstrating the iPad as an option to aid initial review of MR spinal emergency cases.;2012
Recent research has shown that effective dialogue management can be achieved through the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. However past research on POMDP-based dialogue systems usually assumed the parameters of the decision process were known a priori. Themain contribution of this paper is to present a Bayesian reinforcement learning framework for learning the POMDP parameters online from data in a decision-theoretic manner. We discuss various approximations and assumptions which can be leveraged to ensure computational tractability and apply these techniques to learning observationmodels for several simulated spoken dialogue domains.;2012
Recent research has shown that negative emotional states of increased anxiety and sadness prospectively predict the occurrence of persecutory ideation but it is not known whether these findings extend to other subtypes of delusions. The current study explored whether these negative emotional states as well as hallucinations biased reasoning style (ie jumping to conclusions) and negative self-esteem prospectively predict the occurrence and various dimensions of delusions of control reference and grandiosity in real time as they occur in daily life. One hundred and thirty community-dwelling participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed laboratory measures and momentary self-reports generated by a personal digital assistant multiple times per day over 7 consecutive days. Analyses were time lagged allowing simultaneous examination of person-level and within-person time-varying relationships among the variables. Approximately half of the participants reported having at least one delusional experience during the week and approximately a quarter of those individuals reported experiencing all 3 delusion subtypes. Hallucinations were a significant predictor of the occurrence of delusions of control and reference over the subsequent hours of the same day but negative emotional states of anxiety and sadness were not. Negative self-esteem predicted the frequency of all 3 delusion subtypes during the week and a reasoning style characterized by reduced information gathering was a significant predictor of the frequency of delusions of control. Delusional dimensions of conviction distress and disruption had different associations with the variables tested for each delusion subtype.;2012
Reinforcement learning is now an acknowledged approach for optimizing the interaction strategy of spoken dialogue systems. If the first considered algorithms were quite basic (like SARSA) recent works concentrated on more sophisticated methods. More attention has been paid to off-policy learning dealing with the exploration-exploitation dilemma sample efficiency or handling non-stationarity. New algorithms have been proposed to address these issues and have been applied to dialogue management. However each algorithm often solves a single issue at a time while dialogue systems exhibit all the problems at once. In this paper we propose to apply the Kalman Temporal Differences (KTD) framework to the problem of dialogue strategy optimization so as to address all these issues in a comprehensive manner with a single framework. Our claims are illustrated by experiments led on two real-world goal-oriented dialogue management frameworks DIPPER and HIS.;2012
Reinforcement techniques have been successfully used to maximise the expected cumulative reward of statistical dialogue systems. Typically reinforcement learning is used to estimate the parameters of a dialogue policy which selects the system's responses based on the inferred dialogue state. However the inference of the dialogue state itself depends on a dialogue model which describes the expected behaviour of a user when interacting with the system. Ideally the parameters of this dialogue model should be also optimised to maximise the expected cumulative reward. This article presents two novel reinforcement algorithms for learning the parameters of a dialogue model. First the Natural Belief Critic algorithm is designed to optimise the model parameters while the policy is kept fixed. This algorithm is suitable for example in systems using a handcrafted policy perhaps prescribed by other design considerations. Second the Natural Actor and Belief Critic algorithm jointly optimises both the model and the policy parameters. The algorithms are evaluated on a statistical dialogue system modelled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process in a tourist information domain. The evaluation is performed with a user simulator and with real users. The experiments indicate that model parameters estimated to maximise the expected reward function provide improved performance compared to the baseline handcrafted parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Since its beginning in 1969 the Internet has grown rapidly especially over the past few years. Companies and organizations store more and more information about themselves on the Internet. Sometimes that information is not well organized. Other times the huge volume of available data makes useful information difficult to be found. The result is that users have to waste their time looking for what they want to know using the traditional menu-driven navigation and keyword search that websites provide. This is a critical issue because it decreases users interest about companies. In order to avoid this problem in this paper we propose a framework for designing virtual assistants which are considering first results an ideal alternative to help users find not only the information that they are looking for but also some related information which could be of the highest interest.

Studies have shown that natural language interfaces such as question answering and conversational systems allow information to be accessed and understood more easily by users who are unfamiliar with the nuances of the delivery mechanisms (e.g. keyword-based search engines) or have limited literacy in certain domains (e.g. unable to comprehend health-related content due to terminology barrier). In particular the increasing use of the web for health information prompts us to reexamine our existing delivery mechanisms. We present enquireMe which is a contextual question answering system that provides lay users with the ability to obtain responses about a wide range of health topics by vaguely expressing at the start and gradually refining their information needs over the course of an interaction session using natural language. enquireMe allows the users to engage in conversations about their health concerns a process that can be therapeutic in itself. The system uses community-driven question-answer pairs from the web together with a decay model to deliver the top scoring answers as responses to the users' unrestricted inputs. We evaluated enquireMe using benchmark data from WebMD and TREC to assess the accuracy of system-generated answers. Despite the absence of complex knowledge acquisition and deep language processing enquireMe is comparable to the state-of-the-art question answering systems such as START as well as those interactive systems from TREC.;2012
Tablet computers such as the iPad which have a large format improved graphic display resolution and a touch screen interface may have an advantage compared to existing mobile devices such as smartphones and laptops for viewing radiological images. We assessed their potential for emergency radiology teleconsultation by reviewing multi-image CT and MRI studies on iPad tablet computers compared to Picture Archival and Communication Systems (PACS) workstations. Annonymised DICOM images of 79 CT and nine MRI studies comprising a range of common on-call conditions reported on full-featured diagnostic PACS workstation by one Reporting Radiologist were transferred from PACS to three iPad tablet computers running OsiriX HD v 2.02 DICOM software and viewed independently by three reviewing radiologists. Structured documentation was made of major findings (primary diagnosis or other clinically important findings) minor findings (incidental findings) and user feedback. Two hundred and sixty four readings (88 studies read by three reviewing radiologists) were compared with 3.4 % (nine of 264) major discrepancies and 5.6 % (15 of 264) minor discrepancies. All reviewing radiologists reported favorable user experience but noted issues with software stability and limitations of image manipulation tools. Our results suggest that emergency conditions commonly encountered on CT and MRI can be diagnosed using tablet computers with good agreement with dedicated PACS workstations. Shortcomings in software and application design should be addressed if the potential of tablet computers for mobile teleradiology is to be fully realized.;2012
The emerging era of evidence-based practice emphasizes that human service agencies need to find effective and efficient means of training staff and implementing systems change based on scientific evidence. Additional advancements in technology use across populations and settings within the field have also served as a catalyst for the development of contemporary staff training techniques. Therefore the purpose of the current study was to train management-level staff employed at an agency for individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders to collect agency-wide data using personal digital assistant (PDA) data collection systems.

The first decade of the 21st century has seen tremendous improvements in mobile Internet and its technologies. The high traffic volume of services such as video conference and other real-time traffic applications are imposing a great challenge on networks. In the meantime demand for the use of mobile devices in computation and communication such as smart phones personal digital assistants and mobile-enabled laptops has grown rapidly. These services have driven the demand for increasing and guaranteeing bandwidth requirements in the network. A direction of this paper is in the case of resource reservation protocol (RSVP) over mobile IPv6 networks. There are numbers of proposed solutions for RSVP and quality of service provision over mobile IPv6 networks but most of them use advanced resource reservation. In this paper we propose a mathematical model to determine maximum end-to-end delay bound through intermediate routers along the network. These bounds are sent back to the home agent for further processing. Once the home agent receives maximum end-to-end delay bounds it calculates cumulative bound and compares this bound with the desired application end-to-end delay bound to make final decision on resource reservation. This approach improves network resource utilization.;2012
The goal of this study was to evaluate experimentally systematic instruction compared with trial-and-error learning (conventional instruction) applied to assistive technology for cognition (ATC) in a double-blind pre-test-post-test randomised controlled trial. Twenty-nine persons with moderate-severe cognitive impairments due to acquired brain injury (15 in systematic instruction group 14 in conventional instruction) completed the study. Both groups received 12 45-minute individual training sessions targeting selected skills on the Palm Tungsten E2 personal digital assistant (PDA). A criterion-based assessment of PDA skills was used to evaluate accuracy fluency/efficiency maintenance and generalisation of skills. There were no significant differences between groups at immediate post-test with regard to accuracy and fluency. However significant differences emerged at 30-day follow-up in favour of systematic instruction. Furthermore systematic instruction participants performed significantly better at immediate post-test generalising trained PDA skills when interacting with people other than the instructor. These results demonstrate that systematic instruction applied to ATC results in better skill maintenance and generalisation than trial-and-error learning for individuals with moderate-severe cognitive impairments due to acquired brain injury. Implications study limitations and directions for future research are discussed.;2012
The optimal way to build speech understanding modules depends on the amount of training data available. When only a small amount of training data is available effective allocation of the data is crucial to preventing overfitting of statistical methods. We have developed a method for allocating a limited amount of training data in accordance with the amount available. Our method exploits rule-based methods for when the amount of data is small which are included in our speech understanding framework based on multiple model combinations i.e. multiple automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules and multiple language understanding (LU) modules and then allocates training data preferentially to the modules that dominate the overall performance of speech understanding. Experimental evaluation showed that our allocation method consistently outperforms baseline methods that use a single ASR module and a single LU module while the amount of training data increases.;2012
The physical environment is thought to influence walking however daily variations in perceived environment have received little attention. The current study sought to examine if key within-person factors (i.e. implementation intentions social support affect and self-efficacy) would be associated with walking and if perceived access to supportive environments (e.g. access to nice walking paths) and perceived environmental barriers (e.g. bad weather and safety issues) were uniquely associated with walking after controlling for other constructs. Participants (N = 14 50.0% men 78.6% White M age = 59.4 +/- 6.4) were in the intervention arm of an 8-week controlled trial promoting walking via personal digital assistants. Participants completed electronic surveys twice a day (total entries = 804) in which they reported brisk walking levels and psychosocial and environmental factors. Multilevel modelling was used to examine within-person variations in constructs as determinants of walking. Results suggested that daily variations in implementation intentions social support and positive affect were positively associated with walking. Further perceived access to supportive environments though not perceived environmental barriers was positively associated with walking after controlling for other constructs (p < 0.05). Future research should explore intervention components that target context-specific information about perceived access to supportive environments as part of a broader perspective on intervention development.;2012
The process of Natural Language Generation for a Conversational Agent translates some semantic language to its surface form expressed in natural language. In this paper we are going to show a Case Based Reasoning technique which is easily extensible and adaptable to multiple domains and languages that generates coherent phrases and produces a natural outcome in the context of a Conversational Agent that maintains a dialogue with the user.

The purpose of this investigation was to compare fine motor task completion when using video models presented on a smaller screen size (Personal Digital Assistant) compared to a larger laptop screen size. The investigation included four high school students with autism spectrum disorders and mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and used an adapted alternating treatments design with baseline extended baseline comparison and final treatment conditions. Results showed that although independent completion of fine motor office related tasks increased under both procedures use of video models on the larger screen resulted in a higher percentage of correct responses across all four students.;2012
The study reported in this article concerns the questions what and how fourth-year medical students can learn from a series of cases that have a similar underlying problem. This question is crucial in the theoretical sense as it looks at mechanisms of updating and improving knowledge structures which are conjectured to consist of 'illness scripts' which integrate knowledge about enabling conditions for a disease the underlying fault and the consequences or signs and symptoms of the disease. It was found that much learning was implicit whilst students explicitly paid attention to variations in enabling conditions and consequences which led to improvement of these knowledge components. Integration of biomedical knowledge into the fault component was however hampered by lack of knowledge and by misconceptions that students were unable to debug in the absence of learning resources or detailed feedback. The practical importance of this study stems from its close parallels to the learning situation in clinical practice where patients (or cases) are the most important learning resources whilst feedback on results is often minimal. Implications and possible solutions for clinical teaching are discussed.;2012
The users of Ambient Intelligence systems expect an intelligent behavior from their environment receiving adapted and easily accessible services and functionality. This can only be possible if the communication between the user and the system is carried out through an interface that is simple (i.e. which does not have a steep learning curve) fluid (i.e. the communication takes place rapidly and effectively) and robust (i.e. the system understands the user correctly). Natural language interfaces such as dialog systems combine the previous three requisites as they are based on a spoken conversation between the user and the system that resembles human communication. The current industrial development of commercial dialog systems deploys robust interfaces in strictly defined application domains. However commercial systems have not yet adopted the new perspective proposed in the academic settings which would allow straightforward adaptation of these interfaces to various application domains. This would be highly beneficial for their use in AmI settings as the same interface could be used in varying environments. In this paper we propose a new approach to bridge the gap between the academic and industrial perspectives in order to develop dialog systems using an academic paradigm while employing the industrial standards which makes it possible to obtain new generation interfaces without the need for changing the already existing commercial infrastructures. Our proposal has been evaluated with the successful development of a real dialog system that follows our proposed approach to manage dialog and generates code compliant with the industry-wide standard VoiceXML.;2012
There are many Web-based platforms where people could share user-generated content such as reviews posts blogs and tweets. However online communities and social networks are expanding so rapidly that it is impossible for people to digest all the information. To help users obtain information more efficiently both the interface for data access and the information representation need to be improved. An intuitive and personalized interface such as a dialogue system could be an ideal assistant which engages a user in a continuous dialogue to garner the user's interest assists the user via speech-navigated interactions harvests and summarizes the Web data as well as presenting it in a natural way. This work therefore aims to conduct research on a universal framework for developing a speech-based interface that can aggregate user-generated content and present the summarized information via speech-based human-computer interactions. The challenge is two-fold. Firstly how to interpret the semantics and sentiment of user-generated data and aggregate them into structured yet concise summaries? Secondly how to develop a dialogue modeling mechanism to present the highlighted information via natural language? This work explores plausible approaches to tackling these challenges. We will investigate a parse-and-paraphrase paradigm and a sentiment scoring mechanism for information extraction from unstructured user-generated content. We will also explore sentiment-involved opinion summarization and dialogue modeling approaches for aggregated information representation. A restaurant-domain prototype system has been implemented for demonstration.;2012
This article promotes a point of view on human interaction in terms of dialogical systems. The approach draws on recent so-called third wave developments in cognitive science. After an introduction to three waves in cognitive science and their counterparts in linguistics the article is placed in a tradition that is ecological embodied and distributed. Its specific take on human interaction pursues these perspectives by claiming that language can neither be reduced to social rules in the micro-sociological domain nor to biological properties of the individual being. As an alternative to these two positions a theory of dialogical systems is developed on the basis of current thinking within the enactive program (e.g. De Jaegher and Di Paolo 2007) the distributed language movement (e.g. Cowley 2011b) and values-realizing theory (e.g. Hodges 2009). Dialogical systems are systems of co-present human beings engaged in interactivity that bring forth situated behavioural coordination (or a communicative structural coupling). Dialogical systems however have emergent properties irreducible to individual actions or microsocial norms. Among the emergent properties one find a tendency to establish and uphold equilibriums that balance between various at times opposing values and tensions. This approach is exemplified through an analysis of a real-life conversation between a mother and a health visitor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012
This cross-sectional study explores physicians' attitudes and beliefs about the use of personal digital assistant (PDA) in the context of other health information technology (HIT) use and HIT-based applications safety in ambulatory care practices. The relationship of PDA use and patient safety is also explored. Ambulatory care physicians in Nebraska and South Dakota were surveyed from July to November of 2007 using a modified Dillman technique. Respondents were in one of three groups: PDA Users (those using a PDA for patient care) Other Technology Users (those not using a PDA but using other technologies for patient care) and Non-Users (those not using any technology for patient care). PDAs are used by 43% of responding physicians who tend to be younger and salaried. PDA Users exposed to PDAs during training continued use in practice. PDA Users believed the device enabled them to provide more efficient and better care reduce errors and improve patient safety.;2012
This electronic momentary assessment study explored the relationship between flow and pain intensity and examined whether flow is an optimal experience for people with chronic pain. Adults with chronic pain (n = 30) were signaled randomly seven times daily during 1 week to respond to a flow questionnaire via personal digital assistant. The participants responded to 718 questionnaires from 1447 beeps (response rate = 49.6%). Results indicated that participants were most commonly at home doing self-care activities with family or alone. Participants experienced flow 34.9% apathy 44.6% relaxation 11.6% and anxiety 8.9% of the sampled time. Participants' mean concentration self-esteem motivation and potency scores were highest in flow compared to the other three states. Separate one-way between-groups analyses of variance comparing concentration (F(3) = 11.85 p < .001) self-esteem (F(3) = 11.98 p < .001) motivation (F(3) = 29.29 p < .001) positive affect (F(3) = 2.89 p = .035) potency (F(3) = 19.88 p < .001) and pain intensity (F(3) = 1.39 p = .245) scores across the four states showed a significant overall effect on all comparisons except pain intensity and positive affect.;2012
This paper describes a substantial effort to build a real-time interactive multimodal dialogue system with a focus on emotional and nonverbal interaction capabilities. The work is motivated by the aim to provide technology with competences in perceiving and producing the emotional and nonverbal behaviors required to sustain a conversational dialogue. We present the Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) scenario as a setting which seems particularly suited for the study of emotional and nonverbal behavior since it requires only very limited verbal understanding on the part of the machine. This scenario allows us to concentrate on nonverbal capabilities without having to address at the same time the challenges of spoken language understanding task modeling etc. We first report on three prototype versions of the SAL scenario in which the behavior of the Sensitive Artificial Listener characters was determined by a human operator. These prototypes served the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of the SAL scenario and allowed us to collect data required for building system components for analyzing and synthesizing the respective behaviors. We then describe the fully autonomous integrated real-time system we created which combines incremental analysis of user behavior dialogue management and synthesis of speaker and listener behavior of a SAL character displayed as a virtual agent. We discuss principles that should underlie the evaluation of SAL-type systems. Since the system is designed for modularity and reuse and since it is publicly available the SAL system has potential as a joint research tool in the affective computing research community.;2012
This paper introduces a new model of attentional state in task-oriented human-machine interaction. It integrates three lines of research: (i) neurocognitive understanding of the focus of attention in working memory (ii) the notion of attention related to the theory of discourse structure in the field of computational linguistics and (iii) investigation of a corpus that comprises recordings of spontaneous speech-based human-machine interaction. The underlying idea was to make a computationally appropriate representation of attentional information that imitates the function of a focus of attention in human perception. The introduced model addresses both the research questions of storage and processing of attentional information. Finally the paper illustrates the model for concrete interaction domains and discusses its implementation within a prototype spoken dialogue system.;2012
This paper investigates face authentication based access control solutions for camera-equipped mobile devices. A new hierarchical correlation based face authentication (HCFA) scheme is proposed which suits resource-constrained mobile devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants. The idea of HCFA is conducting a partial correlation output peak analysis (analyze the relationship between each cross-correlation output peak generated from selected sub-regions of a face) in conjunction with conventional direct cross-correlation methods. The experimental results on the public domain database demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieved better performance than that of the conventional direct correlation based schemes. Furthermore HCFA was implemented on the Nokia S60 CLDC emulator using Java ME (previously J2ME) programming technology in order to test the applicability and implementability. The test results show that the proposed algorithm is implementable on mobile devices. It not only shortens processing time but also reduces resource demand significantly compared with the direct correlation algorithms. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;2012
This paper presents a new hybrid dialog management framework that integrates a statistical ranking algorithm into an example-based dialog management approach for chat-like dialogs. The proposed model uses ranking features that consider various aspects of dialogs including the relative importance of speech acts dialog history sequences and the causal relationships among speech acts and slot-filling states. The ranking algorithm enables one to aggregate these feature scores systematically and to generate diverse system responses. Additionally the model provides detailed feedback by analyzing the causal relationships among speech acts and predicting the user's possible intentions associated with a given dialog states. Simulated experimental results demonstrate that our approach is effective for task-oriented dialogs and chat-like dialogs. Additionally a case study using elementary school students implies that the proposed system can be used for language learning purposes in addition to task-oriented services.;2012
This paper presents a novel framework for constructing a Semantic-Based Conversational Agent (SCAF). Traditional conversational agents (CA) interpret scripts using structural patterns of sentences which require the script writer to consider every possible permutation that a user may send as input to the CA. This is a time-consuming process which takes no consideration of semantic content working solely with the structural form of the sentence. Furthermore this has proven to be a high maintenance task that can produce some unforeseen consequences when modifying or introducing new patterns into a script. This invariably results in the script writer reassessing the entire script to prevent such occurrences. Different script writers possess differing levels of skill and as such this can prove to be an exasperating task. The proposed SCAF interprets scripts consisting of natural language sentences by means of a semantic sentence similarity measure. User input is measured semantically against the natural language sentences of the context in order to respond with an appropriate output. Such scripting is effortless and alleviates the burden of the traditional pattern-scripted methodologies. Evaluation of the framework has highlighted its potential and shown improvements on traditional CAs.;2012
This paper presents a user localization system based on the fusion of visual information and sound source localization implemented on a social robot called Maggie. One of the main requisites to obtain a natural interaction between human-human and human-robot is an adequate spatial situation between the interlocutors that is to be orientated and situated at the right distance during the conversation in order to have a satisfactory communicative process. Our social robot uses a complete multimodal dialog system which manages the user-robot interaction during the communicative process. One of its main components is the presented user localization system. To determine the most suitable allocation of the robot in relation to the user a proxemic study of the human-robot interaction is required which is described in this paper. The study has been made with two groups of users: children aged between 8 and 17 and adults. Finally at the end of the paper experimental results with the proposed multimodal dialog system are presented.;2012
This paper presents an assessment of automatically generated multimodal referring expressions as produced by embodied conversational agents in a virtual world. The algorithm used for this purpose employs general principles of human motor control and cooperativity in dialogues that can be parameterised so as to vary the precision of the pointing gestures and the amount of linguistic information included in the referring expressions. The study assessed how native speakers of English and Japanese perceived three different algorithmic outputs for multimodal referring behaviour in terms of understandability human-likeness and a social practice (selling). Results show that users generally prefer mobile agents that are economical in their linguistic descriptions to stationary verbose agents. They also show the need for further calibration of the algorithm to accommodate the differences between the two groups. In addition to the detailed description of the set up and results of the study the paper discusses implications for the design and use of agents methodological issues that arose while conducting the cross-cultural study and directions for future work.

This paper proposes a multimodal communication method for human-friendly robot partners based on various types of sensors. First we explain informationally structured space to extend the cognitive capabilities of robot partners based on environmental systems. Next we discuss the suitable measurement range for recognition technologies of touch interface voice recognition human detection gesture recognition and others. Based on the suitable measurement ranges we propose an integration method to estimate human behaviors based on the human detection using color image and 3-D distance information and gesture recognition by the multilayered spiking neural network using the time series of human-hand positions. Furthermore we propose a conversation system to realize the multimodal communication with a person. Finally we show several experimental results of the proposed method and discuss the future direction of this research.;2012
This research examined the full range of tasks and activities that design engineers perform how their working time is distributed among these and how these issues influence their satisfaction with their work. Seventy-eight design engineers each carried a personal digital assistant (PDA) for twenty working days. Once every hour they entered data into their PDAs concerning their current work tasks and satisfaction levels using a work sampling approach. Work tasks were explored from multiple perspectives yielding highly extensive and detailed results. A key finding was that design engineers' work involves considerable technical engineering work (62.92% of time) and socially collaborative work (40.37% of time). The results were discussed in terms of their implications for academic theory and organizational practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012
This study assesses the possibility of using handheld devices to increase commuter safety for adults with cognitive impairments. The system uses a commercial off-the-shelf PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) with built-in GPS (Global Positioning System) enabling individuals to respond to unexpected situations without staff intervention. This study was performed according to an ABAB reversal design in which A represented the baseline and B represented intervention phases. The data show that participants' awareness of anomalies significantly increased in target response thus improving trip safety during intervention phases. Practical and developmental implications of the findings are discussed.;2012
This study compared data obtained from throat and head microphone evaluations of conversational speech intensity in a group of 17 individuals with hypophonia caused by Parkinson's disease (PD) and 14 control participants. The two microphones were connected to a personal digital assistant (PDA) system that recorded the participants'. conversational speech intensity during five randomly presented levels of multi-talker background noise (50 55 60 65 and 70 dB SPL). Both the throat and head microphone data were associated with a significant increase in speech intensity with increases in the intensity of the background noise. In contrast only the head microphone data were associated with a significant difference between reduced intensity of the PD participants and higher intensity of the control participants. A linear regression analysis comparing the throat and head data found a significant difference between the slope values for the PD and control participants. It is proposed that these slope results may be related to differences in how the PD and control participants used the size of mouth opening to modulate speech intensity. In general the results of this study suggest that for conversations that are recorded in various levels of background noise a head microphone placed close to the mouth may be a more sensitive instrument for measuring hypophonia in PD than a throat microphone.;2012
This study examined health care provider and caretaker perceptions of electronic Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (eIMCI) in diagnosing and treating childhood illnesses. The authors conducted semi-structured interviews among caretakers (n = 20) and health care providers (n = 11) in the Pwani region of Tanzania. This qualitative study was nested within a larger quantitative study measuring impact of eIMCI on provider adherence to IMCI protocols. Caretakers and health care workers involved in the larger study provided their perceptions of eIMCI in comparison with the conventional paper forms. One health care provider from each participating health center participated in qualitative interviews 20 caretakers were selected from 1 health center involved in the quantitative study. Interviews were conducted in Swahili and lasted 5-10 min each. Providers expressed positive opinions of eIMCI noting that the personal digital assistants were faster and easier to use than were the paper forms and encouraged adherence to IMCI procedures. Caretakers also held a positive view of eIMCI noting improved service from providers more thorough examination of their child and a perception that providers who used the personal digital assistants were more knowledgeable. Research indicates widespread nonadherence to IMCI guidelines suggesting improved methods for implementing IMCI are necessary. The authors conclude that eIMCI represents a promising method for improving health care delivery because it improves health care provider and caretaker perception of the clinical encounter. Further investigation into this technology is warranted.;2012
This study introduces emotional feedback as a construct in an acceptance model. It explores the effect of emotional feedback on behavioral intention to use Computer Based Assessment (CBA). A female Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) with empathetic encouragement behavior was displayed as emotional feedback. More specifically this research aims at investigating the effect of Emotional Feedback on Behavioral Intention to Use a CBA system Perceived Playfulness Perceived Usefulness Perceived Ease of Use Content and Facilitating Conditions. An appropriate survey questionnaire was completed by 134 students. Results demonstrate that Emotional Feedback has a direct effect on Behavioral Intention to Use a CBA system and on other crucial determinants of Behavioral Intention. Finally the proposed acceptance model for computer based assessment extended with the Emotional Feedback variable explains approximately 52% of the variance of Behavioral Intention.

This study investigated the effects of simultaneous written text on the comprehension of spoken English as a foreign language when the text is presented with the aid of a personal digital assistant (PDA) as a learning tool. Eighty-seven university students majoring in applied foreign languages were randomly assigned to either listening with auditory materials only or listening with identical and concurrent written text. Performance efficiency was used to provide a better indicator of the quality of learning. The results revealed that for learners with lower English levels the presence of concurrent written text elicited higher performance efficiency in the immediate recall task of the English listening comprehension. However the beneficial effect of the written text did not extend to the subsequent auditory-only passage. The study suggested that when using mobile devices as training tools the provision of written text facilitates the acquisition of information but not the schema construction of the English listening comprehension skill.;2012
This study was undertaken to determine the PDA functionalities for a problem-based learning (PBL) medical curriculum at the Graduate School of Medicine (GSM) the University of Wollongong (UOW). The study determines the factors/aspects of incorporating PDAs and the attitudes of stakeholders regarding the use of PDAs in such a PBL-based medical curriculum. In-depth interviews were designed and conducted with medical faculty the medical education technology team and honorary medical academics. Four major PDA functionalities were identified these being: clinical-log reference communication and general functions. Two major aspects for the incorporation of PDAs into the PBL-medical curriculum at the UOW were determined from the interviews these being technical and practical aspects. There is a potential for PDAs to be incorporated into the PBL-medical curricula at the UOW. However a clear strategy needs to be defined as to how best to incorporate PDAs into PBL-medical curricula with minimal impact on students as well as financial and resource implications for the GSM.;2012
This work addresses natural language dialog planning for an intelligent web filtering model which lets the user filter search results obtained by a traditional search engine and assists them to find what they really are looking for. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches a stochastic planning model is proposed for a web-driven dialog system which uses Conditional Random Fields to predict next dialog moves. Experiments with real web users and different interaction settings show the promise of the approach to web-based adaptive planning aimed at information filtering. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This work presents a new approach to the synthesis of Spanish Sign Language (LSE). Its main contributions are the use of a centralized relational database for storing sign descriptions the proposal of a new input notation and a new avatar design the skeleton structure of which improves the synthesis process. The relational database facilitates a highly detailed phonologic description of the signs that include parameter synchronization and timing. The centralized database approach has been introduced to allow the representation of each sign to be validated by the LSE National Institution FCNSE. The input notation designated HLSML presents multiple levels of abstraction compared with current input notations. Redesigned input notation is used to simplify the description and the manual definition of LSE messages. Synthetic messages obtained using our approach have been evaluated by deaf users in this evaluation a maximum recognition rate of 98.5% was obtained for isolated signs and a recognition rate of 95% was achieved for signed sentences.

Varenicline is believed to work in part by reducing craving responses to smoking cues and by reducing general levels of craving however these hypotheses have never been evaluated with craving assessed in the natural environments of treatment-seeking smokers. Ecological momentary assessment procedures were used to assess the impact of varenicline on cue-specific and general craving in treatment-seeking smokers prior to quitting. For 5 weeks prior to quitting 60 smokers carried personal digital assistants that assessed their response to smoking or neutral cues. During week 1 (baseline) participants did not receive medication during weeks 2-4 (drug manipulation) participants were randomized to receive varenicline or placebo during week 5 (standard therapy) all participants received varenicline. Craving was assessed before each cue cue-specific craving and attention to cue were assessed after each cue. During all phases smoking cues elicited greater craving than neutral cues the magnitude of this effect declined after the first week. General craving declined across each phase of the study. Relative to the placebo condition varenicline was associated with a greater decline in general craving over the drug manipulation phase. Varenicline did not significantly attenuate cue-specific craving during any phase of the study. Smoking cues delivered in the natural environment elicited strong craving responses in treatment-seeking smokers but cue-specific craving was not affected by varenicline administered prior to the quit attempt. These findings suggest that the clinical efficacy of varenicline is not mediated by changes in cue-specific craving during the pre-quit period of treatment-seeking smokers.;2012
We describe a structured theory-driven training programme for individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment in the use of emerging commercial technology. We demonstrate its application to 10 individuals with memory impairment from a variety of aetiologies. A within-subject ABAB multi-case experimental design was used to evaluate the impact of personal digital assistant or smartphone use on day-to-day memory functioning at baseline immediately post-intervention at return to baseline and at short-term follow-up (range = 3-8 months). An errorless fading-of-cues protocol enabled all participants to acquire the skill set necessary to operate their PDA or smartphone independently. All 10 individuals showed robust improvement in day-to-day functioning post-intervention as quantified across a number of ecologically valid questionnaire and task-based measures. This was further corroborated by family members with whom six of the participants resided. These findings demonstrate that individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment can acquire the skills necessary to independently flexibly and broadly apply commercial technology to support their everyday memory functioning. Moreover the findings confirm that the gap between individuals with memory impairment and potent emerging technology can be closed by the application of a systematic theory-driven training programme.;2012
We developed a new type of mobile teleradiology system using an ultramobile PC (UMPC) for web-based remote viewing over a wireless network. We assessed the diagnostic performance of this system for abdominal CT interpretation. Performance was compared with an emergency department clinical monitor using a DICOM viewer. A total of 100 abdominal CT examinations were presented to four observers. There were 56 examinations showing appendicitis and 44 which were normal. The observers viewed the images using a UMPC display and an LCD monitor and rated each examination on a five-point scale. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to test for differences. The sensitivity and specificities of all observers were similarly high. The average area under the ROC curve for readings performed on the UMPC and the LCD monitor was 0.959 and 0.976 respectively. There were no significant differences between the two display systems for interpreting abdominal CTs. The web-based mobile teleradiology system appears to be feasible for reading abdominal CTs for diagnosing appendicitis and may be valuable in emergency teleconsultation.;2012
We present a computational model that generates listening behaviour for a virtual agent. It triggers backchannel signals according to the user's visual and acoustic behaviour. The appropriateness of the backchannel algorithm in a user-agent situation of storytelling has been evaluated by naive participants who judged the algorithm-ruled timing of backchannels more positively than a random timing. The system can generate different types of backchannels. The choice of the type and the frequency of the backchannels to be displayed is performed considering the agent's personality traits. The personality of the agent is defined in terms of two dimensions extroversion and neuroticism. We link agents with a higher level of extroversion to a higher tendency to perform more backchannels than introverted ones and we link neuroticism to less mimicry production and more response and reactive signals sent. We run a perception study to test these relations in agent-user interactions as evaluated by third parties. We find that the selection of the frequency of backchannels performed by our algorithm contributes to the correct interpretation of the agent's behaviour in terms of personality traits.;2012
We present a series of studies of affirmative cue words-a family of cue words such as okay or alright that speakers use frequently in conversation. These words pose a challenge for spoken dialogue systems because of their ambiguity: They may be used for agreeing with what the interlocutor has said indicating continued attention or for cueing the start of a new topic among other meanings. We describe differences in the acoustic/prosodic realization of such functions in a corpus of spontaneous task-oriented dialogues in Standard American English. These results are important both for interpretation and for production in spoken language applications. We also assess the predictive power of computational methods for the automatic disambiguation of these words. We find that contextual information and final intonation figure as the most salient cues to automatic disambiguation.;2012
We present an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) that incorporates a context-sensitive mechanism for handling user barge-in. The affective ECA engages the user in social conversation and is fully implemented. We will use actual examples of system behaviour to illustrate. The ECA is designed to recognise and be empathetic to the emotional state of the user. It is able to detect react quickly to and then follow up with considered responses to different kinds of user interruptions. The design of the rules which enable the ECA to respond intelligently to different types of interruptions was informed by manually analysed real data from human-human dialogue. The rules represent recoveries from interruptions as two-part structures: an address followed by a resumption. The system is robust enough to manage long multi-utterance turns by both user and system which creates good opportunities for the user to interrupt while the ECA is speaking.;2012
We propose a collaborative filtering (CF) model to predict user satisfaction in SDS evaluation. Inspired by the use of CF in recommendation systems where a user's preference for a new item is assume to resemble that for similar items rated previously we adapt the idea to predict user evaluations of unrated dialogs based on the ratings received by similar dialogs. Ratings of dialogs are gathered by crowdsourcing through Amazon Mechanical Turk. A reference baseline is provided by a linear regression model (LRM) based on the PARADISE framework. We present two versions of the CF model. First the item-based collaborative filtering model (ICFM) clusters rated dialogs and builds an LRM for each cluster. The rating of an unseen dialog is predicted by the LRM of its most similar cluster. Second the extended ICFM (EICFM) separates dialog features into user-related and system-related groups to build LRMs for these separately. Experimental results on dialogs from the Let's Go! system show both ICFM and EICFM can significantly improve the proportion of variability explained by the LRM. We also demonstrate the generalizability of the CF model to a new dialog corpus from the systems in the Spoken Dialog Challenge (SDC) 2010.;2012
We study the affective states exhibited by students using an intelligent tutoring system for Scatterplots with and without an interactive software agent Scooter the Tutor. Scooter the Tutor had been previously shown to lead to improved learning outcomes as compared to the same tutoring system without Scooter. We found that affective states and transitions between affective states were very similar among students in both conditions. With the exception of the neutral state no affective state occurred significantly more in one condition over the other. Boredom confusion and engaged concentration persisted in both conditions representing both virtuous cycles and vicious cycles that did not appear to differ by condition. These findings imply that-although Scooter is well liked by students and improves student learning outcomes relative to the original tutor-Scooter does not have a large effect on students' affective states or their dynamics.;2012
Whereas traditional dialog systems operate on the top ASR hypothesis statistical dialog systems claim to be more robust to ASR errors by maintaining a distribution over multiple hidden dialog states. Recently these techniques have been deployed publicly for the first time making empirical measurements possible. In this paper we analyze two of these deployments. We find that performance was quite mixed: in some cases statistical techniques improved accuracy with respect to the top speech recognition hypothesis in other cases accuracy was degraded. Investigating degradations we find the three main causes are (non-obviously) inaccurate parameter estimates poor confidence scores and correlations in speech recognition errors. Overall the results suggest fundamental weaknesses in the formulation as a generative model and we suggest alternatives as future work.;2012
With naturalistic dialogue management a spoken dialogue system behaves as a human would under similar conditions. This paper reports on an experiment to develop naturalistic clarification strategies for noisy speech recognition in the context of spoken dialogue systems. We collected a wizard-of-Oz corpus in which human wizards with access to a rich set of clarification actions made clarification decisions online based on human-readable versions of system data. The experiment compares an evaluation of calls to a baseline system in a library domain with calls to an enhanced version of the system. The new system has a clarification module based on the wizard data that is a decision tree constructed from three machine-learned models. It replicates the wizards' ability to ground partial understandings of noisy input and to build upon them. The enhanced system has a significantly higher rate of task completion greater task success and improved efficiency.;2012
With the advancement of pharmaceutical development drug interactions have become increasingly complex. As a result a computer-based drug interaction search system is required to organize the whole of drug interaction data. To overcome problems faced with the existing systems we developed a drug interaction search system using a hash table which offers higher processing speeds and easier maintenance operations compared with relational databases (RDB). In order to compare the performance of our system and MySQL RDB in terms of search speed drug interaction searches were repeated for all 45 possible combinations of two out of a group of 10 drugs for two cases: 5604 and 56040 drug interaction data. As the principal result our system was able to process the search approximately 19 times faster than the system using the MySQL RDB. Our system also has several other merits such as that drug interaction data can be created in comma-separated value (CSV) format thereby facilitating data maintenance. Although our system uses the well-known method of a hash table it is expected to resolve problems common to existing systems and to be an effective system that enables the safe management of drugs.;2012
Yehliu Geopark mGuiding is an Android application that can perform several tasks related to guiding tourists. The improvement of the application is based on a user evaluation of the former version of the Yehliu Geopark tour guiding system which was designed to be executed on a personal digital assistant device. The user evaluation data were acquired from a questionnaire survey comprising a sample of 101 respondents and were processed using ridits analysis and importance-performance analysis. Results revealed the tourists' preferences for the tour guiding system. The application was redesigned based on the tourists' preferences. The new features of the application include: (1) a Geopark map that is attractive and easy to read (2) augmented reality (AR) with camera and global positioning system (GPS) functions (3) user-friendly guiding interface of scenic spots. The application integrates tracking and location functions using GPS coordinates multi-media guiding (descriptions of scenic spots videos photographs and audio presentations) suggested tour selection and searching using AR. The Yehliu Geopark mGuiding system offers a user-friendly interface that the tourists can use on their own smartphone for a complete tour.;2012
A network mobility (NEMO)-based vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a new approach to integrate the NEMO protocol with VANETs. This integration supports communications between roadside units (RSUs) and vehicles and provides Internet access through public hotspots located inside public transportation systems such as buses trains and shuttles. Passengers inside these public transportation systems enjoy full Internet access by using different mobile network nodes (MNNs) such as cell phones and personal digital assistants. However due to the open nature of wireless network environments physical-layer attackers can easily localize the MNNs by measuring their received signal strength (RSS) through positioning schemes such as the triangulation scheme. In this paper we modify obfuscation i.e. concealment and power variability ideas and propose a new physical-layer location privacy scheme i.e. the fake point-cluster-based scheme to prevent attackers from localizing users inside NEMO-based VANET hotspots. The proposed scheme involves fake-point-and cluster-based subschemes and its goal is to confuse the attackers by increasing the estimation errors of their RSSs measurements and hence preserving MNNs' location privacy. Using correctness accuracy and certainty metrics we show that the fake point-cluster-based scheme achieves higher MNN's location privacy when the number of network grid points in the hotspot decreases. In addition our extensive simulations show that the fake point-cluster-based scheme achieves 23% and 37% decreases in the average sender's power and the MNN-AP route path length respectively compared with the fake-point subscheme.;2013
A pedagogic conversational agent (PCA) can be defined as a computer system that interacts with the student in natural language assuming the role of the instructor a student or a companion. It can have a personality and can generate different sentences according to the agent or the student mood. Empathy with the students' feelings seems to increase their motivation to study. However the influence of the agent personality and role as well as the students' opinion is still unclear. Therefore in this article it is explored with the help of a field experiment for the first time how these factors can affect the interaction of children with PCAs and their opinions according to an anonymous and voluntary opinion questionnaire and some personal interviews.;2013
A series of imitation games involving 3-participant (simultaneous comparison of two hidden entities) and 2-participant (direct interrogation of a hidden entity) were conducted at Bletchley Park on the 100th anniversary of Alan Turing's birth: 23 June 2012. From the ongoing analysis of over 150 games involving (expert and non-expert males and females adults and child) judges machines and hidden humans (foils for the machines) we present six particular conversations that took place between human judges and a hidden entity that produced unexpected results. From this sample we focus on features of Turing's machine intelligence test that the mathematician/code breaker did not consider in his examination for machine thinking: the subjective nature of attributing intelligence to another mind.;2013
A spoken dialogue system (SDS) interacts with its user in a spoken natural language. It interprets user speech input and responds to the user. User speech in a spoken natural language may be ambiguous. A challenge in building an SDS is dealing with ambiguity. Without good abilities for disambiguation an SDS can hardly have meaningful and smooth dialogues with its user in practical applications. The existing techniques for disambiguation are mainly based on statistical knowledge about language use. In practical situations such knowledge alone is inadequate. In our research we develop a new disambiguation technique which is based on application of knowledge about user activity behavior in addition to knowledge about language use. The technique is named MUBOD standing for modeling user behavior online for disambiguation. The core component of MUBOD is an online reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to learn the knowledge and apply the knowledge for disambiguation. In this paper we describe the technique and its implementation and present and analyze some initial experimental results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2013
A virtual museum guide agent that uses human relationship-building behaviors to engage museum visitors is described. The computer animated agent named Tinker uses nonverbal conversational behavior empathy social dialogue reciprocal self-disclosure and other relational behavior to establish social bonds with users and encourage continued interaction and repeated visits. Tinker describes exhibits in the museum gives directions and discusses technical aspects of her own implementation. Tinker also recognizes returning visitors through biometric analysis of their hand shapes and dialogue cues. Results from two experiments using Tinker are described. In the first 29 returning visitors are randomized to interact with the agent with the biometric identification turned on or off. In the second experiment 1607 visitors are randomized to interact with versions of Tinker that have relationship-building behavior turned on or off. Results indicate that the use of relational behavior leads to significantly greater engagement by museum visitors measured by session length number of sessions and self-reported attitude as well as learning gains as measured by a knowledge test compared to the same agent that does not use relational behavior. Implications for museum exhibits and intelligent tutoring systems are discussed.;2013
A wideband internal antenna that is composed of a coupled feeding part and four branch lines is presented.The proposed antenna can operate within two wide bands of 0.640.99 GHz and 1.652.85 GHz which cover 11 service bands including LTE 700/2300/2500 AMPS800 GSM900 DCS1800 PCS UMTS WiBro2350 ISM/Bluetooth and WLAN for the 4G mobile phone. The antenna could be available not only for future 4G service but also for current 2G/3G services. This internal antenna is fabricated within the limits of a 65 x 11 x 7 mm3 volume and suitable for smart phones or personal digital assistant (PDA) applications. The measured results are in agreement with the simulation. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 54:513516 2013 View this article online at wileyonlinelibrary.com.

Accurate dietary assessment is an essential foundation of research in nutritional epidemiology. Due to the weaknesses in current methodology attention is turning to strategies that automate the dietary assessment process to improve accuracy and reduce the costs and burden to participants and researchers. 'My Meal Mate' (MMM) is a smartphone application designed to support weight loss. The present study aimed to validate the diet measures recorded on MMM against a reference measure of 24 h dietary recalls. A sample of fifty volunteers recorded their food and drink intake on MMM for 7 d. During this period they were contacted twice at random to conduct 24 h telephone recalls. Daily totals for energy (kJ) and macronutrients recorded on MMM were compared against the corresponding day of recall using t tests for group means and Pearson's correlations. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the agreement between the methods. Energy (kJ) recorded on MMM correlated well with the recalls (day 1: r 0.77 (95% CI 0.62 0.86) day 2: r 0.85 (95% CI 0.74 0.91)) and had a small mean difference (day 1 (MMM 2 recall): -68 kJ/d (95% CI -553 418 kJ) (-16 kcal/d 95% CI -127 100 kcal) day 2 (MMM - recall): -441 kJ/d (95% CI -854 229 kJ) (-105 kcal/d 95% CI -204 27 kcal)). Bland-Altman analysis showed wide limits of agreement between the methods: -3378 to 3243 kJ/d (-807 to 775 kcal/d) on day 1. At the individual level the limits of agreement between MMM and the 24 h recall were wide however at the group level MMM appears to have potential as a dietary assessment tool.;2013
Adolescent consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has increased drastically with detrimental effects such as weight gain weakened bones dental caries and associated higher levels of type II diabetes in this population. While in the clinical setting rural family nurse practitioner (FNP) students using Kellogg-funded Smart Phones screened adolescents aged 13 to 17 years for SSB consumption in the previous 24 hours. Adolescents initially were provided with a pamphlet and related oral teaching concerning SSBs by the FNP students as well as a water bottle to encourage healthy fluid intake. Screening SSB information was loaded onto Smart Phones which resulted in immediate access by the primary investigator sometimes even hundreds of miles distant. After 30 days FNP students completed follow-up phone interviews to reassess SSB consumption in the previous 24 hours. Results concerning decreased SSB consumption were statistically significant. Additionally Smart Phones were instrumental in high-speed data transfer. Both advantages and disadvantages were encountered when using this evolving technology.;2013
Affective robots and embodied conversational agents require convincing facial expressions to make them socially acceptable. To be able to virtually generate facial expressions we need to investigate the relationship between technology and human perception of affective and social signals. Facial landmarks the locations of the crucial parts of a face are important for perception of the affective and social signals conveyed by facial expressions. Earlier research did not use that kind of technology but rather used analogue technology to generate point-light faces. The goal of our study is to investigate whether digitally extracted facial landmarks contain sufficient information to enable the facial expressions to be recognized by humans. This study presented participants with facial expressions encoded in moving landmarks while these facial landmarks correspond to the facial-landmark videos that were extracted by face analysis software from full-face videos of acted emotions. The facial-landmark videos were presented to 16 participants who were instructed to classify the sequences according to the emotion represented. Results revealed that for three out of five facial-landmark videos (happiness sadness and anger) participants were able to recognize emotions accurately but for the other two facial-landmark videos (fear and disgust) their recognition accuracy was below chance suggesting that landmarks contain information about the expressed emotions. Results also show that emotions with high levels of arousal and valence are better recognized than those with low levels of arousal and valence. We argue that the question of whether these digitally extracted facial landmarks are a basis for representing facial expressions of emotions is crucial for the development of successful humanrobot interaction in the future. We conclude by stating that landmarks provide a basis for the virtual generation of emotions in humanoid agents and discuss how additional facial information might be included to provide a sufficient basis for faithful emotion identification.;2013
Although the link between exercise and body image is well documented the considerable inter-individual variability in this relationship has been largely ignored. Therefore the aim of the present study was to test the contributions of key body image and exercise-related moderators (age body mass index (BMI) exercise frequency trait body dissatisfaction internalisation of appearance standards and body surveillance tendencies) in predicting variability in the exercise-body satisfaction relationship. Thirty-seven undergraduate women completed a questionnaire containing the above trait-based measures and then carried a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) for a 7-day period. Participants were instructed to use the PDA to self-report their state body satisfaction immediately following an exercise session and also when the PDA signalled at each of six random intervals throughout the day. Multilevel modelling revealed a bi-directional relationship between exercise and state body satisfaction. Moreover post-exercise increases in state body satisfaction were strongest for individuals who were younger and engaged in regular exercise and weakest for individuals with high BMI and/or the tendency to compare their appearance with others. These findings highlight potential limits on the efficacy of exercise-based therapy for body image disturbances.;2013
Animated characters are beginning to be used as pedagogical tools as they have the power to capture students' attention and foster their motivation for discovery and learning. However in order for them to be widely employed and accepted as a learning resource they must be easy to use and friendly. In this paper we present an architecture that facilitates building interactive pedagogical chatbots that can interact with students in natural language. Our proposal provides a modular and scalable framework to develop such systems efficiently. Additionally we present Geranium a system that helps children to appreciate and protect their environment with an interactive chatbot developed following our scheme.;2013
Background Situation awareness (SA) is a human factor of critical importance to patient safety. Simulation training aims to examine and debrief human factors however SA cannot be directly observed. This has led to the development of SA measurement tools. The Situation Present Assessment Method (SPAM) measures SA in real-time without the need to pause the scenario. The SPAM process involves the delivery of queries to the participant who must answer them accurately and quickly. The latency between the query being asked and answer being received represents SA. Method Two query delivery procedures are described in the literature: query delivery by telephone and in person. These procedures were piloted in simulation teaching with final-year medical students. The scenarios were videotaped and reviewed by the investigators to evaluate each procedure. Our evaluation of the existing SPAM procedures led us to adapt the method by developing a bespoke application which delivers queries via a personal digital assistant (PDA) calculates the latency data and presents it to the instructor. Results Presented by telephone queries tended to disrupt the 'flow' of the simulation. The 'in person' procedure was not disruptive however participants found it difficult to distinguish queries from other dialogue. The PDA represented a compromise between these two techniques: generating data without disrupting the scenario. Conclusions The use of SPAM is feasible in clinical simulation. By using handheld technology SA data are made available to the instructor for use in debrief this expands the utility of SPAM to the field of medical education.;2013
Background. Risk scores are simplified linear formulas for predicting mortality or other adverse outcomes at the bedside without personal digital assistants or calculators. Although risk scores are available for valve surgery they do not predict short-term mortality (within 30 days of surgery) after hospital discharge. Methods. New York's Cardiac Surgery Reporting System 2007 to 2009 data were matched to vital statistics data to identify valve surgery with and without concomitant coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery deaths occurring in the index admission or within 30 days after the procedure in any location. Risk scores were created to easily predict these outcomes by modifying more complicated logistic regression models. Results. There were 13455 isolated valve surgery patients and 8373 valve/CABG surgery patients in the study. The respective in-hospital/30-day mortality rates were 4.03% and 6.60%. There are 11 risk factors comprising the isolated valve surgery score with risk factor scores ranging from 1 to 8 and the highest observed total score is 28. There are 14 risk factors comprising the valve/CABG surgery score with risk factor scores ranging from 1 to 6 and the highest observed total score is 19. The scores accurately predicted mortality in 2007 to 2009 as well as in 2004 to 2006 and were strongly correlated with complications and length of stay. Conclusions. The risk scores that were developed provide quick and accurate estimates of patients' chances of short-term mortality after cardiac valve surgery.

Background: A challenge in intensive obesity treatment is making care scalable. Little is known about whether the outcome of physician-directed weight loss treatment can be improved by adding mobile technology. Methods: We conducted a 2-arm 12-month study (October 1 2007 through September 31 2010). Seventy adults (body mass index >25 and <= 40 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]) were randomly assigned either to standard-of-care group treatment alone (standard group) or to the standardand connective mobile technology system (1 mobile group). Participants attended biweekly weight loss groups held by the Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic. The + mobile group was provided personal digital assistants to self-monitor diet and physical activity they also received biweekly coaching calls for 6 months. Weight was measured at baseline and at 3- 6- 9- and 12-month follow-up. Results: Sixty-nine adults received intervention (mean age 57.7 years 85.5% were men). A longitudinal intent-to-treat analysis indicated that the + mobile group lost a mean of 3.9 kg more (representing 3.1% more weight loss relative to the control group 95% CI 2.2-5.5 kg) than the standard group at each postbaseline time point. Compared with the standard group the + mobile group had significantly greater odds of having lost 5% or more of their baseline weight at each postbaseline time point (odds ratio 6.5 95% CI 2.5-18.6). Conclusions: The addition of a personal digital assistant and telephone coaching can enhance short-term weight loss in combination with an existing system of care. Mobile connective technology holds promise as a scalable mechanism for augmenting the effect of physiciandirected weight loss treatment.

Background: A personal digital assistant (PDA) is a multifunctional information and communication tool allowing nursing students to keep up to date with expanding health related knowledge. Objectives: This study was aimed at exploring nursing students' experience of using a PDA in clinical practice. Method: In this intervention study nursing students (n=67) used PDAs during a period of 15 weeks replied to questionnaires and participated in focus group interviews. Results: The PDA was found to support nursing students in clinical practice and to have the potential to be a useful tool with benefits for both the patients and for the students. The PDA was regarded as useful and was presumed to imply increased confidence and time savings and contribute to improved patient safety and quality of care. Conclusions: With available mobile technology nursing students would be able to access necessary information independent of time and place. Therefore it is important that stakeholders and educators facilitate the use of PDAs to support nursing students during their clinical practice in order to prepare them for their future work and to continuously improve the safety and quality of healthcare.

Background: For years emerging infectious diseases have appeared worldwide and threatened the health of people. The emergence and spread of an infectious-disease outbreak are usually unforeseen and have the features of suddenness and uncertainty. Timely understanding of basic information in the field and the collection and analysis of epidemiological information is helpful in making rapid decisions and responding to an infectious-disease emergency. Therefore it is necessary to have an unobstructed channel and convenient tool for the collection and analysis of epidemiologic information in the field. Methodology/Principal Findings: Baseline information for each county in mainland China was collected and a database was established by geo-coding information on a digital map of county boundaries throughout the country. Google Maps was used to display geographic information and to conduct calculations related to maps and the 3G wireless network was used to transmit information collected in the field to the server. This study established a decision support system for the response to infectious-disease emergencies based on WebGIS and mobile services (DSSRIDE). The DSSRIDE provides functions including data collection communication and analyses in real time epidemiological detection the provision of customized epidemiological questionnaires and guides for handling infectious disease emergencies and the querying of professional knowledge in the field. These functions of the DSSRIDE could be helpful for epidemiological investigations in the field and the handling of infectious-disease emergencies. Conclusions/Significance: The DSSRIDE provides a geographic information platform based on the Google Maps application programming interface to display information of infectious disease emergencies and transfers information between workers in the field and decision makers through wireless transmission based on personal computers mobile phones and personal digital assistants. After a 2-year practice and application in infectious disease emergencies the DSSRIDE is becoming a useful platform and is a useful tool for investigations in the field carried out by response sections and individuals. The system is suitable for use in developing countries and low-income districts.;2013
Background: In settings where sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV prevalence is high the postpartum period is a time of increased biological susceptibility to pregnancy related sepsis. Enabling women living with HIV to avoid unintended pregnancies during the postpartum period can reduce vertical transmission and maternal mortality associated with HIV infection. We describe family planning (FP) practices and fertility desires of HIV-positive and HIV-negative postpartum women in Swaziland. Methods: Data are drawn from a baseline survey of a four-year multi country prospective cohort study under the Integra Initiative which is measuring the benefits and costs of providing integrated HIV and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in Kenya and Swaziland. We compare data from 386 HIV-positive women and 483 HIV-negative women recruited in Swaziland between February and August 2010. Data was collected on hand-held personal digital assistants (PDAs) covering fertility desires mistimed or unwanted pregnancies and contraceptive use prior to their most recent pregnancy. Data were analysed using Stata 10.0. Descriptive statistics were conducted using the chi square test for categorical variables. Measures of effect were assessed using multivariate fixed effects logistic regression model accounting for clustering at facility level and the results are presented as adjusted odds ratios. Results: Majority (69.2%) of postpartum women reported that their most recent pregnancy was unintended with no differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women: OR: 0.96 (95% CI) (0.70 1.32). Although there were significant differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women who reported that their previous pregnancy was unwanted (20.7% vs. 13.5% p = 0.004) when adjusted this was not significant OR: 1.43 (0.92 1.91). 47.2% of HIV-positive women said it was mistimed compared to 52.5% OR: 0.79 (0.59 1.06). 37.9% of all women said they do not want another child. Younger women were more likely to have unwanted pregnancies: OR: 1.12 (1.07 1.12) while they were less likely to have mistimed births OR: 0.82 (0.70 0.97). Those with tertiary education were less likely to have unwanted or mistimed pregnancies OR: 0.30 (0.11 0.86). Half of HIV-positive women and more than a third of HIV-negative women reported that they had been using a FP method when they became pregnant with no differences between the groups: OR: 1.61 (0.823.41). Only short-acting methods were available to these women before the most recent pregnancy and available during the postpartum visit. One fifth of all women received an FP method during the current visit. Among the four fifths who did not receive a method 17.3% reported they were already using a method or were breastfeeding. HIV-positive women were more likely to have already started a method than HIV-negative women (20% vs. 15% p = 0.089). Conclusion: There are few differences overall between the experiences of both HIV-positive and negative women in terms of FP experiences unintended pregnancy and services received during the early postpartum period in Swaziland. Women attending postpartum facilities are receiving satisfactory care. Access to a wider range of effective methods is urgently needed if high levels of unintended pregnancy are to be reduced among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women living in Swaziland.;2013
Background: Increasing healthcare costs related to lifestyle-related chronic diseases require new solutions. Research on self-management tools is expanding and many new tools are emerging. Recording food intake is a key functionality in many of these tools. Nutrition monitoring is a relevant method to gain an overview of factors influencing health. However keeping a food diary often constitutes a challenge for a patient and developing a user-friendly and useful electronic food diary is not straightforward. Purpose: To gain insight into the existing approaches to recording food intake and to analyze current functionalities and input methods. Methods: We searched digital libraries vendor markets and social networks focusing on nutrition. Selection criteria were publications written in English and patient-oriented tools that offered recording of food intake or nutrition. The system properties that we searched for were types of data types of terminal target population and types of reports and sharing functionalities. We summarized the properties based on their frequency in the reviewed sample. Results: 31 publications met the selection criteria. The majority of the identified food recording systems (67%) facilitated entry of food type and the consumed quantity of food 16% of the systems were able to record more than one type of data. The three most frequent target populations were people with obesity diabetes and overweight. Mobile phones were used as terminals in 35% of the cases personal computers (PCs) in 29% and personal digital assistants in 23%. Only 10% supported both PCs and mobile phones. Data sharing was provided by 71% and reports by 51% of the systems. We searched for apps in Google Play and the Apple Store and tested 45 mobile applications that stored food intake data of which 62% supported recording of types of food 24% recording of carbohydrate intake and 15% recording of calorie intake. The majority of the mobile applications offered some kind of reports and data sharing mainly via All of the tested social-network-enabled applications supported access from a personal computer and a mobile phone search in a food database reports graphical presentation listing of favorite foods overview of own meals and entering of consumed food type and quantity. Conclusion: The analyzed apps reflected a variety of approaches to recording food intake and nutrition using different terminals - mostly mobile phones (35%) followed by PCs (29%) and PDAs (23%) for older studies designed mainly for users with obesity (45%) diabetes mellitus (42%) and overweight (32%) or people who want to stay healthy (10%). The majority of the reviewed applications (67%) offered only input of food type and quantity. All approaches (n=31) except for two relied on manual input of data either by typing or by selecting a food type from a database. The exceptions (n=2) used a barcode scanning function. Users of mobile phone applications were not limited to data recording but could view their data on the screen and send it via email. The tested web applications offered similar functionalities for recording food intake. The systems studied provided some degree of personalization: users can access some systems via PCs or mobile phones and they can choose among various types of data input content for recording food intake. Many functions such as search in a food database reports graphical presentation listing of favorite foods and overview of the user's own meals are optimized to simplify the recording process and save time. Data sharing and reports are common features of the reviewed systems. However none use the user's recorded food history to make suggestions on new nutritional intake during the food recording process. This may be an area for future research.

BACKGROUND: Mobile devices (eg smartphones tablet computers) have become ubiquitous and subsequently there has been a growth in mobile applications (apps). Concurrently mobile devices have been integrated into health care practice due to the availability and quality of medical apps. These mobile medical apps offer increased access to clinical references and point-of-care tools. However there has been little identification of mobile medical apps suitable for the practice of pharmacy. OBJECTIVE: To address the shortage of recommendations of mobile medical apps for pharmacists in daily practice. DATA SOURCES: Mobile medical apps were identified via the iTunes and Google Play Stores via the Medical app categories and key word searches (eg drug information medical calculators). In addition reviews provided by professional mobile medical app review websites were used to identify apps. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Mobile medical apps were included if they had been updated in the previous 3 months were available in the US used evidence-based information or literature support had dedicated app support and demonstrated stability. Exclusion criteria included apps that were not available in English had advertisement bias used nonreferenced sources were available only via an institution-only subscription and were web-based portals. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-seven mobile apps were identified and reviewed that involved general pharmacy practice including apps that involved drug references clinical references medical calculators laboratory references news and continuing medical education and productivity. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile medical apps have a variety of features that are beneficial to pharmacy practice. Individual clinicians should consider several characteristics of these apps to determine which are suitable to incorporate into their daily practice.;2013
Background: Numerous validation studies have examined the TEMPS-A in both clinical and nonclinical samples. However the majority of these studies utilized cross-sectional assessments in laboratory or clinical settings. The present study is the first to examine the expression of affective temperaments in daily life using experience sampling methodology (ESM). Methods: 138 participants completed the TEMPS-A and received a personalized digital assistant that signaled them eight times daily for one week to complete questionnaires that assessed affect cognition behavior sense of self and social interaction. Results: As expected cyclothymic/irritable temperament was positively associated with negative affect risky behavior and restlessness and was negatively associated with positive affect and preference to be with others in daily life. In contrast hyperthymic temperament was associated with positive affect fullness of thought doing many and exciting things grandiosity and preference to be with others in daily life. Dysthymic temperament was modestly associated with worry and was positively associated with trouble concentrating fullness of thought and a preference for social contact. Cross-level interactions indicated that cyclothymic/irritable temperament was associated with elevated stress reactivity in daily life. Limitations: ESM data collection was limited to one week. Longer assessment periods might better capture the cyclical nature of affective temperaments. Conclusions: This was the first study to examine affective temperaments in daily life. The findings offer further validation of the TEMPS-A as well as the maladaptive nature of the cyclothymic/irritable temperament. Published by Elsevier B.V.;2013
Background: Patients with cancer are particularly susceptible to drug interactions (Dls) but the extent of the problem has received limited attention. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of interactions with anticancer agents in a group of cancer patients. Methods: The study was performed in a Belgian teaching hospital. One hundred and twenty-two patients with solid malignancies were included. A comprehensive drug history was performed by a clinical pharmacist. Three renowned DI compendia were used to identify Dls. Results: Forty-one potential interactions involving an anticancer agent and considered to be clinically significant were identified among 25% of patients. The anticancer drugs mostly involved were cisplatin and methotrexate and the most frequent co-medications involved were vitamin K antagonists proton pump inhibitors and diuretics. In the majority of cases the potential adverse consequence was increased toxicity of the anticancer agent and/or of the co-medication. Less than 10% of Dls were identified by the three compendia. Conclusions: Preventive measures should be taken to avoid increased toxicity or decreased efficacy of the drugs. Most of the time this simply involves surveillance of biological or clinical parameters. Collaboration with a clinical pharmacist may be useful for the prescribing physician.

Background: Television viewing is an important modifiable risk factor for childhood obesity. However valid methods for measuring children's TV viewing are sparse and few studies have included Latinos a population disproportionately affected by obesity. The goal of this study was to test the reliability and convergent validity of four TV viewing measures among low-income Latino preschool children in the United States. Methods: Latino children (n = 96) ages 3-5 years old were recruited from four Head Start centers in Houston Texas (January 2009 to June 2010). TV viewing was measured concurrently over 7 days by four methods: (1) TV diaries (parent reported) (2) sedentary time (accelerometry) (3) TV Allowance (an electronic TV power meter) and (4) Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) on personal digital assistants (parent reported). This 7-day procedure was repeated 3-4 weeks later. Test-retest reliability was determined by intraclass correlations (ICC). Spearman correlations (due to nonnormal distributions) were used to determine convergent validity compared to the TV diary. Results: The TV diary had the highest test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.82 p < 0.001) followed by the TV Allowance (ICC = 0.69 p < 0.001) EMA (ICC = 0.46 p < 0.001) and accelerometry (ICC = 0.36-0.38 p < 0.01). The TV Allowance (r = 0.45-0.55 p < 0.001) and EMA (r = 0.47-0.51 p < 0.001) methods were significantly correlated with TV diaries. Accelerometer-determined sedentary minutes were not correlated with TV diaries. The TV Allowance and EMA methods were significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.48-0.53 p < 0.001). Conclusions: The TV diary is feasible and is the most reliable method for measuring US Latino preschool children's TV viewing.;2013
Betty's Brain is an open-ended learning environment in which students learn about science topics by teaching a virtual agent named Betty through the construction of a visual causal map that represents the relevant science phenomena. The task is complex and success requires the use of metacognitive strategies that support knowledge acquisition causal map construction and progress monitoring. Previous research has established that middle school students struggle at such tasks without proper scaffolding and feedback. In Betty's Brain this feedback is provided by Betty and Mr. Davis another virtual agent designed to provide guidance and suggestions as students work. This paper discusses our implementation of contextualized conversational (CC) feedback and then presents the results of an experimental study exploring the effects of this feedback in two 8th-grade science classrooms. The results illustrate some advantages of the CC feedback in comparison with a baseline dialogue mechanism that presents similar strategies in a non-conversational non-contextualized form. While both groups showed significant pre-to-post test learning gains the difference in learning gains between the groups was not statistically significant. However students who received CC feedback more often performed actions in accordance with the advised strategies and they created higher quality causal maps.;2013
Context Migraine headaches are common debilitating underdiagnosed and undertreated and medications are not always effective. Research has shown that acupuncture may be an effective and safe adjuvant or alternative migraine treatment. Objective The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether a standardized set of acupuncture points when used to deliver treatment over a predefined period of time could reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines. Design This is a prospective interventional study using set point acupuncture for migraines. Setting The study took place at Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center in Johnstown PA USA. Participants Participants were 59 individuals with a diagnosis of migraine. Intervention Acupuncture was administered 2 x/wk for 4 wks followed by 1 x/wk for 4 more wks using one set of acupoints. Outcome Measures Participants collected daily headache diaries and migraine quality-of-life measurements on a personal digital assistant for 12 wks before starting the acupuncture intervention. Participants continued to record the frequency and intensity of their migraines during the intervention and for an additional 12 wks beyond the intervention. The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) were completed 4 x during the study: 12 wks prior to the start of the intervention immediately prior to the first acupuncture treatment at the end of treatment and 12 wks after the end of treatment. Results When preintervention measurements were compared to postintervention measurements migraine frequency and pain intensity showed a significant decrease (alpha = 0.05) after acupuncture intervention. Results had not returned to the preintervention baseline even 12 wks after the last acupuncture session. Acupuncture significantly influenced migraine frequency and intensity in the study's participants when preintervention measurements were compared to postintervention measurements. Conclusions These results indicate that not only did acupuncture decrease both the frequency and intensity of migraines but also the benefit had not subsided for 12 wks after the final acupuncture session. Validated survey measurements used to assess migraine impact on quality of life showed statistically significant improvement over baseline.;2013
Despite the increasing importance of digital games game accessibility has not yet received enough attention. As a consequence it is unclear how to design games that are engaging and usable also for people with disabilities. This work analyses perceived usability entertainment and overall experience provided by three interfaces for blind people with different gaming habits: (1) a keyboard navigation system (2) a sonar and (3) a conversational interface. Data collected from a preliminary experience suggests that the three interfaces could be used for games although (3) seems a better choice for occasional gamers and novice users and (2) for regular and frequent gamers or users seeking new challenges.;2013
Detecting user affect automatically during real-time conversation is the main challenge towards our greater aim of infusing social intelligence into a natural-language mixed-initiative High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) audio control spoken dialog agent. In recent years studies on affect detection from voice have moved on to using realistic non-acted data which is subtler. However it is more challenging to perceive subtler emotions and this is demonstrated in tasks such as labeling and machine prediction. This paper attempts to address part of this challenge by considering the role of user satisfaction ratings and also conversational/dialog features in discriminating contentment and frustration two types of emotions that are known to be prevalent within spoken human-computer interaction. However given the laboratory constraints users might be positively biased when rating the system indirectly making the reliability of the satisfaction data questionable. Machine learning experiments were conducted on two datasets users and annotators which were then compared in order to assess the reliability of these datasets. Our results indicated that standard classifiers were significantly more successful in discriminating the abovementioned emotions and their intensities (reflected by user satisfaction ratings) from annotator data than from user data. These results corroborated that: first satisfaction data could be used directly as an alternative target variable to model affect and that they could be predicted exclusively by dialog features. Second these were only true when trying to predict the abovementioned emotions using annotator's data suggesting that user bias does exist in a laboratory-led evaluation. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

During recent years conversational agents have become a solution to provide straightforward and more natural ways of retrieving information in the digital domain. In this article we present an agent-based dialog simulation technique for learning new dialog strategies and evaluating conversational agents. Using this technique the effort necessary to acquire data required to train the dialog model and then explore new dialog strategies is considerably reduced. A set of measures has also been defined to evaluate the dialog strategy that is automatically learned and to compare different dialog corpora. We have applied this technique to explore the space of possible dialog strategies and evaluate the dialogs acquired for a conversational agent that collects monitored data from patients suffering from diabetes. The results of the comparison of these measures for an initial corpus and a corpus acquired using the dialog simulation technique show that the conversational agent reduces the time needed to complete the dialogs and improve their quality thereby allowing the conversational agent to tackle new situations and generate new coherent answers for the situations already present in an initial model.;2013
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a way of collecting data in people's natural environments in real time and has become very popular in social and health sciences. The emergence of personal digital assistants has led to more complex and sophisticated EMA protocols but has also highlighted some important drawbacks. Modern cell phones combine the functionalities of advanced communication systems with those of a handheld computer and offer various additional features to capture and record sound pictures locations and movements. Moreover most people own a cell phone are familiar with the different functions and always carry it with them. This paper describes ways in which cell phones have been used for data collection purposes in the field of social sciences. This includes automated data capture techniques for example geolocation for the study of mobility patterns and the use of external sensors for remote health-monitoring research. The paper also describes cell phones as efficient and user-friendly tools for prompt manual data collection that is by asking participants to produce or to provide data. This can either be done by means of dedicated applications or by simply using the web browser. We conclude that cell phones offer a variety of advantages and have a great deal of potential for innovative research designs suggesting they will be among the standard data collection devices for EMA in the coming years.;2013
Emotion in audio-voice signals as synthesized by text-to-speech (TTS) technologies was investigated to formulate a theory of expression for user interface design. Emotional parameters were specified with markup tags and the resulting audio was further modulated with post-processing techniques. Software was then developed to link a selected TTS synthesizer with an automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine producing a chatbot that could speak and listen. Using these two artificial voice subsystems investigators explored both artistic and psychological implications of artificial speech emotion. Goals of the investigation were interdisciplinary with interest in musical composition augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) commercial voice announcement applications human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI). The work-in-progress points towards an emerging interdisciplinary ontology for artificial voices. As one study output HCI tools are proposed for future collaboration.;2013
Formal dialogue systems model rule-based interaction between agents and as such have multiple applications in multi-agent systems and AI more generally. Their conceptual roots are in formal theories of natural argumentation of which Hamblin's formal systems of argumentation in Hamblin (Fallacies. Methuen London 1970 Theoria 37:130-135 1971) are some of the earliest examples. Hamblin cites the medieval theory of obligationes as inspiration for his development of formal argumentation. In an obligatio two agents the Opponent and the Respondent engage in an alternating-move dialogue where the Respondent's actions are governed by certain rules and the goal of the dialogue is establishing the consistency of a proposition. We implement obligationes in the formal dialogue system framework of Prakken (Knowl Eng Rev 21(2):163-188 2006) using Dynamic Epistemic Logic (van Ditmarsch et al. in Dynamic epistemic logic Synthese Library Series. Springer Berlin 2007). The result is a new type of inter-agent dialogue for consistency-checking and analyzing obligationes in this way also sheds light on interpretational and historical questions concerning their use and purpose in medieval academia.;2013
In localisation of radiotherapy treatment field the oncologist is present at the simulator to approve treatment details produced by the therapist. Problems may arise if the oncologist is not available and the patient requires urgent treatment. The development of a tele-localisation system is a potential solution where the oncologist uses a personal digital assistant (PDA) to localise the treatment field on the image sent from the simulator through wireless communication and returns the information to the therapist after his or her approval. Our team developed the first tele-localisation prototype which consisted of a server workstation (simulator) for the administration of digital imaging and communication in medicine localisation images including viewing and communication with the PDA via a Wi-Fi network a PDA (oncologist's site) installed with the custom-built programme that synchronises with the server workstation and performs treatment field editing. Trial tests on accuracy and speed of the prototype system were conducted on 30 subjects with the treatment regions covering the neck skull chest and pelvis. The average time required in performing the localisation using the PDA was less than 1.5min with the blocked field longer than the open field. The transmission speed of the four treatment regions was similar. The average physical distortion of the images was within 4.4% and the accuracy of field size indication was within 5.3%. Compared with the manual method the tele-localisation system presented with an average deviation of 5.5%. The prototype system fulfilled the planned objectives of tele-localisation procedure with reasonable speed and accuracy.;2013
In the last years context awareness namely the provisioning of the current execution context to the application level has received an increasing attention up to becoming a core capability in next generation mobile scenarios. Context awareness intrinsically forces a continuous delivery of context data to resource-constrained mobile devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants to allow application adaptation and that can become too severe a constraint even for modern platforms (Android iOS etc.). This paper focuses on the realization of a context data distribution support for Android-based mobile phones with guaranteed quality levels on the context data delivery time. Android notwithstanding its great potential puts harsh constraints on the implementation of specific context distribution primitives thus preventing the realization of a wide set of significant deployment scenarios. At this stage we face that a large campaign of tests are necessary. We have collected main experimental results in a real testbed to highlight noteworthy details on the runtime performance obtainable with a real Android deployment.

In the recent years major efforts have been made to promote the use of virtual assistants on mobile devices. But in most cases these assistants can only manage a limited and predetermined set of applications. Other limitation that makes difficult the adoption of this technology is the need for a data connection. Thus this paper introduces the use of an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) as an assistant for task-specific applications. The proposed ECA is based on open-source components and runs entirely on the mobile device. The system design was validated by conducting tests to measure the latency and energy consumption.(1).;2013
In this paper a general architecture is proposed for developing embodied conversational agents with fuzzy ontology knowledge base. The proposed architecture enables agents to interact with the user via multimodal channels in a virtual reality environment for the purpose of language learning. The agents play the role of emotional rational and friendly partners who provide a specific domain of knowledge based on user's queries in natural language. These queries are performed by an optimized fuzzy search engine. Two scenarios including two virtual airports and a virtual electronic gadget shop are implemented in this architecture to improve users' oral skills. The results show the users' average oral skills improved 11%. Moreover 80% of the users ranked agents' logical sequence of actions and the total speed of responses as very good and 90% of them evaluated agents' appropriateness of responses as very good based on Likert scale.;2013
In this paper a multimodal user-emotion detection system for social robots is presented. This system is intended to be used during human-robot interaction and it is integrated as part of the overall interaction system of the robot: the Robotics Dialog System (RDS). Two modes are used to detect emotions: the voice and face expression analysis. In order to analyze the voice of the user a new component has been developed: Gender and Emotion Voice Analysis (GEVA) which is written using the Chuck language. For emotion detection in facial expressions the system Gender and Emotion Facial Analysis (GEFA) has been also developed. This last system integrates two third-party solutions: Sophisticated High-speed Object Recognition Engine (SHORE) and Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT). Once these new components (GEVA and GEFA) give their results a decision rule is applied in order to combine the information given by both of them. The result of this rule the detected emotion is integrated into the dialog system through communicative acts. Hence each communicative act gives among other things the detected emotion of the user to the RDS so it can adapt its strategy in order to get a greater satisfaction degree during the human-robot dialog. Each of the new components GEVA and GEFA can also be used individually. Moreover they are integrated with the robotic control platform ROS (Robot Operating System). Several experiments with real users were performed to determine the accuracy of each component and to set the final decision rule. The results obtained from applying this decision rule in these experiments show a high success rate in automatic user emotion recognition improving the results given by the two information channels (audio and visual) separately.;2013
In this paper different perspectives on the role of the teacher in a classroom equipped with personal digital assistants (PDAs) are presented. We report on four classroom studies conducted in two countries Norway and the USA. The overall aim is to understand the use of new tools in different contexts. The key question that we explore concerns the teachers' pedagogical use of the new tool and why certain tools are adopted and others are not. In one case the activities simulated the affordances and constraints of the tools used prior to the PDA. In the other case the activities harnessed the affordances and constraints offered by the successor tool the PDA. We raise the question as to why these tools were used in two different ways. We analyse our findings in terms of sociocultural theory and concepts of humancomputer interaction. Finally we summarize our results and discuss some educational implications.;2013
In this paper we present a technique for developing user simulators which are able to interact and evaluate conversational agents. Our technique is based on a statistical model that is automatically learned from a dialog corpus. This model is used by the user simulator to provide the next answer taking into account the complete history of the interaction. The main objective of our proposal is not only to evaluate the conversational agent but also to improve this agent by employing the simulated dialogs to learn a better dialog model. We have applied this technique to design and evaluate a conversational agent which provides academic information in a multi-agent system. The results of the evaluation show that the proposed user simulation methodology can be used not only to evaluate conversational agents but also to explore new enhanced dialog strategies thereby allowing the conversational agent to reduce the time needed to complete the dialogs and automatically detect new valid paths to achieve each of the required objectives defined for the task.;2013
In this paper we present Furhat - a back-projected human-like robot head using state-of-the art facial animation. Three experiments are presented where we investigate how the head might facilitate human - robot face-to-face interaction. First we investigate how the animated lips increase the intelligibility of the spoken output and compare this to an animated agent presented on a flat screen as well as to a human face. Second we investigate the accuracy of the perception of Furhat's gaze in a setting typical for situated interaction where Furhat and a human are sitting around a table. The accuracy of the perception of Furhat's gaze is measured depending on eye design head movement and viewing angle. Third we investigate the turn-taking accuracy of Furhat in a multi-party interactive setting as compared to an animated agent on a flat screen. We conclude with some observations from a public setting at a museum where Furhat interacted with thousands of visitors in a multi-party interaction.;2013
In this paper we propose a method to achieve effective facial emotional expressivity for embodied conversational agents by considering two types of asymmetry when exploiting the valence-arousal-dominance representation of emotions. Indeed the asymmetry of facial expressions helps to convey complex emotional feelings such as conflicting and/or hidden emotions due to social conventions. To achieve such a higher degree of facial expression in a generic way we propose a new model for mapping the valence-arousal-dominance emotion model onto a set of 12 scalar facial part actions built mostly by combining pairs of antagonist action units from the Facial Action Coding System. The proposed linear model can automatically drive a large number of autonomous virtual humans or support the interactive design of complex facial expressions over time. By design our approach produces symmetric facial expressions as expected for most of the emotional spectrum. However more complex ambivalent feelings can be produced when differing emotions are applied on the left and right sides of the face. We conducted an experiment on static images produced by our approach to compare the expressive power of symmetric and asymmetric facial expressions for a set of eight basic and complex emotions. Results confirm both the pertinence of our general mapping for expressing basic emotions and the significant improvement brought by asymmetry for expressing ambivalent feelings.

Infobots are small-scale natural language question answering systems drawing inspiration from ELIZA-type systems. Their key distinguishing feature is the extraction of meaning from users' queries without the use of syntactic or semantic representations. Three approaches to identifying the users' intended meanings were investigated: keyword-based systems Jaro-based string similarity algorithms and matching based on very shallow syntactic analysis. These were measured against a corpus of queries contributed by users of a WWW-hosted infobot for responding to questions about applications to MSc courses. The most effective system was Jaro with stemmed input (78.57%). It also was able to process ungrammatical input and offer scalability.;2013
Integral components of behavioral weight-loss treatment include self-monitoring of diet and physical activity along with feedback to participants regarding their behaviors. While providing feedback has been associated with weight loss no studies have examined the impact of feedback frequency on weight loss or the mediating role of self-monitoring adherence in this relationship. This study examined the effect of participant feedback frequency on weight loss and determined if this effect was mediated by adherence to self-monitoring in a behavioral weight-loss trial conducted in the USA. Participants (N = 210) were randomly assigned to one of three self-monitoring methods with either no-daily feedback messages or daily feedback messages: (1) paper diary (PD) no-daily feedback (2) personal digital assistant (PDA) no-daily feedback and (3) PDA daily tailored feedback messages (PDA + FB). The Sobel test via bootstrapping examined the direct effect of feedback frequency on weight loss and the indirect effect through self-monitoring adherence. Receiving daily feedback messages significantly increased participants' self-monitoring adherence. A significant effect of feedback frequency on weight loss was noted however after adjusting for self-monitoring adherence the effect of feedback frequency on weight loss was no longer significant. Feedback frequency had a significant indirect effect on weight loss through self-monitoring adherence. Self-monitoring adherence mediated the effect of feedback frequency on weight loss. Increasing the frequency with which participants receive feedback could enhance self-monitoring adherence a critical component of behavioral weight-loss treatment.;2013
Introduction: Recently the prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing significantly. Dietary and physical activity registers are frequently referred to as the cornerstone of behavioral weight control programs. Mobile devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are showing their usefulness to facilitate these self-registers. Objective: This study is aimed to analyze and compare the efficiency and feasibility of a PDA and Paper and Pencil (P&P) registers to record dietary and physical activity in a sample of Spanish adolescents with overweight. Methods: Sample was composed by 30 overweight participants aged 9-15 years seeking for obesity treatment. This is a counterbalance study all participants completing both experimental conditions: PDA and P&P registers. Results: For dietary records participants filled out more records using P&P than PDA when total number of self-registers was considered but when complete records were taken into account these differences disappeared and when percentages of complete records were analyzed PDA produced more accurate registers than P&P. For physical activity PDA produced more records than P&P. PDA was the preferred system. According to participants the PDA s strengths are the comfort easiness to use and to transport. Conclusions: Results showed that P&P produced more incomplete dietary records than PDA. PDA is a reliable system that allows the clinician to be confident in the data recorded. Recently several applications for mobile devices have been developed but there are few studies supporting evidence of their efficacy and feasibility in assessment and treatment of childhood obesity. This study tries to provide some evidence in this field.;2013
It is beneficial for students to experience situational learning especially for English as a foreign language (EFL) learning. Providing more listening and speaking opportunities could help EFL students with English learning. Our research proposes a listening and speaking practice system employing personal digital assistants (PDAs) for situated learning using contexts with which students would be familiar. The proposed system attempts to help participating EFL students by presenting learning contexts in familiar situations such as during lunch at school. The results show that the proposed system and designed activities provided EFL elementary school students with listening and speaking practice opportunities in basic vocabulary and simple sentences with the support of familiar situational learning. In the experiment the experimental group learned multimedia-based learning materials about food materials at lunch with PDAs. In contrast the control group learned via paper-based learning materials in class without real contextual support. After the experiment findings reveal that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in learning achievement. By providing recommended sample voices recorded by peers students in the experimental group could repeatedly listen to the recordings in familiar situations thus obtaining more opportunities to practice and interact with peers later. The other significant finding is that the number of peers used to practice speaking English in daily contexts defined as practice diversity was significantly correlated to learning improvement. That is when students practiced speaking English with an increased number of peers in familiar contexts their English skills improved. After interviews with students an interesting phenomenon was identified students in the experimental group extended their learning from school to home. Furthermore students' learning was not only a deliberate event or situation learning also took place spontaneously in their daily lives. Therefore the proposed system and activities can help EFL students particularly novices listen to and speak English in familiar situational contexts.;2013
It is very likely that electronic means of data collection will become a standard for socio-economic surveys in the near future. As surveys move from paper form to personal digital assistants (PDAs) or tablets there is a need to evaluate if such a shift will affect the quality of the data. To explore the potential biases that data collection through PDAs may generate we use the third wave of Young Lives-Peru to randomly assign survey respondents between PDA-based questionnaires and paper-based questionnaires. The study shows that data collected through PDAs has a higher level of agreement when compared to paper-based responses. However there are a number of situations where paper-based questionnaires do not easily translate to PDA-based questionnaires. In addition the study highlights the need to improve training as different surveyor's characteristics (age gender education etc.) may also be correlated with some observed differences between PDA and paper-based questionnaires.;2013
Knowing the degree of semantic contrast between words has widespread application in natural language processing including machine translation information retrieval and dialogue systems. Manually created lexicons focus on opposites such as hot and cold. Opposites are of many kinds such as antipodals complementaries and gradable. Existing lexicons often do not classify opposites into the different kinds however. They also do not explicitly list word pairs that are not opposites but yet have some degree of contrast in meaning such as warm and cold or tropical and freezing. We propose an automatic method to identify contrasting word pairs that is based on the hypothesis that if a pair of words A and B are contrasting then there is a pair of opposites C and D such that A and C are strongly related and B and D are strongly related. (For example there exists the pair of opposites hot and cold such that tropical is related to hot and freezing is related to cold.) We will call this the contrast hypothesis.We begin with a large crowdsourcing experiment to determine the amount of human agreement on the concept of oppositeness and its different kinds. In the process we flesh out key features of different kinds of opposites. We then present an automatic and empirical measure of lexical contrast that relies on the contrast hypothesis corpus statistics and the structure of a Roget-like thesaurus. We show how using four different data sets we evaluated our approach on two different tasks solving most contrasting word questions and distinguishing synonyms from opposites. The results are analyzed across four parts of speech and across five different kinds of opposites. We show that the proposed measure of lexical contrast obtains high precision and large coverage outperforming existing methods.;2013
Lithium-ion batteries are utilized in mobile phones personal digital assistants (PDA) 3C products and electric vehicles. Batteries must be rapidly chargeable. They discharge in devices. In both processes the temperature in the battery increases rapidly. Safety is very important in the operation of lithium-ion batteries. In this work a flexible micro temperature and voltage sensor is fabricated by the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) process for integration on flexible film substrates. The electrolyte and heat inside the lithium batteries can influence the accuracy of measurements made by and the lifetimes of flexible micro temperature sensors. In this work flexible micro temperature and voltage sensor is embedded into lithium-ion battery to acquire in situ temperature and voltage data. These data are useful for improving the safety of lithium-ion batteries.;2013
Low power consuming and highly responsive semiconductor-type microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gas sensors are fabricated for real-time environmental monitoring applications. This subsystem is developed using a gas sensor module a Bluetooth module and a personal digital assistant (PDA) phone. The gas sensor module consists of a NO2 or CO gas sensor and signal processing chips. The MEMS gas sensor is composed of a microheater a sensing electrode and sensing material. Metal oxide nanopowder is drop-coated onto a substrate using a microheater and integrated into the gas sensor module. The change in resistance of the metal oxide nanopowder from exposure to oxidizing or deoxidizing gases is utilized as the principle mechanism of this gas sensor operation. The variation detected in the gas sensor module is transferred to the PDA phone by way of the Bluetooth module.;2013
Mixed reality and 3D user interface technologies have increased the immersion presence and physicality of user interactions. These technologies can also increase the physicality of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) by making the ECAs occupy and interact with the physical space. We propose that increasing the physicality of an ECA can increase the ECA's social presence that is the feeling that the ECA is a real person. In this paper we examine existing research and formalize the idea of ECA physicality. We also explored the relationship between physicality and social presence by conducting two user studies (n = 18 and n = 29). Both user studies took place in a medical team training context and involved virtual human ECAs as fellow team members. The first study's results suggested that increasing physicality increased social presence and elicited more realistic behavior. The second study's results suggested that individual dimensions of physicality affect social presence to different extents.;2013
Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) have attracted significant research attention recently because of the fast growth of laptops personal digital assistant and 802.11/Wi-Fi wireless networking. However the flexible deployment nature and the lack of fixed infrastructure make MANETs suffer from a variety of security attacks. In this paper we show how an adversary can utilize a colluding injected attack (CIA) in MANET by injecting malicious nodes in the network while hiding their identities from other legitimate nodes. These injected nodes will work together (colluding) to create a collision at an arbitrary node thus preventing it from receiving or relaying any packet. Because of this collision a legitimate node could be reported as malicious nodes by monitoring nodes in the neighborhood. In this work we propose a monitoring verification scheme to mitigate the effect of the CIA attack. Our proposed scheme is able to accurately detect malicious nodes in the network compared with previous detection schemes. Through simulations we show that our proposed scheme outperforms previous detection schemes in terms of true/false detection of any malicious behavior in the network caused by the CIA attack.

Mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) smartphones and tablets have increased in popularity and are extremely efficient for work-related social and entertainment uses. Popular entertainment services have also attracted substantial attention. Thus relevant industries have exerted considerable efforts in establishing a method by whichmobile devices can be used to develop excellent and convenient entertainment services. Because cloud-computing technology ismature and possesses a strong computing processing capacity integrating this technology into the entertainment service function in mobile devices can reduce the data load on a system and maintain mobile device performances. This study combines cloud computing with a mobile device to design a karaoke system that contains real-time media merging and sharing functions. This system enables users to download music videos (MVs) from their mobile device and sing and record their singing by using the device. They can upload the recorded song to the cloud server where it is merged with real-time media. Subsequently by employing a media streaming technology users can store their personalMVs in theirmobile device or computer and instantaneously share these videos with others on the Internet. Through this process people can instantly watch shared videos enjoy the leisure and entertainment effects of Mbile devices and satisfy their desire for singing.;2013
Mobile learning aims to utilise communication devices such as mobile devices and wireless connection in combination with e-learning systems allowing learners to experience convenient instant and suitable learning at unrestricted time and place. Participants were 125 Taiwanese senior high school students whose continuance intention was examined after learning English via PDAs (personal digital assistants). The study using the one-group post-test design adopted the Technology Acceptance Model and incorporated factors such as curiosity and perceived convenience. The results indicated that (1) curiosity had a positive effect on continuance intention (2) perceived convenience had a positive effect on perceived usefulness and continuance intention.;2013
Mobile phones and personal digital assistants are becoming increasingly important in our daily life since they enable us to access a large variety of ubiquitous services. Mobile networks formed by the connection of mobile devices following some relationships among mobile users provide good platforms for mobile virus spread. Quick and efficient security patch dissemination strategy is necessary for the update of antivirus software so that it can detect mobile virus especially the new virus under the wireless mobile network environment with limited bandwidth which is also large scale decentralized dynamically evolving and of unknown network topology. In this paper we propose an efficient semi autonomy-oriented computing (SAOC) based patch dissemination strategy to restrain the mobile virus. In this strategy some entities are deployed in a mobile network to search for mobile devices according to some specific rules and with the assistance of a center. Through experiments involving both real-world networks and dynamically evolving networks we demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively send security patches to as many mobile devices as possible at a considerable speed and lower cost in the mobile network. It is a reasonable effective and secure method to reduce the damages mobile viruses may cause.;2013
Mobile technologies hold promise for improving diet and physical activity but little attention is given to creating programs that adolescents like and will use. This study developed a personal digital assistant (PDA) program to promote increased intake of fruits and vegetables (FV) in predominately low-income ethnic minority girls. This study used a three-phase community-engaged process including (i) engagement of a Student Advisory Board (SAB) to determine comfort with PDAs (ii) early testing of Prototype I and rapid re-design by the SAB and (iii) feasibility testing of Prototype II in a new sample of girls. Phase 1 results showed that girls were comfortable with the PDA. Testing of Prototype I in Phase 2 showed that acceptability was mixed with girls responding to 47.3% of the prompts. Girls wanted more reminders accountability in monitoring FV help in meeting daily goals and free music downloads based on program use. The PDA was reprogrammed and testing of Prototype II in Phase 3 demonstrated marked improvement in use (78.3%) increases in FV intake (1.8 +/- 2.6 daily servings) and good overall satisfaction. Findings suggest that mobile technology designed with the early input of youth is a promising way to improve adolescent health behaviors.;2013
New applications such as video conferencing and voice over IP present many challenges to the design of mobile networks. The mobile networks are constantly changing. The latest devices like smart phones personal digital assistants and mobile enabled laptops such as Windows Mobile and Windows Phone are truly able to deliver on any mobile broadband. As a July 2010 study by ERICSON one of the top tier infrastructure suppliers for mobile networks shows there are approximately five billions cell phone lines in the globe. This survey estimates 3.4 billion smart phone users in 2015. Thus the Internet service providers must deliver a high quality of service to the customers. The key factor in quality of service is optimization for bandwidth allocation. Various queuing algorithms can be used in case of mobile IPv6 to control bandwidth allocation for instance. In this paper we present various queuing disciplines in mobile IPv6 network when traffic class field in IPv6 is set to reserved that is the packets need quality of service throughout from source to destination.;2013
Nurses are a stressed group and this may affect their health and work performance. The determinants of occupational stress in nurses and other occupational groups have almost invariably been examined in between subject studies. This study aimed to determine if the main determinants of occupation stress i.e. demand control effort and reward operate within nurses. A real time study using personal digital-assistant-based ecological momentary assessment to measure affect and its hypothesised determinants every 90 min in 254 nurses over three nursing shifts. The measures were negative affect positive affect demand/effort control and reward. While the effects varied in magnitude between people in general increased negative affect was predicted by high demand/effort low control and low reward. Control and reward moderated the effects of demand/effort. High positive affect was predicted by high demand/effort control and reward. The same factors are associated with variations in stress-related affect within nurses as between.;2013
Objective: Although mobile devices equipped with drug reference software may help prevent adverse drug events (ADEs) in the nursing home (NH) by providing medication information at the point of care little is known about their use and perceived benefits. The goal of this study was to conduct a survey of a nationally representative sample of NH physicians to quantify the use and perceived benefits of mobile devices in preventing ADEs in the NH setting. Design/Setting/Participants: We surveyed physicians who attended the 2010 American Medical Directors Association Annual Symposium about their use of mobile devices and beliefs about the effectiveness of drug reference software in preventing ADEs. Results: The overall net valid response rate was 70% (558/800) with 42% (236/558) using mobile devices to assist with prescribing in the NH. Physicians with 15 or fewer years of clinical experience were 67% more likely to be mobile device users compared with those with more than 15 years of clinical experience (odds ratio = 1.68 95% confidence interval = 1.17-2.41 P = .005). For those who used a mobile device to assist with prescribing almost all (98%) reported performing an average of 1 or more drug lookups per day performed an average of 1 to 2 lookups per day for potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and most (88%) believed that drug reference software had helped to prevent at least 1 potential ADE in the preceding 4-week period. Conclusions: The proportion of NH physicians who use mobile devices with drug reference software although significant is lower than in other clinical environments. Our results suggest that NH physicians who use mobile devices equipped with drug reference software believe they are helpful for reducing ADEs. Further research is needed to better characterize the facilitators and barriers to adoption of the technology in the NH and its precise impact on NH ADEs.

Objective: An automated health counselor agent was designed to promote both physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption through a series of simulated conversations with users on their home computers. Methods: The agent was evaluated in a 4-arm randomized trial of a two-month daily contact intervention comparing: (a) physical activity (b) fruit and vegetable consumption (c) both interventions and (d) a non-intervention control. Physical activity was assessed using daily pedometer steps. Daily servings of fruit and vegetables were assessed using the NIH/NCI self-report Fruit and Vegetable Scan. Results: Participants in the physical activity intervention increased their walking on average compared to the control group while those in the fruit and vegetable intervention and combined intervention decreased walking. Participants in the fruit and vegetable intervention group consumed significantly more servings per day compared to those in the control group and those in the combined intervention reported consuming more compared to those in the control group. Conclusion: Automated health intervention software designed for efficient re-use is effective at changing health behavior. Practice implications: Automated health behavior change interventions can be designed to facilitate translation and adaptation across multiple behaviors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Objective: Computer-based virtual coaches are increasingly being explored for patient education counseling and health behavior training and coaching. The objective of this research was to develop and evaluate a Virtual Mindfulness Coach for training and coaching in mindfulness meditation. Methods: The coach was implemented as an embodied conversational character providing mindfulness training and coaching via mixed initiative text-based natural language dialog with the student and emphasizing affect-adaptive interaction. (The term 'mixed initiative dialog' refers to a human-machine dialog where either can initiate a conversation or a change in the conversation topic.) Results: Findings from a pilot evaluation study indicate that the coach-based training is more effective in helping students establish a regular practice than self-administered training using written and audio materials. The coached group also appeared to be in more advanced stages of change in terms of the transtheoretical model and have a higher sense of self-efficacy regarding establishment of a regular mindfulness practice. Conclusion: These results suggest that virtual coach-based training of mindfulness is both feasible and potentially more effective than a self-administered program. Of particular interest is the identification of the specific coach features that contribute to its effectiveness. Practice implications: Virtual coaches could provide easily accessible and cost-effective customized training for a range of health behaviors. The affect-adaptive aspect of these coaches is particularly relevant for helping patients establish long-term behavior changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2013
Objective: Relapse is a major problem in drug addiction treatment. Both drug craving and drug-related cognitions (e.g. attentional bias and implicit attitudes to drugs) may contribute to relapse. Using ecological momentary assessments we examined whether craving and cognitions assessed during drug detoxification treatment were associated with relapse. Method: Participants were 68 heroin-dependent inpatients undergoing clinical detoxification at an addiction treatment center. Participants carried around a personal digital assistant for 1 week. Participants completed up to 4 random assessments (RAs) per day. They also completed an assessment when they experienced a temptation to use drugs (TA). At each assessment participants reported their craving and attitudes to drugs. Implicit cognitions were assessed with a drug Stroop task (attentional bias) and an Implicit Association Test (implicit attitudes). Results: Individuals who relapsed during the study week exhibited a larger attentional bias and more positive implicit attitudes to drugs than did nonrelapsers at TAs (but not RAs). In addition compared to nonrelapsers relapsers reported higher levels of craving and more positive explicit attitudes to drugs at TAs than at RAs. Additional within-subject analyses revealed that attentional bias for drugs at TAs increased before relapse. Conclusions: Drug-related cognitive processes assessed with ecological momentary assessments were associated with relapse during drug detoxification. Real-time assessment of craving and cognitions may help to identify which individuals are at risk of relapse and when they are at risk of relapse.;2013
Objective: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the use of a customized personal digital assistant (PDA) to support cognitive functioning in a person with Korsakoff syndrome. Method: The PDA was compared with no external support and the use of a memory watch in a single case experimental design. Three main personal goal tasks were defined: arrive at appointments on time execute a long-term task successfully and remember to ask for medication. Results: No significant differences were found between the use of the memory watch and the use of the customized PDA. PDA use was perceived as feasible and effective and was considered as a more comprehensive aid than the memory watch. Conclusion: This study shows that a person with Korsakoff syndrome is able to use and benefit from a customized PDA. Replication of these findings in a larger effectiveness study is necessary.;2013
Objective: To examine the impact of 3 data collection modes on the number of questions answered data quality and student preference. Methods: 275 urban seventh-grade students were recruited and randomly assigned to complete a paper survey (SAQ) PDA survey (PDA) or PDA survey with audio (APDA). Students completed a paper debriefing survey. Results: APDA respondents completed significantly more questions compared to SAQ and PDA. PDA and APDA had significantly less missing data than did SAQ. No differences were found for student evaluation. Conclusions: Strong benefits may be gained by the use of APDA for adolescent school-based data collection.;2013
ObjectivesTo compare the efficacy of a computer-based physical activity program (Embodied Conversational AgentECA) with that of a pedometer control condition in sedentary older adults. DesignSingle-blind block-randomized controlled trial stratified according to clinic site and health literacy status. SettingThree urban ambulatory care practices at Boston Medical Center between April 2009 and September 2011. ParticipantsOlder adults (N=263 mean age 71.3 61% female 63% African American 51% high school diploma or less). InterventionECA participants were provided with portable tablet computers with touch screens to use for 2months and were directed to connect their pedometers to the computer using a data cable and interact with a computer-animated virtual exercise coach daily to discuss walking and to set walking goals. Intervention participants were then given the opportunity to interact with the ECA in a kiosk in their clinic waiting room for the following 10months. Control participants were given a control pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for an equivalent period of time. Intervention participants were also provided with pedometers. MeasurementsThe primary outcome was average daily step count for the 30days before the 12-month interview. Secondary outcomes were average daily step count for the 30days before the 2-month interview. Outcomes were also stratified according to health literacy level. ResultsECA participants walked significantly more steps than control participants at 2months (adjusted mean 4041 vs 3499 steps/day P=.01) but this effect waned by 12months (3861 vs 3383 P=.09). For participants with adequate health literacy those in the ECA group walked significantly more than controls at both 2months (P=.03) and 12months (P=.02) while those with inadequate health literacy failed to show significant differences between treatment groups at either time point. Intervention participants were highly satisfied with the program. ConclusionAn automated exercise promotion system deployed from outpatient clinics increased walking among older adults over the short-term. Effective methods for long-term maintenance of behavior change are needed.;2013
One of the fundamental issues of geographical information science is to design GIS interfaces and functionalities in a way that is easy to understand teach and use. Unfortunately current geographical information systems (including ArcGIS) remains very difficult to use as spatial analysis tools because they organize and expose functionalities according to GIS data structures and processing algorithms. As a result GIS interfaces are conceptually confusing cognitively complex and semantically disconnected from the way human reason about spatial analytical activities. In this article we propose an approach that structures GIS analytical functions based on the notion of analytical intent. We describe an experiment that replaces ArcGIS desktop interface with a conversational interface to enable mixed-initiative user-system interactions at the level of analytical intentions. We initially focus on the subset of GIS functions that are relevant to finding what's inside as described by Mitchell but the general principles apply to other types of spatial analysis. This work demonstrates the feasibility of delegating some spatial thinking tasks to computational agents and also raises future research questions that are key to building a better theory of spatial thinking with GIS.;2013
Online Social Networks (OSNs) have attracted millions of active users and have become an integral part of today's web ecosystem. Unfortunately in the wrong hands OSNs can be used to harvest private user data distribute malware control botnets perform surveillance spread misinformation and even influence algorithmic trading. Usually an adversary starts off by running an infiltration campaign using hijacked or adversary-owned OSN accounts with an objective to connect with a large number of users in the targeted OSN. In this article we evaluate how vulnerable OSNs are to a large-scale infiltration campaign run by socialbots: bots that control OSN accounts and mimic the actions of real users. We adopted the design of a traditional web-based botnet and built a prototype of a Socialbot Network (SbN): a group of coordinated programmable socialbots. We operated our prototype on Facebook for 8 weeks and collected data about user behavior in response to a large-scale infiltration campaign. Our results show that (1) by exploiting known social behaviors of users OSNs such as Facebook can be infiltrated with a success rate of up to 80% (2) subject to user profile privacy settings a successful infiltration can result in privacy breaches where even more private user data are exposed (3) given the economics of today's underground markets running a large-scale infiltration campaign might be profitable but is still not particularly attractive as a sustainable and independent business (4) the security of socially-aware systems that use or integrate OSN platforms can be at risk given the infiltration capability of an adversary in OSNs and (5) defending against malicious socialbots raises a set of challenges that relate to web automation online-offline identity binding and usable security.

Overlapping talk occurs frequently in multi-party conversations and is a domain in which speakers may pursue various communicative goals. The current study focuses on turn competition. Specifically we seek to identify the phonetic differences that discriminate turn-competitive from non-competitive overlaps. Conversation analysis techniques were used to identify competitive and non-competitive overlaps in a corpus of multi-party recordings. We then generated a set of potentially predictive features relating to prosody (F0 intensity speech rate pausing) and overlap placement (overlap duration point of overlap onset recycling etc.). Decision tree classifiers were trained on the features and tested on a classification task in order to determine which features and feature combinations best differentiate competitive overlaps from non-competitive overlaps. It was found that overlap placement features played a greater role than prosodic features in indicating turn competition. Among the prosodic features tested F0 and intensity were the most effective predictors of turn competition. Also our decision tree models suggest that turn competitive and non-competitive overlaps can be initiated by a new speaker at many different points in the current speaker's turn. These findings have implications for the design of dialogue systems and suggest novel hypotheses about how speakers deploy phonetic resources in everyday talk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Personal digital assistants (PDA) particularly Palm Pilots are popular data collection devices in experience sampling research. The declining availability of such devices however has prompted researchers to explore alternative technologies for signaling participants and collecting responses. The present research considers interactive voice response (IVR) methods which can deliver questions and collect data using common cell phones. Participants completed an experience sampling study using either a PDA (n = 428) or a cell phone under three different conditions (IVR condition n = 98 IVR Callback condition n = 93 IVR Callback Comeback condition n = 94). We found that response rates were higher when people used PDAs (69%) than when they used their cell phones (IVR condition = 51%) but response rates increased when people could call back within a few minutes of missing a signal (IVR Callback condition = 58%) and had a face-to-face meeting with a researcher midweek (IVR Callback Comeback = 64%). The daily life ratings were similar across the conditions. The findings are encouraging for researchers interested in using IVR cell phone methods for ecological momentary assessment but more work is needed to develop procedures or incentives that increase response rates.;2013
Portability of a spoken dialogue system (SDS) to a new domain or a new language is a hot topic as it may imply gains in time and cost for building new SDSs. In particular in this paper we investigate several fast and efficient approaches for language portability of the spoken language understanding (SLU) module of a dialogue system. We show that the use of statistical machine translation (SMT) can reduce the time and the cost of porting a system from a source to a target language. For conceptual decoding a state-of-the-art module based on conditional random fields (CRF) is used and a new approach based on phrase-based statistical machine translation (PB-SMT) is also evaluated. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed methods for a fast and low cost SLU language portability. In addition we propose two methods to increase SLU robustness to translation errors. Overall it is shown that the combination of all these approaches can further reduce the concept error rate. While most of the experiments in this paper deal with portability from French to Italian (given the availability of the Media French corpus and its subset manually translated into Italian) a validation of our methodology is eventually proposed in Arabic.;2013
Purpose: Healthcare organizations are increasingly faced with an environment in which they must implement health information systems to achieve higher standards for efficiency and quality of care while at the same time being asked to provide needed services with fewer resources. This is particularly challenging for rural health systems where access to resources is often more limited. This study investigates the potential value of iPad tablets for enhancing health services delivery by primary care physicians in rural Nevada. Methods: Five physicians from rural Nevada were selected to receive iPads and funding for apps that would enhance their medical practices. Following a year of use data was gathered on each physician's actual use and perceived value of the iPads. A case study approach was taken using both an online survey and semi-structured phone interviews to collect case data. Results: Use and perceived usefulness of the iPad was mixed but generally positive with some physicians utilizing it much more than others. The iPads were primarily used by the physicians to access medical information through online resources (e.g. Epocrates and UpToDate) for reference and diagnostic purposes although they were also used for some interaction with patients. All felt that resources available through the iPad were limited and that better applications would improve the usefulness of the iPad particularly in regard to graphical and video content suitable to sharing with patients. Conclusions: Physicians in this study felt that the iPad could fill a need between smartphones and desktops which were their primary technology tools prior to receiving the iPad but that useful medical applications and resources are currently limited for the iPad. In particular better graphical and video content would improve the usefulness of the iPad as a tool for patient interactions. Apps that store content locally would serve to mitigate inconsistent internet access that is still common in rural settings increasing the usefulness of the iPad in that context. Tablets like the iPad also have potential for use in accessing the electronic medical record systems that are increasingly being implemented in rural hospitals and healthcare facilities.

Recent studies have demonstrated that people show social reactions when interacting with human-like virtual agents. For instance human users behave in a socially desirable way show increased cooperation or apply human-like communication. It has however so far not been tested whether users are prone to mimic the artificial agent's behavior although this is a widely cited phenomenon of human human communication that seems to be especially indicative of the sociality of the situation. We therefore conducted an experiment in which we analyzed whether humans reciprocate an agent's smile. In a between-subjects design 104 participants conducted an 8-min small-talk conversation with an agent that either did not smile showed occasional smiles or displayed frequent smiles. Results show that although smiling did not have a distinct impact on the evaluation of the agent the human interaction partners themselves smiled longer when the agent was smiling.

Research concerning the complex interplay between factors that contribute to poor social functioning in schizophrenia has been hampered by limitations of traditional measures most notably the ecological validity and accuracy of retrospective self-report and interview measures. Computerized Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMAc) permits the real-time assessment of relationships between daily life experiences thoughts feelings and behaviors. In the current study EMAc was used to record daily social interactions subjective performance appraisals of these interactions (e. g. I succeeded/failed I was liked/rejected) and affect in 145 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants completed electronic questionnaires on a personal digital assistant (PDA) four times per day for one week. Time-lagged multilevel modeling of the data revealed that more positive interaction appraisals at any point in a day were associated with greater positive affect which in turn was a strong predictor of more social interactions over subsequent hours. Social functioning therefore was linked to positive performance beliefs about social interactions that were associated with greater positive affect. The findings suggest a useful treatment target for cognitive behavioral therapy and other psychosocial interventions that can be used to challenge defeatist beliefs and increase positive affect to enhance social functioning in schizophrenia.

Research on dialog systems is a very active area in social robotics. During the last two decades these systems have evolved from those based only on speech recognition and synthesis to the current and modern systems which include new components and multimodality. By multimodal dialogue we mean the interchange of information among several interlocutors not just using their voice as the mean of transmission but also all the available channels such as gestures facial expressions touch sounds etc. These channels add information to the message to be transmitted in every dialogue turn. The dialogue manager (IDiM) is one of the components of the robotic dialog system (RDS) and is in charge of managing the dialogue flow during the conversational turns. In order to do that it is necessary to coherently treat the inputs and outputs of information that flow by different communication channels: audio vision radio frequency touch etc. In our approach this multichannel input of information is temporarily fused into communicative acts (CAs). Each CA groups the information that flows through the different input channels into the same pack transmitting a unique message or global idea. Therefore this temporary fusion of information allows the IDiM to abstract from the channels used during the interaction focusing only on the message not on the way it is transmitted. This article presents the whole RDS and the description of how the multimodal fusion of information is made as CAs. Finally several scenarios where the multimodal dialogue is used are presented.;2013
Smartphones combine the communication capabilities of cellphones and the functions of PDA (personal digital assistant) which enable us to access a large variety of ubiquitous services such as surfing the web sending/receiving emails MMS and online shopping. However the availability of these services provided by smartphones increases the vulnerability to worm attacks. In addition modeling on worm propagation in smartphones is particularly challenging because it is difficult to piece together dynamics from pair-wise device interactions. To characterize the propagation dynamics of worms in smartphones we propose an efficient worm propagation modeling scheme using a two-dimensional cellular automata based on the epidemic theory. A set of suitable local transition rules is designed for the two-dimensional cellular automata in this scheme. Moreover this scheme integrates an infection factor to evaluate the spread degree of infected nodes and a resistance factor to evaluate the degree that susceptible nodes resist. Five classes of epidemic states are considered: susceptible exposed infected diagnosed and recovered. We explore a strategy for simulating the dynamics of worm propagation process from a single node to the entire network. The effectiveness and rationality of the proposed model have been validated through extensive simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2013
Studying how interlocutors exchange information efficiently during conversations in less-than-ideal acoustic conditions promises to both further the understanding of links between perception and production and inform the design of human-computer dialogue systems. The current study explored how interlocutors' speech changes in the presence of fluctuating noise. Pairs of talkers were recorded while solving puzzles cooperatively in quiet and with modulated-noise or competing speech maskers whose silent intervals were manipulated to produce either temporally sparse or dense maskers. Talkers responded to masked conditions by both increasing the amount of speech produced and locally changing their speech activity patterns resulting in a net reduction in the proportion of speech in temporal overlap with the maskers with larger relative reductions for sparse maskers. An analysis of talker activity in the vicinity of masker onset and offset events showed a significant reduction in onsets following masker onsets and a similar increase in onsets following masker offsets. These findings demonstrate that talkers are sensitive to masking noise and respond to its fluctuations by adopting a wait-and-talk strategy. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.;2013
Supplementing sufficient water to dam materials loaded on transportation trucks is the key in obtaining optimal moisture content of these materials thus ensuring compaction efficiency of earth-rock dam construction. Conventional methods of manual truck watering are labor intensive cause water wastage and suffer from imprecise control of the volume of water supplement. We integrated radio frequency identification global positioning system geographic information system personal digital assistant and general packet radio service cellular network technologies to develop an automatic control and real-time monitoring system for dam material transport truck watering. The developed system automates the control of watering operations according to the volume carried by each truck and the type of dam material loaded. It also monitors continuously the whole process of truck watering. The case study of the NZD Dam project demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed system. It not only achieves automatic and high-accuracy truck-and-material-based watering process but also makes possible timely feedback for watering control and improvement ultimately enhancing the compaction quality of dam materials and realizing better project performance.

Supporting multiple active speakers in automotive hands-free or speech dialog applications is an interesting issue not least due to comfort reasons. Therefore a multi-channel system for enhancement of speech signals captured by distributed distant microphones in a car environment is presented. Each of the potential speakers in the car has a dedicated directional microphone close to his position that captures the corresponding speech signal. The aim of the resulting overall system is twofold: On the one hand a combination of an arbitrary pre-defined subset of speakers' signals can be performed e.g. to create an output signal in a hands-free telephone conference call for a far-end communication partner. On the other hand annoying cross-talk components from interfering sound sources occurring in multiple different mixed output signals are to be eliminated motivated by the possibility of other hands-free applications being active in parallel. The system includes several signal processing stages. A dedicated signal processing block for interfering speaker cancellation attenuates the cross-talk components of undesired speech. Further signal enhancement comprises the reduction of residual cross-talk and background noise. Subsequently a dynamic signal combination stage merges the processed single-microphone signals to obtain appropriate mixed signals at the system output that may be passed to applications such as telephony or a speech dialog system. Based on signal power ratios between the particular microphone signals an appropriate speaker activity detection and therewith a robust control mechanism of the whole system is presented. The proposed system may be dynamically configured and has been evaluated for a car setup with four speakers sitting in the car cabin disturbed in various noise conditions.;2013
The analysis of a speech act is important for dialogue understanding systems because the speech act of an utterance is closely associated with the user's intention in the utterance. This paper proposes a speech act classification model that effectively uses a two-layer hierarchical structure generated from the adjacency pair information of speech acts. The proposed model has two advantages when adding hierarchical information to speech act classification the improved accuracy of the speech act classification and the reduced running time in the testing phase. As a result it achieves higher performance than other models that do not use the hierarchical structure and has faster running time because Support Vector Machine classifiers can efficiently be arranged on the two-layer hierarchical structure.

The How Was Your Day(HWYD) companion is an embodied conversational agent that can discuss work-related issues entering free-form dialogues while discussing issues surrounding a typical work day. The open-ended nature of these interactions requires new models of evaluation. Here we describe a paradigm and methodology for evaluating the main aspects of such functionality in conjunction with overall system behavior with respect to three parameters: functional ability (i.e. does it do the rightthing conversationally) content (i.e. does it respond appropriately to the semantic context) and emotional behavior (i.e. given the emotional input from the user does it respond in an emotionally appropriate way). We demonstrate the functionality of our evaluation paradigm as a method for both grading current system performance and targeting areas for particular performance review. We show correlation between for example automatic speech recognition performance and overall system performance (as is expected in systems of this type) but beyond this we show where individual utterances or responses indicated as positive or negative characterize system performance and demonstrate how our combination evaluation approach highlights issues (both positive and negative) in the companion system's interaction behavior.;2013
The Mbita Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Mbita HDSS) located on the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya was established in 2006. The main objective of the HDSS is to provide a platform for population-based research on relationships between diseases and socio-economic and environmental factors and for the evaluation of disease control interventions. The Mbita HDSS had a population of approximately 54 014 inhabitants from 11 576 households in June 2013. Regular data are collected using personal digital assistants (PDAs) every 3 months which includes births pregnancies migration events and deaths. Coordinates are taken using geographical positioning system (GPS) units to map all dwelling units during data collection. Cause of death is inferred from verbal autopsy questionnaires. In addition other health-related data such as vaccination status socio-economic status water sources acute illness and bed net distribution are collected. The HDSS has also provided a platform for conducting various other research activities such as entomology studies research on neglected tropical diseases and environmental health projects which have benefited the organization as well as the HDSS community residents. Data collected are shared with the community members health officials local administration and other relevant organizations. Opportunities for collaboration and data sharing with the wider research community are available and those interested should contact shimadam@nagasaki-u.ac.jp or mhmdkarama@yahoo.com.;2013
The objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a customised personal digital assistant (PDA) as a cognitive aid for people with acquired brain injury using a randomised parallel-group study. The participants were 34 patients with acquired brain injury in a cognitive rehabilitation setting. The experimental group used a customised PDA while the control group received care-as-usual (paper-and-pencil aids). Measurements were conducted at baseline (T0) after 8 hours of training (T1) after 16 hours of training (T2) and at 5-month follow-up (T3). The main outcome was the attainment of individualised goals. Both groups showed a significant increase in goal attainment (GAS) (p<.001). There were no significant differences between the groups at T1 or T2 on any of the other outcome measures. It was concluded that the customised PDA was as effective as paper-and-pencil aids and may therefore serve as a useful alternative when choosing the optimal rehabilitation strategy for a patient.;2013
The operation of robotic tour guides in public museums leads to a variety of interactions of these complex technical systems with humans of all ages and with different technical backgrounds. Interacting with a robot is a new experience for many visitors. An intuitive user interface preferable one that resembles the interaction between human tour guides and visitors simplifies the communication between robot and visitors. To allow for supportive behavior of the guided persons predictable robot behavior is necessary. Humanoid robots are able to resemble human motions and behaviors and look familiar to human users that have not interacted with robots so far. Hence they are particularly well suited for this purpose. In this work we present our anthropomorphic mobile communication robot Robotinho. It is equipped with an expressive communication head to display emotions. Its multimodal dialog system incorporates gestures facial expression body language and speech. We describe the behaviors that we developed for interaction with inexperienced users in a museum tour guide scenario. In contrast to prior work Robotinho communicated with the guided persons during navigation between exhibits not only while explaining an exhibit. We report qualitative and quantitative results from evaluations of Robotinho in RoboCup@Home competitions and in a science museum.;2013
The paper proposes a dialogue system LND which brings together and unifies two traditions in studying dialogue as a game: the dialogical logic introduced by Lorenzen and persuasion dialogue games as specified by Prakken. The first approach allows the representation of formal dialogues in which the validity of argument is the topic discussed. The second tradition has focused on natural dialogues examining e.g. informal fallacies typical in real-life communication. Our goal is to unite these two approaches in order to allow communicating agents to benefit from the advantages of both i.e. to equip them with the ability not only to persuade each other about facts but also to prove that a formula used in an argument is a classical propositional tautology. To this end we propose a new description of the dialogical logic which meets the requirements of Prakken's generic specification for natural dialogues and we introduce rules allowing to embed a formal dialogue in a natural one. We also show the correspondence result between the original and the new version of the dialogical logic i.e. we show that a winning strategy for a proponent in the original version of the dialogical logic means a winning strategy for a proponent in the new version and conversely.;2013
The proliferation of digital technologyboth as hardware and softwareprovides opportunities for activist groups around the world to connect with one another more rapidly and efficiently than ever before. And as mobile Internet technology (including smartphones personal digital assistants and laptops) becomes cheaper and more readily available the number of services offered to individuals has increased dramatically including voice communication Internet browsing and data transfer. At the same time the rise in transnational advocacy networks means that non-state actors are garnering new voices and challenging both old and new sites of authority from local governments and state agencies to regional and international organizations. Based on fieldwork and with a focus on the process of interaction within transnational groups in Southeast Asia this article adopts a communities of practice (COP) approach and applies it to the impact of digital networking in order to test some of the questions posed about the nature of the so-called technological revolution and to assess the ways in which technological advancement has affected these groups. It hypothesizes that even new and potentially levelling forms of communication can only respond to and reshape the pre-existing social conditions and organizational structures within which network participants function.;2013
The purpose of this study was to develop a new scoring system for the prompt recognition of clinical deterioration and early treatment in postoperative cardiac surgical patients. All consecutive adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery between 1st January 2007 and 31st December 2010 were included. The new score was calculated daily until intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. The score consists of 11 variables representing six different organ systems. Performance was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration tests. A total of 5207 patients with a mean age of 67.2 +/- 10.9 years were admitted to the ICU after cardiac surgery. The operations performed covered the whole spectrum of cardiac surgery. ICU mortality was 5.9%. The mean length of ICU stay was 4.6 +/- 7.0 days. The new score had an excellent discrimination with areas under the ROC curves between 0.91 and 0.96. Calibration was also excellent reflected by observed/expected mortality ratios ranging between 1.0 and 1.26. The new score is a simple and reliable scoring system to assess organ dysfunction in cardiac intensive care patients. It is designed especially for personal digital assistants to simplify and accelerate the process of risk stratification in cardiac surgical ICUs.;2013
The Resource-Based Relative Value Scale is widely used to measure healthcare provider productivity and to set payment standards. The scale however is limited in its assessment of pre- and postservice work and other potentially non-revenue-generating healthcare services what we have termed service-valued activity (SVA). In an attempt to quantify SVA we conducted a time and motion study of providers to assess their productivity in inpatient and outpatient settings. Using the Standard Time and Motion Procedures checklist as a methodological guide we provided personal digital assistants (PDAs) that were prepopulated with 2010 Current Procedural Terminology codes to 19 advanced practice providers (APPs). The APPs were instructed to identify their location and activity each time the PDA randomly alarmed. The providers collected data for 3 to 5 workdays and those data were separated into revenue-generating services (RGSs) and SVAs. Multiple inpatient and outpatient departments were assessed. The inpatient APPs spent 61.6 percent of their time on RGSs and 35.1 percent on SVAs. Providers in the outpatient settings spent 59.0 percent of their time on RGSs and 38.2 percent on SVAs. This time and motion study demonstrated an innovative method and tool for the quantification and analysis of time spent on revenue- and non-revenue-generating services provided by healthcare professionals. The new information derived from this study can be used to accurately document productivity determine clinical practice patterns and improve deployment strategies of healthcare providers.;2013
The web has become the largest repository of multimedia information and its convergence with telecommunications is now bringing the benefits of web technology to hand-held devices. To optimize data access using these devices and provide services which meet the user needs through intelligent information retrieval the system must sense and interpret the user environment and the communication context. In addition natural spoken conversation with handheld devices makes possible the use of these applications in environments in which the use of GUI interfaces is not effective provides a more natural human-computer interaction and facilitates access to the web for people with visual or motor disabilities allowing their integration and the elimination of barriers to Internet access. In this paper we present an architecture for the design of context-aware systems that use speech to access web services. Our contribution focuses specifically on the use of context information to improve the effectiveness of providing web services by using a spoken dialog system for the user-system interaction. We also describe an application of our proposal to develop a context-aware railway information system and provide a detailed evaluation of the influence of the context information in the quality of the services that are supplied.;2013
The widespread use of new mobile technology implementing wireless communications enables a new type of advanced applications to access information services on the Internet. In order to provide services which meet the user needs through intelligent information retrieval the system must sense and interpret the user environment and the communication context. Though context-awareness is vital to provide services adapted to the user preferences it cannot be useful if such services are difficult to access. The development of spoken dialogue systems for these applications facilitates interaction in natural language with the environment which is also benefited from contextual information. In this paper we propose a framework to develop context-aware dialogue systems that dynamically incorporate user specific requirements and preferences as well as characteristics about the interaction environment in order to improve and personalize web information and services. We have identified the major components for context-aware dialogue systems and placed them within a general-purpose architecture. The framework also describes a representation mode based on a dialogue register in order to share information between the elements of the architecture and incorporates statistical methodologies for dialogue management in order to reduce the effort required for both the implementation of a new system and the adaptation to a new task. We have evaluated our proposal developing a travel-planning system and provide a detailed discussion of its positive influence in the quality of the interaction and the information and services provided.;2013
This article reviews research on the effectiveness of four categories of intervention when implemented in public schools with adolescents and young adults diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. The study's inclusionary criteria include a setting of public schools participants aged between 12 and 22 years and the investigation of an antecedent- consequence- self-management- or video-based intervention strategy to influence skills or behaviors in students. A total of 34 studies met these criteria. The procedures of the What Works Clearinghouse Standards for Single-Case Designs and Evidence are used to evaluate whether sufficient high-quality research in using antecedent- consequence- self-management- and video-based strategies exists to consider these evidence-based practices. Intervention effectiveness is estimated using PAND scores and phi coefficients. The results suggest that sufficient research exists to consider antecedent- video- and consequence-based interventions evidence-based practices for adolescents and young adults in public schools. The need for more applied research with adolescents and young adults is highlighted.;2013
This paper describes research that addresses the problem of dialog management from a strong context-centric approach. We further present a quantitative method of measuring the importance of contextual cues when dealing with speech-based human-computer interactions. It is generally accepted that using context in conjunction with a human input such as spoken speech enhances a machine's understanding of the user's intent as a means to pinpoint an adequate reaction. For this work however we present a context-centric approach in which the use of context is the primary basis for understanding and not merely an auxiliary process. We employ an embodied conversation agent that facilitates the seamless engagement of a speech-based information-deployment entity by its human end user. This dialog manager emphasizes the use of context to drive its mixed-initiative discourse model. Atypical modern automatic speech recognizer (ASR) was incorporated to handle the speech-to-text translations. As is the nature of these ASR systems the recognition rate is consistently less than perfect thus emphasizing the need for contextual assistance. The dialog system was encapsulated into a speech-based embodied conversation agent platform for prototyping and testing purposes. Experiments were performed to evaluate the robustness of its performance namely through measures of naturalness and usefulness with respect to the emphasized use of context. The contribution of this work is to provide empirical evidence of the importance of conversational context in speech-based human-computer interaction using a field-tested context-centric dialog manager.

This paper describes the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces (MMI Architecture) standard an architecture and communications protocol that enables a wide variety of independent modalities to be integrated into multimodal applications. By encapsulating the functionalities of modality components and requiring all control information to go through the Interaction Manager the MMI Architecture simplifies integrating components from multiple sources.;2013
This paper discusses the design development features and clinical evaluation of a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based platform for cochlear implant research. This highly versatile and portable research platform allows researchers to design and perform complex experiments with cochlear implants manufactured by Cochlear Corporation with great ease and flexibility. The research platform includes a portable processor for implementing and evaluating novel speech processing algorithms a stimulator unit which can be used for electrical stimulation and neurophysiologic studies with animals and a recording unit for collecting electroencephalogram/evoked potentials from human subjects. The design of the platform for real time and offline stimulation modes is discussed for electric-only and electric plus acoustic stimulation followed by results from an acute study with implant users for speech intelligibility in quiet and noisy conditions. The results are comparable with users' clinical processor and very promising for undertaking chronic studies.;2013
This paper investigates the use of conversational agents to scaffold online collaborative learning discussions through an approach called academically productive talk (APT). In contrast to past work on dynamic support for collaborative learning which has involved using agents to elevate the conceptual depth of collaborative discussion by leading students in groups through directed lines of reasoning this APT-based approach lets students follow their own lines of reasoning and promotes productive practices such as explanation of reasoning and refinement of ideas. Two forms of support are contrasted namely Revoicing support and Feedback support. The study provides evidence that Revoicing support resulted in significantly more intensive reasoning exchange between students in the chat and significantly more learning during the chat than when that form of support was absent. Another form of support namely Feedback support increased expression of reasoning while marginally decreasing the intensity of the interaction between students and did not affect learning.;2013
This paper presented dynamic vehicle information for wireless communication and safe systems by integrating radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The systems provied different particular and advantage between RFID and other recognition technology. The car black box is the best choice and innovates specific application. It is not only the system can guard car but differentiate the responsibility for car accident event. Furthermore the car black box is integrated the RFID general packet radio service (GPRS) Bluetooth personal digital assistant (PDA) and global positioning system (GPS). The proposed system has been trending the merger goal of digitization. Therefore it is created a tremendous amount of commercial opportunity. The car black box is also combined multiple-user with real-time navigation information system. The system is integrated the independent real-time traffic information database and Geographical Information System (GIS) through data fusion method. We adopted a traffic information system offering advanced personalized route planning including added services for traffic jam alerting by means of Short Message Service (SMS) in Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication network. It is shown small and low-cost GSM modules for data process by using the Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm which developed a real-time software solution to help users and evaluation of user preferences for car traffic information system.;2013
This paper presents a model of incremental speech generation in practical conversational systems. The model allows a conversational system to incrementally interpret spoken input while simultaneously planning realising and self-monitoring the system response. If these processes are time consuming and result in a response delay the system can automatically produce hesitations to retain the floor. While speaking the system utilises hidden and overt self-corrections to accommodate revisions in the system. The model has been implemented in a general dialogue system framework. Using this framework we have implemented a conversational game application. A Wizard-of-Oz experiment is presented where the automatic speech recognizer is replaced by a Wizard who transcribes the spoken input. In this setting the incremental model allows the system to start speaking while the user's utterance is being transcribed. In comparison to a non-incremental version of the same system the incremental version has a shorter response time and is perceived as more efficient by the users. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents an integrated view on a series of experiments conducted with an affective dialog system applied as a tool in studies of emotions and social processes in online communication. The different realizations of the system are evaluated in three experimental setups to verify effects of affective profiles as well as of fine-grained communication scenarios on users' expressions of affective states experienced emotional changes and interaction patterns. Results demonstrate that the system applied in virtual reality settings matches a Wizard-of-Oz in terms of chatting enjoyment dialog coherence and realism. Variants of the system's affective profile significantly influence the rating of chatting enjoyment and an emotional connection. Self-reported emotional changes experienced by participants during an interaction with the system are in line with the type of applied profile. Analysis of interaction patterns i.e. usage of particular dialog act classes word categories and textual expressions of affective states for different scenarios demonstrates that a communication scenario for social sharing of emotions was successfully established. The experimental evidence provides valuable input for applications of affective dialog systems and strengthens them as valid tools for studying affect and social aspects in online communication.;2013
This paper proposes an unsupervised spoken language understanding (SLU) framework for a multi-domain dialog system. Our unsupervised SLU framework applies a non-parametric Bayesian approach to dialog acts intents and slot entities which are the components of a semantic frame. The proposed approach reduces the human effort necessary to obtain a semantically annotated corpus for dialog system development. In this study we analyze clustering results using various evaluation metrics for four dialog corpora. We also introduce a multi-domain dialog system that uses the unsupervised SLU framework. We argue that our unsupervised approach can help overcome the annotation acquisition bottleneck in developing dialog systems. To verify this claim we report a dialog system evaluation in which our method achieves competitive results in comparison with a system that uses a manually annotated corpus. In addition we conducted several experiments to explore the effect of our approach on reducing development costs. The results show that our approach be helpful for the rapid development of a prototype system and reducing the overall development costs.;2013
This study aimed to explore the feasibility and validity of using experience sampling methodology (ESM or ecological momentary assessment or mobile device signaling) to measure temporal changes and fluctuations in psychotic symptoms in patients with acute psychosis at the start of antipsychotic treatment. Twenty-six in-patients with delusions were assessed within 2 weeks of starting antipsychotic treatment using ESM on a personal digital assistant (PDA) seven times a day for 14 consecutive days. They were also interviewed at baseline 1 week and 2 weeks after using standardized symptom measures. Sixteen patients (61.5%) completed at least one-third of the entries with a compliance rate of 70.7%. Responses to the ESM items were internally consistent. At baseline ESM and clinical ratings converged on suspiciousness and images but not on voices and most of the delusion dimensions. Conducting ESM with patients in an acute episode was found to be feasible and internally valid. There is some divergence in symptom data obtained by ESM and standard symptom interviews but ESM captures rich information about change that may not be represented by observer ratings.

This study demonstrated the applicability of the well-established laboratory task dynamic visual noise as a technique for reducing naturally occurring food cravings and subsequent food intake. Dynamic visual noise was delivered on a hand-held computer device. Its effects were assessed within the context of a diary study. Over a 4-week period 48 undergraduate women recorded their food cravings and consumption. Following a 2-week baseline half the participants watched the dynamic visual noise display whenever they experienced a food craving. Compared to a control group these participants reported less intense cravings. They were also less likely to eat following a craving and consequently consumed fewer total calories following craving. These findings hold promise for curbing unwanted food cravings and craving-driven consumption in real-world settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2013
This trial assessed the ability to enhance health-related quality of life (HRQL) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) evaluation in trials and patient management using computer assistance with a handheld device called a personal digital assistant. The study assessed ease of use and psychometric properties of this approach comparing the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) paper form with the electronic (eLCSS-QL). Objectives were to: (1) measure completion times (2) evaluate acceptability by patients nurses and physicians (3) determine the correlation of the eLCSS-QL with the paper version and (4) determine the feasibility of using a shorter visual analogue scale (VAS) in the electronic version. Patients were entered at 12 COMET clinics. All had: (a) stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer (b) Karnofsky performance status (KPS) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 60 (c) no prior chemotherapy and (d) received initial courses of docetaxel + platinum. Of the148 patients enrolled characteristics were: men 57 % median KPS 80 % and median age 67 years. Of these 131 patients completed the evaluation form. The eLCSS-QL had excellent acceptance by patients nurses and physicians. Patients required 2.2 min (mean) to complete the eLCSS-QL. Reliability coefficients using Cronbach's alpha were high for the paper (0.84) and electronic (0.88) versions. The correlation coefficient between forms was high (0.92). The length of the VAS on the handheld pc (53 mm versus 100 mm on the paper format) resulted in nearly identical scores. The high acceptance rate by patients and professionals the rapid completion time ease of use and strong psychometric properties confirm that the electronic LCSS (eLCSS-QL) is practical for use in trials and patient management. This study indicates that computer assistance helps overcome barriers associated with evaluating HRQL and PROs.;2013
This work focuses on speech-based human-machine interaction. Specifically a Spoken Dialogue System (SDS) that could be integrated into a robot is considered. Since Automatic Speech Recognition is one of the most sensitive tasks that must be confronted in such systems the goal of this work is to improve the results obtained by this specific module. In order to do so a hierarchical Language Model (LM) is considered. Different series of experiments were carried out using the proposed models over different corpora and tasks. The results obtained show that these models provide greater accuracy in the recognition task. Additionally the influence of the Acoustic Modelling (AM) in the improvement percentage of the Language Models has also been explored. Finally the use of hierarchical Language Models in a language understanding task has been successfully employed as shown in an additional series of experiments.;2013
To successfully integrate technology into any educational program practitioners need awareness of available technology an understanding of how it can assist with instruction knowledge of ways it can support day-to-day activities and finally the ability to teach students as well as educators to use the technology. The proliferation of advanced mobile technologies specifically targeting individuals with moderate to severe intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder means increased access to new tools and a greater need for educational service providers to be trained and ready to identify recommend and deploy appropriate supports. The rapid rate of change in the technology industry is a formidable barrier to adequately preparing anyone except a technology specialist to be current on the latest advances. This article presents recommendations for school psychologists in terms of becoming familiar with the generally available technologies and the underlying instructional techniques rather than any specific technology products. Complete familiarity with all emergent technologies is improbable but through understanding the general ways technology can be used and the basic instructional practices school psychologists will be better equipped to recommend further exploration of technological solutions for students.;2013
Trust is a critical component in effective collaboration decision-making and negotiation. The goal of effective team leaders should be to send signals and messages that increase trust. We attempt to determine if signals can vary perceptions of trustworthiness and if nonverbal behaviors such as the voice contain indicators of trust. In order to investigate the relationship between trust and vocal dynamics this article presents a study that explores how the voice measured unobtrusively reflects a person's current level of perceived trust. We used an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to maximize consistency and control in questioning timing and interviewer nonverbal behavior thus eliminating potential confounds that may be introduced due to interaction adaptation. Participants () completed a face-to-face interview with the ECA and reported their perceptions of the ECA's trustworthiness. The results of the study revealed that vocal pitch was inversely related to perceived trust but temporally variant vocal pitch early in the interview reflected trust. The ECA was perceived as more trustworthy when smiling. While the results of this research suggest a relationship between vocal pitch and perceived levels of trust more work needs to be done to clarify the causal relationship. Similarly additional study needs to be done in order to integrate additional behavioral measurements that account for variation across diverse situations people and cultures.;2013
Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) we sought to determine whether differences in reporting would exist for smokers who self-monitored their smoking-related negative thoughts five times daily in comparison to a non-EMA control group. One hundred seventeen smokers were randomly assigned to two conditions. Eighty-eight smokers carried personal digital assistants (PDAs) for 2 weeks and monitored negative thoughts each day and 29 smokers did not self-monitor their negative thoughts. All smokers completed pretest and posttest assessments reporting their perceived risk and worry associated with smoking consequences. The data revealed evidence of self-monitoring effects as smokers in the EMA condition reported less worry after 2 weeks of self-monitoring compared to smokers in the control condition. The two conditions did not differ in their reports of perceived risk of smoking consequences. These data suggest that EMA procedures asking respondents to self-monitor their thoughts about smoking may influence feelings about their smoking behavior.;2013
Visual perception speech perception and the understanding of perceived information are linked through complex mental processes. Gestures as part of visual perception and synchronized with verbal information are a key concept of human social interaction. Even when there is no physical contact (e.g. a phone conversation) humans still tend to express meaning through movement. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) as well as humanoid robots are visual recreations of humans and are thus expected to be able to perform similar behaviour in communication. The behaviour generation system proposed in this paper is able to specify expressive behaviour strongly resembling natural movement performed within social interaction. The system is TTS-driven and fused with the time-and-space efficient TTS-engine called 'PLATTOS'. Visual content and content presentation is formulated based on several linguistic features that are extrapolated from arbitrary input text sequences and prosodic features (e.g. pitch intonation stress emphasis etc.) as predicted by several verbal modules in the system. According to the evaluation results when using the proposed system the synchronized co-verbal behaviour can be recreated with a very high-degree of naturalness either by ECAs or humanoid robots alike.;2013
We are currently experiencing a boom in the presence of Spanish language in the world which is reflected in its inclusion as a second language in the educational system of countries like Brazil and the emergence of language in the U. S. and China. To confront this situation there is a wide variety of courses for learning Spanish. However specific initiatives combining proven teaching methods in university classroom experiences with the creation of new multidisciplinary content displayed on 3D virtual sets have not been detected. This study proposes the establishment of a learner's role-play to improve learner's skills. Foreign languages' learning is the focus of the report because can serve as an appropriate context to analyze self-directed learning strategies and the culture of Lifelong Learning. The goal of this research is the creation of an integrated Massively Multiuser Online Learning (MMOL) platform that enables the creation development and deployment of contents and activities for teaching Spanish in an ad hoc educational virtual world named SLRoute. Such environment promotes an immersive creative and collaborative experience in the process of learning a foreign language. In order to assess the validity and reliability of this technology we used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The ultimate intention is to measure the acceptability of MMOL platforms for educational issues.;2013
We describe the work on infusion of emotion into a limited-task autonomous spoken conversational agent situated in the domestic environment using a need-inspired task-independent emotion model (NEMO). In order to demonstrate the generation of affect through the use of the model we describe the work of integrating it with a natural-language mixed-initiative HiFi-control spoken conversational agent (SCA). NEMO and the host system communicate externally removing the need for the Dialog Manager to be modified as is done in most existing dialog systems in order to be adaptive. The first part of the paper concerns the integration between NEMO and the host agent. The second part summarizes the work on automatic affect prediction namely frustration and contentment from dialog features a non-conventional source in the attempt of moving towards a more user-centric approach. The final part reports the evaluation results obtained from a user study in which both versions of the agent (non-adaptive and emotionally-adaptive) were compared. The results provide substantial evidences with respect to the benefits of adding emotion in a spoken conversational agent especially in mitigating users' frustrations and ultimately improving their satisfaction.;2013
We examined the potential of the iPad 2 as a teleradiologic tool for evaluating brain computed tomography (CT) with subtle hemorrhage in the conventional lighting conditions which are common situations in the remote CT reading. The comparison of the clinician's performance was undertaken through detecting hemorrhage by the iPad 2 and the clinical liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. We selected 100 brain CT exams performed for head trauma or headache. Fifty had subtle radiological signs of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) while the other 50 showed no significant abnormality. Five emergency medicine physicians reviewed these brain CT scans using the iPad 2 and the LCD monitor scoring the probability of ICH on each exam on a five-point scale. Result showed high sensitivities and specificities in both devices. We generated receiver operating characteristic curves and calculated the average area under the curve of the iPad 2 and the LCD (0.935 and 0.900). Using the iPad 2 and reliable internet connectivity clinicians can provide remote evaluation of brain CT with subtle hemorrhage under suboptimal viewing condition. Considering the distinct advantages of the iPad 2 the popular out-of-hospital use of mobile CT teleradiology would be anticipated soon.;2013
We present an approach to adapt dynamically the language models (LMs) used by a speech recognizer that is part of a spoken dialogue system. We have developed a grammar generation strategy that automatically adapts the LMs using the semantic information that the user provides (represented as dialogue concepts) together with the information regarding the intentions of the speaker (inferred by the dialogue manager and represented as dialogue goals). We carry out the adaptation as a linear interpolation between a background LM and one or more of the LMs associated to the dialogue elements (concepts or goals) addressed by the user. The interpolation weights between those models are automatically estimated on each dialogue turn using measures such as the posterior probabilities of concepts and goals estimated as part of the inference procedure to determine the actions to be carried out. We propose two approaches to handle the LMs related to concepts and goals. Whereas in the first one we estimate a LM for each one of them in the second one we apply several clustering strategies to group together those elements that share some common properties and estimate a LM for each cluster. Our evaluation shows how the system can estimate a dynamic model adapted to each dialogue turn which helps to significantly improve the performance of the speech recognition which leads to an improvement in both the language understanding and the dialogue management tasks.

We propose a novel practical dialogue management system that satisfies the requirements of robust dialogue management efficient domain knowledge construction and flexible architecture for maintenance and extensibility. The proposed system uses a corpus-based framework and a dynamic dialogue transition network model which work in a cooperative and complementary manner. The former supports automatic generation of domain knowledge from an annotated corpus whereas the latter manages dialogue flows robustly. The system can also automatically carry out user-intention analyses and response generation since it retrieves the most similar utterance and its response pair by estimating similarity between the input utterance and corpus utterances. Therefore the system can control a new domain dialogue by updating the corpus. In our experiments on two different corpora the system achieved F-0.5-scores of 91% and 90% in terms of user intention recognition with a task completion rate of 95% and 91%.;2013
When humans are addressing multiple robots with informative speech acts (Clark & Carlson 1982) their cognitive resources are shared between all the participating robot agents. For each moment the user's behavior is not only determined by the actions of the robot that they are directly gazing at but also shaped by the behaviors from all the other robots in the shared environment. We define cooperative behavior as the action performed by the robots that are not capturing the user's direct attention. In this paper we are interested in how the human participants adjust and coordinate their own behavioral cues when the robot agents are performing different cooperative gaze behaviors. A novel gaze-contingent platform was designed and implemented. The robots' behaviors were triggered by the participant's attentional shifts in real time. Results showed that the human participants were highly sensitive when the robot agents were performing different cooperative gazing behaviors.;2013
While there are studies that have looked at the implementation of mobile learning in educational institutions particularly the identification of issues encountered few studies have explored holistically the elements that sustain mobile learning. This study dissects the findings of a longitudinal study of a secondary school adopting a personal digital assistant programme and proposes a person-centred sustainable model for mobile learning.;2013
A 39-item survey instrument was distributed to faculty and students at Wingate University School of Pharmacy to assess student and faculty drug information (DI) resource use and access preferences. The response rate was 81% (n=5289). Faculty and professional year 2 to 4 students preferred access on laptop or desktop computers (67% and 75% respectively) followed by smartphones (27% and 22% respectively). Most faculty and students preferred using Lexicomp Online for drug information (53% and 74% respectively). Results indicate that DI resources use is similar between students and faculty laptop or desktop computers are the preferred platforms for accessing drug information.;2014
A compact planar ultra-wideband (UWB) multiple-input-multiple-output antenna array with two radiating elements is proposed in this work. Elements separation is kept at 5.5 mm and the isolation is achieved with a floating parasitic decoupling structure not known for UWB diversity antennas previously. The antenna system performs very well over the entire UWB frequency range of 3.1-10.6 GHz. The mutual coupling between the radiating elements is below -20 dB in most of the band. The decoupling structure is investigated in detail and the diversity analysis of the antenna in Rayleigh fading environment for indoor and outdoor propagations is also presented by computing envelope correlation coefficients. The proposed antenna array measures 33 x 45.5 mm(2) only and it is suitable for handheld devices personal digital assistant (PDA)s next generation home entertainment systems and robots.;2014
A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) has been proposed as a dialog model that enables automatic optimization of the dialog policy and provides robustness to speech understanding errors. Various approximations allow such a model to be used for building real-world dialog systems. However they require a large number of dialogs to train the dialog policy and hence they typically rely on the availability of a user simulator. They also require significant designer effort to hand-craft the policy representation. We investigate the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) in policy modeling to overcome these problems. We show that GP policy optimization can be implemented for a real world POMDP dialog manager and in particular: 1) we examine different formulations of a GP policy to minimize variability in the learning process 2) we find that the use of GP increases the learning rate by an order of magnitude thereby allowing learning by direct interaction with human users and 3) we demonstrate that designer effort can be substantially reduced by basing the policy directly on the full belief space thereby avoiding ad hoc feature space modeling. Overall the GP approach represents an important step forward towards fully automatic dialog policy optimization in real world systems.;2014
Advanced mobile devices allow registered nurses and nursing students to keep up-to-date with expanding health-related knowledge but are rarely used in nursing in Sweden. This study aims at describing registered nurses' and nursing students' views regarding the use of advanced mobile devices in nursing practice. A cross-sectional study was completed in 2012 a total of 398 participants replied to a questionnaire and descriptive statistics were applied. Results showed that the majority of the participants regarded an advanced mobile device to be useful giving access to necessary information and also being useful in making notes planning their work and saving time. Furthermore the advanced mobile device was regarded to improve patient safety and the quality of care and to increase confidence. In order to continuously improve the safety and quality of health care advanced mobile devices adjusted for nursing practice should be further developed implemented and evaluated in research.;2014
Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems must provide adapted services easily accessible by a wide variety of users. This can only be possible if the communication between the user and the system is carried out through an interface that is simple rapid effective and robust. Natural language interfaces such as dialog systems fulfill these requisites as they are based on a spoken conversation that resembles human communication. In this paper we enhance systems interacting in AAL domains by means of incorporating context-aware conversational agents that consider the external context of the interaction and predict the user's state. The user's state is built on the basis of their emotional state and intention and it is recognized by means of a module conceived as an intermediate phase between natural language understanding and dialog management in the architecture of the conversational agent. This prediction carried out for each user turn in the dialog makes it possible to adapt the system dynamically to the user's needs. We have evaluated our proposal developing a context-aware system adapted to patients suffering from chronic pulmonary diseases and provide a detailed discussion of the positive influence of our proposal in the success of the interaction the information and services provided as well as the perceived quality.;2014
Ambient Intelligence systems require a natural and personalized experience in interacting with services provided by the environment. In this view the interaction may happen either in a pervasive way through a combination of devices embedded in the environment or using a conversational interface acting as an environment concierge. In the latter case the interface can be embodied in a conversational agent able to involve users in a human-like conversation and to establish a social relation with them. Developing such an Ambient Conversational System (ACS) requires a model of the user that considers not only the cognitive ingredients of his mental state but also extra-rational factors such as affect engagement attitudes. This paper describes a multimodal framework for recognizing the social attitude of users during the interaction with an embodied agent in a smart environment. In particular we started from the analysis and annotation of advisory dialogs between humans and then we used the annotated corpus to build a framework for recognizing the social attitude in multimodal dialogs with an ACS. Results of the study show an acceptable performance of the framework in recognizing and monitoring the social attitude during the dialog with anACS. We also compared results of the analysis of human-human interactions with respect to the human-ACS interaction and even if the level of initiative of subjects during the dialog was lower in this lattermodality the difference in the average number of social moves was not significant thus showing that subjects probably were keen to establish a social relation with the conversational agent.;2014
An intelligent data acquisition and service system for apple orchard was developed for acquiring apple tree growth information in time and managing orchard production remotely. The data of fruit tree growth environment were collected by Portable Digital Assistant (PDA) through the ZigBee Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) deployed in the apple orchard. The collected data were packaged and uploaded following the transportation protocol through the web service interface provided by the orchard server. After that the orchard data were parsed and stored using distributed mechanism. Finally the data could be processed analyzed and visualized by the cloud orchard server and the orchard production decisions based on WebGIS technology could be made as well. Hence the users could access the services provided by the network platform via remote mobile or fixed terminals. The system operation test showed that the whole process was stable and reliable during which intelligent data collection storage and cloud data processing and publishing services were achieved.;2014
As more advanced methodologies are developed for symptom assessment in traumatic stress studies it is important to examine how these methodologies can exacerbate distress or contribute to symptoms among study participants. Using a sample of 202 female college students we examined the changes in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and general psychological symptomatology among groups of trauma-exposed and non-trauma-exposed women randomly assigned to complete 30 days of daily monitoring of traumatic symptoms and substance use behaviors using personal digital assistants (PDAs). These two groups were compared with a trauma-exposed sample of women who did not complete daily monitoring assessments and only completed pre- and post-monitoring online assessments. While trauma-exposed participants in the monitoring group reported more distress from the daily assessments than those in the monitoring group with no history of trauma this distress level was relatively low. Online surveys delivered pre- and post-monitoring showed a similar pattern. Trauma-exposed participants in monitoring and no-monitoring groups reported a decrease in general psychological symptoms over the 30 days however monitoring participants reported increased levels of PTSD severity over time. Closer examination revealed the observed changes were relatively moderate. Participants expressed benefits and risks regarding study participation supporting the findings that repeated assessments of traumatic symptoms using personal handheld devices may lead to small increases in distress and PTSD symptoms but that these approaches may be generally well tolerated.;2014
As needed (PRN) oral opioid analgesics are an integral part of many orthopedic postoperative multimodal pain management regimens. However the unpredictable nature of this dosing method can lead to disruptions in the process of administering the medication as well as be an interruption to regular nursing activities. This IRB approved quantitative time study tested the hypothesis that a significant amount of nursing time is required in the administration of PRN oral opioid analgesics on a postoperative orthopedic nursing unit. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the time necessary to complete the required steps related to the administration of PRN oral analgesics. Nurses from 28 nursing shifts used a personal digital assistant (PDA) to record the time needed to complete these steps. We determined that 10.9 minutes is the mean time required to administer PRN oral analgesics on this unit. Other time studies have evaluated the medication administration process as a whole. No time studies related to PRN oral analgesic administration have been reported. In phase I of our project the data were summarized and will be used as a baseline comparison for phase II in which we will evaluate an oral PCA medication administration system.

Attackers employ artificial machine-operated social network profiles called socialbots to connect to real members of an organization thus greatly increasing the amount of information the attacker can collect. To connect socialbots attackers employ several strategies. The authors' approach detects socialbots by intelligently selecting organization member profiles and monitoring their activity. Their study demonstrates their method's efficacy specifically that when an attacker knows the defense strategy being deployed the most effective attack is randomly sprayed friend requests which eventually lead to a low number of connections.;2014
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Interactive voice response systems integrated with electronic health records have the potential to improve primary care by engaging parents outside clinical settings via spoken language. The objective of this study was to determine whether use of an interactive voice response system the Personal Health Partner (PHP) before routine health care maintenance visits could improve the quality of primary care visits and be well accepted by parents and clinicians. METHODS: English-speaking parents of children aged 4 months to 11 years called PHP before routine visits and were randomly assigned to groups by the system at the time of the call. Parents' spoken responses were used to provide tailored counseling and support goal setting for the upcoming visit. Data were transferred to the electronic health records for review during visits. The study occurred in an urban hospital-based pediatric primary care center. Participants were called after the visit to assess (1) comprehensiveness of screening and counseling (2) assessment of medications and their management and (3) parent and clinician satisfaction. RESULTS: PHP was able to identify and counsel in multiple areas. A total of 9.7% of parents responded to the mailed invitation. Intervention parents were more likely to report discussing important issues such as depression (42.6% vs 25.4% P < .01) and prescription medication use (85.7% vs 72.6% P = .04) and to report being better prepared for visits. One hundred percent of clinicians reported that PHP improved the quality of their care. CONCLUSIONS: Systems like PHP have the potential to improve clinical screening counseling and medication management.;2014
Background: Although many medical learners and teachers are using mobile technologies within medical education there has been little evidence presented describing how they use mobile devices across a whole curriculum. Methods: The Northern Ontario School of Medicine (NOSM) introduced a new mobile device program in 2010. Incoming undergraduate medical learners received a laptop and an iPad and learners entering year three of the four-year program received a laptop and an iPhone. A survey was sent to all learners to gather information on their use of and attitudes toward these devices. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to analyze the data and to generate a series of themes that synthesized student behaviors perceptions and attitudes. Results: Context and learner autonomy were found to be important factors with learners using multiple devices for different purposes and adopting strategic approaches to learning using these devices. The expectation that school-issued devices would be regularly and enthusiastically used to replace more traditional study media was not reflected in practice. Conclusions: Learners' approaches to using mobile devices are heterogeneous as is the extent to which they use them. Learners adapt their use of mobile devices to the learning cultures and contexts they find themselves in.;2014
Background: Automated health behavior change interventions show promise but suffer from high attrition and disuse. The Internet abounds with thousands of personal narrative accounts of health behavior change that could not only provide useful information and motivation for others who are also trying to change but an endless source of novel entertaining stories that may keep participants more engaged than messages authored by interventionists. Objective: Given a collection of relevant personal health behavior change stories gathered from the Internet the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated indexing algorithm that could select the best possible story to provide to a user to have the greatest possible impact on their attitudes toward changing a targeted health behavior in this case weight loss. Methods: An indexing algorithm was developed using features informed by theories from behavioral medicine together with text classification and machine learning techniques. The algorithm was trained using a crowdsourced dataset then evaluated in a 2x2 between-subjects randomized pilot study. One factor compared the effects of participants reading 2 indexed stories vs 2 randomly selected stories whereas the second factor compared the medium used to tell the stories: text or animated conversational agent. Outcome measures included changes in self-efficacy and decisional balance for weight loss before and after the stories were read. Results: Participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing website (N=103 53.4% 55/103 female mean age 35 SD 10.8 years 65.0% 67/103 precontemplation 19.4% 20/103 contemplation for weight loss). Participants who read indexed stories exhibited a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy for weight loss compared to the control group (F-1F-107=5.5 P=.02). There were no significant effects of indexing on change in decisional balance (F-1F-97=0.05 P=.83) and no significant effects of medium on change in self-efficacy (F-1F-107=0.04 P=.84) or decisional balance (F-1F-97=0.78 P=.38). Conclusions: Personal stories of health behavior change can be harvested from the Internet and used directly and automatically in interventions to affect participant attitudes such as self-efficacy for changing behavior. Such approaches have the potential to provide highly tailored interventions that maximize engagement and retention with minimal intervention development effort.;2014
Background: Diabetes self-care by patients has been shown to assist in the reduction of disease severity and associated medical costs. We compared the effectiveness of two different diabetes self-care interventions on glycemic control in a racially/ethnically diverse population. We also explored whether reductions in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) will be more marked in minority persons. Methods: We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial of 376 patients with type 2 diabetes aged >= 18 years and whose last measured HbA1c was >= 7.5% (>= 58 mmol/mol). Participants were randomized to: 1) a Chronic Disease Self-Management Program ( CDSMP n = 101) 2) a diabetes self-care software on a personal digital assistant ( PDA n = 81) 3) a combination of interventions ( CDSMP + PDA n = 99) or 4) usual care ( control n = 95). Enrollment occurred January 2009-June 2011 at seven regional clinics of a university-affiliated multi-specialty group practice. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from randomization to 12 months. Data were analyzed using a multilevel statistical model. Results: Average baseline HbA1c in the CDSMP PDA CDSMP + PDA and control arms were 9.4% 9.3% 9.2% and 9.2% respectively. HbA1c reductions at 12 months for the groups averaged 1.1% 0.7% 1.1% and 0.7% respectively and did not differ significantly from baseline based on the model ( P =.771). Besides the participants in the PDA group reporting eating more high-fat foods compared to their counterparts ( P <.004) no other significant differences were observed in participants' diabetes self-care activities. Exploratory sub-analysis did not reveal any marked reductions in HbA1c for minority persons but rather modest reductions for all racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions: Although behavioral and technological interventions can result in some modest improvements in glycemic control these interventions did not fare significantly better than usual care in achieving glycemic control. More research is needed to understand how these interventions can be most effective in clinical practice. The reduction in HbA1c levels found in our control group that received usual care also suggests that good routine care in an integrated healthcare system can lead to better glycemic control.;2014
Background: Mobile electronic devices are replacing paper-based instruments and questionnaires for epidemiological and public health research. The elimination of a data-entry step after an interview is a notable advantage over paper saving investigator time decreasing the time lags in managing and analyzing data and potentially improving the data quality by removing the error-prone data-entry step. Research has not yet provided adequate evidence however to substantiate the claim of fewer errors for computerized interviews. Methodology: We developed an Android-based illness explanatory interview for influenza vaccine acceptance and tested the instrument in a field study in Pune India for feasibility and acceptability. Error rates for tablet and paper were compared with reference to the voice recording of the interview as gold standard to assess discrepancies. We also examined the preference of interviewers for the classical paper-based or the electronic version of the interview and compared the costs of research with both data collection devices. Results: In 95 interviews with household respondents total error rates with paper and tablet devices were nearly the same (2.01% and 1.99% respectively). Most interviewers indicated no preference for a particular device but those with a preference opted for tablets. The initial investment in tablet-based interviews was higher compared to paper while the recurring costs per interview were lower with the use of tablets. Conclusion: An Android-based tablet version of a complex interview was developed and successfully validated. Advantages were not compromised by increased errors and field research assistants with a preference preferred the Android device. Use of tablets may be more costly than paper for small samples and less costly for large studies.;2014
Background: Observational and survey methods have limitations in measuring hand hygiene behavior. The ability of a personal digital assistant to anonymously gather data at the point of decision making could potentially address these. Methods: Participants were provided with a personal digital assistant to be used for three 2-hour periods and asked to rate influential factors of the Health Belief Model (HBM). Participants were also required to enter what they thought they should do and what they actually did. Results: A total of 741 hand hygiene opportunities was recorded. All HBM constructs were higher for hand hygiene opportunities where there was compliance versus noncompliance with a significant difference for patient pressure my risk perceived benefits perceived seriousness and availability of good facilities. Only 20% of doctors 28% of nurses and 66% of physiotherapists always did what they thought they should. There was no correlation between self-reported and actual compliance. Conclusion: The HBM appeared to be a useful theoretical framework. Surprisingly participants rated their compliance as high despite having recorded instances where they did not do what they thought they should do. This suggests that staff may have a different definition of compliance than strict observation of the guidelines.

Background: Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases have expressed a need for more frequent measurement of relevant outcomes due to the variations in their symptoms during the day and from day to day. At present patient-reported outcomes are extensively collected with questionnaires completed with pen and paper. However as a measurement tool in frequent data collection the questionnaires are impractical. In contrast text messages on mobile phones are suitable for frequent data collection. The aim of this study was two-fold to compare daily registrations of patient-reported outcomes assessed with text-messages on mobile phones (SMS) or with questionnaires completed with pen and paper (P&P) with regard to scores and variation of scores and to examine feasibility of the SMS method in a multicentre clinical study. Methods: To compare scores 21 patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease performed daily assessments of pain fatigue stiffness and ability to carry out daily activities on a numeric rating scale (NRS). The patients were asked to assess the variables every other day with the SMS method and every other day with the P&P method for 28 consecutive days. In total each participant had to answer 14 P&P forms and 14 SMS messages. Mean scores and variation expressed as the pooled standard deviation or as the average range between the maximum and minimum scores for the two methods were compared using paired sample t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. To examine feasibility 36 patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease assessed the same four variables with SMS twice a week for 35 weeks. Feasibility of the SMS method was expressed as mean response-rate (%) in the total group and per centre. Results: Mean scores standard deviation of mean scores and mean range scores did not differ significantly between the two methods (p > 0.05). Response-rate with the SMS method was 97.9% for the whole group and for the three centres 97.1% 98.3% and 98.4% respectively. Conclusion: Outcomes assessed on numeric rating scales and reported with text-messages on mobile phones or with questionnaires completed with pen and paper provide comparable scores. Further the SMS method provided high response rates (> 97%) in a multicentre setting. Our results encourage the use of text messages on mobile phones in studies requiring frequent data collection and real-time assessment as in fluctuating diseases such inflammatory rheumatic diseases.;2014
Background: Personal smartphones are used frequently by healthcare practitioners in hospitals to assist in the provision of care. Island Health is one of the first health authorities in Canada to endorse the iPhone (R) smartphone as a potentially valuable tool for clinical practice. Objective: To measure smartphones effect on pharmacists' efficiency to assess pharmacist acceptance of corporate smartphones and to investigate how these devices are being utilized. Methods: This multi-center time-trial survey and observational prospective study enrolled 90 pharmacists across eight hospitals on Vancouver Island. Participants performed a time-trial of 22 situational drug information questions before and after receiving an iPhone (R). They also completed demographic and satisfaction surveys. A subset of 14 of the 90 pharmacists participated in a pre- and post- iPhone (R) implementation eight hour direct observation study. Lastly communication data from the phone service provider was collected and analyzed. Results: Smartphone use was associated with a faster median response time of approximately six minutes for all situational time-trial questions combined (48 min:15 s pre-iPhone (R) vs. 42 min:18 s post-iPhone (R)) (p=0.039). Smartphone use did not significantly influence time spent walking to obtain a resource time spent using computers or time spent answering of clinical questions during observation. Almost half of pharmacists reported that using the smartphone increased their confidence and competence to resolve drug therapy problems. Conclusions: Pharmacists readily accepted smartphones into their practice and felt positively about using them. Smartphones did not improve direct observation measures of workflow but they did improve pharmacists' efficiency in the answering of hypothetical drug information questions (p=0.039). This study indicates that if smartphones are incorporated into pharmacy practice in a structured organized manner with supports and training in place smartphone uptake will occur and pharmacists will adapt and incorporate this technology into their daily routine with no predicted deterioration in the quality of their work. The impact of improved efficiency on patient care resulting from an increased reliance on technology and time spent on devices needs to be further assessed.

Background: Tablet computers are increasingly used in healthcare but they may carry nosocomial pathogens. There are few data available on how to clean an iPad effectively for use in the clinical setting. Aim: We aimed to identify the most effective method of decontaminating the Apple iPad without causing damage and establish the duration of any residual effect. Methods: Following contamination with a microbial broth (meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and Clostridium difficile) we examined efficacy of iPad disinfection in the laboratory using six different disinfectant wipes: Sani-Cloth CHG 2% (chlorhexidine 2%/ alcohol 70%) Clorox Tristel Trigene soap and water and plain cloth. Following cleaning iPads were recontaminated to examine residual activity. After 480 Sani-Cloth CHG 2% disinfecting episodes functional and visual analysis of iPads was performed by blinded subjects. Findings: With the exception of Clostridium difficile Sani-Cloth CHG 2% and Clorox wipes were most effective against MRSA and VRE and they were significantly better than the Apple-recommended plain cloth (P <= 0.001). A substantial residual antimicrobial effect was seen for > 6 h after wiping the iPad with Sani-Cloth CHG 2% despite repeated recontamination and without further disinfection. The functionality or visual appearance of the iPad was not damaged by repeated use of Sani-Cloth CHG 2% wipes. Conclusions: Sani-Cloth CHG 2% wipes effectively disinfect the iPad against MRSA and VRE with a residual antibacterial effect and without causing damage. (c) 2014 The Healthcare Infection Society.

Background: The East Tennessee State University Quillen College of Medicine Library has participated for several years in projects to provide rural clinicians with health information resources. Objectives: To determine whether a strategy of hand-held devices with a best-evidence point-of-care disease tool and a drug database paired with access to a medical library for full-text articles and training to use the tools would be an affordable way to meet the information needs of rural underserved clinicians. Methods: This study is a mixed-methods methodology. The first project was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial (RCT) methodology. The second was evaluated qualitatively using interviews and focus groups. Results: The quantitative findings discovered that clinicians equipped with a hand-held device with evidence-based software more frequently found answers to clinical questions found answers more quickly were more satisfied with information they found and use expensive resources such as continuing medical education online databases and textbooks less than the group that did not have access to online technology. Qualitative results supported the quantitative findings. Conclusion: Librarians can implement a three-pronged strategy of the secondary literature via a hand-held the primary literature via Loansome Doc and quality training to meet basic information needs of rural clinicians.;2014
Background: The lack of high quality timely data for evidence-informed decision making at the district level presents a challenge to improving maternal and newborn survival in low income settings. To address this problem the EQUIP project (Expanded Quality Management using Information Power) implemented a continuous household and health facility survey for continuous feedback of data in two districts each in Tanzania and Uganda as part of a quality improvement innovation for mothers and newborns. Methods: Within EQUIP continuous survey data were used for quality improvement (intervention districts) and for effect evaluation (intervention and comparison districts). Over 30 months of intervention (November 2011 to April 2014) EQUIP conducted continuous cross-sectional household and health facility surveys using 24 independent probability samples of household clusters to represent each district each month and repeat censuses of all government health facilities. Using repeat samples in this way allowed data to be aggregated at six four-monthly intervals to track progress over time for evaluation and for continuous feedback to quality improvement teams in intervention districts. In both countries one continuous survey team of eight people was employed to complete approximately 7200 household and 200 facility interviews in year one. Data were collected using personal digital assistants. After every four months routine tabulations of indicators were produced and synthesized to report cards for use by the quality improvement teams. Results: The first 12 months were implemented as planned. Completion of household interviews was 96% in Tanzania and 91% in Uganda. Indicators across the continuum of care were tabulated every four months results discussed by quality improvement teams and report cards generated to support their work. Conclusions: The EQUIP continuous surveys were feasible to implement as a method to continuously generate and report on demand and supply side indicators for maternal and newborn health they have potential to be expanded to include other health topics. Documenting the design and implementation of a continuous data collection and feedback mechanism for prospective description quality improvement and evaluation in a low-income setting potentially represents a new paradigm that places equal weight on data systems for course correction as well as evaluation.;2014
Background: With the proliferation of portable digital technology mobile learning is becoming increasingly popular in nursing education and practice. Most of the research in this field has been concentrated on small-scale projects in high income countries. Very little is known about the ways in which nurses and midwives use mobile technology in remote and resource poor areas in informal learning contexts in low and middle income countries. Objectives: To address this gap this study investigates whether nurses use mobile phones as effective educational tools in marginalized and remote areas and if so how and why. Setting and Methods: In rural South Africa 16 nurses who attended an advanced midwifery education program facilitators and clinical managers were interviewed about their use of digital mobile technology for learning. Techniques of qualitative content analysis were used to examine the data. Results: Several rich organically-grown learning practices were identified: mobile phone usage facilitated (1) authentic problem solving (2) reflective practice (3) emotional support and belongingness (4) the realization of unpredictable teaching situations and (5) life-long learning. Conclusions: It is concluded that mobile phones and the convergence of mobile phones and social media in particular change learning environments. In addition these tools are suitable to connect learners and learning distributed in marginalized areas. Finally a few suggestions are made about how these insights from informal settings can inform the development of more systematic mobile learning formats. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Conversational recommender systems are E-Commerce applications which interactively assist online users to acquire their interaction goals during their sessions. In our previous work we have proposed and validated a methodology for conversational systems which autonomously learns the particular web page to display to the user at each step of the session. We employed reinforcement learning to learn an optimal strategy i.e. one that is personalized for a real user population. In this paper we extend our methodology by allowing it to autonomously learn and update the optimal strategy dynamically (at run-time) and individually for each user. This learning occurs perpetually after every session as long as the user continues her interaction with the system. We evaluate our approach in an off-line simulation with four simulated users as well as in an online evaluation with thirteen real users. The results show that an optimal strategy is learnt and updated for each real and simulated user. For each simulated user the optimal behavior is reasonably adapted to this user's characteristics but converges after several hundred sessions. For each real user the optimal behavior converges only in several sessions. It provides assistance only in certain situations allowing many users to buy several products together in shorter time and with more page-views and lesser number of query executions. We prove that our approach is novel and show how its current limitations can catered.;2014
Costs and secondary benefits of implementing electronic identification (e-ID) for performance recording (i.e. lambing body weight inventory and milk yield) in dairy and meat ewes were assessed by using the results from a previous study in which manual (M) semiautomatic (SA) and automatic (AU) data collection systems were compared. Ewes were identified with visual ear tags and electronic rumen boluses. The M system used visual identification on-paper data recording and manual data uploading to a computer. The SA system used e-ID with a handheld reader in which performances were typed and automatic uploaded to a computer. The use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) for recording and automatic data uploading which transformed M in a SA system was also considered. The AU system was only used for BW recording and consisted of e-ID automatic data recording in an electronic scale and uploading to a computer. The cost-benefit study was applied to 2 reference sheep farms of 700 meat ewes under extensive or intensive production systems and of 400 dairy ewes practicing once- or twice-a-day machine milkings. Sensitivity analyses under voluntary and mandatory e-ID scenarios were also included. Benefits of using e-ID for SA or AU performance recording mainly depended on sheep farm purpose number of test days per year handheld reader and PDA prices and flock size. Implementing e-ID for SA and AU performance recording saved approximately 50% of the time required by the M system and increased the reliability of the data collected. Use of e-ID increased the cost of performance recording in a voluntary e-ID scenario paying only partially the investment made (15 to 70%). For the mandatory e-ID scenario in which the cost of e-ID devices was not included savings paid 100% of the extra costs needed for using e-ID in all farm types and conditions. In both scenarios the reader price was the most important extra cost (40 to 90%) for implementing e-ID in sheep farms. Calculated extra costs of using the PDA covered more than 100% of the implementation costs in all type of sheep farms indicating that this device was cost-effective for sheep-performance recording.;2014
Embodied conversational agents (ECA) are a type of intelligent multimodal computer interface that allow computers to interact with humans in a face-to-face manner. It is quite feasible that ECAs will someday replace the common keyboard as a human-computer interface. However we have much to understand about how people interact with such embodied virtual agents. In this study we performed a laboratory experiment in an airport screening context to assess how people's linguistic behavior changes with their perceptions of the ECA's power and likeability. The results show that people tend to manifest more verbal immediacy and expressivity as well as offer more information about themselves with ECAs they perceive as more likeable and less powerful.;2014
Embodied conversational agents still do not achieve the fluidity and smoothness of natural conversational interaction. One main reason is that current system often respond with big latencies and in inflexible ways. We argue that to overcome these problems real-time conversational agents need to be based on an underlying architecture that provides two essential features for fast and fluent behavior adaptation: a close bi-directional coordination between input processing and output generation and incrementality of processing at both stages. We propose an architectural framework for conversational agents [Artificial Social Agent Platform (ASAP)] providing these two ingredients for fluid real-time conversation. The overall architectural concept is described along with specific means of specifying incremental behavior in BML and technical implementations of different modules. We show how phenomena of fluid real-time conversation like adapting to user feedback or smooth turn-keeping can be realized with ASAP and we describe in detail an example real-time interaction with the implemented system.;2014
Endowing artificial conversational agents with personality is a very promising way to obtain more believable user interactions with robots and computers. However although many authors have studied how to create an agent's personality and how it affects performance and user satisfaction less attention has been paid to assess whether the designed agent's personality corresponds to the users' perception whether it is easily recognizable and what is the effect that the user's own personality has in the discrimination of the agents' personality. In this paper we present an assessment framework to address these issues in an integrated way which in our opinion offers enough flexibility to consider the diversity of application domains and evaluation approaches that can be found in the literature. The framework is based on numerical measures which facilitate the interpretation of results and makes it possible to compare and rank different agents with respect to the user's perception of the rendered personality. In addition we have developed a tool that implements the framework which may be very useful for researchers in order to easily evaluate different agent personalities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Following a model on the cyclical nature of teacher (trait) self-efficacy and context- task- and situation-specific (state) mastery experiences (TSSME) we investigated the variability and effects of lesson characteristics (e.g. lesson sequence) student group characteristics (e.g. proportion of students receiving free school meals) and teacher characteristics (e.g. teacher experience) on teachers' situation-specific mastery experience. Forty-three teachers reported on 1055 lessons in 385 student groups using electronic questionnaires in Personal Digital Assistants during a period of 2 weeks. Two domains of TSSME (support of learning and organisation of classrooms) and perception of students (engagement and behaviour) were found. Multilevel models found roughly a quarter of the variance in TSSME between teachers a quarter between student groups and half between lessons. Student group characteristics differentially predicted TSSME. Perceived student engagement was more predictive of TSSME than perceived student behaviour. More experienced and high-efficacy teachers had higher TSSME. The findings have implications for our understanding of teachers' everyday practice with different student groups.;2014
Handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets are becoming useful in the medical field as they allow physicians radiologists and researchers to analyze images with the benefit of mobile accessibility. However for handheld devices to be effective the display must be able to perform well in a wide range of ambient illumination conditions. We conducted visual experiments to quantify user performance for testing the image quality of two current-generation devices in different ambient illumination conditions while measuring ambient light levels with a real-time illuminance meter. We found and quantified that due to the high reflectivity of handheld devices performance deteriorates as the user moves from dark areas into environments of greater ambient illumination. The quantitative analysis suggests that differences in display reflection coefficients do not affect the low illumination performance of the device but rather the performance at higher levels of illumination.;2014
In developing speech recognition based services for any task domain it is necessary to account for the support of an increasing number of languages over the life of the service. This paper considers a small vocabulary speech recognition task in multiple Indian languages. To configure a multi-lingual system in this task domain an experimental study is presented using data from two linguistically similar languages Hindi and Marathi. We do so by training a subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) (Povey et al. 2011 Rose et al. 2011) under a multi-lingual scenario (Burget et al. 2010 Mohan et al. 2012a). Speech data was collected from the targeted user population to develop spoken dialogue systems in an agricultural commodities task domain for this experimental study. It is well known that acoustic channel and environmental mismatch between data sets from multiple languages is an issue while building multi-lingual systems of this nature. As a result we use a cross-corpus acoustic normalization procedure which is a variant of speaker adaptive training (SAT) (Mohan et al. 2012a). The resulting multi-lingual system provides the best speech recognition performance for both languages. Further the effect of sharing similar context-dependent states from the Marathi language on the Hindi speech recognition performance is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2014
In order to monitor plant chlorophyll content in real-time a new vehicle-mounted detection system was developed to measure crop canopy spectral characteristics. It was designed to work as a wireless sensor network with one control unit and one measuring unit. The control unit included a personal digital assistant (PDA) device with a ZigBee wireless network coordinator. As the coordinator of the whole wireless network the control unit was used to receive display and store all the data sent from sensor nodes. The measuring unit consisted of several optical sensor nodes. All the sensor nodes were mounted on an on-board mechanical structure so that the measuring unit could collect the canopy spectral data while moving. Each sensor node contained four optical channels to measure the light radiation at the wavebands of 550 650 766 and 850 nm. The calibration tests verified a good performance in terms of the wireless transmission ability and the sensor measurement precision. Both stationary and moving field experiments were also conducted in a winter wheat experimental field. There was a high correlation between chlorophyll content and vegetation index and several estimation models of the chlorophyll content were established. The highest R-2 of the estimation models was 0.718. The results showed that the vehicle-mounted crop detection system has potential for field application.;2014
In spoken dialog systems dialog state tracking refers to the task of correctly inferring the user's goal at a given turn given all of the dialog history up to that turn. The Dialog State Tracking Challenge is a research community challenge task that has run for three rounds. The challenge has given rise to a host of new methods for dialog state tracking and also to deeper understanding about the problem itself including methods for evaluation.;2014
In this article we show that a small innovation in inspection technology can make substantial differences in inspection outcomes. For restaurant hygiene inspections the state of Florida has introduced a handheld electronic device the portable digital assistant (PDA) which reminds inspectors of about 1000 potential violations that may be checked for. Using inspection records from July 2003 to June 2009 we find that the adoption of PDA led to 11% more detected violations and subsequently restaurants may have gradually increased their compliance efforts. We also find that PDA use is significantly correlated with a reduction in restaurant-related foodborne disease outbreaks.;2014
In this paper the development of mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) over the past 20 years is reviewed with a particular focus on the pedagogical challenges facing its exploitation. Following a consideration of the definition of mobile learning the paper describes the dominant mobile technologies upon which MALL applications have been based: MP3 players personal digital assistants and mobile phones. It then identifies the prevalent methodological approach that has underlain the great majority of MALL implementations: a behaviorist teacher-centered transmission model of instruction. However though rarely implemented MALL is equally capable of supporting more innovative constructivist collaborative learner-centered instruction examples of which are examined. Besides being restricted by a pedagogical approach very much out of step with methodologies that have guided foreign language teaching for nearly four decades MALL has also been constrained by access to technology. In part this problem has been due to the necessity of acquiring mobile devices for student usage and the costs associated with mobile network and Internet connections. Even more so the exploitation of mobile devices for language learning has been hampered by a lack of hardware standardization and entrenched operating system incompatibilities. The paper concludes that MALL has yet to realize its full potential and that achieving this aim is more a matter of pedagogy than technology. The financial and technological factors that have impeded the effective exploitation of MALL are likely to be resolved as operating system incompatibilities are overcome by market forces and students as well as teachers acquire suitable mobile devices for their own personal use. The future of MALL lies in the exploitation of the communication and multimedia affordances of mobile devices in ways that support collaborative task-based learning both within and outside of the classroom.;2014
In this paper we consider transcripts which originated from a practical series of Turing's Imitation Game that was held on June 23 2012 at Bletchley Park U.K. In some cases the tests involved a three-participant simultaneous comparison of two hidden entities whereas others were the result of a direct two-participant interaction. Each of the transcripts considered here resulted in a human interrogator being fooled by a machine into concluding that they had been conversing with a human. Particular features of the conversation are highlighted successful ploys on the part of each machine are discussed and likely reasons for the interrogator being fooled are considered. Subsequent feedback from the interrogators involved is also included.;2014
In this study we highlight the theoretical underpinnings of human impression management tactics and link them to current research in embodied conversational agents. Specifically we incorporated impression management behaviors into an embodied conversational agent in order to show that different influence strategies affect user perceptions and how those perceptions might be moderated by user gender. We programmed the agent to use two human impression management techniques (ingratiation and self-promotion) and had the agent interact with 88 users. After the interaction users reported their perceptions of the system's power trustworthiness expertise and attractiveness. The impression management techniques altered users' perceptions and these perceptions were moderated by gender differences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2014
Intangible cultural heritage represents the cultural identities and diversity of mankind and should be preserved and passed on to the current and future generations. However in digital cultural heritage research intangible cultural heritage has been relatively less studied and the focus has been placed on creating tools and applications for professionals rather than for the general public. In this paper we present our research effort on creating an interactive system for conveying traditional Chinese culture through natural language conversation. We propose a systematic method for the domain experts to construct with minimal effort the knowledge base from a set of unstructured philosophy texts and we design an algorithm to build a conversational agent emulating the conversation ability of a famous Chinese philosopher. We also report two evaluation studies on the prototype we developed showing encouraging results on the feasibility and benefits of our approach. By automating part of the answer-finding task using natural language processing and information retrieval technology the system is able to find answers dynamically without the need to manually author large amounts of question and answer pairs. Our proposed method could potentially be used to create other conversational agents for educating and promoting cultural values to the general public in a natural and appealing way.;2014
Introduction: Musculoskeletal trauma occupies a significant proportion of the daily workload of most Emergency and Radiology departments. The diagnosis and management of patients with musculoskeletal trauma often require assessment of radiographs along with clinical assessment. With the advent of smart phones we hypothesised that they could be used as a means of smarter communication particularly for the transfer of radiographic images between healthcare professionals. Patients and method: We performed a cross sectional study using thirty radiographs each of the distal radius ankle and hip. The study was approved by Ethics Committee and all data were anonymized in accordance to Caldicott guidelines and data protection act 1998. Photographs of radiographs were taken using an iphone camera and sent to three independent Orthopaedic Registrars via Multimedia messaging service (MMS). Each Registrar independently assessed these images on their smart phone display in their own time and recorded the specific diagnosis along with the classification of fractures and specific treatment plan. The accuracy of diagnosis on smart phone was measured against the radiology report and inter observer agreement was assessed among registrars for classification and treatment plan. Results: The overall accuracy of fracture diagnosis was 97.7% with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94.4%. The inter observer agreement analysis showed kappa (k) values of 0.67 0.67 and 0.71 for classification of wrist ankle and hip fractures respectively showing substantial agreement while kappa values for management plan were 0.65 0.88 and 0.65 for the three fractures respectively showing substantial to near perfect agreement. Conclusion: This study suggests that smart phone can be used as a safe and accurate tool for skeletal trauma consultation among oncall doctors and can help reduce the waiting time in emergency departments.

Introduction: The need to train physicians committed to learning throughout their careers has prompted medical schools to encourage the development and practice of self-regulated learning by students. Longitudinal integrated clerkships (LICs) require students to exercise self-regulated learning skills. As mobile tools tablets can potentially support self-regulation among LIC students. Methods: We provided 15 LIC students with tablet computers with access to the electronic health record (EHR) to track their patient cohort and a multiplatform online notebook to support documentation and retrieval of self-identified clinical learning issues. Students received a 1-hour workshop on the relevant features of the tablet and online notebook. Two focus groups with the students were used to evaluate the program one early and one late in the year and were coded by two raters. Results: Students used the tablet to support their self-regulated learning in ways that were unique to their learning styles and increased access to resources and utilization of down-time. Students who used the tablet to self-monitor and target learning demonstrated the utility of tablets as learning tools. Conclusions: LICs are environments rich in opportunity for self-regulated learning. Tablets can enhance students' ability to develop and employ self-regulatory skills in a clinical context.;2014
Learning is facilitated by conversational interactions both with human tutors and with computer agents that simulate human tutoring and ideal pedagogical strategies. In this article we describe some intelligent tutoring systems (e.g. AutoTutor) in which agents interact with students in natural language while being sensitive to their cognitive and emotional states. These systems include one-on-one tutorial dialogues conversational trialogues in which two agents (a tutor and a peer) interact with a human student and other conversational ensembles in which agents take on different roles. Tutorial conversations with agents have also been incorporated into educational games. These learning environments have been developed for different populations (elementary through high school students college students adults with reading difficulties) and different subjects spanning science technology engineering mathematics reading writing and reasoning. This article identifies some of the conversation patterns that are implemented in the dialogues and trialogues.;2014
m Objective: Assessing automatic feedback technologies to promote safe travel and speech loudness control in two men with multiple disabilities respectively. Method: The men were involved in two single-case studies. In Study I the technology involved a microprocessor two photocells and a verbal feedback device. The man received verbal alerting/feedback when the photocells spotted an obstacle in front of him. In Study II the technology involved a sound-detecting unit connected to a throat and an airborne microphone and to a vibration device. Vibration occurred when the man's speech loudness exceeded a preset level. Results: The man included in Study I succeeded in using the automatic feedback in substitution of caregivers' alerting/feedback for safe travel. The man of Study II used the automatic feedback to successfully reduce his speech loudness. Conclusion: Automatic feedback can be highly effective in helping persons with multiple disabilities improve their travel and speech performance.;2014
Merging Immersive Virtual Environments Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence techniques provides a number of advantages to develop Intelligent Environments for multiple applications. This paper is focused on the application of these technologies to develop intelligent learning environments. Education is one of the most interesting applications of immersive virtual environments as their flexibility can be exploited in order to create heterogeneous groups from all over the world who can collaborate synchronously in different virtual spaces. We highlight the potential of virtual worlds as an educative tool and propose a model to create learning environments within Second Life or OpenSimulator combining the Moodle learning management system embodied conversational metabots and programmable 3D objects. Our proposal has been applied in several subjects of the Computer Science degree in the Carlos III University of Madrid. The results of the evaluation show that developed learning environment fosters engagement and collaboration and helps students to better understand complex concepts.;2014
Mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones are widely used not only in our everyday lives but also in various industrial fields. Most of these mobile devices have multiple wireless network interfaces such as Bluetooth 3G and Wi-Fi. A considerable amount of energy is consumed to transfer the data through wireless communication. Moreover most of these mobile devices operate on limited battery power. In industrial environments changes in the communication environment are severe due to significant noise sources and due to distortion in the transceiver circuitry of strong motors static frequency changers electrical discharge devices and other devices. It is necessary to select the network interface efficiently in order to extend the lifetimes of mobile devices and their applications. Therefore in this paper we propose an energy-efficient adaptive wireless network interface-selection scheme (AWNIS). Our scheme is proposed based on the mathematical modeling of energy consumption and data transfer delay patterns. Our scheme selects the best wireless network interface in terms of energy consumption by considering the link quality and adapting a dynamic network interface-selection interval according to the network environment. The simulation results show that proposed scheme effectively improves the energy efficiency while guaranteeing a certain level of data transfer delay.;2014
Multimodal interfaces incorporating embodied conversational agents enable the development of novel concepts with regard to interaction management tactics in responsive human-machine interfaces. Such interfaces provide several additional nonverbal communication channels such as natural visualized speech facial expression and different body motions. In order to simulate reactive humanlike communicative behavior and attitude the realization of motion relies on different behavioral analyses and realization tactics and approaches. This article proposes a novel environment for online visual modeling of humanlike communicative behavior named EVA-framework. In this study we focus on visual speech and nonverbal behavior synthesis by using hierarchical XML-based behavioral events and expressively adjustable motion templates. The main goal of the presented abstract motion notation scheme named EVA-Script is to enable the synthesis of unique and responsive behavior.;2014
Objective: Attentional retraining (AR) is a potential new treatment for addiction. AR trains addicts to attend away from drug-related cues thereby reducing exposure to drug cues and reducing craving. We examined the utility of delivering AR to smokers on a personal digital assistant (PDA) in the natural environment. Method: Smokers (N = 60) not seeking to quit were randomly assigned to an AR group or a control group (i.e. a group with no training). They carried a PDA with them for one week. They were prompted to complete four assessments daily including three attentional retrainings (AR group) or three control trainings (control group) and one evaluation of attentional bias. AR was implemented using a modified visual probe task. Attentional bias was assessed using a standard visual probe task on the PDA. Results: The AR group completed an average of 15.0 attentional retrainings and the control group completed an average of 14.9 control trainings. As hypothesized attentional bias declined over the week in the AR group but not in the control group Group x Day interaction F(1 232) = 4.77 p = .03. AR also reduced craving ratings following a briefly presented picture containing smoking and nonsmoking features group main effect F(1 234) = 3.89 p = .04. AR did not significantly influence smoking behavior. Conclusion: AR can be administered on a mobile device in the natural environment and AR can reduce attentional bias and craving.;2014
Objective: This study compared time-to-hospitalization among subjects enrolled in different diabetes self-management programs (DSMP). We sought to determine whether the interventions delayed the occurrence of any acute event necessitating hospitalization. Methods: Electronic medical records (EMR) were obtained for 376 adults enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) self-management programs. All study participants had uncontrolled diabetes and were randomized into either: personal digital assistant (PDA) Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) combined PDA and CDSMP (COM) or usual care (UC) groups. Subjects were followed for a maximum of two years. Time-to-hospitalization was measured as the interval between study enrollment and the occurrence of a diabetes-related hospitalization. Results: Subjects enrolled in the CDSMP-only arm had significantly prolonged time-to-hospitalization (Hazard ratio: 0.10 p = 0.002) when compared to subjects in the control arm. Subjects in the PDA-only and combined PDA and CDSMP arms showed no improvements in comparison to the control arm. Conclusion: CDSMP can be effective in delaying time-to-hospitalization among patients with T2DM. Practice implications: Reducing unnecessary healthcare utilization particularly inpatient hospitalization is a key strategy to improving the quality of health care and lowering associated health care costs. The CDSMP offers the potential to reduce time-to-hospitalization among T2DM patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2014
Objective: To compare condom use motives and behaviours in the context of penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI) with new versus established sexual partners using daily event-level data among a clinic-recruited sample. Methods: Participants (ages 15-65 years old) were recruited from five sexually transmissible infection (STI) clinics in three United States cities. They were provided with personal digital assistants and instructed to respond to daily questionnaire items regarding PVI events from the past 24 h. Generalised estimations equations were used to make inferences on age-adjusted estimated odds ratios comparing events occurring with established versus new partners. Results: For males pregnancy prevention was a more common motivation for condom use in new relationships (P < 0.001). Males with new sex partners were more likely to report condom use (P < 0.005) and also reported fewer errors or problems in condom use with new sex partners (P < 0.001). For females pregnancy prevention (P = 0.03) STI acquisition (P < 0.001) and STI transmission (P = 0.005) were more likely to be motives for condom use with new versus established partners. Also females with new sex partners were more likely to report condom use (P < 0.001) as well as using multiple condoms during a single event (P = 0.03). Conclusion: Event-level findings suggest that condom use motivations and behaviours vary depending on whether PVI occurs between established versus new sex partners. Condom use is more likely for PVI with new partners but other condom-associated behaviours and motivations differ between females and males.;2014
Objective: To determine the effectiveness of personal digital assistant devices on achievement of memory and organization goals in patients with poor memory after acquired brain injury. Design: Assessor blinded randomized controlled trial. Setting: Specialist brain injury rehabilitation hospital (inpatients and outpatients). Participants: Adults with acquired brain impairments (85% traumatic brain injury aged >= 17 years) who were assessed as having functional memory impairment on the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (General Memory Index). Interventions: Training and support to use a personal digital assistant for eight weeks to compensate for memory failures by an occupational therapist. The control intervention was standard rehabilitation including use of non-electronic memory aids. Main outcome measures: Goal Attainment Scale which assessed achievement of participants' daily memory functioning goals and caregiver perception of memory functioning and General Frequency of Forgetting subscale of the Memory Functioning Questionnaire administered at baseline (pre-randomization) and post intervention (eight weeks later). Results: Forty-two participants with memory impairment were recruited. Use of a personal digital assistant led to greater achievement of functional memory goals (mean difference 1.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 2.2) P = 0.0001) and improvement on the General Frequency of Forgetting subscale (mean difference 12.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 22.9) P = 0.021). Conclusions: Occupational therapy training in the use of a handheld computer improved patients' daily memory function more than standard rehabilitation.;2014
Objective: To examine the behavioral processes through which lifestyle interventions impacted weight loss. Methods: The analyses were limited to overweight and obese Black and White adults randomized to a PREMIER lifestyle intervention (N5501). Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the direct and indirect relationships of session attendance days of self-monitoring diet and exercise change in diet composition and exercise and 6-month weight change. Results: Greater session attendance was associated with increased self-monitoring which was in turn significantly related to reduction in percent energy from total fat consumed. Change in percent energy from fat and self-monitoring was associated with 6-month percent change in weight. Both a decrease in fat intake and increase in self-monitoring are potential mediators of the relationship between attendance and weight change. Conclusions: The findings provide a reasonable model that suggests regular session attendance and use of behavioral strategies like self-monitoring are associated with improved behavioral outcomes that are associated with weight loss.;2014
Objectives To develop validate test for applicability and practicality implement and undertake a preliminary evaluation of a standard operating procedure (SOP) for pharmacist patient-profiling activities at Rehabilitation Hospital Karin Grech (RHKG). Methods Following direct observation of pharmacist patient-profiling activities in the hospital a draft SOP was developed. The SOP was validated twice using a self-administered validation questionnaire and was amended according to suggestions proposed during validation. The validated SOP was tested for applicability and practicality through an observation study. Pharmacists were trained to follow the SOP correctly and the SOP was subsequently implemented. Preliminary evaluation of the SOP was undertaken using a self-administered evaluation questionnaire 1 and 4months post implementation. Results A patient-profiling' SOP for pharmacists was developed. Validation was beneficial since constructive suggestions were proposed and improvements with respect to SOP content length presentation layout and comprehensiveness were implemented to develop the final version of the SOP. The SOP was found to be practical and applicable for use at RHKG. Preliminary evaluation showed that all pharmacists (nine) found the SOP fit for purpose easy to follow for training new pharmacists user friendly easy to understand and promotes consistency in patient-profiling activities. Conclusions The patient-profiling' SOP provides a comprehensive approach to standardisation of pharmacist patient-profiling activities at RHKG to improve the quality of patient care. The SOP will need to be regularly reviewed and updated and can be transferred to other hospital settings with minor amendments.;2014
Objectives: To test the impact of the method of administration (MOA) on score level reliability and validity of scales developed in the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Study Design and Setting: Two nonoverlapping parallel forms each containing eight items from each of three PROMIS item banks (Physical Function Fatigue and Depression) were completed by 923 adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease depression or rheumatoid arthritis. In a randomized crossover design subjects answered one form by interactive voice response (IVR) technology paper questionnaire (PQ) personal digital assistant (PDA) or personal computer (PC) and a second form by PC in the same administration. Method equivalence was evaluated through analyses of difference scores intraclass correlations (ICCs) and convergent/discriminant validity. Results: In difference score analyses no significant mode differences were found and all confidence intervals were within the prespecified minimal important difference of 0.2 standard deviation. Parallel-forms reliabilities were very high (ICC = 0.85-0.93). Only one across-mode ICC was significantly lower than the same-mode ICC. Tests of validity showed no differential effect by MOA. Participants preferred screen interface over PQ and IVR. Conclusion: We found no statistically or clinically significant differences in score levels or psychometric properties of IVR PQ or PDA administration compared with PC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Often it is assumed that electronic recording by observers necessarily provides better quality data than pen-and-paper methods. Fifteen novice observers recorded rates of responding from 10 role-played video samples using one of three continuous recording input formats: keyboard (laptop) touchscreen (personal digital assistants) or pen-and-paper. We evaluated the quality of the observers' data compared with criterion records using calibration and interobserver agreement algorithms. Results of the calibration analysis revealed that observers in the touchscreen group produced the most consistently accurate and precise data the keyboard group observers showed wide variation in precision and accuracy and the pen-and-paper group observers were significantly less precise than the touchscreen group. We conclude that although electronic recording has the potential to be as accurate as and more precise than pen-and-paper methods this is far from guaranteed. Analyses of observers' errors advise recommendations for improving data accuracy and precision when using each method. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;2014
One of the most fundamental research questions in the field of human-machine interaction is how to enable dialogue systems to capture the meaning of spontaneously produced linguistic inputs without explicit syntactic expectations. This paper introduces a cognitively-inspired representational model intended to address this research question. To the extent that this model is cognitively-inspired it integrates insights from behavioral and neuroimaging studies on working memory operations and language-impaired patients (i.e. Broca's aphasics). The level of detail contained in the specification of the model is sufficient for a computational implementation while the level of abstraction is sufficient to enable generalization of the model over different interaction domains. Finally the paper reports on a domain-independent framework for end-user programming of adaptive dialogue management modules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2014
Overcoming speech recognition errors in the field of human-computer interaction is important in ensuring a consistent user experience. This paper proposes a semantic-oriented post-processing approach for the correction of errors in speech recognition. The novelty of the model proposed here is that it re-ranks the n-best hypothesis of speech recognition based on the user's intention which is analyzed from previous discourse information while conventional automatic speech recognition systems focus only on acoustic and language model scores for the current sentence. The proposed model successfully reduces the word error rate and semantic error rate by 3.65% and 8.61% respectively.;2014
Personal health records (PHRs) in contrast to electronic health records (EHRs) or electronic medical records (EMRs) are health records in which data are accessible to patients and not just providers. In recent years many systems have enabled PHRs to be available in a mobile format. Mobile PHRs (mPHRs) allow patients to access health information via the Internet or telecommunication devices such as mobile phones personal digital assistants and tablet computers. mPHRs have the potential to help patients and providers identify medical conditions and prescriptions from numerous locations which may minimize medical errors and identify improvements to health behaviors during emergencies when patients present to a new provider or EHRs are not accessible. Despite their benefits numerous challenges inhibit the adoption and further development of mPHRs including integration into overall health technology infrastructure and legal and security concerns. This paper identifies the benefits of mPHRs during emergencies and the remaining challenges impeding full adoption and use and provides recommendations to federal agencies to enhance support and use of mPHRs.;2014
Purpose: Adolescents report high asthma-related morbidity that can be prevented by adequate self-management of the disease. Therefore there is a need for a developmentally appropriate strategy to promote effective asthma self-management. Mobile phone-based technology is portable commonly accessible and well received by adolescents. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a comprehensive mobile phone-based asthma self-management aid for adolescents (mASMAA) that was designed to facilitate symptom monitoring treatment adherence and adolescent-parent partnership. The system used state-of-the-art natural language-understanding technology that allowed teens to use unconstrained English in their texts and to self-initiate interactions with the system. Materials and methods: mASMAA was developed based on an existing natural dialogue system that supports broad coverage of everyday natural conversation in English. Fifteen adolescent-parent dyads participated in a 2-week trial that involved adolescents' daily scheduled and unscheduled interactions with mASMAA and parents responding to daily reports on adolescents' asthma condition automatically generated by mASMAA. Subsequently four focus groups were conducted to systematically obtain user feedback on the system. Frequency data on the daily usage of mASMAA over the 2-week period were tabulated and content analysis was conducted for focus group interview data. Results: Response rates for daily text messages were 81%-97% in adolescents. The average number of self-initiated messages to mASMAA was 19 per adolescent. Symptoms were the most common topic of teen-initiated messages. Participants concurred that use of mASMAA improved awareness of symptoms and triggers promoted treatment adherence and sense of control and facilitated adolescent-parent partnerships. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the utility and user acceptability of mASMAA as a potential asthma self-management tool in a selective group of adolescents. Further research is needed to replicate the findings in a large group of adolescents from sociodemographically diverse backgrounds to validate the findings.;2014
Several novel digital assistant power integrated technologies (DAPITs) for power management unit (PMU) to reduce the designing complexity as well as to keep good performance in scaling CMOS process are proposed in this paper. The DAPITs include segment power driving with pulse skip modulation/pulse width modulation and loop regulating with digital regulation circuit for dc-dcs in PMU calibrating digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with resistance compensation network for dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and separating phase clock for multi-dc-dcs in PMU. With these DAPITs the efficiencies and output accuracies of dc-dcs are increased the DVS signal sent by DAC is linear and current ripples in PMU are reduced. In this paper a PMU embedded into system-on-a-chip (SoC) is designed based on a 0.13-mu m CMOS process. The designed PMU includes four dc-dc buck converters and two LDOs. This paper introduces the top structure of the PMU and the main proposed DAPITs. Simulation and test results show that the output voltages of the dc-dc converters in the PMU can be changed by external resistors and regulated from 0.7 to 1.8 V stepped with 25 mV by SoC load through interface. And the maximum efficiency of the dc-dcs with DVS in the PMU is more than 90% while with an external resistor it can reach to 95%.;2014
Some studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have revealed an association between craving for cigarettes and relapse. It is therefore important to understand the correlates of craving during smoking cessation. Attentional bias to smoking cues is a potential correlate of craving but it has not previously been assessed using EMA during smoking cessation. Smokers enrolled in a research smoking cessation study were offered the opportunity to take part in an EMA study. Volunteers carried around a personal digital assistant (PDA) for the first week of their quit attempt. They completed up to 4 random assessments (RAs) per day as well as assessments when they experienced a temptation to smoke and when they relapsed. Craving for cigarettes was assessed with a single item (17 scale). Attentional bias was assessed with a smoking Stroop task (a reaction time task) at every other assessment as was self-reported attention to cigarettes. Data were available from 119 participants. Across 882 assessments participants exhibited a significant smoking Stroop effect. Linear mixed models revealed a significant between-subject association between craving and the smoking Stroop effect. Individuals with higher levels of craving exhibited greater attentional bias. The within-subject association was not significant. Similar results were obtained for the relationship between self-reported attention to cigarettes and attentional bias. Attentional bias can be assessed in the natural environment using EMA during smoking cessation and attentional bias is a correlate of craving during the early stages of a quit attempt.;2014
Speech and hand gestures offer the most natural modalities for everyday human-to-human interaction. The availability of diverse spoken dialogue applications and the proliferation of accelerometers on consumer electronics allow the introduction of new interaction paradigms based on speech and gestures. Little attention has been paid however to the manipulation of spoken dialogue systems (SDS) through gestures. Situation-induced disabilities or real disabilities are determinant factors that motivate this type of interaction. In this paper six concise and intuitively meaningful gestures are proposed that can be used to trigger the commands in any SDS. Using different machine learning techniques a classification error for the gesture patterns of less than 5 % is achieved and the proposed set of gestures is compared to ones proposed by users. Examining the social acceptability of the specific interaction scheme high levels of acceptance for public use are encountered. An experiment was conducted comparing a button-enabled and a gesture-enabled interface which showed that the latter imposes little additional mental and physical effort. Finally results are provided after recruiting a male subject with spastic cerebral palsy a blind female user and an elderly female person.;2014
Speech interfaces within Intelligent Environments (IEs) must be rendered adaptive to external and internal factors among those the complexity of the dialogue. Hence we present HIS-OwlSpeak a model-driven dialogue manager for Intelligent Environments. It meets the challenges arising from engineering IEs by providing a unified platform comprising adaptivity to a variety of internal and external factors. This work addresses internal adaptivity realized by different modes of dialogue control i.e. rule-based and probabilistic. For this the Hidden Information State (HIS) approach - featuring inherent handling of uncertainty in dialogue systems - is applied to a model-driven solely rule-based dialogue manager. It uses ontologies to specify the dialogue thus separating the specification from the dialogue control. Consequently all necessary aspects for merging the world of model-driven dialogue management with the HIS approach are presented in detail. Furthermore the system has been evaluated using two concurrent dialogues of different complexity successfully validating the implementation.;2014
Spoken dialogue systems are increasingly being used to facilitate and enhance human communication. While these interactive systems can process the linguistic aspects of human communication they are not yet capable of processing the complex dynamics involved in social interaction such as the adaptation on the part of interlocutors. Providing interactive systems with the capacity to process and exhibit this accommodation could however improve their efficiency and make machines more socially-competent interactants. At present no automatic system is available to process prosodic accommodation nor do any clear measures exist that quantify its dynamic manifestation. While it can be observed to be a monotonically manifest property it is our hypotheses that it evolves dynamically with functional social aspects. In this paper we propose an automatic system for its measurement and the capture of its dynamic manifestation. We investigate the evolution of prosodic accommodation in 41 Japanese dyadic telephone conversations and discuss its manifestation in relation to its functions in social interaction. Overall our study shows that prosodic accommodation changes dynamically over the course of a conversation and across conversations and that these dynamics inform about the naturalness of the conversation flow the speakers' degree of involvement and their affinity in the conversation.

The CHRONIOUS system offers an integrated platform aiming at the effective management and real-time assessment of the health status of the patient suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). An intelligent system is developed for the analysis and the real-time evaluation of patient's condition. A hybrid classifier has been implemented on a personal digital assistant combining a support vector machine a random forest and a rule-based system to provide a more advanced categorization scheme for the early and in real-time characterization of a COPD episode. This is followed by a severity estimation algorithm which classifies the identified pathological situation in different levels and triggers an alerting mechanism to provide an informative and instructive message/advice to the patient and the clinical supervisor. The system has been validated using data collected from 30 patients that have been annotated by experts indicating 1) the severity level of the current patient's health status and 2) the COPD disease level of the recruited patients according to the GOLD guidelines. The achieved characterization accuracy has been found 94%.;2014
The current study evaluated a relatively new video-based procedure continuous video modeling (CVM) to teach multi-step cleaning tasks to high school students with moderate intellectual disability. CVM in contrast to video modeling and video prompting allows repetition of the video model (looping) as many times as needed while the user completes a task. CVM was evaluated using a multiple probe design across three cleaning tasks and replicated across three students. CVM alone was effective in promoting completion of tasks for two of the three students. Results suggest that CVM may be an effective instructional strategy for prompting task completion however further research is recommended regarding the types of tasks best suited for this video-based intervention.;2014
The objective was to assess the impacts of diabetes self-management programs on productivity-related indirect costs of the disease. Using an employer's perspective this study estimated the productivity losses associated with: (1) employee absence on the job (2) diabetes-related disability (3) employee presence on the job and (4) early mortality. Data were obtained from electronic medical records and survey responses of 376 adults aged >= 18 years who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of type 2 diabetes self-management programs. All study participants had uncontrolled diabetes and were randomized into one of 4 study arms: personal digital assistant (PDA) chronic disease self-management program (CDSMP) combined PDA and CDSMP and usual care (UC). The human-capital approach was used to estimate lost productivity resulting from 1 2 3 and 4 above which are summed to obtain total productivity loss. Using robust regression total productivity loss was modeled as a function of the diabetes self-management programs and other identified demographic and clinical characteristics. Compared to subjects in the UC arm there were no statistically significant differences in productivity losses among persons undergoing any of the 3 diabetes management interventions. Males were associated with higher productivity losses (+$708/year P < 0.001) and persons with greater than high school education were associated with additional productivity losses (+$758/year P < 0.001). Persons with more than 1 comorbid condition were marginally associated with lower productivity losses (-$326/year P = 0.055). No evidence was found that the chronic disease management programs examined in this trial affect indirect productivity losses.;2014
The present study investigated different types of boredom as proposed in a four-categorical conceptual model by Goetz and Frenzel (2006 doi:10.1026/0049-8637.38.4.149). In this model four types of boredom are differentiated based on degrees of valence and arousal: indifferent calibrating searching and reactant boredom. In two studies (Study 1: university students N = 63 mean age 24.08 years 66 % female Study 2: high school students grade 11 N = 80 mean age 17.05 years 58 % female) real-time data were obtained via the experience-sampling method (personal digital assistants randomized signals). Boredom experiences (N = 1103/1432 in Studies 1/2) were analyzed with respect to the dimensions of valence and arousal using multilevel latent profile analyses. Supporting the internal validity of the proposed boredom types our results are in line with the assumed four types of boredom but suggest an additional fifth type referred to as apathetic boredom. The present findings further support the external validity of the five boredom types in showing differential relations between the boredom types and other affective states as well as frequency of situational occurrence (achievement contexts vs. non-achievement contexts). Methodological implications as well as directions for future research are discussed.;2014
There are different ways for people to be trained with regard to some special skills and information they need. These ways include textbooks and computers in recent years especially mobile or other electronic devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) handheld technologies and tablet PCs. The choice of learner depends on an individual access to different technologies and the infrastructure environment. Adopting accurate information technology at the right time and right place in a rapidly changing society is a vital factor both in school and educational settings. Augmented reality (AR) is one of the technologies that shifts the location and timing of education and it is one of the concepts that we frequently hear in recent years. Despite the use of AR in a wide areas such as enginerring product development factory planning manufacturing advertising etc. there is also the potential for AR use in educational context. This study explores different types of AR use in various areas and then argues its potential in education. AR is seen as one of the important issues that can be studied by researches in education in the near future.;2014
This article contributes to the ecolinguistic research agenda in two ways: first it introduces a distinct ecological approach to intricacies of intercultural interaction emphasizing the multiple voices subjectivities and historicities that meet and mesh in such encounters. Second it introduces an ecological model of timescales that allows ecological language scientists to adopt a naturalized position in order to show how temporal patterns crisscross complex empirical data the key word is that of temporal ranges i.e. ranges of timescales constrained by the same organizing principle. Using this model we describe a principled method for extracting temporal patterns historicities and sociocultural voices in complex empirical data. Our example is another Thanksgiving dinner (cf. Tannen 1984) where a German a Russian and two Japanese women interact in a US context. Our analysis shows how past events (e.g. the spread of the Ottoman Empire Germany and Japan during World War II Russian-American relations during the cold war and the election of cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as pope in 2005) become powerful constraints on the interactional dynamics between the interlocutors as they use these events to project and mold their dialogical and social identities vis-a-vis each other and the researcher. At the end of the article we present an ecological view on identity and we discuss the role of the researcher in an ecological paradigm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2014
This article describes an evaluation of a POMDP-based spoken dialogue system (SDS) using crowdsourced calls with real users. The evaluation compares a Hidden Information State POMDP system which uses a hand-crafted compression of the belief space with the same system instead using an automatically computed belief space compression. Automatically computed compressions are a way of introducing automation into the design process of statistical SDSs and promise a principled way of reducing the size of the very large belief spaces which often make POMDP approaches intractable. This is the first empirical comparison of manual and automatic approaches on a problem of realistic scale (restaurant pub and coffee shop domain) with real users. The evaluation took 2193 calls from 85 users. After filtering for minimal user participation the two systems were compared on more than 1000 calls. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2014
This article investigates the use of a hand-held unit as an information source in manual assembly. Having a mobile information system such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) that can be brought at all times as opposed to a stationary one such as a computer terminal is hypothesised to increase the information range and thus improves assembly performance. The increased information range is argued to be due to assembly workers employing a cost-benefit strategy where the cost of gathering information is compared with the assumed benefit of it. This article reports empirical data comparing the use of a mobile information carrier with a traditional stationary computer and results show that the use of a PDA significantly improves quality whereas productivity does not significantly improve quality.;2014
This article presents two studies conducted with an affective dialogue system in which text-based system-user communication was used to model generate and present different affective and social interaction scenarios. We specifically investigated the influence of interaction context and roles assigned to the system and the participants as well as the impact of pre-structured social interaction patterns that were modelled to mimic aspects of social exclusion scenarios. The results of the first study demonstrate that both the social context of the interaction and the roles assigned to the system influence the system evaluation interaction patterns textual expressions of affective states as well as emotional self-reports. The results observed for the second study show the system's ability to partially exclude a participant from a triadic conversation without triggering significantly different affective reactions or a more negative system evaluation. The experimental evidence provides insights on the perception modelling and generation of affective and social cues in artificial systems that can be realized in different modalities including the text modality thus delivering valuable input for applying affective dialogue systems as tools for studying affect and social aspects in online communication.;2014
This paper addresses issues of automatically detecting significant dialog events (SDEs) in naturalistic HCI and of deducing trait-specific conclusions relevant for the design of spoken dialog systems. We perform our investigations on the multimodal LAST MINUTE corpus with records from naturalistic interactions. First we used textual transcripts to analyse interaction styles and discourse structures. We found indications that younger subjects prefer a more technical style in communication with dialog systems. Next wemodel the subject's internal success state with a hidden Markov model trained using the observed sequences of system feedback. This reveals that younger subjects interact significantly more successful with technical systems. Aiming on automatic detection of specific subjects's reactions we then semi-automatically annotate SDEs-phrases indicating an irregular i.e. not-task-oriented subject behavior. We use both acoustic and linguistic features to build several trait-specific classifiers for dialog phases which showed pronouncedly different accuracies for diverse age and gender groups. The presented investigations coherently support age-dependence of both expressiveness and problem-solving ability. This in turn induces design rules for future automatic designated companion systems.;2014
This paper describes the design and evaluation of a method for developing a chat-oriented dialog system by utilizing real human-to-human conversation examples from movie scripts and Twitter conversations. The aim of the proposed method is to build a conversational agent that can interact with users in as natural a fashion as possible while reducing the time requirement for database design and collection. A number of the challenging design issues we faced are described including (1) constructing an appropriate dialog corpora from raw movie scripts and Twitter data and (2) developing an multi domain chat-oriented dialog management system which can retrieve a proper system response based on the current user query. To build a dialog corpus we propose a unit of conversation called a tri-turn (a trigram conversation turn) as well as extraction and semantic similarity analysis techniques to help ensure that the content extracted from raw movie/drama script files forms appropriate dialog-pair (query-response) examples. The constructed dialog corpora are then utilized in a data-driven dialog management system. Here various approaches are investigated including example-based (EBDM) and response generation using phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT). In particular we use two EBDM: syntactic-semantic similarity retrieval and TF-IDF based cosine similarity retrieval. Experiments are conducted to compare and contrast EBDM and SMT approaches in building a chat-oriented dialog system and we investigate a combined method that addresses the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. System performance was evaluated based on objective metrics (semantic similarity and cosine similarity) and human subjective evaluation from a small user study. Experimental results show that the proposed filtering approach effectively improve the performance. Furthermore the results also show that by combing both EBDM and SMT approaches we could overcome the shortcomings of each.;2014
This paper is a continuation of the work [26] in which the LND dialogue system was proposed. LND reconstructs the dialogical logic introduced by Lorenzen using the terminology of persuasion dialogue games as specified by Prakken [18]. The aim of the LND system is to recognize formal fallacies in natural dialogues and remove them. Now we extend this system to include a new protocol enabling the reconstruction of natural dialogues in which parties can commit formal fallacies. We then present the implementation of the protocols applied.;2014
This paper presents a dialogue system called Lorenzen-Hamblin Natural Dialogue (LHND) in which participants can commit formal fallacies and have a method of both identifying and withdrawing formal fallacies. It therefore provides a tool for the dialectical evaluation of force of argument when players advance reasons which are deductively incorrect. The system is inspired by Hamblin's formal dialectic and Lorenzen's dialogical logic. It offers uniform protocols for Hamblin's and Lorenzen's dialogues and adds a protocol for embedding them. This unification required a reformulation of the original description of Lorenzen's system to distinguish between different stances that a person might take in the discussion as suggested by Hodges. The LHND system is compared to Walton and Krabbe's Complex Persuasion Dialogue using an example of a dialogue.;2014
This paper presents a novel approach to social data analysis exploring the use of microblogging to manage interaction between humans and robots and presenting and evaluating an architecture that extends the use of social networks to connect humans and devices. The approach uses natural language processing - in the form of simple grammar-based techniques - to extract features of interest from textual data retrieved from a microblogging platform in real-time and generate appropriate executable code for the robot. The simple rule-based solution exploits some of the 'natural' constraints imposed by microblogging platforms to manage the potential complexity of the interactions and create bi-directional communication. In order to evaluate the developed system an analysis of real-time user-generated social media data is presented. The analysis demonstrates the feasibility of producing programmes from the social media data which lead to executable actions by a front-end application - an approach of immediate relevance to web-based systems like question-answering engines personal digital assistants and smart home/office devices.

This paper presents a novel Semantic-Based Conversational Agent (SCA). Traditional conversational agents (CA) interpret scripts consisting of structural patterns of sentences which take no consideration of semantic content. The script writer must therefore anticipate the many variations of input the user may respond with during dialogue. This is evidently a high maintenance task. Furthermore different script writers possess differing levels of skill and as such this can prove to be an exasperating task. The proposed SCA interprets scripts consisting of natural language sentences by means of a semantic sentence similarity measure. User input is measured semantically against the natural language sentences of the current context in order to respond with an appropriate output string. Such scripting is effortless and alleviates the burden of the traditional pattern-scripted languages. Experiments have involved the use of script writers to demonstrate the use of the language. Results have highlighted the potential of the language and shown improvements on traditional pattern-scripted languages.;2014
This paper presents an experimental study that analyzes how conversational agents activate human communication in thought-evoking multi-party dialogues between multi-users and multi-agents. A thought-evoking dialogue is a kind of interaction in which agents act to provoke user thinking and it has the potential to activate multi-party interactions. This paper focuses on quiz-style multi-party dialogues between two users and two agents as an example of thought-evoking multi-party dialogues. The experimental results revealed that the presence of a peer agent significantly improved user satisfaction and increased the number of user utterances in quiz-style multi-party dialogues. We also found that agents' empathic expressions significantly improved user satisfaction improved user ratings of the peer agent and increased the number of user utterances. Our findings should be useful for activating multi-party communications in various applications such as pedagogical agents and community facilitators.;2014
This paper presents the design and evaluation of the multipurpose platform for domestic ambient media research and applications through an improved method called wizard-of-oz. Inspired by the increasing requirements for the reuse of valuable development work in intelligent ambient media system and service design we propose a different approach to construct a high-level pseudo platform to support flexible and cost-economic prototype mock-up and test. Based on the platform three incremental ambient media applications were developed for empirical studies and a number of studies were carried out to assess the applicability effectiveness and reusability of this platform within domestic settings. The results showed that this platform has great advantages over conventional systems specifically developed for ambient media research in above aspects. Also the results have provided secondary understanding in the design of future ambient media applications for domestic use including the guidelines for the design of domestic smart conversational system interfaces and user interactions with ambient media.;2014
This paper proposes a domain-independent statistical methodology to develop dialog managers for spoken dialog systems. Our methodology employs a data-driven classification procedure to generate abstract representations of system turns taking into account the previous history of the dialog. A statistical framework is also introduced for the development and evaluation of dialog systems created using the methodology which is based on a dialog simulation technique. The benefits and flexibility of the proposed methodology have been validated by developing statistical dialog managers for four spoken dialog systems of different complexity designed for different languages (English Italian and Spanish) and application domains (from transactional to problem-solving tasks). The evaluation results show that the proposed methodology allows rapid development of new dialog managers as well as to explore new dialog strategies which permit developing new enhanced versions of already existing systems.

This paper proposes a two-phase reanalysis model for understanding user intention in utterances by considering the correlative characteristics between the three attributes relating to user intention. The proposed model comprises two phases. In the first phase each attribute is analyzed in the optimized sequence. The results of the analysis are then used as features that undergo reanalysis in the second phase with the assumption that the relationship between the attributes is correlative. The experiments conducted showed that the proposed model improves user intention analysis over the baseline model with an error reduction rate in Speech Act Concept Sequence and Arguments of 0.64% 14.78% and 5.84% respectively.

This paper reports on the linguistic accuracy of five renowned chatbots with an evaluator (an ESL teacher) chatting with each chatbot for about three hours. The chatting consisted of a series of set questions/statements (determined as being in the domain of an ESL learner) - aimed at assessing the accuracy and felicity of the chatbots' answers at the grammatical level. Results indicate that chatbots are generally able to provide grammatically acceptable answers with three chatbots returning acceptability figures in the 90% range. When meaning is factored in however a different picture emerges with the chatbots often providing meaningless nonsensical answers and the accuracy rate for the joint categories of grammar and meaning falling below 60%. The paper concludes on the note that although chatbots as conversation practice machines do not yet make robust chatting partners improvements in chatbot performance bode well for future developments.;2014
This paper reports the findings of a research project investigating the use of iPods by student nurses to enhance their interactions with content instructors and peers while located at a distance from their university campus. Wireless handheld devices (WHD) are an important tool in nursing environments that are undergoing rapid technological change. Preferred treatments drug dosages postsurgical care and preventive healthcare regimens continually change and such devices allow students to rapidly confirm information while in the clinical area thus fostering active learning and safe practice. A case study approach was adopted with each participating student cohort comprising a case. Multiple data collection methods were used to enable rich descriptions of each case. This paper focusses on factors relating to the use of iPods which influenced student learning in distance courses at two regional Queensland universities. It furthermore highlights a range of creative interventions reported by students and educators in resolving issues with their devices. The study found that connectivity difficulties technology literacy level compatibility of study resources with the WHDs and small screen size were all factors that impacted negatively on the use of iPods in distance courses. The paper describes the responses of students and educators to the use of iPods for learning. This study concluded that nursing students and nursing educators alike may experience problems when WHD's are introduced to courses as a platform for learning. However both students and educators can be innovative and resourceful in managing these problems and when access to course resources that were enabled for viewing on the WHDs were available the learning experience of the students and the teaching experience for the educators were enhanced.

This work presents the development of a robotic wheelchair that can be commanded by users in a supervised way or by a fully automatic unsupervised navigation system. It provides flexibility to choose different modalities to command the wheelchair in addition to be suitable for people with different levels of disabilities. Users can command the wheelchair based on their eye blinks eye movements head movements by sip-and-puff and through brain signals. The wheelchair can also operate like an auto-guided vehicle following metallic tapes or in an autonomous way. The system is provided with an easy to use and flexible graphical user interface onboard a personal digital assistant which is used to allow users to choose commands to be sent to the robotic wheelchair. Several experiments were carried out with people with disabilities and the results validate the developed system as an assistive tool for people with distinct levels of disability.;2014
To provide a spoken interaction between robots and human users an internal representation of the robots sensory information must be available at a semantic level and accessible to a dialogue system in order to be used in a human-like and intuitive manner. In this paper we integrate the fields of perceptual anchoring (which creates and maintains the symbol-percept correspondence of objects) in robotics with multimodal dialogues in order to achieve a fluent interaction between humans and robots when talking about objects. These everyday objects are located in a so-called symbiotic system where humans robots and sensors are co-operating in a home environment. To orchestrate the dialogue system the IrisTK dialogue platform is used. The IrisTK system is based on modelling the interaction of events between different modules e.g. speech recognizer face tracker etc. This system is running on a mobile robot device which is part of a distributed sensor network. A perceptual anchoring framework recognizes objects placed in the home and maintains a consistent identity of the objects consisting of their symbolic and perceptual data. Particular effort is placed on creating flexible dialogues where requests to objects can be made in a variety of ways. Experimental validation consists of evaluating the system when many objects are possible candidates for satisfying these requests.;2014
To reduce lengthy and rigid interactions of menu-driven navigation and keyword searches dialogue systems based on a natural language interface have been developed. Domain action classification is an essential part of a dialogue system because speakers' intentions are determined through the classification process. Although a domain action consists of a tightly associated speech act and a concept sequence previous studies have independently dealt with speech acts and concept sequences in order to simplify the models and this simplification has caused a decrease in performance. A retraining method for improving the domain action classification performance is proposed in order to resolve this problem. The proposed method divides a domain action classification model into a speech act classification model and a concept sequence classification model. The speech act classification model repeatedly uses concept sequence classification model outputs as inputs during training. In the experiments with goal-oriented dialogues the proposed method exhibited a higher accuracy of 0.6% and higher macro F1-measure of 1.7% compared to the SVM and ME models that dealt with speech acts and concept sequences separately. Based on the experimental results it was determined that the proposed method can improve the performance of some representative machine learning models for domain action classification.

To test the impact of method of administration (MOA) on the measurement characteristics of items developed in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Two non-overlapping parallel 8-item forms from each of three PROMIS domains (physical function fatigue and depression) were completed by 923 adults (age 18-89) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease depression or rheumatoid arthritis. In a randomized cross-over design subjects answered one form by interactive voice response (IVR) technology paper questionnaire (PQ) personal digital assistant (PDA) or personal computer (PC) on the Internet and a second form by PC in the same administration. Structural invariance equivalence of item responses and measurement precision were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory methods. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis supported equivalence of factor structure across MOA. Analyses by item response theory found no differences in item location parameters and strongly supported the equivalence of scores across MOA. We found no statistically or clinically significant differences in score levels in IVR PQ or PDA administration as compared to PC. Availability of large item response theory-calibrated PROMIS item banks allowed for innovations in study design and analysis.;2014
Traditional dialogue systems use a fixed silence threshold to detect the end of users' turns. Such a simplistic model can result in system behaviour that is both interruptive and unresponsive which in turn affects user experience. Various studies have observed that human interlocutors take cues from speaker behaviour such as prosody syntax and gestures to coordinate smooth exchange of speaking turns. However little effort has been made towards implementing these models in dialogue systems and verifying how well they model the turn-taking behaviour in human computer interactions. We present a data-driven approach to building models for online detection of suitable feedback response locations in the user's speech. We first collected human computer interaction data using a spoken dialogue system that can perform the Map Task with users (albeit using a trick). On this data we trained various models that use automatically extractable prosodic contextual and lexico-syntactic features for detecting response locations. Next we implemented a trained model in the same dialogue system and evaluated it in interactions with users. The subjective and objective measures from the user evaluation confirm that a model trained on speaker behavioural cues offers both smoother turn-transitions and more responsive system behaviour.

Using mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) smartphones tablet computers etc. to electronically collect malaria-related field data is the way for the field questionnaires in the future. This case study seeks to design a generic survey framework PDA-based geo-tagged malaria-related data collection tool (PGMS) that can be used not only for large-scale community-level geo-tagged electronic malaria-related surveys but also for a wide variety of electronic data collections of other infectious diseases. The framework includes two parts: the database designed for subsequent cross-sectional data analysis and the customized programs for the six study sites (two in Kenya three in Indonesia and one in Tanzania). In addition to the framework development we also present our methods used when configuring and deploying the PDAs to 1) reduce data entry errors 2) conserve battery power 3) field install the programs onto dozens of handheld devices 4) translate electronic questionnaires into local languages 5) prevent data loss and 6) transfer data from PDAs to computers for future analysis and storage. Since 2008 PGMS has successfully accomplished quite a few surveys that recorded 10871 compounds and households 52126 persons and 17100 bed nets from the six sites. These numbers are still growing.;2014
Virtual agents are a real asset in collaborative virtual environment for training (CVET) as they can replace missing team members. Collaboration between such agents and users however is generally limited. We present here a whole integrated model of CVET focusing on the abstraction of the real or virtual nature of the actor to define a homogenous collaboration model. First we define a new collaborative model of interaction. This model notably allows to abstract the real or virtual nature of a teammate. Moreover we propose a new role exchange approach so that actors can swap their roles during training. The model also permits the use of physically based objects and characters animation to increase the realism of the world. Second we design a new communicative agent model which aims at improving collaboration with other actors using dialog to coordinate their actions and to share their knowledge. Finally we evaluated the proposed model to estimate the resulting benefits for the users and we show that this is integrated in existing CVET applications.

We address the problem of dynamically modeling and adapting to unknown users in resource-scarce domains in the context of interactive spoken dialogue systems. As an example we show how a system can learn to choose referring expressions to refer to domain entities for users with different levels of domain expertise and whose domain knowledge is initially unknown to the system. We approach this problem using a three-step process: collecting data using a Wizard-of-Oz method building simulated users and learning to model and adapt to users using Reinforcement Learning techniques. We show that by using only a small corpus of non-adaptive dialogues and user knowledge profiles it is possible to learn an adaptive user modeling policy using a sense-predict-adapt approach. Our evaluation results show that the learned user modeling and adaptation strategies performed better in terms of adaptation than some simple hand-coded baseline policies with both simulated and real users. With real users the learned policy produced around a 20% increase in adaptation in comparison to an adaptive hand-coded baseline. We also show that adaptation to users' domain knowledge results in improving task success (99.47% for the learned policy vs. 84.7% for a hand-coded baseline) and reducing dialogue time of the conversation (11% relative difference). We also compared the learned policy with a variety of carefully hand-crafted adaptive policies that use the user knowledge profiles to adapt their choices of referring expressions throughout a conversation. We show that the learned policy generalizes better to unseen user profiles than these hand-coded policies while having comparable performance on known user profiles. We discuss the overall advantages of this method and how it can be extended to other levels of adaptation such as content selection and dialogue management and to other domains where adapting to users' domain knowledge is useful such as travel and healthcare.;2014
We assessed whether three adults with multiple disabilities could use simple reminding technology to carry out daily activities at the appropriate times. The technology consisted of a Galaxy S-3 mini smartphone (by Samsung) with the application of (a) the talking alarm program for providing verbal instructions about the single activities scheduled (for two participants) or (b) the photo alarm program for providing vibration alerting combined with pictorial instructions about the activities (for the third participant). For each participant the study involved an ABAB sequence in which A represented baseline phases (without technology) and B intervention phases (with technology). All three participants were successful in using the technology to independently perform the activities scheduled (i.e. between seven and 10 per day) at the appropriate times. The practical implications of the findings and the importance of technology resources in programs for people with multiple disabilities are discussed.;2014
We developed a virtual counseling system which can deliver brief alcohol health interventions via a 3D anthropomorphic speech-enabled interface-a new field for spoken dialog interactions with intelligent virtual agents in the health domain. We present our spoken dialog system design and its evaluation. We developed our dialog system based on Markov decision processes framework and optimized it by using reinforcement learning algorithms with data we collected from real user interactions. The system begins to learn optimal dialog strategies for initiative selection and for the type of confirmations that it uses during the interaction. We compared the unoptimized system with the optimized system in terms of objective measures (e.g. task completion) and subjective measures (e.g. ease of use future intention to use the system) and obtained positive results.;2014
We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a 2-week-long ecological momentary intervention (EMI) delivered via personal digital assistants (PDAs) to improve treatment adherence in bipolar disorder. EMIs use mobile technology to deliver treatment as clients engage in their typical daily routines in their usual settings. Overall participants (N = 14) stated that EMI sessions were helpful user-friendly and engaging and reported satisfaction with the timing and burden of sessions as well as the method of delivery. All participants completed the study and all PDAs were returned undamaged. On average participants completed 92% of EMI sessions. Although this study was not designed to assess efficacy depression scores decreased significantly over the study period and data suggest relatively high rates of treatment adherence missed medication was reported 3% of the time and three participants reported missing a total of six mental health appointments. Negative feedback largely involved technical and logistical issues many of which are easily addressable. These preliminary findings add to the growing body of literature indicating that mobile-technology-assisted interventions are feasible to implement and acceptable to patients with serious mental illnesses.;2014
We offer a synopsis and commentary on J. Fanning and colleagues' article Increasing Physical Activity with Mobile Devices: AMeta-Analysis published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Although regular physical activity has a range of benefits very few adults in the USA meet recommended guidelines for daily physical activity. The meta-analysis of Fanning et al. (2012) aimed to synthesize the results of research usingmobile devices to increase physical activity. Their review identified 11 studies that used mobile technologies including short message service (SMS) apps or personal digital assistant (PDA) to improve physical activity behaviors among participants. Fanning et al. conclude that while literature in this area is limited to date there is initial support for the efficacy of mobile-based interventions for improving physical activity. Included studies varied greatly and the majority used only SMS to influence physical behaviors meaning generalization of results to other forms of mobile technologies may be premature. This review does however provide a foundation for understanding how mobile-based interventions may be used efficaciously for the development of future interventions to improve health behaviors.;2014
We present a computational model of incremental grounding including state updates and action selection. The model is inspired by corpus-based examples of overlapping utterances of several sorts including backchannels and completions. The model has also been partially implemented within a virtual human system that includes incremental understanding and can be used to track grounding and provide overlapping verbal and non-verbal behaviors from a listener before a speaker has completed her utterance.;2014
We present and evaluate a novel approach to natural language generation (NLG) in statistical spoken dialogue systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimization framework for incremental information presentation (IP) where there is a trade-off to be solved between presenting enough information to the user while keeping the utterances short and understandable. The trained IP model is adaptive to variation from the current generation context (e. g. a user and a non-deterministic sentence planner) and it incrementally adapts the IP policy at the turn level. Reinforcement learning is used to automatically optimize the IP policy with respect to a data-driven objective function. In a case study on presenting restaurant information we show that an optimized IP strategy trained on Wizard-of-Oz data outperforms a baseline mimicking the wizard behavior in terms of total reward gained. The policy is then also tested with real users and improves on a conventional hand-coded IP strategy used in a deployed SDS in terms of overall task success. The evaluation found that the trained IP strategy significantly improves dialogue task completion for real users with up to a 8.2% increase in task success. This methodology also provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem which has previously been treated as a module following dialogue management with no access to lower-level context features (e. g. from a surface realizer and/or speech synthesizer).;2014
We present work on understanding natural language in a situated domain in an incremental word-by-word fashion. We explore a set of models specified as Markov Logic Networks and show that a model that has access to information about the visual context during an utterance its discourse context the words of the utterance as well as the linguistic structure of the utterance performs best and is robust to noisy speech input. We explore the incremental properties of the models and offer some analysis. We conclude that MLNS provide a promising framework for specifying such models in a general possibly domain-independent way. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2014
We report progress towards developing a sensor module that categorizes types of laughter for application in dialogue systems or social-skills training situations. The module will also function as a component to measure discourse engagement in natural conversational speech. This paper presents the results of an analysis into the sounds of human laughter in a very large corpus of naturally occurring conversational speech and our classification of the laughter types according to social function. Various types of laughter were categorized into either polite or genuinely mirthful categories and the analysis of these laughs forms the core of this report. Statistical analysis of the acoustic features of each laugh was performed and a Principal Component Analysis and Classification Tree analysis were performed to determine the main contributing factors in each case. A statistical model was then trained using a Support Vector Machine to predict the most likely category for each laugh in both speaker-specific and speaker-independent manner. Better than 70% accuracy was obtained in automatic classification tests. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2014
Whilst common sense knowledge has been well researched in terms of intelligence and (in particular) artificial intelligence specific factual knowledge also plays a critical part in practice. When it comes to testing for intelligence testing for factual knowledge is in every-day life frequently used as a front line tool. This paper presents new results which were the outcome of a series of practical Turing tests held on 23rd June 2012 at Bletchley Park England. The focus of this paper is on the employment of specific knowledge testing by interrogators. Of interest are prejudiced assumptions made by interrogators as to what they believe should be widely known and subsequently the conclusions drawn if an entity does or does not appear to know a particular fact known to the interrogator. The paper is not at all about the performance of machines or hidden humans but rather the strategies based on assumptions of Turing test interrogators. Full unedited transcripts from the tests are shown for the reader as working examples. As a result it might be possible to draw critical conclusions with regard to the nature of human concepts of intelligence in terms of the role played by specific factual knowledge in our understanding of intelligence whether this is exhibited by a human or a machine. This is specifically intended as a position paper firstly by claiming that practicalising Turing's test is a useful exercise throwing light on how we humans think and secondly by taking a potentially controversial stance because some interrogators adopt a solipsist questioning style of hidden entities with a view that it is a thinking intelligent human if it thinks like them and knows what they know. The paper is aimed at opening discussion with regard to the different aspects considered.;2014
With Internet access no longer restricted to desktop and laptop computers job applicants now have the opportunity to complete remotely delivered assessments on mobile handheld small screen devices such as smartphones and personal digital assistants. In this study a large dataset is used to investigate demographic and score differences between job applicants who completed a remotely delivered high-stakes assessment on a mobile device and those who completed it on a nonmobile device. Based on a sample of 3575207 job applicants who completed an unproctored Internet-based assessment between January 2011 and April 2012 the percentage of applicants completing the assessment on a mobile device was small 1.93% but nevertheless represented more than 69000 people. Overall there were small test-taker demographic differences in the use of mobile devices versus nonmobile devices in that mobile devices were slightly more likely to be used by women African-Americans and Hispanics and younger applicants. Scores on a personality measure were similar for mobile and nonmobile devices but scores on a general mental ability test were substantially lower for mobile devices. Tests of measurement invariance also indicated equivalence across the mobile and nonmobile samples. Test taker and organizational implications for completing remotely delivered high-stakes noncognitive and cognitive assessments on mobile versus nonmobile devices are discussed.;2014
With the aim of assessing the secondary benefits of using electronic identification (e-ID) in sheep farms we compared the use of manual (M) semiautomatic (SA) and automatic (AU) data-collection systems for performance recording (i.e. milk lambing and weight) in 3 experiments. Ewes were identified with visual ear tags and electronic rumen boluses. The M system consisted of visual ear tags on-paper data recording and manual data uploading to a computer the use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) for data recording and data uploading was also done in M. The SA system used a handheld reader (HHR) for e-ID data recording and uploading. Both PDA and HHR used Bluetooth for uploading. The AU system was only used for body weight recording and consisted of e-ID data recording in an electronic scale and data uploading. In experiment 1 M and SA milk-recording systems were compared in a flock of 48 dairy ewes. Ewes were milked once-(x 1 n = 24) or twice-(x2 n = 24) daily in a 2 x 12 milking parlor and processed in groups of 24. Milk yield (1.21 +/- 0.04 L/d on average) was 36% lower in x1 than x2 ewes and milk recording time correlated positively with milk yield (R-2 = 0.71). Data transfer was markedly faster for FDA and HHR than for M. As a result overall milk recording time was faster in SA (x1 = 12.1 +/- 0.6 min/24 ewes x2 = 22.1 +/- 0.9 min/24 ewes) than M (x1 = 14.9 +/- 0.6 min/24 ewes x2 = 27.9 +/- 1.0 min/24 ewes). No differences between PDA and HHR were detected. Time savings with regard to M were greater for x2 than for x 1 (5.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.1 min per 24 ewes respectively) but similar for FDA and HHR. Data transfer errors averaged 3.6% in M whereas no errors were found in either SA system. In experiment 2 73 dairy and 80 meat ewes were monitored at lambing using M and SA. Overall time for lambing recording was greater in M than SA in dairy (1.67 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.87 +/- 0.04 min/ewe) and meat (1.30 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.03 min/ewe) ewes. Recording errors were greater in dairy (9.6%) than in meat (1.9%) ewes. Data uploading errors only occurred in M (4.9%). In experiment 3 120 dairy and 120 meat ewes were weighed using M and AU systems. In both flocks mean BW recording and data uploading times as well as overall BW recording time (0.63 +/- 0.02 and 0.25 +/- 0.01 min/ewe respectively) were greater in M than in AU and uploading errors only occurred in M (8.8%). In conclusion HHR and PDA systems were time-effective for performance recording both saving time and improving data accuracy. Working load and time for ewe identification were faster in HHR but it did not affect the performance recording time. The FDA was the fastest device for data download. Further research will evaluate the costs of implementing e-ID for performance recording and other uses in sheep farms.;2014
With the implementation of Electronic Health Record (EHR) the patients' health information will reside on the network of computers that can be accessed through a variety of techniques and technologies. One of the widely used present-day communication technology is the mobile/cell phone that has great potential in the healthcare delivery and management as the healthcare providers can remotely access electronically stored health information of patients from anywhere anytime. One of the greatest advantages of the mobile health technology is convenience of time-independent communication from geographically distant places with the healthcare centers and patients that enhances healthcare quality at reduced cost. However its equally great disadvantage lies in sending and receiving the health information wirelessly through atmosphere which can be easily intercepted eavesdropped interjected modified or even destroyed.;2014
A Multiple-input multiple-output antenna array with two radiating elements having a wide bandwidth is reported in this work. Spatial diversity has been introduced to achieve the diversity gain and the array was kept compact by introducing five parasitic decoupling elements on the bottom of the substrate each having a length equal to /2 at a specific frequency. Each resonant element offers a resonant bandwidth of 1 GHz starting from 3 GHz to 8.5 GHz. Good agreement between the measured and simulated results shows that the antenna system performs very well over the frequency range 3 GHz to 8.5 GHz. In addition an isolation of more than 15 dB is achieved with the help of the parasitic elements while keeping an edge-to-edge and center-to-center separation of 4 mm and 19 mm respectively. The proposed antenna measures 26 x 40.5 mm(2) and it is suitable for handheld devices personal digital assistants next generation home entertainment systems and robots.

A new dialogue management model for affective dialogue system which aims to provide a service of information inquiry and affective interaction is proposed in this paper. First we construct two finite state machines (TFSM) to model the user and the system respectively and simulate the dialogue process as an information exchange between the two state machines. All possible state transitions in dialogue and its probabilities of the user are summarized as a user model which is helpful for the system to inference and predict the user's internal states. Second we further discuss the implementation methods of information inquiry and emotional response modules. Finally we employ the return function of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) model to analyze and evaluate the TFSM-based dialogue management model. The experimental results not only show the relationships between the average returns recognition error rates and state transition probabilities but also confirm that our TFSM-based dialogue management model outperforms the conventional FSM model.

A new grid load frequency control approach is proposed for the doubly fed induction generator based wind power plants. The load frequency control issue in a power system is undergoing fundamental changes due to the rapidly growing amount of wind energy conversation system and concentrating on maintaining generation-load balance and disturbance rejection. The prominent feature of the linear active disturbance rejection control approach is that the total disturbance can be estimated and then eliminated in real time. And thus it is a feasible solution to deal with the load frequency control issue. In this paper the application of the linear active disturbance rejection control approach in the load frequency control issue for a complex power system with wind energy conversation system based on doubly fed induction generator is investigated. The load frequency control issue is formulated as a decentralized multi-objective optimization control problem the solution to which is solved by the hybrid particle swarm optimization technique. To show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme the robust performance testing based on Monte-Carlo approach is carried out. The performance superiority of the system with the proposed linear active disturbance rejection control approach over that with the traditional proportional integral and fuzzy-proportional integral-based controllers is validated by the simulation results.

A novel method for forecasting technology success based on patent data is proposed. Four criteria technology life cycle diffusion speed patent power and expansion potential are considered for technology forecasting. Patent power and expansion potential are considered as technology scope indicators. A data fusion algorithm is applied to combine the results obtained from different criteria. The usefulness and potential of the proposed forecasting approach has been demonstrated using all U.S. patents related to three technologies namely thin film transistor-liquid crystal display flash memory system and personal digital assistant. The results obtained from these patents demonstrate that the personal digital assistant technology is preferred over other technologies. Investments in thin film transistor liquid-crystal display and flash memory system technologies have equal priority. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2015
A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of electronic portable assistive devices (EPADs) for people with acquired brain injury. A systematic database search (OVID CINAHL) found 541 citations published between 1989 and the end of 2012. A total of 23 reports met the inclusion/exclusion criteria namely intervention studies (group n-of-1) testing the efficacy of EPADs as compensatory devices for cognitive impairment for people with acquired brain injury aged 16-65 years. Study quality was rated by the PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale (randomised controlled trials) the Downes and Black tool (other group intervention studies) and the Single Case Experimental Design tool (single participant studies). Levels of evidence were determined using five levels of classification based on the Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Evidence table. Results found no Level 1 studies (RCTs with PEDro score >= 6) four Level 2 studies and 10 Level 3 studies. There was insufficient evidence to recommend any practice standards but sufficient evidence to recommend the use of electronic reminder systems in supporting the everyday functioning of people with acquired brain injury as a practice guideline. Higher quality studies are required to support a broader range of compensatory roles that EPADs have the potential to play in neurorehabilitation and the long-term support of people with acquired brain injury.;2015
Affective Computing aims at improving the naturalness of human-computer interactions by integrating the socio-emotional component in the interaction. The use of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) - virtual characters interacting with humans - is a key answer to this issue. On the one hand the ECA has to take into account the human emotional behaviours and social attitudes. On the other hand the ECA has to display socio-emotional behaviours with relevance. In this paper we provide an overview of computational methods used for user's socio-emotional behaviour analysis and of human-agent interaction strategies by questioning the ambivalent status of surprise. We focus on the computational models and on the methods we use to detect user's emotion through language and speech processing and present a study investigating the role of surprise in the ECA's answer.;2015
Alignment is a phenomenon observed in human conversation: Dialog partners' behavior converges in many respects. Such alignment has been proposed to be automatic and the basis for communicating successfully. Recent research on human-computer dialog promotes a mediated communicative design account of alignment according to which the extent of alignment is influenced by interlocutors' beliefs about each other. Our work aims at adding to these findings in two ways. (a) Our work investigates alignment of manual actions instead of lexical choice. (b) Participants interact with the iCub humanoid robot instead of an artificial computer dialog system. Our results confirm that alignment also takes place in the domain of actions. We were not able to replicate the results of the original study in general in this setting but in accordance with its findings participants with a high questionnaire score for emotional stability and participants who are familiar with robots align their actions more to a robot they believe to be basic than to one they believe to be advanced. Regarding alignment over the course of an interaction the extent of alignment seems to remain constant when participants believe the robot to be advanced but it increases over time when participants believe the robot to be a basic version.;2015
Appropriate turn-taking is important in spoken dialogue systems as well as generating correct responses. Especially if the dialogue features quick responses a user utterance is often incorrectly segmented due to short pauses within it by voice activity detection (VAD). Incorrectly segmented utterances cause problems both in the automatic speech recognition (ASR) results and turn-taking: i.e. an incorrect VAD result leads to ASR errors and causes the system to start responding though the user is still speaking. We develop a method that performs a posteriori restoration for incorrectly segmented utterances and implement it as a plug-in for the MMDAgent open-source software. A crucial part of the method is to classify whether the restoration is required or not. We cast it as a binary classification problem of detecting originally single utterances from pairs of utterance fragments. Various features are used representing timing prosody and ASR result information. Experiments show that the proposed method outperformed a baseline with manually-selected features by 4.8% and 3.9% in cross-domain evaluations with two domains. More detailed analysis revealed that the dominant and domain-independent features were utterance intervals and results from the Gaussian mixture model (GMM).;2015
Augmented reality augmented television and second screen are cutting edge technologies that provide end users extra and enhanced information related to certain events in real time. This enriched information helps users better understand such events at the same time providing a more satisfactory experience. In the present paper we apply this main idea to human-robot interaction (HRI) to how users and robots interchange information. The ultimate goal of this paper is to improve the quality of HRI developing a new dialog manager system that incorporates enriched information from the semantic web. This work presents the augmented robotic dialog system (ARDS) which uses natural language understanding mechanisms to provide two features: (i) a non-grammar multimodal input (verbal and/or written) text and (ii) a contextualization of the information conveyed in the interaction. This contextualization is achieved by information enrichment techniques that link the extracted information from the dialog with extra information about the world available in semantic knowledge bases. This enriched or contextualized information (information enrichment semantic enhancement or contextualized information are used interchangeably in the rest of this paper) offers many possibilities in terms of HRI. For instance it can enhance the robot's pro-activeness during a human-robot dialog (the enriched information can be used to propose new topics during the dialog while ensuring a coherent interaction). Another possibility is to display additional multimedia content related to the enriched information on a visual device. This paper describes the ARDS and shows a proof of concept of its applications.;2015
Autonomous robots are increasingly interacting with users who have limited knowledge of robotics and are likely to have an erroneous mental model of the robot's workings capabilities and internal structure. The robot's real capabilities may diverge from this mental model to the extent that one might accuse the robot's manufacturer of deceiving the user especially in cases where the user naturally tends to ascribe exaggerated capabilities to the machine (e.g. conversational systems in elder-care contexts or toy robots in child care). This poses the question whether misleading or even actively deceiving the user of an autonomous artifact about the capabilities of the machine is morally bad and why. By analyzing trust autonomy and the erosion of trust in communicative acts as consequences of deceptive robot behavior we formulate four criteria that must be fulfilled in order for robot deception to be morally permissible and in some cases even morally indicated.;2015
Background and objectives Inappropriate medication use is common in the care of patients with CKD. The feasibility of a simple mobile health tool designed to advise patients on safe medication usage in CKD was examined. Design setting participants & measurements Participants with predialysis CKD (defined as eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) in the Safe Kidney Care Cohort Study were recruited for home usability testing of a novel medication inquiry system between January and September of 2013. Testing was through two mobile platforms: (1) short messaging service text or (2) personal digital assistant (e.g. iPod Touch). Twenty participants (one half assigned to one device and one half assigned to the other device) were enrolled and received an in-center tutorial on device usage before the end of the study visit. Participants were subsequently mailed three sample pill bottles with the name of randomly selected medications and asked to input these medications into the medication inquiry system. The medication inquiry system response options were as follows: (1) safe in CKD (2) not safe in CKD (3) use with caution/speak with your health care provider or (4) error message (for an incorrectly inputted medication). Participants were asked to record the response issued by the medication inquiry system for each medication sent for usability testing. A user satisfaction survey was administered after completion of the protocol. Results All participants owned a mobile telephone but few owned a smartphone. Of 60 total medication queries there were only three recorded errors two of which occurred in the short messaging service texting group. Overall satisfaction with the application was high with slightly higher satisfaction noted in the personal digital assistant group compared with the short messaging service group. Conclusions The mobile health medication inquiry system application had general ease of use and high acceptance across two platforms among individuals representative of the CKD population. Tailored mobile health technology may improve medication safety in CKD.;2015
Background: An understanding of eating behaviors is an important element of health education and treatment in clinical populations. To understand the biopsychosocial profile of eating behaviors in an ecologically valid way ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is appropriate because its use is able to overcome the recall bias in patient-reported outcomes (PROs). As appetite is a key PRO associated with eating behaviors this study was done to develop an EMA scale to evaluate the within-individual variation of momentary appetite and uses this scale to discuss the relationships between appetite and various psychological factors. Methods: Twenty healthy participants (age 23.6 +/- 4.2 years old) wore a watch-type computer for a week. Several times a day including just before and after meals they recorded their momentary psychological stress mood states and ten items related to appetite. In addition they recorded everything they ate and drank into a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based food diary. Multilevel factor analysis was used to investigate the factor structure of the scale and the reliability and validity of the scale were also explored. Results: Multilevel factor analyses found two factors at the within-individual level (hunger/fullness and cravings) and one factor at the between-individual level. Medians for the individually calculated Cronbach's alphas were 0.89 for hunger/fullness 0.71 for cravings and 0.86 for total appetite (the sum of all items). Hunger/fullness cravings and total appetite all decreased significantly after meals compared with those before meals and hunger/fullness cravings and total appetite before meals were positively associated with energy intake. There were significant negative associations between both hunger/fullness and total appetite and anxiety and depression as well as between cravings and depression anxiety and stress. Conclusions: The within-individual reliability of the EMA scale to assess momentary appetite was confirmed in most subjects and it was also validated as a useful tool to understand eating behaviors in daily settings. Further refinement of the scale is necessary and further investigations need to be conducted particularly on clinical populations.;2015
Background: Dietary intake assessment with diet records (DR) is a standard research and practice tool in nutrition. Manual entry and analysis of DR is time-consuming and expensive. New electronic tools for diet entry by clients and research participants may reduce the cost and effort of nutrient intake estimation. Objective: To determine the validity of electronic diet recording we compared responses to 3-day DR kept by Tap & Track software for the Apple iPod Touch and records kept on the Nutrihand website to DR coded and analyzed by a research dietitian into a customized US Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutrient analysis program entitled GRAND (Grand Forks Research Analysis of Nutrient Data). Methods: Adult participants (n=19) enrolled in a crossover-designed clinical trial. During each of two washout periods participants kept a written 3-day DR. In addition they were randomly assigned to enter their DR in a Web-based dietary analysis program (Nutrihand) or a handheld electronic device (Tap & Track). They completed an additional 3-day DR and the alternate electronic diet recording methods during the second washout. Entries resulted in 228 daily diet records or 12 for each of 19 participants. Means of nutrient intake were calculated for each method. Concordance of the intake estimates were determined by Bland-Altman plots. Coefficients of determination (R-2) were calculated for each comparison to assess the strength of the linear relationship between methods. Results: No significant differences were observed between the mean nutrient values for energy carbohydrate protein fat saturated fatty acids total fiber or sodium between the recorded DR analyzed in GRAND and either Nutrihand or Tap & Track or for total sugars comparing GRAND and Tap & Track. Reported values for total sugars were significantly reduced (P<.05) comparing Nutrihand to GRAND. Coefficients of determination (R-2) for Nutrihand and Tap & Track compared to DR entries into GRAND respectively were energy .56 .01 carbohydrate .58 .08 total fiber .65 .37 sugar .78 .41 protein .44 .03 fat .36.03 saturated fatty acids .23.03 sodium .20 .00 and for Nutrihand only for cholesterol .88 vitamin A .02 vitamin C .37 calcium .05 and iron .77. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrates high variability in individual responses for both electronic capture programs with higher 95% limits of agreement for dietary intake recorded on Tap & Track. Conclusions: In comparison to dietitian-entered 3-day DR electronic methods resulted in no significant difference in mean nutrient estimates but exhibited larger variability particularly the Tap & Track program. However electronic DR provided mean estimates of energy macronutrients and some micronutrients which approximated those of the dietitian-analyzed DR and may be appropriate for dietary monitoring of groups. Electronic diet assessment methods have the potential to reduce the cost and burden of DR analysis for nutrition research and clinical practice.;2015
Background: Evidence supports the role of feedback in reinforcing motivation for behavior change. Feedback that provides reinforcement has the potential to increase dietary self-monitoring and enhance attainment of recommended dietary intake. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of daily feedback (DFB) messages delivered remotely on changes in dietary intake. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the Self-Monitoring And Recording using Technology (SMART) Trial a single-center 24-month randomized clinical trial of behavioral treatment for weight loss. Participants included 210 obese adults (mean body mass index 34.0 kg/m(2)) who were randomized to either a paper diary (PD) personal digital assistant (PDA) or PDA plus daily tailored feedback messages (PDA + FB). To determine the role of daily tailored feedback in dietary intake we compared the self-monitoring with DFB group (DFB group n = 70) with the self-monitoring without DFB group (no-DFB group n = 140). All participants received a standard behavioral intervention for weight loss. Self-reported changes in dietary intake were compared between the DFB and no-DFB groups and were measured at baseline and at 6 12 18 and 24 months. Linear mixed modeling was used to examine percentage changes in dietary intake from baseline. Results: Compared with the no-DFB group the DFB group achieved a larger reduction in energy (-22.8% vs -14.0% P = .02) and saturated fat (-11.3% vs -0.5% P = .03) intake and a trend toward a greater decrease in total fat intake (-10.4% vs -4.7% P = .09). There were significant improvements over time in carbohydrate intake and total fat intake for both groups (P values < .05). Conclusion: Daily tailored feedback messages designed to target energy and fat intake and delivered remotely in real time using mobile devices may play an important role in the reduction of energy and fat intake.;2015
Background: Plant breeding and genetics demand fast exact and reproducible phenotyping. Efficient statistical evaluation of phenotyping data requires standardised data storage ensuring long-term data availability while maintaining intellectual property rights. This is state of the art at phenomics centres which however are unavailable for most scientists. For them we developed a simple and cost-efficient system the Phenotyper which employs mobile devices or personal digital assistants (PDA) for on-site data entry and open-source software for data management. Results: A graphical user interface (GUI) on a PDA replaces paper-based form sheet and data entry on a desktop. The user can define his phenotyping schemes in a web tool without in-depth knowledge of the system and thus adjust it more easily to new research aspects than in a classical laboratory information management system (LIMS). In the Phenotyper schemes are built from controlled vocabulary gained from published ontologies. Vocabulary and schemes are stored in a database that also manages the user access. From the web page schemes are downloaded as extended markup language (XML) files for the transfer to the PDA and the exchange between users. On the PDA the GUI displays the schemes and stores data in comma separated value format and XML format. After manual quality control data are uploaded via a web page to an independently hosted results database in which data are stored in an entity-attribute-value structure to provide maximum flexibility. Datasets are linked to the original and curated data files stored on a file server. The ownership stamp project affiliation and date stamp of a dataset are used to regulate data access which is restricted to data belonging to the user or to his projects and data for which the embargo period has ended. By export of standardised ASCII reports to long-term data storage facility long-term accessibility allows searching citing and use of raw data beyond the lifetime of the database. The Phenotyper is available to the scientific community for use and further development. Conclusions: The Phenotyper provides a well-structured but flexible data acquisition and management structure for mobile on-site measurements for efficient evaluation and shared use of data.;2015
Background: Studies of rape of women seldom distinguish between men's participation in acts of single and multiple perpetrator rape. Multiple perpetrator rape (MPR) occurs globally with serious consequences for women. In South Africa it is a cultural practice with defined circumstances in which it commonly occurs. Prevention requires an understanding of whether it is a context specific intensification of single perpetrator rape or a distinctly different practice of different men. This paper aims to address this question. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional household study with a multi-stage randomly selected sample of 1686 men aged 18-49 who completed a questionnaire administered using an Audio-enhanced Personal Digital Assistant. We attempted to fit an ordered logistic regression model for factors associated with rape perpetration. Results: 27.6 % of men had raped and 8.8 % had perpetrated multiple perpetrator rape (MPR). Thus 31.9 % of men who had ever raped had done so with other perpetrators. An ordered regression model was fitted showing that the same associated factors albeit at higher prevalence are associated with SPR and MPR. Conclusions: Multiple perpetrator rape appears as an intensified form of single perpetrator rape rather than a different form of rape. Prevention approaches need to be mainstreamed among young men.;2015
Background: Systems and tools are needed to identify and mitigate preconception health (PCH) risks particularly for African American (AA) women given persistent health disparities. We developed and tested Gabby an online preconception conversational agent system. Methods: One hundred nongravid AA women 18-34 years of age were screened for over 100 PCH risks and randomized to the Gabby or control group. The Gabby group interacted with the system for up to six months the control group received a letter indicating their health risks with a recommendation to talk with their clinician. The numbers proportions and types of risks were compared between groups. Results: There were 23.7 (SD 5.9) risks identified per participant. Eighty-five percent (77 of 91) provided 6 month follow up data. The Gabby group had greater reductions in the number (8.3 vs. 5.5 risks P < .05) and the proportion (27.8% vs 20.5% P < 0.01) of risks compared to controls. The Gabby group averaged 63.7 minutes of interaction time. Seventy-eight percent reported that it was easy to talk to Gabby and 64% used information from Gabby to improve their health. Conclusion: Gabby was significantly associated with preconception risk reduction. More research is needed to determine if Gabby can benefit higher risk populations and if risk reduction is clinically significant.;2015
Background: The use of smartphones e-mail and the Internet has affected virtually all areas of patient care. Current university and hospital policies concerning the use of devices may be incongruent with day-to-day patient care. Purpose: The goal was to assess the current usage patterns of the Internet e-mail and personal electronics for clinical purposes by surgical residents as well as their communication habits and preferences. Also assessed was residents' knowledge regarding the institutional policies surrounding these issues. Methods: Surgical residents (n = 294) at a large teaching institution were surveyed regarding their knowledge of university policies as well as daily use of various communication technologies. Communication preferences were determined using theoretical clinical scenarios. Results: Our survey with a response rate of 54.7% (n = 161) revealed that 93.8% of participants indicated daily Internet use for clinical duties. Most respondents (72%) were either completely unaware of the existence of guidelines for its use or aware but had no familiarity with their content. Use of e-mail for clinical duties was common (85%) and 74% of the respondents rated e-mail as very important or extremely important for patient care. Everyone who responded had a mobile phone with 98.7% being smartphones which the majority (82.9%) stated was very important or extremely important for patient care. Text messaging was the primary communication method for 57.8% of respondents. The traditional paging system was the primary communication method for only 1.3% of respondents and the preferred method for none. Conclusions: Daily use of technology is the norm among residents however knowledge of university guidelines was exceedingly low. Residents need better education regarding current guidelines. Current guidelines do not reflect current clinical practice. Hospitals should consider abandoning the traditional paging system and consider facilitating better use of residents' mobile phones.;2015
Background: To describe a study design that focuses on risk factors and patterns of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Methods: A 2-year single centre observational study was conducted in Guangzhou in China. The study enrolled 318 subjects with COPD aged 40-79 years stratified into different but equally sized groups according to global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) stage (including Stage 0) and 86 lung healthy controls. An assessment each year was scheduled including questionnaires lung function testing Chest X-ray and blood collection. A sub-group called sub-group X consisting of 203 subjects with COPD and 51 lung healthy controls was selected to answer a symptom questionnaire daily (EXACT-PRO) via a BlackBerry Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) device. Upon an alert that indicated a change in daily symptom pattern the patients were contacted by the clinic to decide whether they had experienced an exacerbation and should have an extra visit within 24-48 hours. At an extra visit nasal and throat swabs induced sputum and blood were collected. Air pollution temperature and humidity were also monitored daily. A subset of sub-group X called sub-group M that consisted of 52 COPD patients and 15 healthy controls was dedicated to measure muscle strength and a dexa scan. Results: More than 78% of the enrolled patients completed the study successfully. There appeared a difference between the patient groups and the controls in gender age body mass index (BMI) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) FEV1/FVC and smoking at baseline. In sub-group X 90 out of 203 (44.4%) selected COPD patients developed one or more exacerbations in the 2-year observation period. They were more severe COPD patients according to GOLD stage at study start. On average most exacerbations occurred in the month March and the least number of exacerbations occurred in October. Conclusions: This study with the obtained patient dataset will allow a better insight in many aspects of exacerbations in COPD (e.g. the identification the risk factors phenotypes and the biomarkers).;2015
Background: With the increasing penetration of digital mobile devices among adolescents mobile texting messaging is emerging as a new channel for patient-clinician communication for this population. In particular it can promote active communication between healthcare clinicians and adolescents with asthma. However little is known about the content of the messages exchanged in medical encounters via mobile text messaging. Therefore this study explored the content of text messaging between clinicians and adolescents with asthma. Materials and Methods: We collected a total of 2953 text messages exchanged between 5 nurse case managers and 131 adolescents with asthma through a personal digital assistant. The text messages were coded using a scheme developed by adapting categories from the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Results: Nurse case managers sent more text messages (n=2639) than adolescents with asthma. Most messages sent by nurse case managers were targeted messages (n=2475) directed at all adolescents with asthma whereas there were relatively few tailored messages (n=164) that were created personally for an individual adolescent. In addition both targeted and tailored messages emphasized task-focused behaviors over socioemotional behaviors. Likewise text messages (n=314) sent by adolescents also emphasized task-focused over socioemotional behaviors. Conclusions: Mobile texting messaging has the potential to play an important role in patient-clinician communication. It promotes not only active interaction but also patient-centered communication with clinicians. In order to achieve this potential healthcare clinicians may need to focus on socioemotional communication as well as task-oriented communication.;2015
Based on a philosophy of integrating components from multimodal interaction applications with 3D graphical environments reusing already defined markup language for describing graphics graphical and spoken interactions based on the interactive movie metaphor a markup language for modeling scenes behavior and interaction is sought. With the definition of this language we hope to have a common framework for developing applications that allow multimodal interaction at 3D stages. Thus we have defined the basis of an architecture that allows us to integrate the components of such multimodal interaction applications in 3D virtual environments.;2015
Building on literature related to selling and embodied conversational agents (ECA) this research seeks to determine how the use of an ECA might improve users' perceptions of shopping value (hedonic and utilitarian) and the consequences for theft purchase intentions and satisfaction with the website. This analysis focuses specifically on three ECA usage consequences: playfulness decision quality and social presence. Hedonic value mediates the effects of playfulness and social presence on satisfaction and behavioral intentions utilitarian shopping value mediates the effects of decision quality. The results highlight the importance of accounting for both utilitarian and hedonic features to understand ECA outputs in e-commerce sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved;2015
Counseling for information technology (IT) personnel lies at the intersection between the software development ecosystem where IT employees collaborate professionally and the social ecosystem where they communicate with each other to share the success or handle the failure of software development. Today counseling has become a major issue in the IT industry since the success rate of IT system development projects is as low as 30 % and more than 60 % of IT professionals suffer from anxiety or other emotional problems. This paper describes a conversational agent aiming to replace human counselors assisting IT personnel in software development ecosystems toward future deployment to social ecosystems. Utilizing IT domain ontology knowledge our agent automatically adapts the vocabulary used in its responses according to the context and to the current phase of the conversation. Using context-based reflection support knowledge the agent generates its response consisting of (1) chatterbot-like mirroring/rewording for context sharing and (2) newly proposed context-respectful mechanism of prompts for context narrowing/digging to help a client discover problems and become aware of their solutions via deep reflections of IT personnel undergoing counseling. Knowledge focusing on a single domain such as IT counseling domain and context-based/context-respectful reflection allow our counseling agent to work properly without having to acquire and manage a huge amount of knowledge. Experimental results show that clients interact with our agent on average two times longer than they do with ELIZA-style conversational agents also a questionnaire-based validation has shown the average value of questionnaire's result was agree side for our agent but disagree side for ELIZA-style conversational agents. Therefore the user acceptance level of our agent is much higher than that of conventional chatterbots.;2015
Current validated methods for dietary assessment rely on self-report which tends to be inaccurate timeconsuming and burdensome. The objective of this work was to demonstrate the suitability of estimating energy intake using individually-calibrated models based on Counts of Chews and Swallows (CCS models). In a laboratory setting subjects consumed three identical meals (training meals) and a fourth meal with different content (validation meal). Energy intake was estimated by four different methods: weighed food records (gold standard) diet diaries photographic food records and CCS models. Counts of chews and swallows were measured using wearable sensors and video analysis. Results for the training meals demonstrated that CCS models presented the lowest reporting bias and a lower error as compared to diet diaries. For the validation meal CCS models showed reporting errors that were not different from the diary or the photographic method. The increase in error for the validation meal may be attributed to differences in the physical properties of foods consumed during training and validation meals. However this may be potentially compensated for by including correction factors into the models. This study suggests that estimation of energy intake from CCS may offer a promising alternative to overcome limitations of self-report. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2015
Due to the mobile Internet revolution people tend to browse the Web while driving their car which puts the driver's safety at risk. Therefore an intuitive and non-distractive in-car speech interface to the Web needs to be developed. Before developing a new speech dialog system (SDS) in a new domain developers have to examine the user's preferred interaction style and its influence on driving safety. This paper reports a driving simulation study which was conducted to compare different speech-based in-car human machine interface concepts concerning usability and driver distraction. The applied SDS prototypes were developed to perform an online hotel booking by speech while driving. The speech dialog prototypes were based on different speech dialog strategies: a command-based and a conversational dialog. Different graphical user interface (GUI) concepts (one including a human-like avatar) were designed in order to support the respective dialog strategy the most and to evaluate the effect of the GUI on usability and driver distraction. The results show that only few differences concerning speech dialog quality were found when comparing the speech dialog strategies. The command-based dialog was slightly better accepted than the conversational dialog which seems to be due to the high concept error rate of the conversational dialog. A SDS without GUI also seems to be feasible for the driving environment and was accepted by the users. The comparison of speech dialog strategies did not reveal differences in driver distraction. However the use of a GUI impaired the driving performance and increased gaze-based distraction. The presence of an avatar was not appreciated by participants and did not affect the dialog performance. Concerning driver distraction the virtual agent did neither negatively affect the driving performance nor increase visual distraction. The results implicate that in-car SDS developers should take both speaking styles into consideration when designing an SDS for information exchange tasks. Furthermore developers have to consider reducing the content presented on the screen in order to reduce driver distraction. A human-like avatar was not appreciated by users while driving. Research should further investigate if other kinds of avatars might achieve different results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2015
Due to the technological evolution and the increasing popularity of smartphones people can access an application using authentication based on biometric approaches from many different devices. Device interoperability is a very challenging problem for biometrics which needs to be further studied. In this paper we focus on interoperability device compensation for online signature verification since this biometric trait is gaining a significant interest in banking and commercial sector in the last years. The proposed approach is based on two main stages. The first one is a preprocessing stage where data acquired from different devices are processed in order to normalize the signals in similar ranges. The second one is based on feature selection taking into account the device interoperability case in order to select to select features which are robust in these conditions. This proposed approach has been successfully applied in a similar way to two common system approaches in online signature verification i.e. a global features-based system and a time functions-based system. Experiments are carried out using Biosecure DS2 (Wacom device) and DS3 (Personal Digital Assistant mobile device) dynamic signature data sets which take into account multisession and two different scenarios emulating real operation conditions. The performance of the proposed global features-based and time functions-based systems applying the two main stages considered in this paper have provided an average relative improvement of performance of 60.3% and 26.5% Equal Error Rate (EER) respectively for random forgeries cases compared with baseline systems. Finally a fusion of the proposed systems has achieved a further significant improvement for the device interoperability problem especially for skilled forgeries. In this case the proposed fusion system has achieved an average relative improvement of 27.7% EER compared with the best performance of time functions-based system. These results prove the robustness of the proposed approach and open the door for future works using devices as smartphones or tablets commonly used nowadays.;2015
Electronic health records are increasingly used in regional health authorities healthcare systems hospitals and clinics throughout North America. The emergency department provides care for urgent and critically ill patients. Over the past several years emergency departments have become more computerized. Tablet computers and Smartphones are increasingly common in daily use. As part of the computerization trend we have seen the introduction of handheld computers tablets and Smartphones into practice as a way of providing health professionals (e.g. physicians nurses) with access to patient information and decision support in the emergency department. In this article we present a scoping review and outline the current state of the research using mobile devices in the emergency departments. Our findings suggest that there is very little research evidence that supports the use of these mobile devices and more research is needed to better understand and optimize the use of mobile devices. Given the prevalence of handheld devices it is inevitable that more decision support charting and other activities will be performed on these devices. These developments have the potential to improve the quality and timeliness of care but should be thoroughly evaluated.;2015
Epidural spinal cord stimulation (ESCS) combined with partial weight-bearing therapy (PWBT) has been shown to facilitate recovery of functional walking for individuals after spinal cord injury (SCI). The investigation of neural mechanisms of recovery from SCI under this treatment has been conducted broadly in rodent models yet a suitable ESCS system is still unavailable. This paper describes a practical programmable and fully implantable stimulator for laboratory research on rats to explore fundamental neurophysiological principles for functional recovery after SCI. The ESCS system is composed of a personal digital assistant (PDA) an external controller an implantable pulse generator (IPG) lead extension and stimulating electrodes. The stimulation parameters can be programmed and adjusted through a graphical user interface on the PDA. The external controller is placed on the rat back and communicates with the PDA via radio-frequency (RF) telemetry. An RF carrier from the class-E power amplifier in the external controller provides both data and power for the IPG through an inductive link. The IPG is built around a microcontroller unit to generate voltage-regulated pulses delivered to the bipolar electrode for ESCS in rats. The encapsulated IPG measures 22 mm x 23 mm x 7 mm with a mass of similar to 3.78 g. This fully implantable batteryless stimulator provided a simplified and efficient method to carry out chronic experiments in untethered animals for medical electro-neurological research.;2015
Excessive daytime somnolence (EDS) is defined as the inability to stay awake in daily life activities. Several scales have been used to diagnose excessive daytime sleepiness the most widely used being the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Sleep disorders and EDS are very common in the general population. It is therefore important to be able to screen patients for this symptom in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis of sleep disorders. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) have been used in the field of affective computing and human interactions but up to now no software has been specifically designed to investigate sleep disorders. We created an ECA able to conduct an interview based on the ESS and compared it to an interview conducted by a sleep specialist. We recruited 32 consecutive patients and a group of 30 healthy volunteers free of any sleep complaints. The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire that asks the subject to rate (with a pen and paper paradigm) his or her probability of falling asleep. For the purpose of our study the ECA or real-doctor questionnaire was modified as follows: Instead of the I'' formulate questions were asked as Do you.'' Our software is based on a common 3D game engine and several commercial software libraries. It can run on standard and affordable hardware products. The sensitivity and specificity of the interview conducted by the ECA were measured. The best results (sensibility and specificity >98%) were obtained to discriminate the sleepiest patients (ESS >= 16) but very good scores (sensibility and specificity > 80%) were also obtained for alert subjects (ESS< 8). ESS scores obtained in the interview conducted by the physician were significantly correlated with ESS scores obtained in the interview the ECA conducted. Most of the subjects had a positive perception of the virtual physician and considered the interview with the ECA as a good experience. Sixty-five percent of the participants felt that the virtual doctor could significantly help real physicians. Our results show that a virtual physician can conduct a very simple interview to evaluate EDS with very similar results to those obtained by a questionnaire administered by a real physician. The expected massive increase in sleep complaints in the near future likely means that more and more physicians will be looking for computerized systems to help them to diagnose their patients.;2015
Expressive speech synthesis has received increased attention in recent times. Stress (or pitch accent) is the perceptual prominence within words or utterances which contributes to the expressivity of speech. This paper summarizes our contribution to Mandarin expressive speech synthesis. A novel hierarchical stress modeling and generation method for Mandarin is proposed and further integrated into HMM-based speech synthesis (HTS) and Fujisaki model-based speech synthesis systems to accurately model the undulation of pitch contour. In HMM-based expressive speech synthesis stress-related contextual features obtained from the hierarchical model are introduced in modeling the prosodic variation caused by stress in addition to the traditional prosodic features used in HTS. A rule-based and a Deep Belief Network based prosodic variation models are proposed and then used in stress adaptation module in HTS. The other approach uses the Fujisaki model to improve the expressiveness of synthetic speech. The hierarchical stress model is introduced into the phrase and tone command control mechanisms of the model. The pitch contour is then directly generated by the superposition of two-level commands of the Fujisaki model. Experimental results using the proposed hierarchical stress modeling and generation methods showed that the macro- and microcharacteristics of stress could be successfully captured. The methodology proposed in this paper has application to a range of areas such as conveying attitude and indicating focus in spoken dialog systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2015
Following from previous research on intensity bias and the accessibility model of emotional self-report the present study examined the role of emotional exhaustion in explaining the discrepancy in teachers' reports of their trait (habitual) versus state (momentary real) emotions. Trait reports (habitual emotions exhaustion) were assessed via trait questionnaires and state reports (momentary emotions) were assessed in real time via the experience sampling method by using personal digital assistants (N = 69 high school teachers 1089 measures within teachers). In line with our assumptions multi-level analyses showed that as compared to the state assessment teachers reported higher levels of habitual teaching-related emotions of anger anxiety shame boredom enjoyment and pride. Additionally the state-trait discrepancy in self-reports of negative emotions was accounted for by teachers' emotional exhaustion with high exhaustion levels corresponding with a greater state-trait discrepancy. Exhaustion levels did not moderate the state-trait discrepancy in positive emotions indicating that perceived emotional exhaustion may reflect identity-related cognitions specific to the negative belief system. Implications for research and educational practice are discussed.;2015
Going beyond studies of individual differences in and profiles of students' motivation we investigated situation-specific (intra-personal) experiences of autonomous (enjoyment interest and task choice) and controlled (having to do and the teacher wanting them to do a task) motivation across learning situations during one week and how these were related to student characteristics (teacher rated academic performance and task-focus). Three-hundred and fourteen primary school students (Years 5 and 6) completed electronic questionnaires on Personal Digital Assistants on an average of 11.2 learning episodes during a week. Multilevel Structural Equation Models provided support for a model based in organismic integration theory (OIT). At the situation-level controlled motivation positively predicted autonomous motivation. At the student-level students differed in the association between autonomous and controlled motivations such that lower performers felt more autonomously motivated when controlled motivation was high. Implications for teacher practice are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2015
In an earlier paper we described a structured theory-driven training programme which was administered to 10 individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment. All individuals received an errorless-fading-of-cues protocol in the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) or smartphones (Svoboda Richards Leach & Mertens 2012) and demonstrated generalisation of acquired skills to day-to-day memory challenges. Maintenance of intervention gains over the long-term is another indicator of successful generalisation. Here we present the maintenance of device use in the same group of individuals 12 to 19 months after programme completion. A within-subject ABABB multi-case experimental design was used to evaluate the impact of PDA or smartphone use on day-to-day memory functioning at baseline immediately post-intervention at return to baseline and at short-term and long-term follow-up. Results presented here focus predominantly on long-term follow-up. All 10 individuals showed maintenance of gains in day-to-day functioning as quantified across several ecologically valid questionnaire and task-based measures. This was corroborated by family members with whom six of the participants resided. This study further demonstrates the programme's clinical effectiveness in enabling individuals with moderate-to-severe memory impairment to function more independently and with greater confidence up to 19 months following programme completion.;2015
In developed country such as Japan aging has become a serious issue as there is a disproportionate increasing of elderly population who are no longer able to look after themselves. In order to tackle this issue we introduce human-friendly robot partner to support the elderly people in their daily life. However to realize this it is essential for the robot partner to be able to have a natural communication with the human. This paper proposes a new communication framework between the human and robot partner based on relevance theory as the basis knowledge. The relevance theory is implemented to build mutual cognitive environment between the human and the robot partner namely as the informationally structured space (ISS). Inside the ISS robot partner employs both verbal as well as non-verbal communication to understand human. For the verbal communication Rasmussen's behavior model is implemented as the basis for the conversational system. While for the non-verbal communication environmental and human state data along with gesture recognition are utilized. These data are used as the perceptual input to compute the robot partner's emotion. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed communication framework in establishing natural communication between the human and the robot partner. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In terms of functional conversations Grice's Maxim of Quantity suggests that responses should contain no more information than was explicitly asked for. However in our daily conversations more informative response skills are usually employed in order to hold enjoyable conversations with interlocutors. These responses are usually produced as forms of one's additional opinions which usually contain their original viewpoints as well as novel means of expression rather than simple and common responses characteristic of the general public. In this paper we propose automatic expressive opinion sentence generation mechanisms for enjoyable conversational systems. The generated opinions are extracted from a large number of reviews on the web and ranked in terms of contextual relevance length of sentences and amount of information represented by the frequency of adjectives. The sentence generator also has an additional phrasing skill. Three controlled lab experiments were conducted where subjects were requested to read generated sentences and watch videos filmed about conversations between the robot and a person. The results implied that mechanisms effectively promote users' enjoyment and interests.;2015
In the whole world the proportion of aged population is increasing day by day. To fulfill Confucius' philosophy of treat others' elderly and youth as if they are our family members we proposed an intelligent web-based agent which is able to conduct daily life conversation with the elders. Based on psychological theory we classify the participants of the experiment into three types using K-means. A decision tree is trained based on the information gain during the process of classification. We also implemented a web-based software agent which is visually alive and is able to interact with the elders through visual and audio context. Such agent can be accessed virtually from any location on the planet and is able to have conversation and interaction with the elders to keep them from being bored. The trained decision tree serves as the brain of the web-based agent to classify the type of the elders as the conversation goes on and provide the appropriate questions or choices for the human-machine interaction. Through large-scale experiments we found that the combination of web-based agent and the trained decision tree works satisfactorily for the purpose of care-giving to the elderly.;2015
In this paper the Gartner Group's hype cycle is used as the basis for categorizing and analyzing research on the educational use of ubiquitous computing. There are five phases of the hype cycle: the technology trigger the peak of inflated expectations the trough of disillusionment the slope of enlightenment and the plateau of productivity. Research on the educational use of mobile technology is divided in this paper into four stages: (i) a period of mobility and personal digital assistants (PDAs) (ii) the era of wireless internet learning devices (iii) the introduction of social mobile media and (iv) a ubiquitous future. In addition three empirical case studies are used as examples of these developmental stages. These case studies demonstrate the diversity of contexts methods and technologies used ranging from the workplace to nature trails from inquiry learning to collaborative knowledge building and from PocketPCs to smartphones. The four stages of educational use in the context of the hype cycle and the case studies together emphasize that pedagogically grounded instructional design is needed to put emergent technologies to effective use to promote learning skills namely self-regulated learning and collaboration and to prepare people for the 21st century learning society.;2015
In this paper we address issues in situated language understanding in a moving car which has the additional challenge of being a rapidly changing environment. More specifically we propose methods for understanding user queries regarding specific target buildings in their surroundings. Unlike previous studies on physically situated interactions such as interactions with mobile robots the task at hand is very time sensitive because the spatial relationship between the car and target changes while the user is speaking. We collected situated utterances from drivers using our research system called Townsurfer which was embedded in a real vehicle. Based on this data we analyzed the timing of user queries the spatial relationships between the car and the targets the head pose of the user and linguistic cues. Based on this analysis we further propose methods to optimize timing and spatial distances and to make use of linguistic cues. Finally we demonstrate that our algorithms improved the target identification rate by 24.1% absolute. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2015
In this paper we present a probabilistic framework for goal-driven spoken dialog systems. A new dynamic stochastic state (DS-state) is then defined to characterize the goal set of a dialog state at different stages of the dialog process. Furthermore an entropy minimization dialog management (EMDM) strategy is also proposed to combine with the DS-states to facilitate a robust and efficient solution in reaching a user's goals. A song-on-demand task with a total of 38 117 songs and 12 attributes corresponding to each song is used to test the performance of the proposed approach. In an ideal simulation assuming no errors the EMDM strategy is the most efficient goal-seeking method among all tested approaches returning the correct song within 3.3 dialog turns on average. Furthermore in a practical scenario with top five candidates to handle the unavoidable automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) errors the results show that only 61.7% of the dialog goals can be successfully obtained in 6.23 dialog turns on average when random questions are asked by the system whereas if the proposed DS-states are updated with the top five candidates from the SLU output using the proposed EMDM strategy executed at every DS-state then a 86.7% dialog success rate can be accomplished effectively within 5.17 dialog turns on average. We also demonstrate that entropy-based DM strategies are more efficient than non-entropy based DM. Moreover using the goal set distributions in EMDM the results are better than those without them such as in sate-of-the-art database summary DM.;2015
In this study the effectiveness of a hands free approach for operating video prompts to complete multi-step tasks was measured. Students advanced the video prompts by using a motion (hand wave) over a proximity sensor switch. Three young adult females with a diagnosis of moderate intellectual disability participated in the study. Effectiveness of the intervention was determined using a multiple probe design across three craft activities and replicated with the three young adults. Results indicate all three students demonstrated the ability to: master operation of the proximity sensor switch to operate the video prompts independently complete the craft activities and maintain their performance using the hands free approach.;2015
INTRODUCTION: The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) measures effects of fatigue from sleep loss and circadian misalignment on sustained vigilance performance. To promote PVT use in field environments a 5-min PVT version has been implemented on a personal digital assistant (PDA) with a touch screen. The present laboratory study was conducted to validate this PVT against a standard 10-min laptop PVT across 38 h of total sleep deprivation (TSD). METHODS: Following a baseline sleep night subjects underwent 38 h of TSD during which they performed the PVT every hour alternating between the two test platforms. The study concluded with a night of recovery sleep. RESULTS: The primary outcome was the number of PVT lapses (reaction times > 500 ms). Both PVT platforms showed significant effects for the number of lapses across TSD test times involving an increase with time awake modulated by circadian rhythm. Laptop PVT lapses across test times exhibited a large effect size (f(2) = 0.36) whereas PDA PVT lapses exhibited a medium effect size (f(2) = 0.17). The laptop PVT showed a significant effect for the number of false starts during TSD similar to the temporal profile of lapses while the PDA PVT had false starts throughout the TSD period. DISCUSSION: The 5-min PDA PVT provided performance testing functionality and results comparable to the 10-min laptop PVT. The number of PDA PVT lapses tracked fatigue similarly to the laptop PVT lapses albeit with smaller average ranges and effect sizes.;2015
Loneliness and social isolation are significant problems in older adult populations. We describe the design of a multimodal conversational agent-based system designed to provide longitudinal social support to isolated older adults. Results from a requirements analysis study and a remote Wizard-of-Oz study are presented that inform the design of the autonomous social support agent. An exploratory pilot study was conducted in which the agent was placed in the homes of 14 older adults for a week. Results indicate high levels of acceptance and satisfaction of the system. Results also indicate that when the agent proactively draws elders into interactions triggered by a motion sensor it is more effective at addressing loneliness than when the agent passively relies upon elders to initiate interactions. We discuss future research opportunities for affective computing to address this important societal problem.;2015
Mobile Opportunistic Network (MON) is characterized by intermittent connectivity where communication largely depends on the mobility pattern of the participating nodes. In MON a node can take the custody of a packet for a long time and carry it until a new forwarding path has been established unlike mobile adhoc network (MANET) where a node must drop the packet otherwise. Therefore routing in MON depends on the repeated make-and-break of communication links which again depends on the mobility of the nodes as they encounter and drift away from each other. MONs can simply be formed by humans carrying hand-held devices (like Personal Digital Assistant [PDAs] or cell phones) or on-board devices installed in vehicles. Therefore with mobility playing a major role in the performance of MON researchers have repeatedly tried to understand the nature of mobility with respect to humans vehicles and wild animals. To study the nature of mobility researchers have collected mobility traces proposed mobility models and analyzed the performance of MON with respect to various mobility parameters. This article provides a detailed survey of different mobility models which have been proposed to date and how mobility largely determines the performance of opportunistic routing. We divide the article into four major sections. First we provide a detailed survey of all the synthetic mobility models which have been developed to date. Second we study the various mobility traces which have been collected and analyzed. Third we study how mobility parameters affect the performance of MON. Finally we highlight on some of the research areas and open challenges which yet remain unsolved.;2015
Mobile technology presents new opportunities for nursing education and ultimately the provision of nursing care. The aim of this study was to explore the utility of mobile technology in undergraduate nursing education. In this evaluation study undergraduate nursing students were provided with iPod Touch devices containing best practice guidelines. Computer self-efficacy was assessed and the Theory of Planned Behavior was used to identify potential predictors of the use of mobile technology. Questionnaires were completed at baseline (n = 33) and postimplementation (n = 23). Feedback on feasibility issues was recorded throughout the study period. Students generally found the devices useful and few technical problems were identified however lack of skill in using the devices and lack of support from staff in the clinical setting were commonly identified issues. Self-efficacy scores were high throughout the study. Attitudes perceptions of the desirability of use perceived personal control over use and intentions of using the device were lower postimplementation than at baseline. Attitude toward the technology predicted intention to use the device after graduation. Mobile technology may promote evidence-informed practice however supporting students' acquisition of related skills may optimize use. Successful integration of mobile technology into practice requires attention to factors that affect student attitudes.;2015
Most studies on dialogue corpora as well as most dialogue systems employ dialogue acts as the basic units for interpreting discourse structure user input and system actions. The definition of the discourse structure and the dialogue strategy consequently require the tagging of dialogue corpora in terms of dialogue acts. The tagging problem presents two basic variants: a batch variant (annotation of whole dialogues in order to define dialogue strategy or study discourse structure) and an online variant (decoding of the dialogue act sequence of a given turn in order to interpret user intentions). In the two variants is unusual having the segmentation of each turn into the dialogue meaningful units (segments) to which a dialogue act is assigned. In this paper we present the use of the N-Gram Transducer technique for tagging dialogues without needing to provide a prior segmentation in these two different variants (dialogue annotation and turn decoding). Experiments were performed in two corpora of different nature and results show that N-Gram Transducer models are suitable for these tasks and provide good performance.;2015
Nursing students face a variety of challenges to learning in clinical practice from the theory-practice gap to a lack of clinical supervision and the ad hoc nature of learning in clinical environments. Mobile technology is proposed as one way to address these challenges. This article comprehensively summarizes and critically reviews the available literature on mobile technology used in undergraduate clinical nursing education. It identifies the lack of clear definitions and theory in the current body of evidence the variety of mobile devices and applications used the benefits of mobile platforms in nursing education and the complexity of sociotechnical factors such as the cost usability portability and quality of mobile tools that affect their use in undergraduate clinical nursing education. Implications for nursing education and practice are outlined and recommendations for future research are discussed.;2015
Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the equivalence between electronic and paper administration of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in studies conducted subsequent to those included in Gwaltney et al's 2008 review. Methods: A systematic literature review of PROM equivalence studies conducted between 2007 and 2013 identified 1997 records from which 72 studies met pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. PRO data from each study were extracted in terms of both correlation coefficients (ICCs Spearman and Pearson correlations Kappa statistics) and mean differences (standardized by the standard deviation SD and the response scale range). Pooled estimates of correlation and mean difference were estimated. The modifying effects of mode of administration year of publication study design time interval between administrations mean age of participants and publication type were examined. Results: Four hundred thirty-five individual correlations were extracted these correlations being highly variable (I2 = 93.8) but showing generally good equivalence with ICCs ranging from 0.65 to 0.99 and the pooled correlation coefficient being 0.88 (95 % CI 0.87 to 0.88). Standardised mean differences for 307 studies were small and less variable (I2 = 33.5) with a pooled standardised mean difference of 0.037 (95 % CI 0.031 to 0.042). Average administration mode/platform-specific correlations from 56 studies (61 estimates) had a pooled estimate of 0.88 (95 % CI 0.86 to 0.90) and were still highly variable (I2 = 92.1). Similarly average platform-specific ICCs from 39 studies (42 estimates) had a pooled estimate of 0.90 (95 % CI 0.88 to 0.92) with an I2 of 91.5. After excluding 20 studies with outlying correlation coefficients (>= 3SD from the mean) the I2 was 54.4 with the equivalence still high the overall pooled correlation coefficient being 0.88 (95 % CI 0.87 to 0.88). Agreement was found to be greater in more recent studies (p < 0.001) in randomized studies compared with non-randomised studies (p < 0.001) in studies with a shorter interval (< 1 day) (p < 0.001) and in respondents of mean age 28 to 55 compared with those either younger or older (p < 0.001). In terms of mode/platform paper vs Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) comparisons had the lowest pooled agreement and paper vs tablet/touch screen the highest (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The present study supports the conclusion of Gwaltney's previous meta-analysis showing that PROMs administered on paper are quantitatively comparable with measures administered on an electronic device. It also confirms the ISPOR Taskforce's conclusion that quantitative equivalence studies are not required for migrations with minor change only. This finding should be reassuring to investigators regulators and sponsors using questionnaires on electronic devicesafter migration using best practices. Although there is data indicating that migrations with moderate changes produce equivalent instrument versions hence do not require quantitative equivalence studies additional work is necessary to establish this. Furthermore there is the need to standardize migration practices and reporting practices (i.e. include copies of tested instrument versions and screenshots) so that clear recommendations regarding equivalence testing can be made in the future. raising questions about the necessity of conducting equivalence testing moving forward.;2015
Objective: To examine the acceptability and feasibility of using smartphone technology to assess beverage intake and evaluate whether the feasibility of smartphone use is greater among key sub-populations. Design: An acceptability and feasibility study of recording the video dietary record the acceptability of the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) wearing smartphones and whether the videos helped participants recall intake after a cross-over validation study. Setting: Rural and urban area in Shanghai China. Subjects: Healthy adults (n 110) aged 20-40 years old. Results: Most participants reported that the phone was acceptable in most aspects including that videos were easy to use (70 %) helped with recalls (77 %) EMA reminders helped them record intake (75 %) and apps were easy to understand (85 %). However 49 % of the participants reported that they had trouble remembering to take videos of the beverages before consumption or 46 % felt embarrassed taking videos in front of others. Moreover 72 % reported that the EMA reminders affected their consumption. When assessing overall acceptability of using smartphones 72 % of the participants were favourable responders. There were no statistically significant differences in overall acceptability for overweight v. normal-weight participants or for rural v. urban residents. However we did find that the overall acceptability was higher for males (81 %) than females (61 % P=0.017). Conclusions: Our study did not find smartphone technology helped with dietary assessments in a Chinese population. However simpler approaches such as using photographs instead of videos may be more feasible for enhancing 24 h dietary recalls.;2015
ObjectiveEtiological and maintenance models for disordered eating highlight the salience of negative affect and interpersonal dysfunction. This study employed a 14-day experience sampling procedure to assess the impact of negative affect and interpersonal perceptions on binge eating behavior. MethodYoung adult women (N=40) with recurrent binge eating and significant clinical impairment recorded their mood interpersonal behavior and eating behaviors at six stratified semirandom intervals daily through the use of personal digital assistants. ResultsAlthough momentary negative affect was associated with binge eating behavior average levels of negative affect over the experience sampling period were not and interpersonal problems moderated the relationship between negative affect and binge eating. Interpersonal problems also intensified the association between momentary interpersonal perceptions and binge eating behavior. Lagged analyses indicated that previous levels of negative affect and interpersonal style also influence binge eating. DiscussionThe study findings suggest there may be important differences in how dispositional versus momentary experiences of negative affect are associated with binge eating. Results also highlight the importance of interpersonal problems for understanding relationships among negative affect interpersonal perception and binge eating behavior. These results offer several possibilities for attending to affective and interpersonal functioning in clinical practice. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2015 48:715-726);2015
Objectives: To compare the data quality logistics and cost of a self-administered sexual behavior questionnaire administered either using a computer-assisted survey instrument (CASI) or by paper and pencil in a primary care clinic. Study Design and Setting: A self-administered sexual behavior questionnaire was administered to 16-29 year olds attending general practice. Questionnaires were administered by either paper and pencil (paper) or CASI. A personal digital assistant was used to self-administer the CASI. Results: A total of 4491 people completed the questionnaire with 46.9% responses via CASI and 53.2% by paper. Completion of questions was greater for CAST than for paper for sexual behavior questions: number of sexual partners [odds ratio (OR) 6.85 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.32 14.11] and ever having had sex with a person of the same gender (OR 2.89 95% CI: 1.52 5.49). The median number of questions answered was higher for CAST than for paper (17.6 vs. 17.2 P < 0.01). CASI was cheaper to run at $8.18 per questionnaire compared with $11.83 for paper. Conclusion: Electronic devices using CAST are a tool that can increase participants' questionnaire responses and deliver more complete data for a sexual behavior questionnaire in primary care clinics.

Objectives:To quantify the effects of varying clinical communication styles (verbal and pictorial) on the ability of orthopaedic trauma surgeons in understanding an injury and formulate an initial management plan.Methods:A Research Electronic Data Capture survey was e-mailed to all OTA members. Respondents quantified (5-point Likert scale) how confident they felt understanding an injury and establishing an initial management plan based on the information provided for 5 common orthopaedic trauma scenarios. Three verbal descriptions were created for each scenario and categorized as limited moderate or detailed. The questions were repeated with the addition of a radiographic image and then repeated a third time including a clinical photograph. Statistical evaluation consisted of descriptive statistics and Kruskal-Wallis analyses using STATA (version 12.0).Results:Of the 221 respondents there were a total of 95 who completed the entire survey. Nearly all were currently taking call (92/95 = 96.8%) and the majority were fellowship trained (79/95 = 83.2%). Most practice at a level I trauma center (58/95 = 61.1%) and work with orthopaedic residents (62/95 = 65.3%). There was a significant increase in confidence scores between a limited moderate and detailed description in all clinical scenarios for understanding the injury and establishing an initial management plan (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference in confidence scores between all 3 types of evidence presented (verbal verbal + x-ray verbal + x-ray + photograph) in both understanding and managing the injury for limited and moderate descriptions (P < 0.001). No differences were seen when adding pictorial information to the detailed verbal description. When comparing confidence scores between a detailed description without images and a limited description that includes radiographs and a photograph no difference in confidence levels was seen in 7 of the 10 scenarios (P > 0.05).Conclusions:The addition of images in the form of radiographs and/or clinical photographs greatly improves the confidence of orthopaedic trauma surgeons in understanding injuries and establishing initial management plans with limited verbal information (P < 0.001). The inclusion of x-rays and photographs raises the confidence for understanding and management with limited verbal information to the level of a detailed verbal description in most scenarios. Mobile technology allows for easy secure transfer of images that can make up for the lack of available information from limited verbal descriptions because of the knowledge base of communicating providers.;2015
ObjectiveTo establish the reliability validity and sensitivity to change of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) among Chinese subjects with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee living in mainland China. MethodsA multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study was conducted for validation of the electronic personal digital assistant version of the WOMAC Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 3.1 Index in China. A total of 287 subjects with OA of the knee were randomized to receive either meloxicam (15 mg) or placebo. Psychometric properties of the WOMAC were evaluated by estimating the reliability validity and sensitivity to change. Equivalence of the electronic version was also compared with the paper version. ResultsIntraclass correlation coefficients for the WOMAC pain stiffness and physical function subscales were 0.81 0.76 and 0.85 respectively indicating good test-retest reliability. Similarly internal consistency was strong (Cronbach's alpha for the 3 WOMAC subscales was 0.84 0.86 and 0.96 respectively). Pearson's correlation coefficients for WOMAC pain and Short Form 36 health survey (SF-36) bodily pain as well as WOMAC physical function and SF-36 physical functioning domains were >0.4 indicating convergent validity whereas the coefficients for all 3 WOMAC domains with SF-36 mental health and mental health component scores were <0.4 indicating divergent validity. There was strong discriminant validity between healthy volunteers and OA patients. The effect sizes of change from baseline to week 12 in WOMAC subscale scores were large demonstrating sensitivity to change. Equivalence between paper and electronic versions was very high. ConclusionThe culturally and linguistically validated Chinese version of the WOMAC NRS 3.1 for mainland China is psychometrically robust in its validity reliability and sensitivity to change for patients with OA of the knee.;2015
Over the past decade dramatic changes brought about by a rapid diffusion of Internet technologies cellular telephones mobile devices personal digital assistants electronic health records and data visualization have helped to create a revolution in health communication. To understand the implications of this communication revolution for cancer care the National Cancer Institute launched an ambitious set of research priorities under its extraordinary opportunities program. We present an overview of some of the relevant behavioral research being conducted within the perspective of this extraordinary opportunity in cancer communication research. We begin by tracing the implications of this research for behavioral scientists across the continuum of cancer care from primary prevention (e.g. tobacco control diet exercise sun protection and immunization against human papilloma virus) to secondary prevention (e.g. screening for polyps lesions and early stage neoplasms) to diagnosis and treatment post-treatment survivorship and end of life. Along each point of the continuum we describe a natural evolution of knowledge from studies on the traditional role of media to research on the changing role of new media and informatics and we carefully highlight the role that psychological research has played in improving communication-and health-related outcomes along the way. We conclude with an appeal to psychologists of many different backgrounds to join with biomedical researchers engineers clinical practitioners and others to accelerate progress against cancer.;2015
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are versatile task organizers that hold promise as assistive technologies for people with cognitive-behavioral challenges. This delayed randomized controlled trial compared two groups of adult workers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to determine whether the use of an Apple iPod Touch PDA as a vocational support improves work performance and reduces personal support needs on the job. Baseline data were collected on 50 adults with ASD who were beginning a vocational placement supported by a job coach. Participants were randomized to receive training in the use of a PDA as a vocational aid upon starting their job or after working 12 weeks without PDA support. Workers who received PDA training at the beginning of their job placement required significantly less hours of job coaching support (p = 0.013) during their first 12 weeks on the job than those who had not yet received the intervention. Functional performance between the two groups was not significantly different. The significant difference in hours of job coaching support persisted during the subsequent 12 weeks in which both groups used a PDA (p = 0.017).;2015
Purpose: Bladder dysfunction influences recovery of urinary continence after radical prostatectomy. We performed a multicenter randomized double-blind study evaluating solifenacin vs placebo on return to continence in patients who were still incontinent 7 to 21 days after catheter removal after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Materials and Methods: A wireless personal digital assistant was given to patients the day of catheter removal. Encrypted answers were transmitted daily to dedicated servers. After a 7 to 21-day treatment-free washout period patients requiring 2 to 10 pads per day for 7 consecutive days were randomized (1:1) to 5 mg solifenacin daily or placebo. The primary end point was time from first dose to continence defined as 0 pads per day or a dry security pad for 3 consecutive days. Secondary end points included proportion of patients continent at end of study average change in pads per day number and quality of life assessments. Results: A total of 1086 screened patients recorded personal digital assistant information. Overall 640 patients were randomized to solifenacin vs placebo and 17 failed to take medication. There was no difference in time to continence (p=0.17). Continence was achieved by study end in 91 of 313 (29%) vs 66 of 309 (21%) respectively (p=0.04). Pads per day change from baseline was -3.2 and -2.9 respectively (p=0.03). Dry mouth was the only common adverse event seen in 6.1% and 0.6% respectively. Constipation rates were similar. The overall rate of continence in the entire population from screening to end of study was 73%. Conclusions: There was no effect on primary outcome but some secondary end points benefited the solifenacin arm. The study provides level 1B clinical evidence for continence outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.;2015
Purpose: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the potential value of a new personalized activity-based feedback treatment. Method: A prognostic cohort study was carried out in the daily environment of the patients. Seventeen individuals with chronic lower back pain (CLBP) symptoms for >3 months were included. Patients were from the Netherlands aged 18-65 years. Patients wore an accelerometer and a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) for 15d. Patients received continuous and time-related personalized feedback and were instructed to follow the activity pattern as displayed on the PDA. Technical performance and compliance with the system were rated. Objective and subjective activity scores were compared for exploring awareness. The absolute difference between the activity pattern of the patient and the norm value used was calculated and expressed as mean difference. Pain intensity was measured using the VAS. Results: The technical performance and compliance with the system were rated moderate. More than half of the patients were aware of their activity level during the feedback days (67%). A positive effect of the feedback was seen in a trend which showed a decrease in the absolute difference between the activity pattern of the patient and the norm value (p=0.149) and a significant decrease in pain intensity levels (p=0.005). Conclusions: This pilot study suggested that an individual-tailored feedback system that focuses on the activity behavior of the patient has potential as the treatment of individuals with CLBP.Implications for RehabilitationActivity-based feedback for individuals with chronic low back pain:Many patients are not aware of their activity patterns.The activity patterns of patients differ from those of healthy controls.It is important to make patients aware of their activity patterns in order to change activity behavior.An individual-tailored feedback system seems promising in decreasing pain intensity levels for a subgroup of patients.;2015
Recently the focus of many novel search applications has shifted from short keyword queries to verbose natural language queries. Examples include question answering systems and dialogue systems voice search on mobile devices and entity search engines like Facebook's Graph Search or Google's Knowledge Graph. However the performance of textbook information retrieval techniques for such verbose queries is not as good as that for their shorter counterparts. Thus effective handling of verbose queries has become a critical factor for adoption of information retrieval techniques in this new breed of search applications. Over the past decade the information retrieval community has deeply explored the problem of transforming natural language verbose queries using operations like reduction weighting expansion reformulation and segmentation into more effective structural representations. However thus far there was not a coherent and organized survey on this topic. In this survey we aim to put together various research pieces of the puzzle provide a comprehensive and structured overview of various proposed methods and also list various application scenarios where effective verbose query processing can make a significant difference.;2015
Research on computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and conversational pedagogical agents has strongly emphasized the value of providing dynamic dialogue support for learners working together to accomplish a certain task. Recently on the basis of the classroom discourse framework of Academically Productive Talk (APT) a flexible form of conversational agent support has emerged employing APT-based intervention methods so as to stimulate pedagogically beneficial conversational interactions among learning partners. This paper investigates the impact of an APT-based Linking Contributions (LC) intervention mode implemented by a conversational agent in the context of a collaborative activity in higher education. This type of agent interventions encourages students to explicitly externalize their reasoning on important domain concepts building upon the contributions of their partners. Forty-three (43) students collaborated in small groups using a prototype CSCL system to accomplish three different tasks in the domain of Multimedia Learning. Groups were randomly assigned to the treatment or the control condition. In the treatment condition a conversational agent participated in students' dialogues making LC mode interventions. In the control condition students discussed without the agent intervening. The results of the study illustrated that the students in the treatment condition engaged in a more productive dialogue demonstrating increased explicit reasoning throughout the collaborative activity. Furthermore it was shown that the students in the treatment condition outperformed the control students in various measures on knowledge acquisition. Evidence also suggests that students' enhanced learning performance was mediated by the positive effect of the agent intervention mode on students' argumentation. Overall this study provides insights into how the use of a configurable conversational agent displaying unsolicited LC interventions during students' discourse can be beneficial to collaborative learning.

Speech-act classification is essential to generation and understanding of utterances within a natural language dialogue system since the speech-act of an utterance is closely tied to a user intention. The binary feature weighting scheme has mainly been used for speech-act classification because traditional feature weighting schemes such as tf.idf are not effective in speech-act classification due to the short length of utterances. This paper studies two effective feature weighting schemes using the category distributions of features: (1) the first one exploits the entropy of whole category distributions and (2) the second one the log-odds ratio of positive and negative category distributions. As a result the proposed schemes show significant improvement on SVM and k-NN classifiers in our experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved;2015
Spoken dialog systems have been proposed as a solution to facilitate a more natural human-machine interaction. In this paper we propose a framework to model the user's intention during the dialog and adapt the dialog model dynamically to the user needs and preferences thus developing more efficient adapted and usable spoken dialog systems. Our framework employs statistical models based on neural networks that take into account the history of the dialog up to the current dialog state in order to predict the user's intention and the next system response. We describe our proposal and detail its application in the Let's Go spoken dialog system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2015
The design and operating principles of an interactive system of semantic processing i.e. understanding the meaning of scientific and technical texts on chemical technology of reagents and ultrapure substances have been presented. Understanding of the meaning of scientific and technical texts has been implemented through the development of intelligent software of a dialogue system which includes semantic and topological models of knowledge representation as well as special languages of the automated generation of meaning. Understanding of the basic terms concepts and phrases in the limited natural language of the problem area has been presented in the form of the internal representation of the knowledge and language of control directives.;2015
The goal of addressee detection is to answer the question Are you talking to me? When a dialogue system interacts with multiple users it is crucial to detect when a user is speaking to the system as opposed to another person. We study this problem in a multimodal scenario using lexical acoustic visual dialogue state and beamforming information. Using data from a multiparty dialogue system we quantify the benefits of using multiple modalities over using a single modality. We also assess the relative importance of the various modalities as well as of key individual features in estimating the addressee. We find that energy-based acoustic features are by far the most important that information from speech recognition and system state is useful as well and that visual and beamforming features provide little additional benefit. While we find that head pose is affected by whom the speaker is addressing it yields little nonredundant information due to the system acting as a situational attractor. Our findings would be relevant to multiparty open-world dialogue systems in which the agent plays an active conversational role such as an interactive assistant deployed in a public open space. For these scenarios our study suggests that acoustic lexical and system-state information is an effective and practical combination of modalities to use for addressee detection. We also consider how our analyses might be affected by the ongoing development of more realistic natural dialogue systems.;2015
The growing complexity of radiologic examinations and interventional procedures requires frequent exchange of knowledge. Consequently a simple way to share and discuss patient images between radiology experts and with colleagues from other medical disciplines is needed. Aims of this work were the development and initial performance evaluation of a fast and user friendly platform independent teleconsultation system for medical imaging. A local back end system receives DICOM images and generates anonymized JPEG files that are uploaded to an internet webserver. The front end running on that webserver comprises an image viewer with a specially developed pointer element for indicating findings to collaborative partners. The front end that uses only standard web technologies works on a variety of different platforms mobile devices and desktop computers. Images can be accessed by simply calling up a special internet address in a web browser that may be exchanged between users (e.g. via email). A speed evaluation of the system showed good results: For example the preparation and upload of a standard head CT took less than 21 seconds. The data volume of the same series and the viewer application could be transferred to a mobile phone in less than 42 seconds via a UMTS network or in less than 3 seconds via a HSPA network. The presented system with its minimal hard- and software requirements its simplicity and platform independence might be a promising tool in the increasingly important area of teleconsultation.;2015
The growth of speech interfaces and speech interaction with computer partners has made it increasingly important to understand the factors that determine users' language choices in human computer dialogue. We report two controlled experiments that used a picture-naming-matching task to investigate whether users in human computer speech-based interactions tend to use the same grammatical structures as their conversational partners and whether such syntactic alignment can impact strong default grammatical preferences. We additionally investigate whether beliefs about system capabilities that are based on partner identity (i.e. human or computer) and speech interface design cues (here voice anthropomorphism) affect the magnitude of syntactic alignment in such interactions. We demonstrate syntactic alignment for both dative structures (e.g. give the waitress the apple vs. give the apple to the waitress) where there is no strong default preference for one or other structure (Experiment 1) and noun phrase structures (e.g. a purple circle vs. a circle that is purple) where there is a strong default preference for one structure (Experiment 2). The tendency to align syntactically was unaffected by partner identity (human vs. computer) or voice anthropomorphism. These findings have both practical and theoretical implications for HCI by demonstrating the potential for spoken dialogue system behaviour to influence users' syntactic choices in interaction. As well as verifying natural corpora findings this work also highlights that priming and cognitive mechanisms that are unmediated by beliefs about partner identity could be important in understanding why people align syntactically in human - computer dialogue.

The idea of using personal digital assistance (PDA) in the healthcare industry has been sparsely explored from the viewpoint of an emerging market like Malaysia. Since the potential benefits of adopting PDA are immense this study aims to investigate the intention of medical professionals to adopt PDA in their daily work. Interestingly only personal innovativeness in technology (PIIT) was found to be insignificant in this study. The study is important as it provides vital information not only for hospital management but also for system developers and even government agencies when devising their corporate and marketing strategies.;2015
The impact of simulated embodied agent emotion has been explored in short-term studies but no work to date has examined its impact in longer interactions that involve multiple interactions with agents. We present an embodied agent (Rachael) that simulates a health professional and attempts to help people improve their fruit and vegetable consumption. Emotional and unemotional versions of the agent were developed to examine how user perceptions of the agent changed over an intervention period of 49 days and in turn how this influenced fruit and vegetable consumption. Results found that whilst participants consumed more daily portions of fruit and vegetables over the intervention period and reduced their consumption gains post-intervention there was no significant difference in consumption gains over time between those who interacted with the emotional or unemotional agents. Qualitative feedback however highlighted a strong preference for the emotional agent. A novelty effect was also observed where the agents were perceived more positively initially and less so over time.;2015
The intensive use of models in model-driven engineering (MDE) raises the need to develop meta-models with different aims such as the construction of textual and visual modelling languages and the specification of source and target ends of model-to-model transformations. While domain experts have the knowledge about the concepts of the domain they usually lack the skills to build meta-models. Moreover meta-models typically need to be tailored according to their future usage and specific implementation platform which demands knowledge available only to engineers with great expertise in specific MDE platforms. These issues hinder a wider adoption of MDE both by domain experts and software engineers. In order to alleviate this situation we propose an interactive iterative approach to meta-model construction enabling the specification of example model fragments by domain experts with the possibility of using informal drawing tools like Dia or yED. These fragments can be annotated with hints about the intention or needs for certain elements. A meta-model is then automatically induced which can be refactored in an interactive way and then compiled into an implementation meta-model using profiles and patterns for different platforms and purposes. Our approach includes the use of a virtual assistant which provides suggestions for improving the meta-model based on well-known refactorings and a validation mode enabling the validation of the meta-model by means of examples.;2015
The meanings of anhedonia and depressed mood the cardinal emotional symptoms of major depression may be shaped by cultural norms regarding pleasure and sadness. Thirty-two European Americans 26 Hispanic Americans 33 Asian Americans and 20 Russian Americans provided reports of (a) depressive symptoms (b) momentary emotions and pleasure and (c) global subjective well-being. Momentary reports were collected over 10 days using handheld personal digital assistants. Reports of anhedonia were associated with heightened levels of momentary low arousal negative emotions (e.g. sadness) whereas reports of depressed mood were associated with dampened levels of momentary positive emotions (e.g. happiness). Symptoms of anhedonia and depressed mood interacted in their associations with momentary pleasure. In addition the associations of anhedonia and depressed mood with positive emotions and life satisfaction differed across cultural groups. Specifically these symptoms were associated with dampened positive emotions in the Asian American group only. Additionally anhedonia was associated with dampened global life satisfaction in the European American group only. These results suggest that reports of anhedonia and depressed mood cannot be interpreted at face value as specific and culture-free indicators of emotional deficits. Instead they appear to signal changes in the balance of positive and negative emotions with the exact nature of these signals shaped at least in part by cultural context. This conclusion has important consequences for the clinical interpretation of depressive symptoms in multicultural societies.;2015
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of three video perspectives: point-of-view scene view and a combination of point-of-view and scene view on task completion by three young adults with moderate intellectual disability. The comparison was made using an Adapted Alternating Treatments Design across three sets of fundamentally different gift wrapping tasks as each of three students used step-by-step video prompting. Overall results of the study showed minimal differences in performance across the three students regardless of the video perspective while a combination of point-of-view and scene view camera angle resulted in fewer errors by two of the three students.;2015

The way in which attachment styles are expressed in the moment as individuals navigate their real-life settings has remained an area largely untapped by attachment research. The present study examined how adult attachment styles are expressed in daily life using experience sampling methodology (ESM) in a sample of 206 Spanish young adults. Participants were administered the Attachment Style Interview (ASI) and received personal digital assistants that signaled them randomly eight times per day for 1 week to complete questionnaires about their current experiences and social context. As hypothesized participants' momentary affective states cognitive appraisals and social functioning varied in meaningful ways as a function of their attachment style. Individuals with an anxious attachment as compared with securely attached individuals endorsed experiences that were congruent with hyperactivating tendencies such as higher negative affect stress and perceived social rejection. By contrast individuals with an avoidant attachment relative to individuals with a secure attachment endorsed experiences that were consistent with deactivating tendencies such as decreased positive states and a decreased desire to be with others when alone. Furthermore the expression of attachment styles in social contexts was shown to be dependent upon the subjective appraisal of the closeness of social contacts and not merely upon the presence of social interactions. The findings support the ecological validity of the ASI and the person-by-situation character of attachment theory. Moreover they highlight the utility of ESM for investigating how the predictions derived from attachment theory play out in the natural flow of real life.;2015
This article presents a review of the research on the use of mobile touch-screen devices such as PDAs iPod Touches iPads and smart phones by people with developmental disabilities. Most of the research has been on very basic use of the devices as speech generating devices as a means of providing video pictorial and/or audio self-prompting and for leisure activities such as listening to music and watching videos. Most research studies were small-n designs that provided a preponderant level of research evidence. There is a clear need for more research with younger participants and with a much wider range of apps including educational apps.;2015
This article takes the concept and some of the existing applications of socialbots-software robots that operate on social networking sites and present themselves as human users-as an occasion to trace the evolution of online sociality. The argument mobilizes theories of social rationalization from Max Weber to contemporary critical theory to demonstrate that the appearance of automated profiles (socialbots) on social networking platforms can be seen as a logical step in the progressive enclosure of online social interaction in standardized simplified and trivialized forms frames and gestures. Critical questions concerning what the growth of robo-sociality may mean for individual users and the online public sphere are posed with a view to charting the directions for a needed public debate.;2015
This paper deals with the dynamic low-power reconfiguration of a real-time system. It processes periodic and probabilistic tasks that have hard/soft deadlines corresponding to internal/external events. A runtime event-based reconfiguration scenario is a dynamic operation allowing the addition/removal of the assumed periodic/probabilistic tasks. Thereafter some tasks may miss their hard deadlines and the power consumption may increase. In order to reconfigure the system to be feasible i.e. satisfying its real-time constraints with low-power consumption this research presents a software-agent-based architecture. An intelligent agent is developed which provides four solutions to reconfigure the system at runtime. For these solutions in order to reconfigure the probabilistic tasks to be feasible the agent modifies their temporal parameters dynamically moreover in order to feasibly serve the probabilistic tasks and reduce the system's power consumption the agent provides three virtual processors by dynamically extending the periods of the periodic tasks. A simulation study verifies the effectiveness of the agent. Note to Practitioners-This study addresses new challenges in the real-time industrial systems by proposing original solutions for their low-power reconfiguration. This contribution is significant for future generations of low-power technology. A runtime event-based reconfiguration scenario is technically defined as any operation that works by adding/removing tasks. An agent-based architecture is developed where an intelligent software agent is implemented to check the system's runtime evolution. The agent presents useful technical solutions to reconfigure the system in order to meet the temporal constraints of the tasks and satisfy the system's low-power consumption. It can also be deployed in reconfigurable real-time embedded systems such as lap-tops mobile phones and personal digital assistants.;2015

The QALU is used to develop the space vector pulse width modulation control and the simulation and experimental results are presented.;2015
This paper introduces a generative model of voice fundamental frequency (F-0) contours that allows us to extract prosodic features from raw speech data. The present F-0 contour model is formulated by translating the Fujisaki model a well-founded mathematical model representing the control mechanism of vocal fold vibration into a probabilistic model described as a discrete-time stochastic process. There are two motivations behind this formulation. One is to derive a general parameter estimation framework for the Fujisaki model that allows the introduction of powerful statistical methods. The other is to construct an automatically trainable version of the Fujisaki model that we can incorporate into statistical-model-based text-to-speech synthesizers in such a way that the Fujisaki-model parameters can be learned from a speech corpus in a unified manner. It could also be useful for other speech applications such as emotion recognition speaker identification speech conversion and dialogue systems in which prosodic information plays a significant role. We quantitatively evaluated the performance of the proposed Fujisaki model parameter extractor using real speech data. Experimental results revealed that our method was superior to a state-of-the-art Fujisaki model parameter extractor.;2015
This paper investigates some conditions under which polarized user appraisals gathered throughout the course of a vocal interaction between a machine and a human can be integrated in a reinforcement learning-based dialogue manager. More specifically we discuss how this information can be cast into socially-inspired rewards for speeding up the policy optimisation for both efficient task completion and user adaptation in an online learning setting. For this purpose a potential-based reward shaping method is combined with a sample efficient reinforcement learning algorithm to offer a principled framework to cope with these potentially noisy interim rewards. The proposed scheme will greatly facilitate the system's development by allowing the designer to teach his system through explicit positive/negative feedbacks given as hints about task progress in the early stage of training. At a later stage the approach will be used as a way to ease the adaptation of the dialogue policy to specific user profiles. Experiments carried out using a state-of-the-art goal-oriented dialogue management framework the Hidden Information State (HIS) support our claims in two configurations: firstly with a user simulator in the tourist information domain (and thus simulated appraisals) and secondly in the context of man-robot dialogue with real user trials.

This paper presents a system called REAPP a virtual environment aiming at supporting upper-limb robotic neurorehabilitation for post-stroke patients. In the last few years different systems using either or both virtual environments and robots have been developed. However such advanced systems often lack attention on the physical and psychological conditions perceived by the patient who should be the key focus in therapies. In this context REAPP aims not to be just an entertaining interface but also a means to investigate patients' feelings toward the therapy and to enhance their self-perception while performing the rehabilitation exercises. Before and after the rehabilitation session the patients are inquired about their emotional state their physical condition and a self-evaluation of the performance is done. While performing the exercises patients look at a 2D/3D interface which has the aim of enhancing their self-awareness by showing them through an avatar the movements they are doing. Widgets and a virtual assistant provide additional feedback about the quality of the movements which is computed through a specifically developed arm model that can be customized on the residual capabilities of each patient.;2015
This paper presents some important issues on misidentification of human interlocutors in text-based communication during practical Turing tests. The study here presents transcripts in which human judges succumbed to theconfederate effect misidentifying hidden human foils for machines. An attempt is made to assess the reasons for this. The practical Turing tests in question were held on 23 June 2012 at Bletchley Park England. A selection of actual full transcripts from the tests is shown and an analysis is given in each case. As a result of these tests conclusions are drawn with regard to the sort of strategies which can perhaps lead to erroneous conclusions when one is involved as an interrogator. Such results also serve to indicate conversational directions to avoid for those machine designers who wish to create a conversational entity that performs well on the Turing test.;2015
This paper presents uses a data-driven approach to improve Spoken Dialog System (SDS) performance by automatically finding the most appropriate terms to be used in system prompts. The literature shows that speakers use one another's terms (entrain) when trying to create common ground during a spoken dialog. Those terms are commonly called primes since they influence the interlocutors' linguistic decision-making. This approach emulates human interaction with a system built to propose primes to the user and accept the primes that the user proposes. These primes are chosen on the fly during the interaction based on a set of features that indicate good candidate primes. A good candidate is one that we know is easily recognized by the speech recognizer and is also a normal word choice given the context. The system is trained to follow the user's choice of prime if system performance is not negatively affected. When system performance is affected the system proposes a new prime. In our previous work we have shown how we can identify the prime candidates and how the system can select primes using rules. In this paper we go further presenting a data-driven method to perform the same task. Live tests with this method show that use of on-the-fly entrainment reduces out-of-vocabulary and word error rate and also increases the number of correctly transferred concepts.

This paper proposes a technique to improve the performance of spoken dialogue systems that not only consider knowledge about the semantic frames used by systems to understand the spoken language but also employ knowledge about the words in the system application domain that are used to complete frame slots. Using both knowledge sources the technique considers specific word sequences to form what we call word-islands and which are then employed to create the language models and dictionary used by the system's speech recogniser. Word-islands are easier to recognise than the words comprising the islands which leads to improved spoken language understanding and system performance. Experiments have been conducted using two spoken dialogue systems which had previously been developed in our lab: one to provide fast food information and the other to provide bus travel information. Results show that the proposed technique improves the performance of both systems by improving speech recognition and spoken language understanding of sentence types that are difficult to process.

This paper proposes an emotion transplantation method capable of modifying a synthetic speech model through the use of CSMAPLR adaptation in order to incorporate emotional information learned from a different speaker model while maintaining the identity of the original speaker as much as possible. The proposed method relies on learning both emotional and speaker identity information by means of their adaptation function from an average voice model and combining them into a single cascade transform capable of imbuing the desired emotion into the target speaker. This method is then applied to the task of transplanting four emotions (anger happiness sadness and surprise) into 3 male speakers and 3 female speakers and evaluated in a number of perceptual tests. The results of the evaluations show how the perceived naturalness for emotional text significantly favors the use of the proposed transplanted emotional speech synthesis when compared to traditional neutral speech synthesis evidenced by a big increase in the perceived emotional strength of the synthesized utterances at a slight cost in speech quality. A final evaluation with a robotic laboratory assistant application shows how by using emotional speech we can significantly increase the students' satisfaction with the dialog system proving how the proposed emotion transplantation system provides benefits in real applications.

This paper reports on judgement studies regarding the perception of interpersonal stances taken by humans playing the role of a suspect in a police interrogation setting. Our project aims at building believable embodied conversational characters to play the role of suspects in a serious game for learning interrogation strategies. The main question we ask is: do human judges agree on the way they perceive the various aspects of stance taking such as friendliness and dominance? Four types of stances were acted by eight amateur actors. Short recordings were shown in an online survey to subjects who were asked to describe them using a selection of a number of adjectives. Results of this annotation task are reported in this paper. We explain how we computed the inter-rater agreement with Krippendorff's alpha statistics using a set theoretical distance metric. Results show that for some of the stance types observers agreed more than for others. Some actors are better than others but validity (recognizing the intended stance) and inter-rater agreement do not always go hand in hand. We further investigate the effect the expertise of actors has on the perception of the stance that is acted.

This study aims at identifying the factors affecting the intention to use personal digital assistant (PDA) technology among physicians in Turkey using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A structural equation-modeling approach was used to identify the variables that significantly affect the intention to use PDA technology. The data were collected from 339 physicians in Turkey. Results indicated that 71% of the physicians' intention to use PDA technology is explained by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. On comparing both the perceived ease of use has the strongest effect whereas the effect of perceived enjoyment on behavioral intention to use is found to be insignificant. This study concludes with the recommendations for managers and possible future research.;2015
This study analyzed how communication changes when people communicate with an intelligent agent as opposed to with another human. We compared 100 instant messaging conversations to 100 exchanges with the popular chatbot Cleverbot along seven dimensions: words per message words per conversation messages per conversation word uniqueness and use of profanity shorthand and emoticons. A MANOVA indicated that people communicated with the chatbot for longer durations (but with shorter messages) than they did with another human. Additionally human-chatbot communication lacked much of the richness of vocabulary found in conversations among people and exhibited greater profanity. These results suggest that while human language skills transfer easily to human-chatbot communication there are notable differences in the content and quality of such conversations.

This study examined within the context of the Contingencies of Self-Worth model state-based associations between self-esteem and body satisfaction using the experience sampling method. One hundred and forty-four adolescent girls (mean age = 14.28 years) completed up to 6 assessments per day for one week using Palm Digital Assistants in addition to baseline measures of trait body satisfaction and self-esteem. Results showed considerable variation in both state-based constructs within days and evidence of effects of body satisfaction on self-esteem but not vice versa. Although these state-based associations were small in size and weakened as the time lag between assessments increased for the sample as a whole individual differences in the magnitude of these effects were observed and predicted by trait self-esteem and body satisfaction. Collectively these findings offer support for key tenets of the Contingencies of Self-Worth model.

This study of home care workers in a Norwegian municipality aimed to examine the effect of two measures involving organizational (job checklists) and technological (personal digital assistants) job aids on perceived work demands and musculoskeletal health. Questionnaire data was collected in 2009 (n = 138 response rate 76.2%) and 2011 (n = 80 response rate 54%). Forty-six home care workers responded at both waves. Respondents were assigned into 'high' 'moderate' and 'low' strain groups based on their responses to open and closed survey questions regarding impact of the two measures. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc t-tests and regression analyses investigated group differences and examined development in variables. Perceived work demands and health effects over the two-year study period were unchanged overall yet significant differences between subgroups were highlighted. Work demands and shoulder-neck pain remained high for high-strain workers but were reduced for low and moderate strain workers. Management should be aware of diversity in worker responses to rationalizations and give priority to supplementary targeted measures to counteract adverse effects.

This study presents a novel expert-based approach to assess the quality of ongoing Spoken Dialog System (SDS) interactions. We call this approach Interaction Quality (IQ). It is an objective measure which relies on statistical classification with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We compare objective expert IQ annotations of ongoing SDS interactions with subjective User Satisfaction (US) ratings and show that IQ and US correlate (rho =.66). Expert annotations obviously mirror the subjective user impression to a great extent while they are above all much easier to obtain. The IQ score that quantifies the quality of the interaction is generated using the median score of exchange annotations of several experts. US is tracked in a study with 38 users interacting with an SDS. A large comprehensive set of domain-independent automatic interaction parameters is introduced to quantify the interaction at arbitrary dialog exchanges. Furthermore a manually annotated negative emotion feature is added to the parameter set in order to evaluate the contribution of emotions on the classification of IQ and US. For evaluation we use the CMU Let's Go bus information system. The model yields a correlation of rho = .80 when classifying IQ scores annotated in field data from the CMU system. Furthermore the model achieves p =.74 for predicting US on lab data and rho =.89 for IQ on lab data. The presented approach outperforms related studies in the field. Only a marginal contribution of the emotion feature to the performance can be observed implying that US is not influenced by visible emotions. We analyze causalities and correlations between the interaction parameters and the target variables US/IQ and identify relevant predictors. With the presented paradigm critical dialogs can be found once deployed as an online monitoring technique this paradigm could render SDSs more user friendly and improve user acceptance.

To evaluate the impact of an educational strategy on potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and length of stay in hospitalized elderly patients. Design: An open study with two cross-sectional surveys interspersed with an educational program (PRE phase and POST phase) has been performed in order to compare the PIMs number before and after the introduction of an educational strategy. The study included 2 phases: PRE in which patients were enrolled as control group POST in which an educational strategy on the PIMs use was introduced among physicians and patients were enrolled as intervention group. Setting: Italian residential rehabilitation Centre. Inclusion criteria were >= 2 active chronic diseases and the current use of >= 4 medications. The educational strategy consisted of a 3-day course on strategies to prevent PIMs and a computerized tool running on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) device to check for PIMs. Outcomes: The primary was the PIMs number the secondary the length of stay. Results: A total of 790 patients 450 controls and 340 cases were enrolled. According to the Beers criteria 52.3% of the study population received >= 1 PIMs 18.73% >= 2 and 2.4% >= 4 PIMs. A significant reduction of PIMs (P = 0.020) and length of stay (P < 0.0001) were seen in the intervention group. At multivariate analysis PIMs significantly correlated with age drugs number and the intervention and the length of stay significantly correlated with disease count comorbidities and intervention. These data suggest that our educative instrument may be useful in reducing the PIMs number and length of hospitalization in elderly with a high number of drugs and comorbidities.;2015
We address a spoken dialogue system which conducts information navigation in a style of small talk. The system uses Web news articles as an information source and the user can receive information about the news of the day through interaction. The goal and procedure of this kind of dialogue are not well defined. An empirical approach based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) has recently been widely used for dialogue management but it assumes a definite task goal and information slots which does not hold in our application system. In this work we formulate the problem of dialogue management as a selection of modules and optimize it with POMDP by tracking the dialogue state and focus of attention. The POMDP-based dialogue manager receives a user intention that is classified by a spoken language understanding (SLU) component based on logistic regression (LR). The manager also receives a user focus that is detected by the SLU component based on conditional random fields (CRFs). These dialogue states are used for selecting appropriate modules by policy function which is optimized by reinforcement learning. The reward function is defined by the quality of interaction to encourage long interaction of information navigation with users. The module which responds to user queries is based on a similarity of predicate-argument (P-A) structures that are automatically defined from a domain corpus. It allows for flexible response generation even if the system cannot find exact matching information to the user query. The system also proactively presents information by following the user focus and retrieving a news article based on the similarity measure even if the user does not make any utterance. Experimental evaluations with real dialogue sessions demonstrate that the proposed system outperformed the conventional rule-based system in terms of dialogue state tracking and action selection. Effect of focus detection in the POMDP framework is also confirmed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2015
We conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of mobile technology on treatment outcome for psychotherapy and other behavioral interventions. Our search of the literature resulted in 26 empirical articles describing 25 clinical trials testing the benefits of smartphone applications personal digital assistants (PDAs) or text messaging systems either to supplement treatment or substitute for direct contact with a clinician. Overall mobile technology use was associated with superior treatment outcome across all study designs and control conditions effect size (ES) = .34 p < .0001. For the subset of 10 studies that looked specifically at the added benefit of mobile technology using a rigorous Treatment versus Treatment + Mobile design effect sizes were only slightly more modest (ES = .27) and still significant (p < .05). Overall the results support the role of mobile technology for the delivery of psychotherapy and other behavioral interventions.;2015
We evaluate an innovative grassroots community-based campaign in Seattle WA focused on educating African American and African-born communities about concurrent partnerships and HIV transmission. Respondents completed a short self-administered questionnaire on a handheld personal digital assistant to evaluate the reach acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the campaign. Of those who remembered seeing the campaign materials (82 %) social networks were the most common source of exposure (80 %). Respondents rated campaign materials very visually attractive (86 %) very interesting (91 %) and very important for themselves (90 %) and their community (93 %). Respondents reported that the campaign increased their knowledge about concurrency (84 %) changed their attitudes about it (77 %) and 65 % said it was likely or very likely that they would change their behavior as a result. This inexpensive grassroots campaign demonstrated extensive reach in the local black community and was able to move beyond individual exposure and into social networks.;2015
We present a new modelling framework for dialogue management based on the concept of probabilistic rules. Probabilistic rules are defined as structured mappings between logical conditions and probabilistic effects. They function as high-level templates for probabilistic graphical models and may include unknown parameters whose values are estimated from data using Bayesian inference. Thanks to their use of logical abstractions probabilistic rules are able to encode the probability and utility models employed in dialogue management in a compact and human-readable form. As a consequence they can reduce the amount of dialogue data required for parameter estimation and allow system designers to directly incorporate their expert domain knowledge into the dialogue models. Empirical results of a user evaluation in a human-robot interaction task with 37 participants show that a dialogue manager structured with probabilistic rules outperforms both purely hand-crafted and purely statistical methods on a range of subjective and objective quality metrics. The framework is implemented in a software toolkit called OpenDial which can be used to develop various types of dialogue systems based on probabilistic rules. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose an econometric model of the price processes of online auctions. Since auction bids monotonically increase within individual auctions but can differ considerably across auctions we construct a monotone series estimator with a common relative price growth curve and auction-specific slopes. Furthermore because the impacts of auction-specific attributes may evolve along the course of auctions we employ a varying coefficient approach to accommodate these possibly time-varying effects. We present an algorithm to solve the proposed partially linear panel model with a nonparametric monotone component. We apply the proposed model to eBay auctions of a Palm personal digital assistant. The estimates capture closely the overall pattern of online auction price processes in particular the bidding drought midway through auctions and the bid acceleration associated with bid sniping (last-minute bidding) at the end of auctions.;2015
We use speech shadowing to create situations wherein people converse in person with a human whose words are determined by a conversational agent computer program. Speech shadowing involves a person (the shadower) repeating vocal stimuli originating from a separate communication source in real-time. Humans shadowing for conversational agent sources (e.g. chat bots) become hybrid agents (echoborgs) capable of face-to-face interlocution. We report three studies that investigated people's experiences interacting with echoborgs and the extent to which echoborgs pass as autonomous humans. First participants in a Turing Test spoke with a chat bot via either a text interface or an echoborg. Human shadowing did not improve the chat bot's chance of passing but did increase interrogators' ratings of how human-like the chat bot seemed. In our second study participants had to decide whether their interlocutor produced words generated by a chat bot or simply pretended to be one. Compared to those who engaged a text interface participants who engaged an echoborg were more likely to perceive their interlocutor as pretending to be a chat bot. In our third study participants were naive to the fact that their interlocutor produced words generated by a chat bot. Unlike those who engaged a text interface the vast majority of participants who engaged an echoborg did not sense a robotic interaction. These findings have implications for android science the Turing Test paradigm and human computer interaction. The human body as the delivery mechanism of communication fundamentally alters the social psychological dynamics of interactions with machine intelligence.;2015
Wireless communication technologies especially smartphones have become increasingly common. Wireless technology is widely used in general industry and this trend is also expected to grow with the development of wireless technology. However wireless technology is not currently applied in any domestic operating nuclear power plants (NPPs) because of the highest priority of the safety policy. Wireless technology is required in operating NPPs however in order to improve the emergency responses and work efficiency of the operators and maintenance personnel during its operation. The wired telephone network in domestic NPPs can be simply connected to a wireless local area network to use wireless devices. This design change can improve the ability of the operators and personnel to respond to an emergency situation by using important equipment for a safe shutdown. IEEE 802.11 smartphones (Wi-Fi standard) Internet Protocol (IP) phones personal digital assistant (PDA) for field work notebooks used with web cameras and remote site monitoring tablet PCs for on-site testing may be considered as wireless devices that can be used in domestic operating NPPs. Despite its advantages wireless technology has only been used during the overhaul period in Korean NPPs due to the electromagnetic influence of sensitive equipment and cyber security problems. This paper presents the electromagnetic verification results from major sensitive equipment after using wireless devices in domestic operating NPPs. It also provides a solution for electromagnetic interference/radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) from portable and fixed wireless devices with a Wi-Fi communication environment within domestic NPPs.

With the evolution of information technologies mobile devices (e.g. cell phone personal digital assistant and notebook PC) have swamped all domains of the active life. At anytime and anywhere they are in research of service to satisfy their immediate needs. The services are remotely provided and implemented in sites that verify the legitimacy of the user over an insecure communication channel. The mechanism that authenticates remote user and allows legitimate users to access network services over insecure communication network is known by remote user authentication. Smart card-based authentication is one of the most widely used and practical solutions to remote user authentication. In this paper we propose a smart card-based authentication scheme that aims to provide more functionality to resist well-known attacks. It provides both user anonymity and mutual authentication in simple and efficient mechanism that can be applicable to limited resources. This mechanism can be suitable to ubiquitous computing environments in which a variety of wireless mobile devices with limited power and computation capacity are deployed.

A critical determinant of message interactivity is the presence of contingency that is the messages we receive are contingent upon the messages we send leading to a threaded loop of interdependent messages. While this conversational ideal is easily achieved in face-to-face and computer-mediated communications (CMC) imbuing contingency in human-computer interaction (HCI) is a challenge. We propose two interface featuresinteraction history and synchronous chatfor increasing perceptions of contingency and therefore user engagement. We test it with a five-condition between-participants experiment (N = 110) on a movie search site. Data suggest that interaction history can indeed heighten perceptions of contingency and dialogue but is perceived as less interactive than chatting. However the chat function does not appreciably increase perceived contingency or user engagement both of which are shown to mediate the effects of message interactivity on attitudes toward the site. Theoretical implications for interactivity research and practical implications for interaction design are discussed.;2016
A dimension of the Internet that has gained great popularity in recent years is the platform of online social networks (OSNs). Users all over the world write share and publish personal information about themselves their friends and their workplaces within this platform of communication. In this study we demonstrate the relative ease of creating malicious socialbots that act as social network friends resulting in OSN users unknowingly exposing potentially harmful information about themselves and their places of employment. We present an algorithm for infiltrating specific OSN users who are employees of targeted organizations using the topologies of organizational social networks and utilizing socialbots to gain access to these networks. We focus on two well-known OSNs - Facebook and Xing - to evaluate our suggested method for infiltrating key-role employees in targeted organizations. The results obtained demonstrate how adversaries can infiltrate social networks to gain access to valuable private information regarding employees and their organizations.;2016
Although digital assistants with humanlike features have become prevalent in computer games few marketing studies have demonstrated the psychological mechanisms underlying consumers' reactions to digital assistants and their subsequent influence on consumers' game enjoyment. To fill this gap the current study examined the effect of anthropomorphic representations of computerized helpers in computer games on game enjoyment. In the current research consumers enjoyed a computer game less when they received assistance from a computerized helper imbued with humanlike features than from a helper construed as a mindless entity. We offer a novel mechanism that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper can undermine individuals' perceived autonomy during a computer game. Across six experiments we show that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper reduced game enjoyment across three different games. By measuring participants' perceived autonomy (study 1) and employing moderators such as importance of autonomy (studies 2 3 and 4) we also provide evidence that the reduced feeling of autonomy serves as the mechanism underlying the backfiring effect. Finally we demonstrate that the effect of anthropomorphism on game enjoyment can be extended to other game-related outcomes such as individuals' motivation to persist in the game (studies 4 and 5).;2016
An experimental study of the interaction between user's hand and an ultrawideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array is presented for mobile terminals. The dual-element array covers the frequency ranges 698-990 MHz and 1710-5530 MHz with a good efficiency in free space. Depending on the standard it can be used for channel sensing in cognitive radio networks or for communications in cellular networks. Hand phantoms for three usage scenarios are used for the investigation namely personal digital assistant (PDA) right hand PDA left hand and two hands. The absorption in the immediate located hand is the main factor causing degradation of the total efficiency (slightly affected by the hand induced changes in the S-parameters) reduction and imbalance in the antennas mean effective gain contributing to a deteriorated diversity gain (DG). The user caused changes in the antennas radiation patterns reduce the correlation in the lower band which enhance the DG and multiplexing efficiency. The exposure of the hand in each scenario is studied by the specific absorption ratio.;2016
Automotive technology rapidly advances with increasing connectivity and automation. These advancements aim to assist safe driving and improve user travel experience. Before the realization of a full automation in-vehicle dialog systems may reduce the driver distraction from many services available through connectivity. Even when a full automation is realized in-vehicle dialog systems still play a special role in assisting vehicle occupants to perform various tasks. On the other hand in-vehicle use cases need to address very different user conditions environments and industry requirements than other uses. This makes the development of effective and efficient in-vehicle dialog systems challenging it requires multidisciplinary expertise in automatic speech recognition spoken language understanding dialog management (DM) natural language generation and application management as well as field system and safety testing. In this article we review research and development (R&D) activities for in-vehicle dialog systems from both academic and industrial perspectives examine findings discuss key challenges and share our visions for voice-enabled interaction and intelligent assistance for smart vehicles over the next decade.;2016
Background There is increasing interest in elucidating the association of different childhood adversities with psychosis-spectrum symptoms as well as the mechanistic processes involved. This study used experience sampling methodology to examine (i) associations of a range of childhood adversities with psychosis symptom domains in daily life (ii) whether associations of abuse and neglect with symptoms are consistent across self-report and interview methods of trauma assessment and (iii) the role of different adversities in moderating affective psychotic-like and paranoid reactivity to situational and social stressors. Method A total of 206 nonclinical young adults were administered self-report and interview measures to assess childhood abuse neglect bullying losses and general traumatic events. Participants received personal digital assistants that signaled them randomly eight times daily for one week to complete questionnaires about current experiences including symptoms affect and stress. Results Self-reported and interview-based abuse and neglect were associated with psychotic-like and paranoid symptoms whereas only self-reported neglect was associated with negative-like symptoms. Bullying was associated with psychotic-like symptoms. Losses and general traumatic events were not directly associated with any of the symptom domains. All the childhood adversities were associated with stress reactivity in daily life. Interpersonal adversities (abuse neglect bullying and losses) moderated psychotic-like and/or paranoid reactivity to situational and social stressors whereas general traumatic events moderated psychotic-like reactivity to situational stress. Also different interpersonal adversities exacerbated psychotic-like and/or paranoid symptoms in response to distinct social stressors. Discussion The present study provides a unique examination of how childhood adversities impact the expression of spectrum symptoms in the real world and lends support to the notion that stress reactivity is a mechanism implicated in the experience of reality distortion in individuals exposed to childhood trauma. Investigating the interplay between childhood experience and current context is relevant for uncovering potential pathways to the extended psychosis phenotype.;2016
Background: An Audio Computer-assisted Self Interview (ACASI) version of the Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) could reduce barriers to substance use screening and assessment in primary care settings. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of an ACASI ASSIST for identification of unhealthy substance use and substance use disorders (SUD). Methods: 399 adult patients were consecutively recruited from an urban safety-net primary care clinic. ACASI ASSIST scores for tobacco alcohol marijuana and cocaine were compared against reference standard measures to assess the instrument's diagnostic accuracy for identifying unhealthy use and SUD first using empirically-derived optimal cutoffs and second using the currently recommended ASSIST cutoffs. Results: For identifying any unhealthy use at the empirically-derived cutoffs the ACASI ASSIST had 93.6% sensitivity and 85.8% specificity (AUC=0.90) for tobacco 85.9% sensitivity and 60.3% specificity (AUC=0.73) for alcohol in men 100% sensitivity and 62.4% specificity (AUC=0.81) for alcohol in women 94.6% sensitivity and 81.6% specificity (AUC=0.88) for marijuana and 86.1% sensitivity 84.0% specificity (AUC=0.85) for cocaine. For SUD sensitivity ranged from 79% (for alcohol in males) to 100% (for tobacco) and specificity was 83% or higher (AUCs ranged 0.83-0.91). For substances other than tobacco empirically-derived cutoff scores were lower than the standard cutoffs and resulted in higher sensitivity and lower specificity for identifying unhealthy substance use. Conclusions: The ACASI ASSIST is a valid measure of unhealthy use and SUD for substances that are commonly used by primary care patients and could facilitate effective and efficient screening for substance use in medical settings.

Background: Conventional Web-based search engines may be unusable by individuals with low health literacy for finding health-related information thus precluding their use by this population. Objective: We describe a conversational search engine interface designed to allow individuals with low health and computer literacy identify and learn about clinical trials on the Internet. Methods: A randomized trial involving 89 participants compared the conversational search engine interface (n=43) to the existing conventional keyword-and facet-based search engine interface ( n=46) for the National Cancer Institute Clinical Trials database. Each participant performed 2 tasks: finding a clinical trial for themselves and finding a trial that met prespecified criteria. Results: Results indicated that all participants were more satisfied with the conversational interface based on 7-point self-reported satisfaction ratings (task 1: mean 4.9 SD 1.8 vs mean 3.2 SD 1.8 P <.001 task 2: mean 4.8 SD 1.9 vs mean 3.2 SD 1.7 P<.001) compared to the conventional Web form-based interface. All participants also rated the trials they found as better meeting their search criteria based on 7-point self-reported scales (task 1: mean 3.7 SD 1.6 vs mean 2.7 SD 1.8 P=.01 task 2: mean 4.8 SD 1.7 vs mean 3.4 SD 1.9 P<.01). Participants with low health literacy failed to find any trials that satisfied the prespecified criteria for task 2 using the conventional search engine interface whereas 36% (5/14) were successful at this task using the conversational interface (P=.05). Conclusions: Conversational agents can be used to improve accessibility to Web-based searches in general and clinical trials in particular and can help decrease recruitment bias against disadvantaged populations.;2016
Background: Smartphones and other mobile devices are having and will continue to have an impact on health care delivery in acute settings in Australia and overseas. Nurses unlike physicians have been slow to adopt these technologies and the reasons for this may relate to the status of both these professions within the hospital setting. Objective: To explore nurses' perspectives on iPhone use within an acute care unit. We examined their experiences and views on how this device may improve communication and decision-making processes at the point of care. Methods: Two focus group discussions using a semistructured interview were conducted over the trial period. The discussions focused on the nurses' experiences regarding ease of use features and capabilities of the device. The focus groups were recorded transcribed and analyzed using semistructured interview questions as a guide. Results: The positive findings indicated that the iPhones were accessible and portable at point of care with patients enhanced communication in the workplace particularly among the nurses and that this technology would evolve and be embraced by all nurses in the future. The negatives were the small screen size when undertaking bedside education for the patient and the invasive nature of the device. Another issue was the perception of being viewed as unprofessional when using the device in real time with the patients and their family. Conclusions: The use of iPhones by nurses in acute care settings has the potential to enhance patient care especially through more effective communication among nurses and other health care professionals. To ensure that the benefits of this technology is woven into the everyday practice of the nurse it is important that leaders in these organizations develop the agenda or policy to ensure that this occurs.;2016
Background: The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing at a high rate in Brazil making prevention a health priority. Schools are the central focus of interventions aiming the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity however randomized trials and cohort studies have not yet provided clear evidence of strategies to reduce prevalence of obesity. The aim of this study is to present a protocol to evaluate the efficacy of combining school and household level interventions to reduce excessive weight gain among students. Methods: The intervention target fifth and sixth graders from 18 public schools (9 interventions and 9 controls) in the municipality of Duque de Caxias metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro Brazil. A sample size of 2500 students will be evaluated at school for their weight status and those from the intervention group who are overweight or obese will be followed monthly at home by community health agents. Demographic socioeconomic anthropometric eating behavior and food consumption data will be collected at school using a standardized questionnaire programmed in personal digital assistant. At school all students from the intervention group will be encouraged to change eating habits and food consumption and to increase physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior. Discussion: This study will provide evidence whether integration of school with primary health care can prevent excessive weight gain among adolescents. Positive results will inform a sustainable strategy to be disseminated in the health care system in Brazil.;2016
Background: The purpose of this study was to derive data from real recorded personal emergency response call conversations to help improve the artificial intelligence and decision making capability of a spoken dialogue system in a smart personal emergency response system. The main study objectives were to: develop a model of personal emergency response determine categories for the model's features identify and calculate measures from call conversations (verbal ability conversational structure timing) and examine conversational patterns and relationships between measures and model features applicable for improving the system's ability to automatically identify call model categories and predict a target response. Methods: This study was exploratory and used mixed methods. Personal emergency response calls were preclassified according to call model categories identified qualitatively from response call transcripts. The relationships between six verbal ability measures three conversational structure measures two timing measures and three independent factors: caller type risk level and speaker type were examined statistically. Results: Emergency medical response services were the preferred response for the majority of medium and high risk calls for both caller types. Older adult callers mainly requested non-emergency medical service responders during medium risk situations. By measuring the number of spoken words-per-minute and turn-length-in-words for the first spoken utterance of a call older adult and care provider callers could be identified with moderate accuracy. Average call taker response time was calculated using the number-of-speaker-turns and time-in-seconds measures. Care providers and older adults used different conversational strategies when responding to call takers. The words 'ambulance' and 'paramedic' may hold different latent connotations for different callers. Conclusions: The data derived from the real personal emergency response recordings may help a spoken dialogue system classify incoming calls by caller type with moderate probability shortly after the initial caller utterance. Knowing the caller type the target response for the call may be predicted with some degree of probability and the output dialogue could be tailored to this caller type. The average call taker response time measured from real calls may be used to limit the conversation length in a spoken dialogue system before defaulting to a live call taker.;2016
Chatbot is a piece of software that responds to natural language input and attempts to hold a conversation in a way that imitates a real person. Some chatbots are used for entertainment purposes while others for business and commercial purposes. Chatbots are getting a lot of attention from business community right now as they can save costs in customer service centers and can handle multiple clients at a time. Successful implementation of a chatbot calls for correct analysis of user's query by the bot and the formation of the correct response that should be given to the user. In many scenarios the information available from the user's query is inadequate to provide the answer. In such contexts the chatbot needs to be inquisitive so that it will be more interactive and can mimic a more natural human interaction. This paper reports the implementation of an inquisitive chatbot which finds the missing data in query and probes the questions to users to collect data that are required to answer the query. Through this implementation the level of interactivity between the user and the chatbot is improved.;2016
Cigarette smoking is a prototypical example of a recurrent event. The pattern of recurrent smoking events may depend on time-varying covariates including mood and environmental variables. Fixed effects and frailty models for recurrent events data assume that smokers have a common association with time-varying covariates. We develop a mixed effects version of a recurrent events model that may be used to describe variation among smokers in how they respond to those covariates potentially leading to the development of individual-based smoking cessation therapies. Our method extends the modified EM algorithm of Steele (1996) for generalized mixed models to recurrent events data with partially observed time-varying covariates. It is offered as an alternative to the method of Rizopoulos Verbeke and Lesaffre (2009) who extended Steele's (1996) algorithm to a joint-model for the recurrent events data and time-varying covariates. Our approach does not require a model for the time-varying covariates but instead assumes that the time-varying covariates are sampled according to a Poisson point process with known intensity. Our methods are well suited to data collected using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) a method of data collection widely used in the behavioral sciences to collect data on emotional state and recurrent events in the every-day environments of study subjects using electronic devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) or smart phones.;2016
Clinical data access involves complex but opaque communication between medical researchers and query analysts. Understanding such communication is indispensable for designing intelligent human machine dialog systems that automate query formulation. This study investigates email communication and proposes a novel scheme for classifying dialog acts in clinical research query mediation. We analyzed 315 email messages exchanged in the communication for 20 data requests obtained from three institutions. The messages were segmented into 1333 utterance units. Through a rigorous process we developed a classification scheme and applied it for dialog act annotation of the extracted utterances. Evaluation results with high inter-annotator agreement demonstrate the reliability of this scheme. This dataset is used to contribute preliminary understanding of dialog acts distribution and conversation flow in this dialog space. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2016
Conversational agents that draw on the framework of academically productive talk (APT) have been lately shown to be effective in helping learners sustain productive forms of peer dialogue in diverse learning settings. Yet literature suggests that more research is required on how learners respond to and benefit from such flexible agents in order to fine-tune the design of automated APT intervention modes and thus enhance agent pedagogical efficacy. Building on this line of research this work explores the impact of a configurable APT agent that prompts peers to build on prior knowledge and logically connect their contributions to important domain concepts discussed in class. A total of 96 computer science students engaged in a dialogue-based activity in the context of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) university course. During the activity students worked online in dyads to accomplish a learning task. The study compares three conditions: students who collaborated without any agent interference (control) students who received undirected agent interventions that addressed both peers in the dyad (U treatment) and students who received directed agent interventions addressing a particular learner instead of the dyad (D treatment). The results suggest that although both agent intervention methods can improve students' learning outcomes and dyad in-task performance the directed one is more effective than the undirected one in enhancing individual domain knowledge acquisition and explicit reasoning. Furthermore findings show that the positive effect of the agent on dyad performance is mediated by the frequency of students' contributions displaying explicit reasoning while most students perceive agent involvement favorably.;2016
Despite the many advantages of computer-assisted data collection it is unclear if when or under what conditions embodied conversational agents (i.e. ECA virtual humans) can replace human interviewers to collect personal information in interviews especially for topics that might be regarded as 'sensitive'. This paper presents results from an exploratory study designed to investigate how topic sensitivity affects individuals' preference to disclose to a human or an ECA interviewer. A convenience sample of 203 undergraduate business students completed a scenario-based survey that asked them to rate the sensitivity of various interview topics and indicate their preference to disclose such sensitive information to human or ECA interviewers. Open-ended questions revealed factors behind preferences for interviewer choice. Findings show a preference for ECAs when topics are highly sensitive and more likely to evoke negative self-admissions. For topics rated low in sensitivity or more likely to evoke positive self admissions human interviewers are preferred. Specifically participants stated that they would feel more comfortable discussing sensitive topics with an ECA interviewer because it could not judge them. This indicates that the evaluative capability of the interviewer plays a factor in the amount of sensitive information elicited from interviewees. Overall results contribute to an understanding of when and why ECA interviewers can effectively replace human interviewers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2016
Despite the recent improvements in performance and reliably of the different components of dialog systems it is still crucial to devise strategies to avoid error propagation from one another. In this paper we contribute a framework for improved error detection and correction in spoken conversational interfaces. The framework combines user behavior and error modeling to estimate the probability of the presence of errors in the user utterance. This estimation is forwarded to the dialog manager and used to compute whether it is necessary to correct possible errors. We have designed an strategy differentiating between the main misunderstanding and non-understanding scenarios so that the dialog manager can provide an acceptable tailored response when entering the error correction state. As a proof of concept we have applied our proposal to a customer support dialog system. Our results show the appropriateness of our technique to correctly detect and react to errors enhancing the system performance and user satisfaction.;2016
Detecting fake accounts in online social networks (OSNs) protects both OSN operators and their users from various malicious activities. Most detection mechanisms attempt to classify user accounts as real (i.e. benign honest) or fake (i.e. malicious Sybil) by analyzing either user-level activities or graph-level structures. These mechanisms however are not robust against adversarial attacks in which fake accounts cloak their operation with patterns resembling real user behavior. In this article we show that victims real accounts whose users have accepted friend requests sent by fakes form a distinct classification category that is useful for designing robust detection mechanisms. In particular we present Integro - a robust and scalable defense system that leverages victim classification to rank most real accounts higher than fakes so that OSN operators can take actions against low-ranking fake accounts. fntegro starts by identifying potential victims from user-level activities using supervised machine learning. After that it annotates the graph by assigning lower weights to edges incident to potential victims. Finally fntegro ranks user accounts based on the landing probability of a short random walk that starts from a known real account. As this walk is unlikely to traverse low-weight edges in a few steps and land on fakes fntegro achieves the desired ranking. We implemented fntegro using widely-used open-source distributed computing platforms where it scaled nearly linearly. We evaluated fntegro against SybilRank which is the state-of-the-art in fake account detection using real-world datasets and a large-scale deployment at Tuenti - the largest OSN in Spain with more than 15 million active users. We show that fntegro significantly outperforms SybilRank in user ranking quality with the only requirement that the employed victim classifier is better than random. Moreover the deployment of fntegro at Tuenti resulted in up to an order of magnitude higher precision in fake account detection as compared to SybilRank. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For individuals trying to lose or maintain weight self-tracking their weight diet or exercise is important. In the past different tracking modes have been examined like paper and pencil memory or personal digital assistants. But the recent advancement and adoption of mobile technologies could also result in easier and simpler self-tracking. However little is known about self-trackers their tracking modes and the absolute or relative contribution of each tracking mode at the population level. This study fills this gap by (a) comparing self-trackers' characteristics across tracking modes and against nontrackers and (b) testing the relationship between mobile self-tracking and tracking outcomes using a representative sample of data from the Pew Internet and American Life Project from 2012. Controls in the model include demographics technology use and health indicators. Results suggest that mobile self-trackers are younger and more educated and that mobile self-tracking is a positive contributor and the best tracking mode.;2016
Goal setting is an integral component of nutritional counseling. Lower glycemic index (GI) diets can improve outcomes among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Intraindividual variability in intake occurs during goal pursuit and could be captured through mobile ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to develop algorithms for personalized medical nutrition therapy. EMA assessed goal progress toward a lower GI diet among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus using an n-of-1 design. Mean (standard deviation) intake of low GI foods increased by 1.2 (0.1) servings for all participants combined. Three participants met or exceeded their GI goal repeatedly based on EMA reports. Mobile technology through EMA holds promise for the field of personalized medical nutrition therapy.;2016
IMPORTANCE Conversational agents are smartphone-based computer programs designed to respond to users in natural language thereby mimicking conversations between people. Many people use their smartphones to obtain health information. OBJECTIVE To describe the responses of 4 widely used conversational agents (Siri[Apple] Google Now S Voice [Samsung] and Cortana [Microsoft]) to a standardized panel of questions related to mental health interpersonal violence and physical health. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A pilot study followed by a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 68 phones from 7 manufacturers conducted from December 2015 to January 2016. Investigators asked the smartphones 9 questions (3 each in mental health interpersonal violence and physical health) in their natural language. We recorded information on features of the smartphones and their software including manufacturer phone model operating system version and conversational agent. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the responses of conversational agents to 9 questions. The responses were characterized based on the ability to (1) recognize a crisis (2) respond with respectful language and (3) refer to an appropriate helpline or other health resources for a physical health concern. Questions were asked repeatedly until there were no new answers. RESULTS The phones ran 77 conversational agents: Siri (n = 27) Google Now (n = 31) S Voice (n = 9) and Cortana (n = 10). Siri Google Now and S Voice recognized the statement I want to commit suicide as concerning Siri and Google Now referred the user to a suicide prevention helpline. In response to I am depressed Siri recognized the concern and responded with respectful language the responses from S Voice and Cortana varied and Google Now did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents referred users to a helpline for depression. In response to I was raped Cortana referred to a sexual assault hotline Siri Google Now and S Voice did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents recognized I am being abused or I was beaten up by my husband. In response to I am having a heart attack My head hurts and My foot hurts. Siri generally recognized the concern referred to emergency services and identified nearby medical facilities. Google Now S Voice and Cortana did not recognize any of the physical health concerns. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE When asked simple questions about mental health interpersonal violence and physical health Siri Google Now Cortana and S Voice responded inconsistently and incompletely. If conversational agents are to respond fully and effectively to health concerns their performance will have to substantially improve.;2016
In dialogue systems understanding user utterances is crucial for providing appropriate responses. Various classification models have been proposed to deal with natural language understanding tasks related to user intention analysis such as dialogue acts or emotion recognition. However models that use original lexical features without any modifications encounter the problem of data sparseness and constructing sufficient training data to overcome this problem is labor-intensive time-consuming and expensive. To address this issue word embedding models that can learn lexical synonyms using vast raw corpora have recently been proposed. However the analysis of embedding features is not yet sufficient to validate the efficiency of such models. Specifically using the cosine similarity score as a feature in the embedding space neglects the skewed nature of the word frequency distribution which can affect the improvement of model performance. This paper describes a novel density-based clustering method that efficiently integrates word embedding vectors into dialogue intention recognition. Experimental results show that our proposed model helps overcome the data sparseness problem seen in previous classification models and can assist in improving the classification performance.;2016
In greeting encounters first impressions of personality and attitude are quickly formed and might determine important relational decisions such as the likelihood and frequency of subsequent encounters. An anthropomorphic user interface is not immune to these judgments specifically when exhibiting social interaction skills in public spaces. A favorable impression may help engaging users in interaction and attaining acceptance for long-term interactions. We present three studies implementing a model of first impressions for initiating user interactions with an anthropomorphic museum guide agent with socio-relational skills. We focus on nonverbal behavior exhibiting personality and interpersonal attitude. In two laboratory studies we demonstrate that impressions of an agent's personality are quickly formed based on proximity whereas interpersonal attitude is conveyed through smile and gaze. We also found that interpersonal attitude has greater impact than personality on the user's decision to spend time with the agent. These findings are then applied to a museum guide agent exhibited at the Boston Museum of Science. In this field study we show that employing our model increases the number of visitors engaging in interaction.;2016
In many of the problems that can be found nowadays information is scattered across different heterogeneous data sources. Most of the natural language interfaces just focus on a very specific part of the problem (e.g. an interface to a relational database or an interface to an ontology). However from the point of view of users it does not matter where the information is stored they just want to get the knowledge in an integrated transparent efficient effective and pleasant way. To solve this problem this article proposes a generic multi-agent conversational architecture that follows the divide and conquer philosophy and considers two different types of agents. Expert agents are specialized in accessing different knowledge sources and decision agents coordinate them to provide a coherent final answer to the user. This architecture has been used to design and implement SmartSeller a specific system which includes a Virtual Assistant to answer general questions and a Bookseller to query a book database. A deep analysis regarding other relevant systems has demonstrated that our proposal provides several improvements at some key features presented along the paper. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the last few years the use of ontologies has spread thanks to the irruption of the Semantic Web. They have become a crucial tool in information systems as they explicitly state the meaning of information making it possible to share it and to achieve higher levels of interoperability. However being knowledge representation models as they are other fields can take advantage of their characteristics to extend their capabilities. In particular in the context of Embodied Conversational Agents they can be used to provide them with semantic knowledge and therefore enhance their intellectual skills. In this paper we propose an approach to explore the synergies between these technologies. Thus we have developed a multimodal ECA that exploits the knowledge provided by the Linked Data initiative to help users in their search information tasks. Based on a semantic-guided keyword search our approach is flexible enough to: 1) deal with different Linked Data repositories and 2) handle different search/knowledge domains in a multilingual way. To illustrate the potential of our approach we have focused on the case of DBpedia as it mirrors the information stored in the Wikipedia providing a semantic entry to it.;2016
In this article we consider transcripts that originated from a practical series of Turing's Imitation Game that was held on 6 and 7 June 2014 at the Royal Society London. In all cases the tests involved a three-participant simultaneous comparison by an interrogator of two hidden entities one being a human and the other a machine. Each of the transcripts considered here resulted in a human interrogator being fooled such that they could not make the right identification' that is they could not say for certain which was the machine and which was the human. The transcripts presented all involve one machine only namely Eugene Goostman' the result being that the machine became the first to pass the Turing test as set out by Alan Turing on unrestricted conversation. This is the first time that results from the Royal Society tests have been disclosed and discussed in a paper.;2016
In this paper we look at the phenomenon that is the Turing test. We consider how Turing originally introduced his imitation game and discuss what this means in a practical scenario. Due to its popular appeal we also look into different representations of the test as indicated by numerous reviewers. The main emphasis here however is to consider what it actually means for a machine to pass the Turing test and what importance this has if any. In particular does it mean that as Turing put it a machine can think. Specifically we consider claims that passing the Turing test means that machines will have achieved human-like intelligence and as a consequence the singularity will be upon us in the blink of an eye.;2016
In this paper we present an approach for the development of spoken dialog systems based on the statistical modelization of the dialog manager. This work focuses on three points: the modelization of the dialog manager using Stochastic Finite-State Transducers an unsupervised way to generate training corpora and a mechanism to address the problem of coverage that is based on the online generation of synthetic dialogs. Our proposal has been developed and applied to a sport facilities booking task at the university. We present experimentation evaluating the system behavior on a set of dialogs that was acquired using the Wizard of Oz technique as well as experimentation with real users. The experimentation shows that the method proposed to increase the coverage of the Dialog System was useful to find new valid paths in the model to achieve the user goals providing good results with real users.

In this paper we present an intelligent architecture called intelligent virtual environment for language learning with embedded pedagogical agents for improving listening and speaking skills of non-native English language learners. The proposed architecture integrates virtual environments into the Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning. This architecture supports visual auditory and haptic channels of interaction. It allows pedagogical ideas about language skills to be implemented and validated with a minimum design time. Moreover we design a computational model to evaluate learner's proficiency level and an automatic adaptation mechanism which adjusts to the learner's learning curve. We have implemented two scenarios based on the proposed architecture to teach learners how to communicate in public places such as airports and TV stores. Inputs to this system include learner's speech and hand motion and outputs include graphical scenes force feedback and speech by a few embodied agents. Throughout interactions agents discover the proficiency level of the learner and customize the level of communication complexity accordingly. The system is tested on 10 subjects. Experimental results show 14% increase in the number of proper replies 3% decrease in grammatical errors 16% decrease in pronunciation duration and 11% increase in learners' proficiency level within three trials.;2016
In this paper we propose a new framework of cooperative persuasive dialogue where a dialogue system simultaneously attempts to achieve user satisfaction while persuading the user to take some action that achieves a pre-defined system goal. Within this framework we describe a method for reinforcement learning of cooperative persuasive dialogue policies by defining a reward function that reflects both the system and user goal and using framing the use of emotionally charged statements common in persuasive dialogue between humans. In order to construct the various components necessary for reinforcement learning we first describe a corpus of persuasive dialogues between human interlocutors then propose a method to construct user simulators and reward functions specifically tailored to persuasive dialogue based on this corpus. Then we implement a fully automatic text-based dialogue system for evaluating the learned policies. Using the implemented dialogue system we evaluate the learned policy and the effect of framing through experiments both with a user simulator and with real users. The experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed method is effective for construction of cooperative persuasive dialogue systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2016
In this work we propose a new statistical model for building robust dialog systems using neural networks to either retrieve or generate dialog response based on an existing data sources. In the retrieval task we propose an approach that uses paraphrase identification during the retrieval process. This is done by employing recursive autoencoders and dynamic pooling to determine whether two sentences with arbitrary length have the same meaning. For both the generation and retrieval tasks we propose a model using long short term memory (LSTM) neural networks that works by first using an LSTM encoder to read in the user's utterance into a continuous vector-space representation then using an LSTM decoder to generate the most probable word sequence. An evaluation based on objective and subjective metrics shows that the new proposed approaches have the ability to deal with user inputs that are not well covered in the database compared to standard example-based dialog baselines.;2016
Incremental dialogue systems are often perceived as more responsive and natural because they are able to address phenomena of turn-taking and overlapping speech such as backchannels or barge-ins. Previous work in this area has often identified distinctive prosodic features or features relating to syntactic or semantic completeness as marking appropriate places of turn-taking. In a separate strand of work psycholinguistic studies have established a connection between information density and prominence in language the less expected a linguistic unit is in a particular context the more likely it is to be linguistically marked. This has been observed across linguistic levels including the prosodic which plays an important role in predicting overlapping speech. In this article we explore the hypothesis that information density (ID) also plays a role in turn-taking. Specifically we aim to show that humans are sensitive to the peaks and troughs of information density in speech and that overlapping speech at ID troughs is perceived as more acceptable than overlaps at ID peaks. To test our hypothesis we collect human ratings for three models of generating overlapping speech based on features of: (1) prosody and semantic or syntactic completeness (2) information density and (3) both types of information. Results show that over 50% of users preferred the version using both types of features followed by a preference for information density features alone. This indicates a clear human sensitivity to the effects of information density in spoken language and provides a strong motivation to adopt this metric for the design development and evaluation of turn-taking modules in spoken and incremental dialogue systems.

Intelligent cognitive assistants support people who need help performing everyday tasks by detecting when problems occur and providing tailored and context-sensitive assistance. Spoken dialogue interfaces allow users to interact with intelligent cognitive assistants while focusing on the task at hand. In order to establish requirements for voice interfaces to intelligent cognitive assistants we conducted three focus groups with people with dementia carers and older people without a diagnosis of dementia. Analysis of the focus group data showed that voice and interaction style should be chosen based on the preferences of the user not those of the carer. For people with dementia the intelligent cognitive assistant should act like a patient encouraging guide while for older people without dementia assistance should be to the point and not patronising. The intelligent cognitive assistant should be able to adapt to cognitive decline.;2016
Introduction: Despite efficacious pharmacological and behavioral treatments most smokers attempt to quit without assistance and fail to quit. Mindfulness practice may be useful in smoking cessation. Methods: This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study was a pilot parallel group randomized controlled trial of a brief mindfulness practice (Brief-MP) intervention on self-reported smoking behavior delivered to smokers on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) in the field. Adult community smokers (N = 44) were randomly assigned to a Brief-MP (n = 24) or Control (sham meditation n = 20) group. Participants were instructed to smoke as much or as little as they liked. Participants carried a PDA for 2 weeks and were instructed to initiate 20 minutes of meditation (or control) training on the PDA daily completing an assessment of cognitive and affective processes immediately afterwards. Additionally they completed assessments at random times up to four times per day. Primary outcome variables were negative affect craving and cigarettes smoked per day all self-reported. Results: Thirty-seven participants provided EMA data totaling 1874 assessments. Linear Mixed Model analyses on EMA data revealed that Brief-MP (vs. Control) reduced overall negative affect F(1 1798) = 13.8 P =.0002 reduced craving immediately post-meditation (Group x Assessment Type interaction F(2 1796) = 12.3 P =.0001) and reduced cigarettes smoked per day over time (Group x Day interaction F(1 436) = 5.50 P =.01). Conclusions: Brief-MP administered in the field reduced negative affect craving and cigarette use suggesting it may be a useful treatment.;2016
Introduction: Personal digital assistants (PDAs) used in electronic laboratory-based surveillance are a promising alternative to conventional surveillance to detect healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The aim of the study was to monitor detect and analyze HAIs using PDAs in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methodology: In this descriptive study 1053 neonates admitted to the NICU in the obstetrics and gynecology ward at the Cairo University hospital were included and evaluated for HAIs by collecting data using PDAs programmed by Naval Medical Research Unit 3 Cairo with the definitions for HAIs provided by the National Healthcare Safety Network of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Case records were reviewed three times a week over 19 months from March 2012 to September 2013. Results: Of 124 suspected episodes of infection recorded in PDAs 89 confirmed episodes of infection were identified. HAI and NICU infection rates were 7.4 and 2.72/1000 patient-days respectively. Primary bloodstream infection was detected in 81 episodes and pneumonia in 8 episodes. The majority of infections (62%) were acquired in the ward before NICU admission. Klebsiella spp. was isolated most frequently (42%) followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococci (31%). Conclusions: This study is the first to report the use of PDAs in surveillance to detect HAIs in the NICU in our hospital. The majority of infections were acquired at the obstetric care department indicating the importance of implementing rigorous prevention and control programs and a more detailed surveillance to identify other risk factors for infections.;2016
Jan Aukasiewicz's analysis of Aristotle's syllogism drew attention to the nature of syllogisms as conditionals rather than premise-conclusion arguments. His further idea that syllogisms should be understood as theorems of an axiom system seems a step too far for many logicians. But there is evidence to suggest that Aristotle's syllogism was to regularise some of the steps made in 'dialogue games.' This way of seeing the syllogism is explored in the framework of modern formal dialogue systems. A modern formal syllogistic game DLSyll is set out and analysed in use.;2016
Marketers are currently facing a 'crisis of immediacy' challenge: how to meet consumers' need to receive content expertise and personalized solutions in real time during their shopping experience. Today's digital technologies such as video conferencing location-based mobile apps and augmented reality provide a highly personalized and immersive environment that allows for interactivity and rich information exchange between the brand and consumer. We conducted in-depth interviews with over 35 retailers large-scale surveys with international shoppers and pilot projects with stores and banking institutions to study how companies are leveraging digital technologies to transform the customer experience. Our findings show that there are two main technology-based models that organizations are deploying to support customers' immediate needs: the remote expert and the digital assistant. We provide company examples of both models as well as when they are most appropriate and success factors to inform managers. (C) 2016 Kelley School of Business Indiana University.

Measuring the construct component processes and practice of mindfulness remains challenging. This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study was a pilot parallel group randomized controlled trial of a brief mindfulness practice (Brief-MP) intervention on self-reported mindfulness and performance-based cognition. Adult community smokers were randomly assigned to a Brief-MP or Control (sham meditation) group. Participants carried a personal digital assistant (PDA) for 2 weeks and were instructed to initiate 20 min of meditation (or control) training on the PDA daily and to complete an assessment of mindfulness and cognition immediately afterwards. Additionally participants completed assessments at random times up to four times per day. Primary outcome variables were feasibility and acceptability state and trait mindfulness a decentered perspective to depressive stimuli and attentional bias to smoking stimuli. Thirty-seven participants provided EMA data totaling 1874 assessments. Fifteen of 18 Brief-MP participants completed over 75 % of mindfulness trainings in the field. The majority of Brief-MP participants endorsed favorable descriptions of the intervention: ''acceptable''and ''willing to recommend to a friend''. Linear Mixed Model analyses on EMA data revealed that over time Brief-MP (vs. Control) increased self-reported Curiosity and Decentering assessed by the Toronto Mindfulness Scale. Brief-MP did not change trait mindfulness or cognition. In sum Brief-MP administered in the field was acceptable and increased state mindfulness.;2016
Microphones integrated on a seat belt are an interesting alternative to conventional sensor positions used for hands-free telephony or speech dialog systems in automobile environments. In the setup presented in this contribution the seat belt consists of three microphones which usually lay around the shoulder and chest of a sitting passenger. The main benefit of belt microphones is the small distance from the talker's mouth to the sensor. As a consequence an improved signal quality in terms of a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to other sensor positions e.g. at the rear view mirror the steering wheel or the center console can be achieved. However the belt microphone arrangement varies considerably due to movements of the passenger and depends on the size of the passenger. Furthermore additional noise sources arise for seat belt microphones: they can easily be touched e.g. by clothes or might be in the path of an air-stream from the automotive ventilation system. This contribution presents several robust signal enhancement algorithms designed for belt microphones in multi-seat scenarios. The belt microphone with the highest SNR (usually closest to the speaker's mouth) is selected for speech signal enhancement. Further improvements can be achieved if all belt microphone signals are combined to a single output signal. The proposed signal enhancement system for belt microphones includes a robust echo cancelation scheme three different microphone combining approaches a sophisticated noise estimation scheme to track stationary as well as non-stationary noise and a speech mixer to combine the signals from each seat belt to a single channel output in a multi-seat scenario.;2016
Mobile devices such as laptops personal digital assistants and mobile phones have become a learning tool with great potential in both classrooms and outdoor learning. Although there have been qualitative analyses of the use of mobile devices in education systematic quantitative analyses of the effects of mobile-integrated education are lacking. This study performed a meta-analysis and research synthesis of the effects of integrated mobile devices in teaching and learning in which 110 experimental and quasiexperimental journal articles published during the period 1993-2013 were coded and analyzed. Overall there was a moderate mean effect size of 0.523 for the application of mobile devices to education. The effect sizes of moderator variables were analyzed and the advantages and disadvantages of mobile learning in different levels of moderator variables were synthesized based on content analyses of individual studies. The results of this study and their implications for both research and practice are discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.;2016
Mobile technologies (including handheld and wearable devices) have the potential to enhance learning activities from basic medical undergraduate education through residency and beyond. In order to use these technologies successfully medical educators need to be aware of the underpinning socio-theoretical concepts that influence their usage the pre-clinical and clinical educational environment in which the educational activities occur and the practical possibilities and limitations of their usage. This Guide builds upon the previous AMEE Guide to e-Learning in medical education by providing medical teachers with conceptual frameworks and practical examples of using mobile technologies in medical education. The goal is to help medical teachers to use these concepts and technologies at all levels of medical education to improve the education of medical and healthcare personnel and ultimately contribute to improved patient healthcare. This Guide begins by reviewing some of the technological changes that have occurred in recent years and then examines the theoretical basis (both social and educational) for understanding mobile technology usage. From there the Guide progresses through a hierarchy of institutional teacher and learner needs identifying issues problems and solutions for the effective use of mobile technology in medical education. This Guide ends with a brief look to the future.;2016
Much of contemporary mainstream formal grammar theory is unable to provide analyses for language as it occurs in actual spoken interaction. Its analyses are developed for a cleaned up version of language which omits the disfluencies non-sentential utterances gestures and many other phenomena that are ubiquitous in spoken language. Using evidence from linguistics conversation analysis multimodal communication psychology language acquisition and neuroscience we show these aspects of language use are rule governed in much the same way as phenomena captured by conventional grammars. Furthermore we argue that over the past few years some of the tools required to provide a precise characterizations of such phenomena have begun to emerge in theoretical and computational linguistics hence there is no reason for treating them as second class citizens other than pre-theoretical assumptions about what should fall under the purview of grammar. Finally we suggest that grammar formalisms covering such phenomena would provide a better foundation not just for linguistic analysis of face-to-face interaction but also for sister disciplines such as research on spoken dialogue systems and/or psychological work on language acquisition.;2016
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system requiring long-term treatment which is often hampered by non-adherence to self-applicable therapies provoking continued disease activity and health care system burdens. This study assessed the influence of a personal digital assistant (PDA) with diary function (n = 339 patients) on persistence and adherence to an interferon beta treatment regimen in comparison to a paper patient diary (n = 330 patients). Patients who recently started with subcutaneous injections of interferon beta-1b were recruited in this prospective non-interventional national cohort study for an observational period of 2 years after successful completion of the initial dose escalation. Therapy persistence as assessed by the drop-out rate within 104 weeks was about 50% in both study cohorts. In male patients the drop-out rate was 10% lower when using a PDA compared to the non-PDA group. Use of a PDA with an injection reminder function increased adherence to the injection schedule (every other day) by a mean of 24.5 injections over 24 months in comparison to use of a PDA without injection reminder function. Persistence in this study was in the published range of observational MS studies. Furthermore in male patients continuation of therapy might be positively influenced by use of a PDA and both female and male patients might benefit from an integrated reminder function. In conclusion electronic diaries reminding patients of upcoming injections can promote an improved adherence to MS therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00902135. Bayer Vital GmbH.;2016
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the reciprocal relationship between sedentary behavior (SB) and momentary affect in the context of daily experiences. Methods: Community-dwelling midlife women (N = 121 age 40-60 y) were recruited for a 15-day daily diary study. The women rated their positive and negative affect when prompted on a personal digital assistant device four times per day and wore an accelerometer for objective assessment of SB. Multilevel models were estimated to test concurrent and lagged associations between momentary estimates of SB and affect. Results: In models that controlled for day of week number of hot flashes and total minutes of accelerometer wear time greater concurrent positive affect was associated with fewer minutes spent being sedentary (beta = -31 P < 0.01). Neither lagged positive nor negative affect predicted later SB however more sedentary minutes predicted lower positive affect at the next occasion (beta = -0.04 P < 0.01). Conclusions: These results suggest that SB has negative affective consequences from moment to moment. The implications of reduced positive affect after prolonged bouts of SB for subsequent motivational behavioral or wellbeing outcomes remain to be determined.;2016
Objective: This paper investigates the influence of using tablet in waiting rooms and medical examinations on how physicians give information and how patients learn. It further assesses the factors that impact patient satisfaction. Methods: Patients and physicians in a primary care clinic were given a tablet device to search for health information in the waiting room and when interacting with the physician while physicians used the tablet device to share information with patients during the medical consultation. 82 patients completed a 'pre' survey on using tablets to search for health related information and a 'post' survey after their visit. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze patient's perceptions. Results: Tablet use during consultation has a negative effect on patients' perceptions of physician information giving but using the tablet in the waiting room has a positive impact on patient learning perceptions of physicians' information giving and patient satisfaction. Conclusions: This study indicates the importance of tablet use in ensuring information giving and patient learning. It further highlights the potential for tablets to promote single-loop learning in the medical encounter by better preparing patients for the physician's information giving. Tablets also enable double loop learning which leads to greater patient satisfaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2016
Objective: To describe the methods and basic demographics of participants in a national survey of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Aboriginal) people specific to sexually transmissible infections and bloodborne viruses. Methods: A national cross-sectional survey of Aboriginal people aged 16-29 years in all Australian jurisdictions between 2011 and 2013 conducted at Aboriginal community events. Questions comprised demographic information knowledge risk behaviours and health service utilisation. Questionnaires were completed on personal digital assistants (PDAs). Results: A total of 2877 people at 21 unique community events completed the questionnaire. A total of 59% of participants were female median age was 21 years and more than 60% were single at the time of the survey. Just over half the participants were resident in an urban area (53%) and 38% were from a regional area. Aboriginal health organisations played an important role in implementing the research. PDAs were found to be an acceptable method for collecting health information. Conclusion: This survey has recruited a large representative sample of Aboriginal people aged 16-29 years using a methodology that is feasible acceptable and repeatable. Implications: The methodology provides a model for ongoing monitoring of this population as programs and policies are implemented to address young Aboriginal people's STI and BBV risks.;2016
Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model has been demonstrated many times to be suited for robust spoken dialogue management. Recently some factored representations of POMDP model are designed for specific dialogue tasks. This paper proposes a novel factored POMDP model to describe a new application of affective dialogue management. Different from existing models the user's state space and the system's observation space are both divided into two distinct components: goal and emotion. Moreover the system's action space is for the first time factored into two parts i.e. goal response and emotion response and the reward function is accordingly updated by weighted sum of the two-part rewards. An example of intelligent music player is given to explain how to apply the new model to build an affective dialogue system. Four experiments are designed to reveal the influence of key parameters on the system performance. The simulation results demonstrate the rationality and feasibility of the proposed model.;2016
People adapt their word choice to both humans and computers. In this study language style (elaborated vs. restricted) and perceived conversational partner (human vs. spoken dialogue system) were varied. Convergence was greater when reacting to a restricted language style. Participants preferred human partners and an elaborated language style. In line with communication accommodation theory results suggest that considering restricted capabilities (cognitive organization) constitutes a central motive for convergence. Implications for spoken dialogue system design are discussed.;2016
Purpose The primary objective of the present pilot study was to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the newly developed self-care system using personal digital assistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. The secondary objective was to investigate changes in daily calorie intake body weight and hemoglobin A1c after using the system for 6 months. Method The participants were nine outpatients with type 2 diabetes aged 34-72 and living in Tokyo or surrounding prefectures. They were instructed to use the electronic food diary and to review the graphs of the total energy intake to control food intake under their own target value for 6 months. After they completed the study the feasibility indicated by adherence rate for food recording and acceptability of the system rated with 6-point Likert scale from 1 (worst) to 6 (best) by the participants were investigated. Results Seven participants out of nine completed the study protocol. The median adherence rate for food recording was 80.6 %. Regarding the acceptability six patients rated 6 for desire to use the system while one rated 5. In addition regarding improvement in self-care for diabetes the median score was 5. Daily calorie intake body weight and HbA1c however did not change significantly over the 6-month period. Conclusion The newly developed self-care system might be feasible and acceptable in diabetes patients which could be applied as an ecological momentary intervention tool although there was some room to refine it to raise adherence.;2016
Since conventional mechanical punching technology for Flexible Printed Circuit Board (FPCB) drilling has restricted via-hole size and depth control for multi-layer circuit boards CO2 and Ultra Violet (UV) laser drilling technologies have been developed. However the FPCBs for mobile phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) require smaller via-hole diameters since the development of thinner and higher circuit density devices is demanded. Currently UV laser systems are widely used for FPCB drilling of 75-105 mu m diameter via-holes and inspectors performs quality test manually using microscopes. We developed a high-precision UV laser microfabrication system for next-generation FPCB drilling of 15 pm diameter via-holes. The degrees of the precision of the microfabricated via-holes of 15 35 50 and 85 mu m were mean absolute error rate of 4.4 2.2 2.3 and 2.2 which was fully satisfied with industrial inspection specification +/- 10%. The drilling speed of the system of 2800 via-holes per second at stationary state was achieved. In addition we applied modified Greedy 2-opt algorithm to find out optimal drilling path which reduced the total time of via-hole fabrication. We successfully reduced the production time by 25% compared with the result obtained in the normal Greedy 2-opt algorithm. Moreover we designed very accurate inspection method using Canny edge detection and geometric pattern matching algorithms and successfully applied it to the Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) module for the inspections of 15 mu m diameter via-hole which was required for the fabrication of high density FPCB.

Smart mobile devices have fostered new interaction scenarios that demand sophisticated interfaces. The main developers of operating systems for such devices provide APIs for developers to implement their own applications including different solutions for graphical interfaces sensor control and voice interaction. Despite the usefulness of such resources there are no strategies defined for coupling the multimodal interface with the possibilities that the devices offer to identify and adapt to the user needs which is particularly important in domains such as Ambient Assisted Living. In this paper we propose a framework that allows developing context-aware multimodal conversational agents that dynamically incorporate user-specific requirements and preferences as well as characteristics about the interaction environment in order to improve and personalize the service that is provided. Our proposal integrates the facilities of the Android API in a modular architecture that emphasizes interaction management and context-awareness to build user-adapted robust and maintainable applications. As a proof of concept we have used the proposed framework to develop an Android app for older adults suffering from Alzheimer's. The app helps them to preserve their cognitive abilities and enhance their relationship with their environment.;2016
Spoken dialogue researchers have recently demonstrated highly interactive systems in several domains. This paper considers how to build on these advances to make systems more robust easier to develop and more scientifically significant. We identify key challenges whose solution would lead to improvements in dialogue systems and beyond.;2016
Spoken dialogue systems have been proposed to enable a more natural and intuitive interaction with the environment and human-computer interfaces. In this contribution we present a framework based on neural networks that allows modeling of the user's intention during the dialogue and uses this prediction to dynamically adapt the dialogue model of the system taking into consideration the user's needs and preferences. We have evaluated our proposal to develop a user-adapted spoken dialogue system that facilitates tourist information and services and provide a detailed discussion of the positive influence of our proposal in the success of the interaction the information and services provided and the quality perceived by the users.;2016
The development of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) involves a large number of challenges such as the modeling of cognitive and affective functions in order to achieve realism and believability in this type of intelligent agents. An approach to provide ECAs with capabilities for cognitive processing such as learning decision making planning and perception has been the use of cognitive architectures. Moreover the literature reports several affective models for the generation classification and management of emotions in ECAs. Nevertheless there is a need of cognitive-affective architectures that address the problem of achieving natural interaction and realistic behavior in ECAs. In this paper we discuss the state of the art on existing cognitive architectures affective models and ECAs and propose a cognitive affective architecture based on Soar and extended with an affective model inspired by ALMA. The proposed cognitive-affective architecture is designed to allow ECAs to include and take advantage of features such as reinforcement learning episodic memory and emotion management.

The Internet has changed the way in which organizations communicate with their publics and museums are not an exception. The consolidation of Web 2.0 has not only given museums access to a powerful new tool for disseminating information but has involved significant changes in the relationship between institutions and their publics facilitating and enhancing the interaction between them. The overall objective of this paper is to analyze the degree of interactivity implemented in the websites of major international art museums in order to assess if museums are evolving towards more dialogic systems with relation to their publics. The results indicate that museums still have a low level of interactivity on their websites both in the tools used to present information and the resources available for interaction with virtual visitors. But it has also observed that museums are progressively implementing interactive and dialogic sources suggesting a clear trend towards new ways of managing these platforms in order to establish more participatory and collaborative communication systems with virtual users.

The optimization of spoken dialog management policies is a non-trivial task due to the erroneous inputs from speech recognition and language understanding modules. The dialog manager needs to ground uncertain semantic information at times to fully understand the need of human users and successfully complete the required dialog tasks. Approaches based on reinforcement learning are currently mainstream in academia and have been proved to be effective especially when operating in noisy environments. However in reinforcement learning the dialog strategy is often represented by complex numeric model and thus is incomprehensible to humans. The trained policies are very difficult for dialog system designers to verify or modify which largely limits the deployment for commercial applications. In this paper we propose a novel framework for optimizing dialog policies specified in human-readable domain language using genetic algorithm. We present learning algorithms using user simulator and real human-machine dialog corpora. Empirical experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve competitive performance on par with some state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms while maintaining a comprehensible policy structure.;2016
The present study investigated the performance of textbased explanation for a large number of learners in an online tutoring task guided by a Pedagogical Conversational Agent ( PCA). In the study a lexical network analysis that focused on the co-occurrence of keywords in learner's explanation text which were used as dependent variables was performed. This method was used to investigate how the variables which consisted of expressions of emotion embodied characteristics of the PCA and personal characteristics of the learner influenced the performance of the explanation text. The learners ( participants) were students enrolled in a psychology class. The learners provided explanations to a PCA one-on-one as an after-school activity. In this activity the PCA portraying the role of a questioner asked the learners to explain a key concept taught in their class. The students were randomly assigned one key term out of 30 and were asked to formulate explanations by answering different types of questions. The task consisted of 17 trials. More than 300 text-based explanation dialogues were collected from learners using a web-based explanation system and the factors influencing learner performance were investigated. Machine learning results showed that during the explanation activity the expressions used and the gender of the PCA influenced learner performance. Results showed that ( 1) learners performed better when a male PCA expressed negative emotions as opposed to when a female PCA expressed negative emotions and ( 2) learners performed better when a female PCA expressed positive expressions as opposed to when a female PCA expressed negative expressions. This paper provides insight into capturing the behavior of humans performing online tasks and it puts forward suggestions related to the design of an efficient online tutoring system using PCA.;2016
The purpose of this research is to determine the effects of implementing an electronic health record on medical-surgical registered nurses' time spent in direct professional patient-centered nursing activities attitudes and beliefs related to implementation and changes in level of nursing engagement after deployment of the electronic health record. Patient-centered activities were categorized using Watson's Caritas Processes and the Relationship-Based Care Delivery System. Methods included use of an Attitudes and Beliefs Assessment Questionnaire Nursing Engagement Questionnaire and Rapid Modeling Corporation's personal digital assistants for time and motion data collection. There was a significant difference in normative belief between nurses with less than 15 years' experience and nurses with more than 15 years' experience (t(21) = 2.7 P = .01). While nurses spent less time at the nurses' station less time charting significantly more time in patients' rooms and in purposeful interactions time spent in relationship-based caring behavior categories actually decreased in most categories. Nurses' engagement scores did not significantly increase. These results serve to inform healthcare organizations about potential factors related to electronic health record deployment which create shifts in nursing time spent across care categories and can be used to explore further patient centered care practices.;2016
There is strong research evidence showing that people naturally align to each other's vocabulary sentence structure and acoustic features in dialog yet little is known about how the alignment mechanism operates in the interaction between users and computer systems let alone how it may be exploited to improve the efficiency of the interaction. This article provides an account of lexical alignment in human-computer dialogs based on empirical data collected in a simulated human-computer interaction scenario. The results indicate that alignment is present resulting in the gradual reduction and stabilization of the vocabulary-in-use and that it is also reciprocal. Further the results suggest that when system and user errors occur the development of alignment is temporarily disrupted and users tend to introduce novel words to the dialog. The results also indicate that alignment in human-computer interaction may have a strong strategic component and is used as a resource to compensate for less optimal (visually impoverished) interaction conditions. Moreover lower alignment is associated with less successful interaction as measured by user perceptions. The article distills the results of the study into design recommendations for human-computer dialog systems and uses them to outline a model of dialog management that supports and exploits alignment through mechanisms for in-use adaptation of the system's grammar and lexicon.;2016
This article explores whether people more frequently attempt to repair misunderstandings when speaking to an artificial conversational agent if it is represented as fully human. Interactants in dyadic conversations with an agent (the chat bot Cleverbot) spoke to either a text screen interface (agent's responses shown on a screen) or a human body interface (agent's responses vocalized by a human speech shadower via the echoborg method) and were either informed or not informed prior to interlocution that their interlocutor's responses would be agent-generated. Results show that an interactant is less likely to initiate repairs when an agent-interlocutor communicates via a text screen interface as well as when they explicitly know their interlocutor's words to be agent-generated. That is to say people demonstrate the most intersubjective effort toward establishing common ground when they engage an agent under the same social psychological conditions as face-to-face human human interaction (i.e. when they both encounter another human body and assume that they are speaking to an autonomously-communicating person). This articles methodology presents a novel means of benchmarking intersubjectivity and intersubjective effort in human-agent interaction. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes the design of an ellipsis and coreference resolution module integrated in a computerized virtual patient dialogue system. Real medical diagnosis dialogues have been collected and analyzed. Several groups of diagnosis-related concepts were defined and used to construct rules patterns and features to detect and resolve ellipsis and coreference. The best F-scores of ellipsis detection and resolution were 89.15% and 83.40 % respectively. The best F-scores of phrasal coreference detection and resolution were 93.83 % and 83.40 % respectively. The accuracy of pronominal anaphora resolution was 92 % for the 3rd-person singular pronouns referring to specific entities and 97.31 % for other pronouns.;2016
This paper introduces a knowledge-based system which grounds the detection of the user's likes and dislikes on the topic structure of the conversation. The targeted study is set in a human-agent interaction with the aim to help the creation of dialogue strategies of an agent based on the user's interests. In this paper we first describe the system based on linguistic resources such as lexicons dependency grammars and dialogue information provided by the dialogue system. Second we explain how the system merges its outputs at the end of each topic sequence. Finally we present an evaluation of both the linguistic rules and the merging process. The system enables a better identification of the target of the user's likes and dislikes and provides a synthetic representation of the user's interests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a novel technique to create scenarios that can be used by a user simulator for exhaustively evaluating spoken dialogue systems. The scenarios are automatically created from simple scenario-templates that the systems' developers create manually employing their knowledge about typical goals of the system's users. The scenarios contain goals which the user simulator will try to achieve through the interaction with the systems. The goals are represented in the form of semantic frames which are associated with user utterances of sentences and are taken from utterance corpora. In this way the scenarios enable speech-based interaction between the simulator and the spoken dialogue systems to be evaluated. Experiments have been carried out employing two spoken dialogue systems (Saplen and Viajero) a user simulator and two utterance corpora previously collected for two different application domains: fast-food ordering and bus travel information. Experimental results show that the technique has been useful for exhaustively evaluating the systems and finding out problems in their performance that must addressed to improve them. Some of these problems are caused by acoustic similarity between some uttered words and strong speaker accents. Thus we think these problems would have been difficult to uncover employing the user simulation techniques typically used nowadays as they do not employ real speech and just consider semantics of user intentions.

This paper proposes a statistical framework to develop user-adapted spoken dialog systems. The proposed framework integrates two main models. The first model is used to predict the user's intention during the dialog. The second model uses this prediction and the history of dialog up to the current moment to predict the next system response. This prediction is performed with an ensemble-based classifier trained for each of the tasks considered so that a better selection of the next system can be attained weighting the outputs of these specialized classifiers. The codification of the information and the definition of data structures to store the data supplied by the user throughout the dialog makes the estimation of the models from the training data and practical domains manageable. We describe our proposal and its application and detailed evaluation in a practical spoken dialog system.;2016
This project uses ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) ear tags and readers with a readable range of 3 to 5 m. Forty stags were tagged with radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags and allocated into 20 pens. When deer with RFID ear tags walked through the aisle handheld RFID readers used as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and stationary RFID readers in frequency range received signals from the tags and individual deer tag data were transmitted immediately and completely through wireless PDAs to a computer. The inputted data were sent to the deer-farm management system to be collated and organized. Farmers obtained individual deer data without approaching the deer which decreased the risk of the deer attacking. Employing UHF-RFID technology integrated with software contributes to enhancing the efficiency of deer identification and farm management.;2016
This research explores ideal methods of persuasion through computer-mediated dialogue. We attempt to identify which persuasive strategy is most successful. We designed a Wizard of Oz laboratory experiment where participants interact with a human wizard via a custom-developed web-based chat interface. The wizard attempted to persuade participants to learn more about Tai Chi using the following persuasive strategies: Emotional Positive Emotional Negative Rational Positive and Rational Negative. Based on the results of the pre- and post-chat questionnaire participants' interest in learning Tai Chi was significantly greater after completing the dialogue and 69% percent of the participants printed a flyer to receive more information. Furthermore conversations using the Emotional Positive strategies resulted in more successful persuasion than rational ones. The results of our study suggest that Emotional Positive strategies may be the most effective. We also suggest successful strategies as a design guideline for autonomous dialogue systems for persuasion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2016
This study compares online simulation in Second Life (R) (Linden Labs San Francisco California USA) with equivalent face-to-face activities for three scenarios. The intention was that the three sets of activities would increase participant awareness of how psychology is applied in relation to work-based contexts. These were a Dragons' Den-style activity to increase awareness of entrepreneurialism a supermarket-based activity based on consumer and work psychology and a counselling agency. After engaging in the activities participants completed various measures including a satisfaction questionnaire. In the supermarket scenario Second Life (R) was rated significantly better in terms of student satisfaction and the extent to which awareness of the application of psychology in this context had increased. For the other scenarios Second Life (R) and face-to-face activities were largely equivalent on the various measures. The exception was that in the online counselling scenario participants did not indicate to a significant degree that they were now more aware of how psychology was applied in this setting. This might be linked to the perceived quality of interaction with the chatbot avatars. It is suggested that the overall superiority of the online supermarket scenario is because this complex problem-based activity achieved greater immersion in the online version.

This study examined whether the provision of feedback and the interval between successive stimuli interact to affect performance on a serial simple reaction time test during sleep deprivation. Sixteen participants (9 female 7 male aged 18-27 yr) completed four versions of the 5-min psychomotor vigilance task for a handheld personal digital assistant (PaImPVT) every 2 h during 28 h of sustained wakefulness. The four versions differed in terms of whether or not they provided feedback immediately after each response and whether the inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) were long (2-10 s) or short (1-5 s). Cognitive function was assessed using reciprocal response time and percentage of responses that were lapses (i.e. had a response time >= 500 ms). Data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA with three within-subjects factors: test session feedback and ISI. For both measures the only significant interaction was between feedback and ISI. Cognitive function was enhanced by feedback when the ISIs were long because it provided motivation. Cognitive function was not affected by feedback when the ISIs were short because there was insufficient time to both attend to the feedback and prepare for the subsequent stimulus.

To characterize the ELISE project a concept robot applicable in the neuro-rehabilitation of the entire paretic upper limb. The project has been designed and implemented based on comprehensive rehabilitation of the shoulder forearm and hand. ELISE is a concept robotic system prepared for individualized approach in rehabilitation of stroke patients including diagnostics passive and/or active exercises and reports. The ELISE system includes dual biofeedback solutions: rehabilitation exercises in virtual reality (VR) and the virtual assistant of therapist. The biomechanical ergonomics electrical/electronics hardware/software aspects of the design are described in detail here. This paper suggests a new approach to rehabilitation robots for the spastic upper limb of stroke survivors. Rehabilitation with ELISE robot was based on movement exercises which incorporate biofeedback in VR. The patient realizes common tasks from ordinary life. This innovative rehabilitation connects practical/social aspect of rehabilitation with movement exercises. With the aid of these stimulations the ELISE robot is intended to speed up the process of recovery from damaged neuron connections in brain. Robot was designed for flexible assembly and can be tailored to individual needs and unique expectations of each therapist and patient. This is possible thanks to the modular design of the robot arm and software. The ELISE robot will be sold in different configurations (e.g. without an expander or a set of virtual games or a virtual assistant of therapist).;2016
To find if current dialogue systems use the same psychotherapist questioning technique as Joseph Weizenbaum's 1960 natural language understanding programme Eliza the authors carried out an original experiment comparing five successful artificial dialogue systems Cleverbot Elbot Eugene Goostman JFred and Ultra Hal with an online version of Eliza. More than one hundred male and female participants with 1st or non-1st English language age range 13-64 interacted with the systems over the Internet scoring each for conversation ability. Developers of the modern conversation systems show they deploy a variety of techniques to initiate and maintain dialogue learning from interactions with humans over the Internet. Statistical significance shows these dialogue systems are an improvement on their predecessor. Embedded on the web affording round-the-clock interaction the nature of artificial dialogue systems is evolving as these systems learn from the way humans converse. The uses of modern Elizas are proven successful as virtual assistants in e-commerce their conversational basis is already extending into education. What we can say is modern artificial dialogue systems do talk. They are able to participate in conversation in a way their predecessor Eliza could not: they are able to share personal opinions relay experience of family dramas be relevant but also be vague and mislead just as humans do.

We present a corpus-based prosodic analysis with the aim of uncovering the relationship between dialogue acts personality and prosody in view to providing guidelines for the ECA Greta's text-to-speech system. The corpus used is the SEMAINE corpus featuring four different personalities further annotated for dialogue acts and prosodic features. In order to show the importance of the choice of dialogue act taxonomy two different taxonomies were used the first corresponding to Searle's taxonomy of speech acts and the second inspired by Bunt's DIT++ including a division of directive acts into finer categories. Our results show that finer-grained distinctions are important when choosing a taxonomy. We also show with some preliminary results that the prosodic correlates of dialogue acts are not always as cited in the literature and prove more complex and variable. By studying the realisation of different directive acts we also observe differences in the communicative strategies of the ECA depending on personality in view to providing input to a speech system.;2016
We present results of quantitative evaluations of a content selection scheme for answer generation in sales dialogue which is based on an interactive game-theoretic model of the dialogue scenario. The model involves representing a probability distribution over possible customer requirements i.e. needs that must be met before a customer will agree to buy an object. Through game-theoretic analysis we derive a content selection procedure which constitutes an optimal strategy in the dialogue game. This procedure is capable of producing pragmatically appropriate indirect answers to yes/no questions and is implemented in an online question answering system. Evaluation results show that these answers are pragmatically natural and contribute to dialogue efficiency. The model allows for systems that learn probabilities of customer requirements both online and from previous data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2016
We propose an approach for identifying the speech acts of speakers' utterances in conversational spoken dialogue that involves using semantic dependency graphs with probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). The semantic dependency graph based on the HowNet knowledge base is adopted to model the relationships between words in an utterance parsed by PCFG. Dependency relationships between words within the utterance are extracted by decomposing the semantic dependency graph according to predefined events. The corresponding values of semantic slots are subsequently extracted from the speaker's utterances according to the corresponding identified speech act. The experimental results obtained when using the proposed approach indicated that the accuracy rates of speech act detection and task completion were 95.6% and 77.4% for human-generated transcription (REF) and speech-to-text recognition output (STT) respectively and the average numbers of turns of each dialogue were 8.3 and 11.8 for REF and STT respectively. Compared with Bayes classifier partial pattern tree and Bayesian-network-based approaches we obtained 14.1% 9.2% and 3% improvements in the accuracy of speech act identification respectively.;2016
With the increasing need for road lane detection used in lane departure warning systems and autonomous vehicles many studies have been conducted to turn road lane detection into a virtual assistant to improve driving safety and reduce car accidents. Most of the previous research approaches detect the central line of a road lane and not the accurate left and right boundaries of the lane. In addition they do not discriminate between dashed and solid lanes when detecting the road lanes. However this discrimination is necessary for the safety of autonomous vehicles and the safety of vehicles driven by human drivers. To overcome these problems we propose a method for road lane detection that distinguishes between dashed and solid lanes. Experimental results with the Caltech open database showed that our method outperforms conventional methods.;2016
3D virtual worlds are promising for immersive learning in English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Unlike English as a Second Language (ESL) EFL typically takes place in the learners' home countries and the potential of the language is limited by geography. Although learning contexts where English is spoken is important in most EFL courses at the college level EFL is taught by acquiring vocabularies grammar and pragmatic features without contextual immersion. In this study an immersive English learning environment in a 3D virtual world OpenSimulator was developed with two key learning artifacts chatbot and time machine. A single-factor independent measures design was used to examines learners' presence under four learning conditions: virtual learning environment without digital learning artifacts (VE) virtual learning environment with chatbot (VEC) virtual learning environment with time machine (VETM) and virtual learning environment with chatbot and time machine (VECTM). Three research questions emerging from the four learning conditions form the backbone of this study: (1) Does chatbot increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (2) Does time machine increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (3) Does the combined use of chatbot and time machine increase presence more than either learning artifact alone? The experimental results indicate that the chatbot and time machine increase the learners' sense of immersion and presence. Best design practices should address how immersion and presence can be integrated into affordances of virtual worlds.;2017
A constant voltage AC-DC converter based on the digital assistant technology is proposed in this paper which has the advantage of high output precision. In this paper a novel digital exponential wave generator is adopted in Constant Voltage (CV) mode to replace the normal triangle waveform to obtain a wider range of switching frequency increasing the accuracy of output voltage under light load. The control chip is implemented based on NEC 1 mu m 5 V/40V HVCMOS process and a 5 V/1.2A prototype has been built to verify the proposed control method. In PFM mode the deviation of output voltage is within +/- 1.5% and the load regulation is +/- 0.92%. Meanwhile when the load jumps from light to heavy the minimum output voltage could be maintained above 4.16 V.;2017
A prototype standardized client was created and programmed to respond to students in the 3D virtual world of Second Life. This automaton called a chatbot was repeatedly interviewed by beginning MSW students in a practice course as a learning exercise. Initial results were positive and suggest the use of simulated clients in virtual worlds as learning objects is worth further development and evaluation.;2017
Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is well treatable many people do not get the desired treatment due to barriers to care (such as stigma and cost). This paper presents a system that bridges this gap by enabling patients to follow therapy at home. A therapist is only involved remotely tomonitor progress and serve as a safety net. With this system patients can recollect their memories in a digital diary and recreate them in a 3D WorldBuilder. Throughout the therapy a virtual agent is present to inform and guide patients through the sessions employing an ontology-based question module for recollecting traumatic memories to further elicit a detailed memory recollection. In a usability study with former PTSD patients (n = 4) these questions were found useful for memory recollection. Moreover the usability of the whole system was rated positively. This system has the potential to be a valuable addition to the spectrum of PTSD treatments offering a novel type of home therapy assisted by a virtual agent.;2017
Although the importance of contextual information in speech recognition has been acknowledged for a long time now it has remained clearly underutilized even in state-of-the-art speech recognition systems. This article introduces a novel methodologically hybrid approach to the research question of context-dependent speech recognition in human-machine interaction. To the extent that it is hybrid the approach integrates aspects of both statistical and representational paradigms. We extend the standard statistical pattern-matching approach with a cognitively inspired and analytically tractable model with explanatory power. This methodological extension allows for accounting for contextual information which is otherwise unavailable in speech recognition systems and using it to improve post-processing of recognition hypotheses. The article introduces an algorithm for evaluation of recognition hypotheses illustrates it for concrete interaction domains and discusses its implementation within two prototype conversational agents.;2017
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasingly prevalent cognitive disorder in which memory language and executive function deteriorate usually in that order. There is a growing need to support individuals with AD and other forms of dementia in their daily lives and our goal is to do so through speech-based interaction. Given that 33% of conversations with people with middle-stage AD involve a breakdown in communication it is vital that automated dialogue systems be able to identify those breakdowns and if possible avoid them.In this article we discuss several linguistic features that are verbal indicators of confusion in AD (including vocabulary richness parse tree structures and acoustic cues) and apply several machine learning algorithms to identify dialogue-relevant confusion from speech with up to 82% accuracy. We also learn dialogue strategies to avoid confusion in the first place which is accomplished using a partially observable Markov decision process and which obtains accuracies (up to 96.1%) that are significantly higher than several baselines. This work represents a major step towards automated dialogue systems for individuals with dementia.;2017
Aphasia concerns neurological disorders of speech with moderate to severe dysfunction of the mechanisms involved in language expression and understanding and influencing the major components of language behavior. Aphasia rehabilitation involves a speech language therapist and the principles of therapy regard the intensity of exercises execution the use of multiple forms of sensory stimuli and the increase of exercises difficulty. The therapy is expensive and has to be customized to patients' specificity including their native language. This paper proposes as a work in progress a cloud-based architecture for aphasia rehabilitation of patients having Romanian as their native language. The plaltform comprises an application database an application logic and interfaces for patients and therapists. Accompanied by a virtual assistant the patient has to solve exercises built by the therapist and depending on the obtained scores the treatment is adjusted and data can be stored in a statistic module. A scoring procedure is proposed as part of the application logic and back-up solutions for minimizing the estimated riksks during the project's lifecycle are formulated.;2017
As a result of the convergence of different services delivered over the internet protocol internet protocol television (IPTV) may be regarded as the one of the most widespread user interfaces accepted by a highly diverse user domain. Every generation from children to the elderly can use IPTV for recreation as well as for gaining social contact and stimulating the mind. However technological advances in digital platforms go hand in hand with the complexity of their user interfaces and thus induce technological disinterest and technological exclusion. Therefore interactivity and affective content presentations are from the perspective of advanced user interfaces two key factors in any application incorporating human-computer interaction (HCI). Furthermore the perception and understanding of the information (meaning) conveyed is closely interlinked with visual cues and non-verbal elements that speakers generate throughout human-human dialogues. In this regard co-verbal behavior provides information to the communicative act. It supports the speaker's communicative goal and allows for a variety of other information to be added to his/her messages including (but not limited to) psychological states attitudes and personality. In the present paper we address complexity and technological disinterest through the integration of natural human-like multimodal output that incorporates a novel combined data- and rule-driven co-verbal behavior generator that is able to extract features from unannotated general text. The core of the paper discusses the processes that model and synchronize non-verbal features with verbal features even when dealing with unknown context and/or limited contextual information. In addition the proposed algorithm incorporates data-driven (speech prosody repository of motor skills) and rule-based concepts (grammar gesticon). The algorithm firstly classifies the communicative intent then plans the co-verbal cues and their form within the gesture unit generates temporally synchronized co-verbal cues and finally realizes them in the form of human-like co-verbal movements. In this way the information can be represented in the form of both meaningfully and temporally synchronized co-verbal cues with accompanying synthesized speech using communication channels to which people are most accustomed.;2017
As human-machine communication has yet to become prevalent the rules of interactions between human and intelligent machines need to be explored. This study aims to investigate a specific question: During human users' initial interactions with artificial intelligence would they reveal their personality traits and communicative attributes differently from human-human interactions? A sample of 245 participants was recruited to view six targets' twelve conversation transcripts on a social media platform: Half with a chatbot Microsoft's Little Ice and half with human friends. The findings suggested that when the targets interacted with Little Ice they demonstrated different personality traits and communication attributes from interacting with humans. Specifically users tended to be more open more agreeable more extroverted more conscientious and self-disclosing when interacting with humans than with Al. The findings not only echo Mischel's cognitive-affective processing system model but also complement the Computers Are Social Actors Paradigm. Theoretical implications were discussed.

As the Industry 4.0 takes shape human operators experience an increased complexity of their daily tasks: they are required to be highly flexible and to demonstrate adaptive capabilities in a very dynamic working environment. It calls for tools and approaches that could be easily embedded into everyday practices and able to combine complex methodologies with high usability requirements. In this perspective the proposed research work is focused on the design and development of a practical solution called Sophos-MS able to integrate augmented reality contents and intelligent tutoring systems with cutting-edge fruition technologies for operators' support in complex man-machine interactions. After establishing a reference methodological framework for the smart operator concept within the Industry 4.0 paradigm the proposed solution is presented along with its functional and non-function requirements. Such requirements are fulfilled through a structured design strategy whose main outcomes include a multi-layered modular solution Sophos-MS that relies on Augmented Reality contents and on an intelligent personal digital assistant with vocal interaction capabilities. The proposed approach has been deployed and its training potentials have been investigated with field experiments. The experimental campaign results have been firstly checked to ensure their statistical relevance and then analytically assessed in order to show that the proposed solution has a real impact on operators' learning curves and can make the difference between who uses it and who does not.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With the rise of autonomous e-mental health applications virtual agents can play a major role in improving trustworthiness therapy outcome and adherence. In these applications it is important that patients adhere in the sense that they perform the tasks but also that they adhere to the specific recommendations on how to do them well. One important construct in improving adherence is psychoeducation information on the why and how of therapeutic interventions. In an e-mental health context this can be delivered in two different ways: verbally by a (virtual) embodied conversational agent or just via text on the screen. The aim of this research is to study which presentation mode is preferable for improving adherence. METHODS: This study takes the approach of evaluating a specific part of a therapy namely psychoeducation. This was done in a non-clinical sample to first test the general constructs of the human-computer interaction. We performed an experimental study on the effect of presentation mode of psychoeducation on adherence. In this study we took into account the moderating effects of attitude towards the virtual agent and recollection of the information. Within the paradigm of expressive writing we asked participants (n = 46) to pick one of their worst memories to describe in a digital diary after receiving verbal or textual psychoeducation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that both the attitude towards the virtual agent and how well the psychoeducation was recollected were positively related to adherence in the form of task execution. Moreover after controlling for the attitude to the agent and recollection presentation of psychoeducation via text resulted in higher adherence than verbal presentation by the virtual agent did.;2017
Background: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia that is challenging for patients and adversely impacts health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Long-term management of AF requires that patients adhere to complex therapies understand difficult terminology navigate subspecialty care and have continued symptom monitoring with the goal of preventing adverse outcomes. Continued interventions to ameliorate the patient experience of AF are essential. Design: The Atrial Fibrillation health Literacy Information Technology Trial (AF-LITT NCT03093558) is an investigator-initiated 2-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT). This RCT is a pilot in order to implement a novel smartphone-based intervention to address the patient experience of AF. This pilot RCT will compare a combination of the Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) and the Alive Cor Kardia Mobile heart rhythm monitor to the current standard of care. The study will enroll 180 adults with non-valvular AF who are receiving anticoagulation for stroke prevention and randomize them to receive a 30-day intervention (smartphone-based ECA/Kardia) or standard of care which will include a symptom and adherence journal. The primary end-points are improvement in HRQoL and self-reported adherence to anticoagulation. The secondary end-points are the acceptability of the intervention to participants its use by participants and acceptability to referring physicians. Conclusions: The AF-LITT pilot aims to evaluate the efficacy of the ECA/Kardia to improve HRQoL and anticoagulant adherence and to guide its implementation in a larger multicenter clinical trial. The intervention has potential to improve HRQoL adherence and health care utilization in individuals with chronic AF.;2017
Background: In 2010 the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was introduced in the Dutch National Immunization Program for 12-year-old girls aiming to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in women. HPV vaccination uptake turned out to be lower than expected: 61% versus 70% respectively. Mothers were shown to play the most important role in the immunization decision about this vaccination. They had also expressed their need for interactive personal information about the HPV vaccination over and above the existing universal general information. To improve the effectiveness of the existing education about the HPV vaccination we systematically developed a Web-based tailored intervention with virtual assistants providing mothers of girls to be invited with tailored feedback on their decision making about the HPV vaccination. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Web-based tailored intervention for promoting HPV vaccination acceptance by means of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Mothers were recruited via the Dutch vaccination register (Praeventis) (n=36000) and three Web-based panels (n=2483). Those who gave informed consent (N=8062) were randomly assigned to the control (n=4067) or intervention condition (n=3995). HPV vaccination uptake as registered by Praeventis once the HPV vaccination round was completed was used as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were differential scores across conditions between baseline (before the provided access to the new tailored intervention) and follow-up (just before the first vaccination) regarding the mothers' degree of informed decision making (IDM) decisional conflict and critical determinants of HPV vaccination uptake among which are intention attitude risk perception and outcome beliefs. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis (N=8062) showed a significant positive effect of the intervention on IDM decisional conflict and nearly all determinants of HPV vaccination uptake (P<.001). No effect was found on uptake (P=.60). This may be attributed to the overall high uptake rates in both conditions. Mothers evaluated the intervention as highly positive including the website as well as the virtual assistants that were used to deliver the tailored feedback. Conclusions: This computer-tailored intervention has the potential to improve HPV vaccination acceptability and IDM and to decrease decisional conflict among mothers of invited girls. Implications for future research are discussed.;2017
Background: People with mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and sensory impairments often fail to take initiative in starting and carrying out daily activities with negative consequences for their occupational condition and social status. Their failure seems due to their inability to determine the right time for the activities and to remember all the activity steps. Aim: This study assessed a smartphone intervention which was designed to help eight participants (four presenting with intellectual disability and blindness and four presenting with intellectual disability and hearing impairment) to independently start and carry out daily activities at appropriate times. Method: The intervention was introduced according to a non-concurrent multiple baseline design across participants. During the intervention each participant was provided with a smartphone which was fitted with the time schedule of his or her activities and the verbal or pictorial instructions for the single steps of those activities. When the time for an activity was reached the participant was automatically reminded to start that activity and thereafter he or she was presented with the instructions for it. Results: The use of the smartphone intervention promoted great improvement over the baseline for all participants. That is the participants managed to (a) independently start the activities at the scheduled times and (b) carry out those activities with high levels of accuracy. Conclusion: A smartphone intervention such as that used in this study may help people with mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and sensory impairments to successfully engage in daily activities.;2017
Background: Web-based cognitive-behavioral therapeutic (CBT) apps have demonstrated efficacy but are characterized by poor adherence. Conversational agents may offer a convenient engaging way of getting support at any time. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods: In an unblinded trial 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook Depression in College Students as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results: Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33) 67% female (47/70) mostly non-Hispanic (93% 54/58) and Caucasian (79% 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47 P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F154=9.24 P=.004). Participants' comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. Conclusions: Conversational agents appear to be a feasible engaging and effective way to deliver CBT.;2017
Controlled natural language (CNL) has great potential to support human-machine interaction (HMI) because it provides an information representation that is both human readable and machine processable. We investigated the effectiveness of a CNL-based conversational interface forHMIin a behavioral experiment called simple human experiment regarding locally observed collective knowledge (SHERLOCK). In SHERLOCK individuals acted in groups to discover and report information to the machine using natural language (NL) which the machine then processed into CNL. The machine fused responses from different users to form a common operating picture a dashboard showing the level of agreement for distinct information. To obtain information to add to this dashboard users explored the real world in a simulated crowd-sourced sensing scenario. This scenario represented a simplified controlled analog for tactical intelligence (i.e. direct intelligence of the environment) which is key for rapidly planning military law enforcement and emergency operations. Overall despite close to zero training 74% of the users inputted NL that was machine interpretable and addressed the assigned tasks. An experimental manipulation aimed to increase user-machine interaction however did not improve performance as hypothesized. Nevertheless results indicate that the conversational interface may be effective in assisting humans with collection and fusion of information in a crowdsourcing context.;2017
Cortana one of the new features introduced by Microsoft in Windows 10 desktop operating systems is a voice activated personal digital assistant that can be used for searching stuff on device or web setting up reminders tracking users' upcoming flights getting news tailored to users' interests sending text and emails and more. Being the platform relatively new the forensic examination of Cortana has been largely unexplored in the literature. This paper seeks to determine the data remnants of Cortana usage in a Windows 10 personal computer (PC). The research contributes in-depth understanding of the location of evidentiary artifacts on hard disk and the type of information recorded in these artifacts as a result of user activities on Cortana. For decoding and exporting data from one of the databases created by Cortana application four custom python scripts have been developed. Additionally as a part of this paper a GUI tool called CortanaDigger is developed for extracting and listing web search strings as well as timestamp of search made by a user on Cortana box. Several experiments are conducted to track reminders (based on time place and person) and detect anti -forensic attempts like evidence modification and evidence destruction carried out on Cortana artifacts. Finally forensic usefulness of Cortana artifacts is demonstrated in terms of a Cortana web search timeline constructed over a period of time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2017
Deep reinforcement learning using convolutional neural networks is the technology behind autonomous vehicles. Could this same technology facilitate the road to college? During the summer between high school and college college-related tasks that students must navigate can hinder successful matriculation. We employ conversational artificial intelligence (AI) to efficiently support thousands of would-be college freshmen by providing personalized text message based outreach and guidance for each task where they needed support. We implemented and tested this system through a field experiment with Georgia State University (GSU). GSU-committed students assigned to treatment exhibited greater success with pre-enrollment requirements and were 3.3 percentage points more likely to enroll on time. Enrollment impacts are comparable to those in prior interventions but with substantially reduced burden on university staff Given the capacity for AI to learn over time this intervention has promise for scaling personalized college transition guidance.;2017
Despite recent advances in automatic speech recognition one of the main stumbling blocks to the widespread adoption of Spoken Dialogue Systems is the lack of reliability of automatic speech recognizers. In this paper we offer a two-tier error-correction process that harnesses syntactic semantic and pragmatic information to improve the understanding of spoken referring expressions specifically descriptions of objects in physical spaces. A syntactic-semantic tier offers generic corrections to perceived ASR errors on the basis of syntactic expectations of a semantic model and passes the corrected texts to a language understanding system. The output of this system which consists of pragmatic interpretations is then refined by a contextual-phonetic tier which prefers interpretations that are phonetically similar to the mis-heard words. Our results obtained on a corpus of 341 referring expressions show that syntactic-semantic error correction significantly improves interpretation performance and contextual phonetic refinements yield further improvements.

Educating society concerning stigmatized conditions such as the eating disorder Anorexia Nervosa (AN) aims to change attitudes that will encourage individuals with AN to recognize their condition and decide to seek help. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) may play an important role in bringing about changes in attitude and behavior because they potentially allow tailored but anonymous free and convenient access and can deliver the information in a conversational way that overcomes health literacy barriers. In this first study we compare the use of an ECA with a video to deliver two strategies (education and contact) to address stigma around the mental health condition of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Our results with 245 participants show that both media (ECA and video) aided recognition of AN and produced significant changes in positive volitional stigma and negative volitional stigma but not in traditional stigma (desire for social distance) with some notable differences based on gender. Baseline data was used in place of a control group and the sample population was undergraduate Psychology students due to higher incidences of AN in this population. Further validation is needed involving a control group and testing on populations other than Psychology students. Nevertheless these initial results encourage our future work to build tailored ECAs to challenge particular beliefs to support a wide range of educational interventions to change behaviors and improve decision-making relating to health and wellbeing.

Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are advanced computational interactive interfaces designed with the aim to engage users in the continuous and long-term use of a background application. The advantages and benefits of these agents have been exploited in several e-health systems. One of the medical domains where ECAs are recently applied is to support the detection of symptoms prevention and treatment of mental health disorders. As ECAs based applications are increasingly used in clinical psychology and due that one fatal consequence of mental health problems is the commitment of suicide it is necessary to analyse how current ECAs in this clinical domain support the early detection and prevention of risk situations associated with suicidality. The present work provides and overview of the main features implemented in the ECAs to detect and prevent suicidal behaviours through two scenarios: ECAs acting as virtual counsellors to offer immediate help to individuals in risk and ECAs acting as virtual patients for learning/training in the identification of suicide behaviours. A literature review was performed to identify relevant studies in this domain during the last decade describing the main characteristics of the implemented ECAs and how they have been evaluated. A total of six studies were included in the review fulfilling the defined search criteria. Most of the experimental studies indicate promising results though these types of ECAs are not yet commonly used in routine practice. The identification of some open challenges for the further development of ECAs within this domain is also discussed.;2017
Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) are promising software to communicate with patients but no study has tested them in the diagnostic field of mental disorders. The aim of this study was 1) to test the performance of a diagnostic system for major depressive disorders (MDD) based on the identification by an ECA of specific symptoms (the MDD DSM 5 criteria) in outpatients 2) to evaluate the acceptability of such an ECA. Patients completed two clinical interviews in a randomized order (ECA versus psychiatrist) and filled in the Acceptability E-scale (AES) to quantify the acceptability of the ECA. 179 outpatients were included in this study (mean age 46.5 +/- 12.9 years 57.5% females). Among the 35 patients diagnosed with MDD by the psychiatrist 14 (40%) patients exhibited mild 12 (34.3%) moderate and 9 (25.7%) severe depressive symptoms. Sensitivity increased across the severity level of depressive symptoms and reached 73% for patients with severe depressive symptoms while specificity remained above 95% for all three severity levels. The acceptability of the ECA evaluated by the AES was very good (25.4). We demonstrate here the validity and acceptability of an ECA to diagnose major depressive disorders. ECAs are promising tools to conduct standardized and well-accepted clinical interviews.;2017
Errors in visual perception may cause problems in situated dialogues. We investigated this problem through an experiment in which human participants interacted through a natural language dialogue interface with a simulated robot. We introduced errors into the robot's perception and observed the resulting problems in the dialogues and their resolutions. We then introduced different methods for the user to request information about the robot's understanding of the environment. We quantify the impact of perception errors on the dialogues and investigate resolution attempts by users at a structural level and at the level of referring expressions.;2017
Food logging is recommended by dieticians for prevention and treatment of obesity but currently available mobile applications for diet tracking are often too difficult and timeconsuming for patients to use regularly. For this reason we propose a novel approach to food journaling that uses speech and language understanding technology in order to enable efficient self-assessment of energy and nutrient consumption. This paper presents ongoing language understanding experiments conducted as part of a larger effort to create a nutrition dialogue system that automatically extracts food concepts from a user's spoken meal description. We first summarize the data collection and annotation of food descriptions performed via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for both a written corpus and spoken data from an in-domain speech recognizer. We show that the addition of word vector features improves conditional random field (CRF) performance for semantic tagging of food concepts achieving an average F1 test score of 92.4 on written data we also demonstrate that a convolutional neural network (CNN) with no hand-crafted features outperforms the best CRF on spoken data achieving an F1 test score of 91.3. We illustrate two methods for associating foods with properties: segmenting meal descriptions with a CRF and a complementary method that directly predicts associations with a feed-forward neural network. Finally we conduct an end-to-end system evaluation through an AMTuser study with worker ratings of 83% semantic tagging accuracy.;2017
Fully automated self-help interventions can serve as highly cost-effective mental health promotion tools for massive amounts of people. However these interventions are often characterised by poor adherence. One way to address this problem is to mimic therapy support by a conversational agent. The objectives of this study were to assess the effectiveness and adherence of a smartphone app delivering strategies used in positive psychology and CBT interventions via an automated chatbot (Shim) for a non-clinical population - as well as to explore participants' views and experiences of interacting with this chatbot. A total of 28 participants were randomized to either receive the chatbot intervention (n = 14) or to a wait-list control group (n = 14). Findings revealed that participants who adhered to the intervention (n = 13) showed significant interaction effects of group and time on psychological well-being (FS) and perceived stress (PSS-10) compared to the wait-list control group with small to large between effect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.14-1.06). Also the participants showed high engagement during the 2-week long intervention with an average open app ratio of 17.71 times for the whole period. This is higher compared to other studies on fully automated interventions claiming to be highly engaging such as Woebot and the Panoply app. The qualitative data revealed sub-themes which to our knowledge have not been found previously such as the moderating format of the chatbot. The results of this study in particular the good adherence rate validated the usefulness of replicating this study in the future with a larger sample size and an active control group. This is important as the search for fully automated yet highly engaging and effective digital self-help interventions for promoting mental health is crucial for the public health.;2017
Given the proliferation of 'intelligent' and 'socially-aware' digital assistants embodying everyday mobile technology and the undeniable logic that utilising voice-activated controls and interfaces in cars reduces the visual and manual distraction of interacting with in-vehicle devices it appears inevitable that next generation vehicles will be embodied by digital assistants and utilise spoken language as a method of interaction. From a design perspective defining the language and interaction style that a digital driving assistant should adopt is contingent on the role that they play within the social fabric and context in which they are situated. We therefore conducted a qualitative Wizard-of-Oz study to explore how drivers might interact linguistically with a natural language digital driving assistant. Twenty-five. participants drove for 10 min in a medium-fidelity driving simulator while interacting with a state-of-the-art high-functioning conversational digital driving assistant. All exchanges were transcribed and analysed using recognised linguistic techniques such as discourse and conversation analysis normally reserved for interpersonal investigation. Language usage patterns demonstrate that interactions with the digital assistant were fundamentally social in nature with participants affording the assistant equal social status and high-level cognitive processing capability. For example participants were polite actively controlled turn-taking during the conversation and used back-channelling fillers and hesitation as they might in human communication. Furthermore participants expected the digital assistant to understand and process complex requests mitigated with hedging words and expressions and peppered with vague language and deictic references requiring shared contextual information and mutual understanding. Findings are presented in six themes which emerged during the analysis formulating responses turn-taking back-channelling fillers and hesitation vague language mitigating requests and politeness and praise. The results can be used to inform the design of future in-vehicle natural language systems in particular to help manage the tension between designing for an engaging dialogue (important for technology acceptance) and designing for an effective dialogue (important to minimise distraction in a driving context).

In human-human dialogue the way in which a piece of information is added to the partners' common ground (i.e. presented and accepted) constitutes an important determinant of subsequent dialogue memory. The aim of this study was to determine whether this is also the case in human-system dialogue. An experiment was conducted in which naive participants and a simulated dialogue system took turns to present references to various landmarks featured on a list. The kind of feedback used to accept these references (verbatim repetition vs. implicit acceptance) was manipulated. The participants then performed a recognition test during which they attempted to identify the references mentioned previously. Self-presented references were recognised better than references presented by the system however such presentation bias was attenuated when the initial presentation of these references was followed by verbatim repetition. Implications for the design of automated dialogue systems are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2017
In order to improve the social capabilities of embodied conversational agents we propose a computational model to enable agents to automatically select and display appropriate smiling behavior during human-machine interaction. A smile may convey different communicative intentions depending on subtle characteristics of the facial expression and contextual cues. To construct such a model as a first step we explore the morphological and dynamic characteristics of different types of smiles (polite amused and embarrassed smiles) that an embodied conversational agent may display. The resulting lexicon of smiles is based on a corpus of virtual agents' smiles directly created by users and analyzed through a machine-learning technique. Moreover during an interaction a smiling expression impacts on the observer's perception of the interpersonal stance of the speaker. As a second step we propose a probabilistic model to automatically compute the user's potential perception of the embodied conversational agent's social stance depending on its smiling behavior and on its physical appearance. This model based on a corpus of users' perceptions of smiling and nonsmiling virtual agents enables a virtual agent to determine the appropriate smiling behavior to adopt given the interpersonal stance it wants to express. An experiment using real human-virtual agent interaction provided some validation of the proposed model.;2017
In recent years compact camera modules (CCMs) have been widely used in consumer electrical and electronic products. CCMs with low cost specially are necessary for portable devices. Therefore the present group recently developed a miniaturized open-loop controlled camera module with low cost for cellphone applications in which the Lorentz force is balanced by a magnetic restoring force. To enhance the performance of the camera module this article reports a pattern structure to modify the linearity of the magnetic restoring force. We fabricated a CCM prototype with the dimensions of 8.5 mm x 8.5 mm x 5 mm and demonstrated the usefulness of the pattern structure with the CCM prototype. Its potential applications are foreseeable in portable devices such as cellphones web cameras personal digital assistants and other commercial electronics.;2017
In recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of bots online varying from Web crawlers for search engines to chatbots for online customer service spambots on social media and content-editing bots in online collaboration communities. The online world has turned into an ecosystem of bots. However our knowledge of how these automated agents are interacting with each other is rather poor. Bots are predictable automatons that do not have the capacity for emotions meaning-making creativity and sociality and it is hence natural to expect interactions between bots to be relatively predictable and uneventful. In this article we analyze the interactions between bots that edit articles on Wikipedia. We track the extent to which bots undid each other's edits over the period 2001-2010 model how pairs of bots interact over time and identify different types of interaction trajectories. We find that although Wikipedia bots are intended to support the encyclopedia they often undo each other's edits and these sterile fights may sometimes continue for years. Unlike humans on Wikipedia bots' interactions tend to occur over longer periods of time and to be more reciprocated. Yet just like humans bots in different cultural environments may behave differently. Our research suggests that even relatively dumb bots may give rise to complex interactions and this carries important implications for Artificial Intelligence research. Understanding what affects bot-bot interactions is crucial for managing social media well providing adequate cyber-security and designing well functioning autonomous vehicles.;2017
In the context of an international research project on older people's relations with and through mobile telephony Italian participants spontaneously provided narrations on mobile phones that appeared to be structured around strong stereotypes. Respondents show a twofold representation of mobile phones either as a simple communication tool or as a hi-tech' device which generates multifaceted stereotypes. More specifically when the mobile phone is considered as a simple communication tool age-based stereotypes address younger people's bad manners while gendered stereotypes depict women as chatterboxes' or social groomers'. On the other hand when the mobile phone is considered a hi-tech' device age-based stereotypes underline younger people's advanced user skills while gendered stereotypes focus on women's lack of competencies. Based on that we provide a conceptual framework for analysing such stereotyped - and apparently conflicting - representations. Interestingly while some issues also emerged in other countries the masculine assumption that women are less-skilled mobile phone users appears as a peculiarity of Italian respondents.;2017
In this paper we look at a specific issue with practical Turing tests namely the right of the machine to remain silent during interrogation. In particular we consider the possibility of a machine passing the Turing test simply by not saying anything. We include a number of transcripts from practical Turing tests in which silence has actually occurred on the part of a hidden entity. Each of the transcripts considered here resulted in a judge being unable to make the 'right identification' i.e. they could not say for certain which hidden entity was the machine.;2017
Intelligent Tutoring Systems personalise learning for students with different backgrounds abilities behaviours and knowledge. One way to personalise learning is through consideration of individual differences in preferred learning style. OSCAR is the name of a Conversational Intelligent Tutoring System that models a person's learning style using natural language dialogue during tutoring in order to dynamically predict and personalise their tutoring session. Prediction of learning style is undertaken by capturing independent behaviour variables during the tutoring conversation with the highest value variable determining the student's learning style. A weakness of this approach is that it does not take into consideration the interactions between behaviour variables and due to the uncertainty inherently present in modelling learning styles small differences in behaviour can lead to incorrect predictions. Consequently the learner is presented with tutoring material not suited to their learning style. This paper proposes a new method that uses fuzzy decision trees to build a series of fuzzy predictive models combining these variables for all dimensions of the Felder Silverman Learning Styles model. Results using live data show the fuzzy models have increased the predictive accuracy of OSCAR-CITS across four learning style dimensions and facilitated the discovery of some interesting relationships amongst behaviour variables.

Interaction Style (IS) refers to patterns of interaction containing highly contextual and innate information. Awareness of our IS can help us discover interpersonal conflicts and guide us how to interact with others. Recently automatic IS recognition is becoming increasingly important in the design of a dialogue system for harmonious interaction. With the goal to select appropriate responses four IS types proposed by Berens are selected as the basis for our study. In this study multiple views (multi-views) of the utterances during interaction including emotions and dialogue topics are recognized first. Inspired by the emotion profile theory the IS profiles are then extracted using the multi-view features to better characterize the IS of the interactional utterances. Similar to the multilayer architectures in deep neural networks a multi-layer multi-view IS profile representation method structured layer by layer through embedding the multi-views is proposed to better interpret intermediate representations in the feature space of the interactional utterances based on a probabilistic fusion model. The IS is finally recognized by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the obtained IS profiles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved an encouraging IS recognition accuracy and outperformed the previous method.;2017
Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as the Amazon Echo - a smart speaker developed by Amazon - are undoubtedly great sources of potential digital evidence due to their ubiquitous use and their always-on mode of operation constituting a human-life's black box. The Amazon Echo in particular plays a centric role for the cloud-based intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) Alexa developed by Amazon Lab126. The Alexa-enabled wireless smart speaker is the gateway for all voice commands submitted to Alexa. Moreover the IVA interacts with a plethora of compatible IoT devices and third-party applications that leverage cloud resources. Understanding the complex cloud ecosystem that allows ubiquitous use of Alexa is paramount on supporting digital investigations when need raises. This paper discusses methods for digital forensics pertaining to the IVA Alexa's ecosystem. The primary contribution of this paper consists of a new efficient approach of combining cloud-native forensics with client-side forensics (forensics for companion devices) to support practical digital investigations. Based on a deep understanding of the targeted ecosystem we propose a proof-of-concept tool CIFT that supports identification acquisition and analysis of both native artifacts from the cloud and client-centric artifacts from local devices (mobile applications and web browsers).

Introduction: Although traditional virtual patient simulations are designed to teach and assess clinical reasoning skills few employ conversational dialogue with the patients. The virtual standardized patients (VSPs) described herein represent standardized patients that students interview using natural language. Students take histories and develop differential diagnoses of the VSPs as much as they would with standardized or actual patients. The student-VSP interactions are recorded creating a comprehensive record of questions and the order in which they were asked which can be analyzed to assess information gathering skills. Students document the encounter in an electronic medical record created for the VSPs. Methods: The VSP was developed by integrating a dialogue management system (ChatScript) with emotionally responsive 3D characters created in a high-fidelity game engine (Unity). The system was tested with medical students at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. Students are able to take a history of a VSP develop a differential diagnosis and document the encounter in the electronic medical record. Results: Accuracy of the VSP responses ranged from 79% to 86% depending on the complexity of the case type of history obtained and skill of the student. Students were able to accurately develop an appropriate differential diagnosis on the basis of the information provided by the patient during the encounter. Conclusions: The VSP enables students to practice their history-taking skills before encounters with standardized or actual patients. Future developments will focus on creating an assessment module that will automatically analyze VSP sessions and provide immediate student feedback.;2017
Introduction: Benefits from mental health early interventions may not be sustained over time and longer-term intervention programs may be required to maintain early clinical gains. However due to the high intensity of face-to-face early intervention treatments this may not be feasible. Adjunctive internet-based interventions specifically designed for youth may provide a cost-effective and engaging alternative to prevent loss of intervention benefits. However until now online interventions have relied on human moderators to deliver therapeutic content. More sophisticated models responsive to user data are critical to inform tailored online therapy. Thus integration of user experience with a sophisticated and cutting-edge technology to deliver content is necessary to redefine online interventions in youth mental health. This paper discusses the development of the moderated online social therapy (MOST) web application which provides an interactive social media-based platform for recovery in mental health. We provide an overview of the system's main features and discus our current work regarding the incorporation of advanced computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user engagement and improve the discovery and delivery of therapy content. Methods: Our case study is the ongoing Horyzons site (5-year randomized controlled trial for youth recovering from early psychosis) which is powered by MOST. We outline the motivation underlying the project and the web application's foundational features and interface. We discuss system innovations including the incorporation of pertinent usage patterns as well as identifying certain limitations of the system. This leads to our current motivations and focus on using computational and artificial intelligence methods to enhance user engagement and to further improve the system with novel mechanisms for the delivery of therapy content to users. In particular we cover our usage of natural language analysis and chatbot technologies as strategies to tailor interventions and scale up the system. Conclusions: To date the innovative MOST system has demonstrated viability in a series of clinical research trials. Given the data-driven opportunities afforded by the software system observed usage patterns and the aim to deploy it on a greater scale an important next step in its evolution is the incorporation of advanced and automated content delivery mechanisms.;2017
Introduction: High maternal and child mortality continues in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). Measurement of maternal newborn and child health (MNCH) coverage indicators often involves an expensive complex and lengthy household data collection process that is especially difficult in less-resourced settings. Computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) has been proposed as a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional paper-and-pencil interviewing (PAPI). However the literature on respondent-level acceptance of CAPI in LMIC has reported mixed outcomes. This is the first study to prospectively examine female respondent acceptance of CAPI and its influencing factors for MNCH data collection in rural Southwest Uganda. Methods: Eighteen women aged 15-49 years were randomly selected from 3 rural villages to participate. Each respondent was administered a Women's Questionnaire with half of the survey questions asked using PAPI techniques and the other half using CAPI. Following this PAPI/CAPI exposure semi structured focus group discussions (FGDs) assessed respondent attitudes towards PAPI versus CAPI. FGD data analysis involved an immersion/crystallization method (thematic narrative analysis). Results: The sixteen FGD respondents had a median age of 27 (interquartile range: 24.8 32.3) years old. The majority (62.5%) had only primary level education. Most respondents (68.8%) owned or regularly used a mobile phone or computer. Few respondents (31.3%) had previously seen but not used a tablet computer. Overall FGDs revealed CAPI acceptance and the factors influencing CAPI acceptability were familiarity' data confidentiality and security' data accuracy' and 'modernization and development'. Discussion: Female survey respondents in our rural Southwest Ugandan setting found CAPI to be acceptable. Global health planners and implementers considering CAPI for health coverage survey data collection should accommodate influencing factors during survey planning in order to maximize and facilitate acceptance and support by local stakeholders and community participants. Further research is needed to generate best practices for CAPI implementation and LMIC higher quality timely streamlined and budget-friendly collection of MNCH indicators could help direct and improve programming to save lives of mothers and children.

Introduction: The burden of raised blood pressure and elevated blood glucose in sub-Saharan Africa has been increasing over the last couple of decades. However a large proportion of the population with raised blood pressure and elevated blood glucose remain undiagnosed contributing to the increasing burden of the problem. There is paucity of published studies describing the burden of major NCDs in sub -Saharan Africa. Likewise except very few studies in some pocket areas there was no representative NCD risk factor survey undertaken in Ethiopia. This paper focuses on the data extracted from the survey on the prevalence of selected NCDs to elaborate more on the issues and to show the invisible magnitude of the two major health problems for policy and program development. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in Ethiopia using the WHO step-wise approach to the surveillance of NCD risk factors. The survey was carried out between April and June 2015. The data collection processes included three steps. Step 1: This step comprised of a questionnaire to gather demographic and behavioural characteristics of the study population Step 2: Physical measurement was done to build on the core data in Step 1 and to determine proportion of the study population with raised blood pressure overweight and obesity and Step 3: Biochemical measurements were undertaken to build on the core data in step 1 and step 2 to measure proportion of the study population with diabetes raised blood glucose and abnormal lipid level. Data were collected digitally using personal digital assistants (PDAs) from which data were transferred to central server using internet file streaming system (IFSS). Data were cleaned and analysed using a combination of softwares namely SPSS Stata and Epi Info version 3.5.4. Results: The survey included 9788 study participants and of this 77% had never been measured for blood pressure prior to current survey. However based on the measurements made during the present survey among all respondents who were not taking medication for raised blood pressure 15.6% (95% CI: 14.4-16.9) had raised blood pressure level (SBP of >= 140 mmHg and/or a DBP of >= 90 mmHg). Likewise among all respondents 97 % had never been tested for blood sugar level prior to present survey. However the current study revealed a total of 5.7 % of the study population had a blood glucose level of >= 110 mg/dl with 6% (95% CI: 4.7-7.2) in men and 5.8 %(95% CI: 4.6-7.0) in women. Conclusions: The prevalence of undiagnosed raised blood pressure and elevated blood sugar was high in Ethiopia and only very small percentage of people had been aware of their high blood pressure and elevated blood sugar. Policy makers in the health sector including other health development partners need to strengthen health system and design nation-wide population based strategy to establish community based screening program for blood pressure and blood glucose.;2017
Many excellent results are obtained in agricultural and forestry research projects. but their practical adoption is often limited. The aim of the European project VALERIE is to increase the transfer and application of innovations produced by research in agriculture and forestry by facilitating their integration into management practices. The project is still ongoing and the results illustrated in this paper are still temporary and subject to being improved. Here we present the methodology used in VALFRIE to extract and summarise knowledge for innovation from research documents with the aim of making it available to final users through ask-Valerie.en we also report on current progress. The tasks associated with extracting and summarising knowledge are centred on: i) an ontology ii) a document base and iii) a system (ask-Valerie.eu) that allows users to effectively search the document base. An ontology defines a set of concepts and the relations between them. The VALERIE ontology is built by experts in the agricultural and forestry domain and contains 6169 concepts (21st October 2016). The document base is the collection of documents in which the system searches. The VALERIE document base includes scientific and practical documents derived from various sources Written in any of a number of languages. All documents contained in the document base are annotated using the ontology: each term (a word or a short phrase) in the document that matches a concept in the VALERIE-ontology is linked to that concept. Annotation is an automated process that takes place whenever a document is added to the document base. The document base contains 4278 documents (October 2016). Among them there are 201 minifactsheets written by members of the VALERIE project each describing an innovation with: a short description of the innovation a list of correlated projects and some links to scientific and practical documents. ask-Valerie.eu searches documents and fragments of text from the document base that address the user's query. ask-Vaterie.cu mimics the dialogue between a practitioner and an expert and achieves this functionality by: i) supporting the practitioner in articulating the question (it completes terms that the user starts to type and suggests other possibly relevant terms) ii) expanding the query using synonyms iii) extracting and ranking text fragments from the documents.;2017
Minimizing power consumption to prolong battery life has become an important design issue for portable battery-operated devices such as smartphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). On a Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) enabled processor power consumption can be reduced by scaling down the operating frequency of the processor whenever the full processing speed is not required. Real-time task scheduling is a complex and challenging problem for DVS-enabled multiprocessor systems. This paper first formulates the real-time task scheduling for DVS-enabled multiprocessor systems as a combinatorial optimization problem. It then proposes a genetic algorithm that is hybridized with the stochastic evolution algorithm to allocate and schedule real-time tasks with precedence constraints. It presents specialized crossover and perturb operations as well as a topology preserving algorithm to generate the initial population. A comprehensive simulation study has been done using synthetic and real benchmark data to evaluate the performance of the proposed Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) in terms of solution quality and efficiency. The performance of the proposed HGA has been compared with the genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization cuckoo search and ant colony optimization. The simulation results show that HGA outperforms the other algorithms in terms of solution quality.;2017
Multilinguality is a characteristic that involves the use of more than one natural language in automatic speech recognition applications. In today's world it is a characteristic of a rapidly increasing class of features required by a complete digital assistant through means of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. In working environments where more than one language is in use the problem of storing and retrieving information acquires a multilingual dimension. Unfortunately many languages from developing countries or minorities received very little attention so far. One way of improving this situation is to do more research on the portability of speech and language technologies for multilingual applications especially for under-resourced languages. These problems as well as that of processing spoken material in a multilingual low-resource environment will be briefly covered in this overview paper.;2017
Novel technology can be a powerful tool for enhancing students' interest in many learning domains. However the sustainability and overall impact of such interest is unclear. This study tests the longer term effects of technology on students' task and course interest. The experimental study was conducted with students in foreign language classes (n = 122): a 12-week experimental trial that included pre and post-course interest and a sequence of task interest measures. Employing a counterbalanced design at three week intervals students engaged in separate speaking tasks with each of a Human and Chatbot partner. Students' interest in successive tasks and in the course (pre-post) were used to assess differential partner effects and course interest development trajectories. Comparisons of task interest under different partner conditions over time indicated a significant drop in students' task interest with the Chatbot but not Human partner. After accounting for initial course interest Structural Equation Modelling indicated that only task interest with the Human partner contributed to developing course interest. While Human partner task interest predicted future course interest task interest under Chatbot partner conditions did not. Under Chatbot partner conditions there was a drop in task interest after the first task: a novelty effect. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE: Optimizing clinical proficiency and education of residents has become more important with restricted residency duty hours. Our objective was to investigate how interns spend their time on inpatient rotations and the perceived educational value of workday activities. METHODS: We performed a descriptive self-work sampling study using a personal digital assistant (PDA) to randomly query interns on inpatient rotations in real time regarding their activity and the perceived educational value of that activity on a 4-point Likert scale. RESULTS: A total of 31 interns participated on 88 workdays over a 5-month period generating 2082 samples from which the average workday was modeled. Time spent using the electronic health record (EHR) accounted for 33% of intern time communicating with the health care team 23% educational activities 17% and time with patients and families 12%. Time with patients and families was perceived to be the most educational part of clinical service. Time spent using the EHR was perceived as the least educational. Interns perceived clinical service as excellent or good 37% of the time while planned educational activities were perceived as excellent or good 81% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Interns spend the majority of their time using the EHR and communicating with the health care team. Interns perceive time spent in planned educational activities has more educational value than time spent in clinical service. The distribution of daily activities is discordant with the perceived educational value of those activities.;2017
Objective: The objective of this study was to build a database to collect infectious disease information at the scene of a disaster through the use of 128 epidemiological questionnaires and 47 types of options with rapid acquisition of information regarding infectious disease and rapid questionnaire customization at the scene of disaster relief by use of a personal digital assistant (PDA). Methods: SQL Server 2005 (Microsoft Corp Redmond WA) was used to create the option database for the infectious disease investigation to develop a client application for the PDA and to deploy the application on the server side. The users accessed the server for data collection and questionnaire customization with the PDA. Results: A database with a set of comprehensive options was created and an application system was developed for the Android operating system (Google Inc Mountain View CA). On this basis an infectious disease information collection system was built for use at the scene of disaster relief. The creation of an infectious disease information collection system and rapid questionnaire customization through the use of a PDA was achieved. Conclusions: This system integrated computer technology and mobile communication technology to develop an infectious disease information collection system and to allow for rapid questionnaire customization at the scene of disaster relief.;2017
Objective: This randomized controlled trial evaluates the feasibility of using an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to teach lifestyle modifications to urban women. Methods: Women were randomized to either 1) an ECA (content included: mindfulness stress management physical activity and healthy eating) or 2) patient education sheets mirroring same content plus a meditation CD/MP3 once a day for one month. General outcome measures included: number of stress management techniques used physical activity levels and eating patterns. Results: Sixty-one women ages 18 to 50 were enrolled. On average 51% identified as white 26% as black 23% as other races and 20% as Hispanic. The major stress management techniques reported at baseline were: exercise (69%) listening to music (70%) and social support (66%). After one month women randomized to the ECA significantly decreased alcohol consumption to reduce stress (p = 0.03) and increased daily fruit consumption by an average of 2 servings compared to the control (p = 0.04). Conclusion: It is feasible to use an ECA to promote health behaviors on stress management and healthy eating among diverse urban women. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2017
Objective: Verbal and non-verbal behaviors which are known as relational contextualization cues relay information about relationships and how they are structured. We developed a computer-simulated provider conducting an informed consent process for clinical research to investigate the effects of a provider's alignment of interests with a patient the research team or a neutral party on patient trust in the provider. Methods: Participants (N = 43) interacted with a simulated provider for a research informed consent process in a three-arm counterbalanced within-subjects experiment. Participants reported their trust in the simulated provider after each treatment. Results: Participants successfully recognized the alignment manipulation and perceived the patient-aligned provider as more trustworthy than the other providers. Participants were also more satisfied with the patient-aligned provider liked this provider more expressed more desire to continue working with this provider and stated that they were significantly more likely to sign the consent form after interacting with this provider compared to the other two. Conclusion: Relational contextualization that aligns with the patient increases trust satisfaction and willingness to enroll in the context of research informed consent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To assess advanced communication skills among second-year medical students exposed either to a computer simulation (MPathic-VR) featuring virtual humans or to a multimedia computerbased learning module and to understand each group's experiences and learning preferences. Methods: A single-blinded mixed methods randomized multisite trial compared MPathic-VR (N = 210) to computer-based learning (N = 211). Primary outcomes: communication scores during repeat interactions with MPathic-VR's intercultural and interprofessional communication scenarios and scores on a subsequent advanced communication skills objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare outcomes. Secondary outcomes: student attitude surveys and qualitative assessments of their experiences with MPathic-VR or computer-based learning. Results: MPathic-VR-trained students improved their intercultural and interprofessional communication performance between their first and second interactions with each scenario. They also achieved significantly higher composite scores on the OSCE than computer-based learning-trained students. Attitudes and experiences were more positive among students trained with MPathic-VR who valued its providing immediate feedback teaching nonverbal communication skills and preparing them for emotion-charged patient encounters. Conclusions: MPathic-VR was effective in training advanced communication skills and in enabling knowledge transfer into a more realistic clinical situation. Practice implications: MPathic-VR's virtual human simulation offers an effective and engaging means of advanced communication training. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2017
ObjectivesThis study aimed to acquire knowledge about the factors affecting smartphone adoption for accessing information in medical settings in Iranian Hospitals. MethodsA qualitative and quantitative approach was used to conduct this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 medical residents and interns in 2013 to identify determinant factors for smartphone adoption. Afterwards nine relationships were hypothesised. We developed a questionnaire to test these hypotheses and to evaluate the importance of each factor. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the causal relations between model parameters and to accurately identify determinant factors. ResultsEight factors were identified in the qualitative phase of the study including perceived usefulness perceived ease of use training internal environment personal experience social impacts observability and job related characteristics. Among the studied factors perceived usefulness personal experience and job related characteristics were significantly associated with attitude to use a smartphone which accounted for 64% of the variance in attitude. Perceived usefulness had the strongest impact on attitude to use a smartphone. ConclusionThe factors that emerged from interviews were consistent with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and some previous studies. TAM is a reliable model for understanding the factors of smartphone acceptance in medical settings.;2017
Owing to the advancements in low-power consumption processors and high-power storage in a small-sized battery the cost of handheld mobile devices eg mobiles tabs or personal digital assistants have reduced to a great extent. This has enabled people to have at least 1 smartphone in general with this number increasing exponentially. However the increasing use of these mobile devices results in an equal increase in the underused processing capacity of these devices too. This encourages the research aiming to use this processing power by forming a mobile computational grid. Because of the inherent limitations of bandwidth battery and computational power job scheduling on these devices demands an efficient scheduling approach to harness the true potential of the grid. The problem becomes even more challenging considering the dynamic nature of these mobile devices. Job scheduling being nondeterministic polynomial time-complete allows the use of evolutionary approaches by exploring and exploiting the search space efficiently. The exploration gets boosted even more with the use of quantum-computing concepts. This work proposes a quantum-inspired Newtonian approach of attraction based on gravitational search algorithm for scheduling the jobs on mobile computational grid. Simulation study has been performed to evaluate the performance of the model over various dimensions. A comparative study has been performed with quantum-genetic algorithm. Simulation result establishes the effectiveness of model under various test conditions.;2017
Postal motorcyclists who regularly conduct deliveries are particularly vulnerable to road accidents since they are exposed to traffic throughout their work day. To reduce accident rates safety officers in each of the local delivery offices alert postmen of any hazardous conditions that may be conducive to accidents. Although some commercial postal organizations already use tracking technologies (e.g. GPS) Korea Post currently has no systematic way to collect their postmen's driving behavior except by referring to each postman's manually recorded daily mileage. In light of this we developed a safety index (SI) for quantifying and analyzing individual postal motorcyclists' safety performance based on their driving behavior and work environment. Each postman's work environment varies from post office to post office and postman to postman depending on delivery conditions. After creating a GPS based system that can be installed on personal digital assistants (PDAs) that are already used by postmen throughout their shifts we conducted two phases of field tests during a two-year period involving postmen working in different demographic areas. Using the collected field data we validated our developed SI and analyzed whether there were any differences in the safety performance among postal motorcyclists working in different regional post offices or within the same regional post office. We found that the safety performance of postal motorcyclists working in different regional delivery offices varied depending on the regional characteristics of the local delivery office (e.g. densely distributed delivery points vs. loosely distributed delivery points). We also found that the safety performance of postal motorcyclists working in the same regional post office varied depending on the specific circumstances of each delivery area (e.g. short commuting routes of the postman responsible for downtown vs. long commuting routes of the postman responsible for a suburb).;2017
Previous research on distractions and the use of mobile devices (personal digital assistants tablet personal computers or laptops) have been conducted almost exclusively in higher education. The purpose of the current study was to examine the frequency and influence of distracting behaviors in Bring Your Own Device secondary school classrooms. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 181 secondary school students (55 female and 126 male) enrolled in three schools across Canada. Almost 80% of the students reported being on task regularly when using mobile devices in class. However students also engaged in at least one of five distracting activities occasionally or regularly with their mobile devices including emailing (64%) surfing the web (65%) using social media (52%) instant messaging (32%) and playing games (30%). Female students engaged with social media significantly more than male students whereas male students played games significantly more than female students. Students were rarely distracted by peer use of mobile technology devices. Students were more distracted by their own use of mobile devices when engaged in independent or group work and less distracted with lectures and student presentations. Students claimed that teacher and school restrictions were probably the most effective method to limit distracting behavior while learning.;2017
Purpose: To describe prevalence and patterns of potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) in the intensive care unit (ICU) occurrence of adverse drug events (ADEs) and agreement between different compendia and intensivists' perceptions. Methods: A cross-sectional study. Drug profiles of all adult patients from 2 academic ICUs were screened on day 3 upon admission. We identified pDDIs using 3 compendia (Stockley's Micromedex and Epocrates) and documented their mechanism of action clinical consequences severity level of evidence and management. Medical records were searched to identify ADEs potentially related to major pDDls. Agreement between information sources (compendia intensivists) was evaluated. Results: We identified 1120 pDDIs among 275 patients. Median number of pDDls per patient was 3.0 (interquartile range 1-6) with 79% of patients presenting with at least 1 pDDI. Major pDDIs were detected in 18% of patients with potentially related to ADEs in 4% of patients. Only 13% of all pDDIs were documented simultaneously in all 3 compendia. Different information sources (compendia clinicians) showed no to fair agreement. Conclusions: Potential drug-drug interactions occurred in most ICU patients contrasting with low rates of potentially related ADEs which may have been underestimated. Sources of information are inconsistent challenging the identification of pDDIs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2017
Question generation is an emerging research area of artificial intelligence in education. Question authoring tools are important in educational technologies e.g. intelligent tutoring systems as well as in dialogue systems. Approaches to generate factual questions i.e. questions that have concrete answers mainly make use of the syntactical and semantic information in a declarative sentence which is then transformed into questions. Recently some research has been conducted to investigate Chinese factual question generation with some limited success. Reported performance is poor due to unavoidable errors (e.g. sentence parsing name entity recognition and rule-based question transformation errors) and the complexity of long Chinese sentences. This article introduces a novel Chinese question generation systembased on three stages sentence simplification question generation and ranking to address the challenge of automatically generating factual questions in Chinese. The proposed approach and systemhave been evaluated on sentences from the New Practical Chinese Reader corpus. Experimental results show that ranking improves more than 20 percentage of questions rated as acceptable by annotators from 65 percent of all questions to 87 percent of the top ranked 25 percent questions.;2017
Recent progress in both AI and robotics have enabled the development of general purpose robot platforms that are capable of executing a wide variety of complex temporally extended service tasks in open environments. This article introduces a novel custom-designed multi-robot platform for research on AI robotics and especially human-robot interaction for service robots. Called BWIBots the robots were designed as a part of the Building-Wide Intelligence (BWI) project at the University of Texas at Austin. The article begins with a description of and justification for the hardware and software design decisions underlying the BWIBots with the aim of informing the design of such platforms in the future. It then proceeds to present an overview of various research contributions that have enabled the BWIBots to better (a) execute action sequences to complete user requests (b) efficiently ask questions to resolve user requests (c) understand human commands given in natural language and (d) understand human intention from afar. The article concludes with a look forward towards future research opportunities and applications enabled by the BWIBot platform.;2017
Research in computer-supported collaborative learning has indicated that conversational agents can be pedagogically beneficial when used to scaffold students' online discussions. In this study we investigate the impact of an agile conversational agent that triggers student dialogue by making interventions based on the academically productive talk framework. An experimental activity in the context of a university course involved 72 undergraduate students who discussed online in dyads. Two conditions were compared: (a) dyads who received agent interventions while working on a learning task (treatment) and (b) dyads who worked on the same task without any agent interference (control). Utilizing a concept map created by the course instructor the conversational agent delivered unsolicited interventions that encouraged treatment students to build on their prior knowledge linking their current contributions to the main domain principles discussed during the course. Study findings indicate that the agent intervention mode substantially improved both individual and group learning outcomes. Evidence suggests that the agent effect on learning performance was mediated by students' explicit reasoning which was also found to be enhanced in the treatment condition.;2017
Scaled acquisition of high-quality structured knowledge has been a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence research. Recent advances in crowdsourcing the sheer number of Internet and mobile users and the commercial availability of supporting platforms offer new tools for knowledge acquisition. This article applies context-aware knowledge acquisition that simultaneously satisfies users' immediate information needs while extending its own knowledge using crowdsourcing. The focus is on knowledge acquisition on a mobile device which makes the approach practical and scalable in this context we propose and implement a new KA approach that exploits an existing knowledge base to drive the KA process communicate with the right people and check for consistency of the user-provided answers. We tested the viability of the approach in experiments using our platform with real users around the world and an existing large source of common-sense background knowledge. These experiments show that the approach is promising: the knowledge is estimated to be true and useful for users 95% of the time. Using context to proactively drive knowledge acquisition increased engagement and effectiveness (the number of new assertions/day/user increased for 175%). Using pre-existing and newly acquired knowledge also proved beneficial.;2017
Self-instruction for individuals with an intellectual disability can be viewed as a pivotal skill in that once learned this skill has collateral effects on future behaviors in various environments. This study used a multiple probe across participants design to evaluate video modeling to teach high school students with an intellectual disability to film their own video prompts which could then be used for self-instruction. Results indicated that three out of four participants acquired the filming behavior and generalized it to a novel setting with a novel model revealing potential for use in video based self-instruction. However quality of the video (i.e. percentage in-frame) varied across these participants and may impinge upon their ability to learn skills from the video. Implications for practitioners to teach individuals with an intellectual disability to prepare their own self-prompts and carry out self-instruction are discussed.;2017
Server-side socialbot detection approaches can identify malicious accounts and spams in online social networks. However they cannot detect socialbot processes residing on user hosts which control these accounts. Therefore new approaches are needed to detect socialbots on hosts. The fundamental to design host-side detecting approaches is to gain an insight into the behaviors of socialbots on host. In this article we analyzed a series of representative socialbots in depth and summarized the typical features of socialbot behaviors. We proposed a new approach to defense against socialbots on end host. The contributions of this article are threefold: (1) our analysis approach can be used for reference during analyzing new socialbots in the future (2) we provide several behavior features of socialbots on hosts including network flow through which socialbots communicate with botmasters through the online social network system calls via which socialbots conduct an activity and process information of socialbots running on hosts. These features can be used by someone to design approaches to identifying socialbots on a host (3) our proposed detection approach can effectively distinguish between a socialbot and a benign application on end hosts.;2017
Slowing down the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its adverse health outcomes requires the patient's self-management and attention to treatment recommendations. Information technology (IT)-based interventions are increasingly being used to support self-management in patients with chronic diseases such as CKD. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the features and effects of IT-based interventions on self-management outcomes of CKD patients. A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline Scopus and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant papers that were published until May 2016. RCT Studies that assessed at least one automated IT tool in patients with CKD stages 1 to 5 and reported at least one self-management outcome were included. Studies were appraised for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool. Out of 12215 papers retrieved eight study met the inclusion criteria. Interventions were delivered via smartphones/personal digital assistants (PDAs) (three studies) wearable devices (three studies) computerized systems (one study) and multiple component (one study). The studies assessed 15 outcomes including eight clinical outcomes and seven process of care outcomes. In 12 (80%) of the 15 outcomes the studies had revealed the effects of the interventions as statistically significant positive. These positive effects were observed in 75% of the clinical outcomes and 86% of the process of care outcomes. The evidence indicates the potential of IT-based interventions (i.e. smartphones/PDAs wearable devices and computerized systems) in self-management outcomes (clinical and process of care outcomes) of CKD patients.;2017
Smart mobile devices have fostered new interaction scenarios for Ambient Intelligence that demand sophisticated interfaces. The main developers of operating systems for such devices have provided APIs for developers to implement their own applications including different solutions for developing graphical interfaces sensor control and voice interaction. Despite the usefulness of such resources there are no strategies defined for coupling the multimodal interface with the possibilities that the devices offer to identify and adapt to the user needs. This way current apps are usually developed ad-hoc and the spoken interface is conceived as an input for simple commands. In this paper we present a practical mobile application that integrates features of Android APIs on a modular architecture that emphasizes multimodal conversational interaction and context-awareness to foster user-adaptivity robustness and maintainability.;2017
Smart mobile devices have fostered new learning scenarios that demand sophisticated interfaces. Multimodal conversational agents have became a strong alternative to develop human-machine interfaces that provide a more engaging and human-like relationship between students and the system. The main developers of operating systems for such devices have provided application programming interfaces for developers to implement their own applications including different solutions for developing graphical interfaces sensor control and voice interaction. Despite the usefulness of such resources there are no strategies defined for coupling the multimodal interface with the possibilities that these devices offer to enhance mobile educative apps with intelligent communicative capabilities and adaptation to the user needs. In this paper we present a practical m-learning application that integrates features of Android application programming interfaces on a modular architecture that emphasizes interaction management and context-awareness to foster user-adaptively robustness and maintainability.;2017
Social isolation in older adults is a major public health concern. An embodied conversational agent (ECA) has the potential to enhance older adults' social interaction. However little is known about older adults' experience with an ECA. In this paper we conducted a pilot study to examine the perceived acceptance and utility of a tablet-based conversational agent in the form of an avatar (termed digital pet) for older adults. We performed secondary analysis of data collected from a study that employed the use of a digital pet in ten older adults' homes for three months. Most of the participants enjoyed the companionship entertainment reminders and instant assistance from the digital pet. However participants identified limited conversational ability and technical issues as system challenges. Privacy dependence and cost were major concerns. Future applications should maximize the agent's conversational ability and the system's overall usability. Our results can inform future designs of conversational agents for older adults which need to include older adults as system co-designers to maximize usability and acceptance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Social robots are intended to coexist and to communicate with humans in a natural way. This requires these robots to be able to identify people (and objects) around them to use that information during human-robot dialogs. In this work we present how electronic beacons can benefit the interactions between humans and social robots. In particular Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy beacons are presented as the most suitable option among the up-to-date available technologies. In order to show the advantages of the system during human-robot interaction first we present the integration of the information provided by these devices in the robot's dialog system and after a hidden toy hunt game is described as a case study of a scenario where electronic beacons ease the interaction between humans and a social robot.

Social skills training performed by human trainers is a well-established method for obtaining appropriate skills in social interaction. Previous work automated the process of social skills training by developing a dialogue system that teaches social communication skills through interaction with a computer avatar. Even though previous work that simulated social skills training only considered acoustic and linguistic information human social skills trainers take into account visual and other non-verbal features. In this paper we create and evaluate a social skills training system that closes this gap by considering the audiovisual features of the smiling ratio and the head pose (yaw and pitch). In addition the previous system was only tested with graduate students in this paper we applied our system to children or young adults with autism spectrum disorders. For our experimental evaluation we recruited 18 members from the general population and 10 people with autism spectrum disorders and gave them our proposed multimodal system to use. An experienced human social skills trainer rated the social skills of the users. We evaluated the system's effectiveness by comparing pre- and post-training scores and identified significant improvement in their social skills using our proposed multimodal system. Computer-based social skills training is useful for people who experience social difficulties. Such a system can be used by teachers therapists and social skills trainers for rehabilitation and the supplemental use of human-based training anywhere and anytime.;2017
Speech interfaces to conversational systems have been a focus in academia and industry for over a decade due to its applicability as a natural interface. Speech recognition and speech synthesis constitute the important input and output modules respectively for such spoken interface systems. In this paper the speech recognition interface for question answering applications is reviewed and existing limitations are discussed. The existing spoken question answering (QA) systems use an automatic speech recogniser by adapting acoustic and language models for the speech interface and off-the-shelf language processing systems for question interpretation. In the process the impact of recognition errors and language processing inaccuracies is neglected. It is illustrated in the paper how a semantically rich knowledge graph can be used to solve automatic speech recognition and language processing specific problems. A simple concatenation of a speech recogniser and a natural language processing system is a shallow method for a speech interface. An effort beyond merely concatenating these two units is required to develop a successful spoken question answering system. It is illustrated in this paper how a knowledge graph based structured data can be used to build a unified system combining speech recognition and language understanding. This facilitates the use of a semantically rich data model for speech interface. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2017
Speech-driven head movement methods are motivated by the strong coupling that exists between head movements and speech providing an appealing solution to create behaviors that are timely synchronized with speech. This paper offers solutions for two of the problems associated with these methods. First speech-driven methods require all the potential utterances of the conversational agent (CA) to be recorded which limits their applications. Using existing text to speech (TTS) systems scales the applications of these methods by providing the flexibility of using text instead of pre-recorded speech. However simply training speech-driven models with natural speech and testing them with synthetic speech creates a mismatch affecting the performance of the system. This paper proposes a novel strategy to solve this mismatch. The proposed approach starts by creating a parallel corpus either with neutral or emotional synthetic speech timely aligned with the original speech for which we have the motion capture recordings. This parallel corpus is used to retrain the models from scratch or adapt the models originally built with natural speech. Both subjective and objective evaluations show the effectiveness of this solution in reducing the mismatch. Second creating head movement with speech-driven methods can disregard the meaning of the message even when the movements are perfectly synchronized with speech. The trajectory of head movements in conversations also has a role in conveying meaning (e.g. head nods for acknowledgment). In fact our analysis reveals that head movements under different discourse functions have distinguishable patterns. Building on the best models driven by synthetic speech we propose to extract dialog acts directly from the text and use this information to directly constrain our models. Compared to the unconstrained model the model generates head motion sequences that not only are closer to the statistical patterns of the original head movements but also are perceived as more natural and appropriate.

Spoken dialog systems are employed in various devices to help users operate them. An advantage of a spoken dialog system is that the user can make input utterances freely but the system sometimes makes it difficult for the user to speak to it. The system should estimate the state of a user who encounters a problem when starting a dialog and then give appropriate help before the user abandons the dialog. Based on this assumption our research aims to construct a system which responds to a user who does not reply to the system. In this paper we propose a method of discriminating the user's state based on vector quantization of non-verbal information such as prosodic features facial feature points and gaze. The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperforms the conventional approaches and achieves a discrimination ratio of 72.0%. Then we examined sequential discrimination for responding to the user at an appropriate timing. The results indicate that the discrimination ratio reached equal to the end of the session at around 6.0 s.;2017
Spoken dialogue systems allow humans to interact with machines using natural speech. As such they have many benefits. By using speech as the primary communication medium a computer interface can facilitate swift human-like acquisition of information. In recent years speech interfaces have become ever more popular as is evident from the rise of personal assistants such as Siri Google Now Cortana and Amazon Alexa. Recently data-driven machine learning methods have been applied to dialogue modelling and the results achieved for limited-domain applications are comparable to or out-perform traditional approaches. Methods based on Gaussian processes are particularly effective as they enable good models to be estimated from limited training data. Furthermore they provide an explicit estimate of the uncertainty which is particularly useful for reinforcement learning. This article explores the additional steps that are necessary to extend these methods to model multiple dialogue domains. We show that Gaussian process reinforcement learning is an elegant framework that naturally supports a range of methods including prior knowledge Bayesian committee machines and multi-agent learning for facilitating extensible and adaptable dialogue systems.

The classical experimental methodology is ill-suited for the investigation of the behavioral and physiological correlates of natural social interactions. A new experimental approach combining a natural conversation between two persons with control conditions is proposed in this paper. Behavior including gaze direction and speech and physiology including electrodermal activity are recorded during a discussion between two participants through videoconferencing. Control for the social aspect of the interaction is provided by the use of an artificial agent and of videoed conditions. A cover story provides spurious explanations for the purpose of the experiment and for the recordings as well as a controlled and engaging topic of discussion. Preprocessing entails transforming raw measurements into boxcar and delta functions time series indicating when a certain behaviour or physiological event is present. The preliminary analysis presented here consists in finding statistically significant differences between experimental conditions in the temporal associations between behavioral and physiological time series. Significant results validate the experimental approach and further developments including more elaborate analysis and adaptation of the paradigm to functional MRI are discussed.;2017
The collection of accurate dietary intakes using traditional dietary assessment methods (e.g. food records) from military personnel is challenging due to the demanding physiological and psychological conditions of training or operations. In addition these methods are burdensome time consuming and prone to measurement errors. Adopting smart-phone/tablet technology could overcome some of these barriers. The objective was to assess the validity of a tablet app modified to contain detailed nutritional composition data in comparison to a measured food intake/waste method. A sample of Canadian Armed Forces personnel randomized to either a tablet app (n = 9) or a weighed food record (wFR) (n = 9) recorded the consumption of standard military rations for a total of 8 days. Compared to the gold standard measured food intake/waste method the difference in mean energy intake was small (73 kcal/day for tablet app and 108 kcal/day for wFR) (p > 0.05). Repeated Measures Bland-Altman plots indicated good agreement for both methods (tablet app and wFR) with the measured food intake/waste method. These findings demonstrate that the tablet app with added nutritional composition data is comparable to the traditional dietary assessment method (wFR) and performs satisfactorily in relation to the measured food intake/waste method to assess energy macronutrient and selected micronutrient intakes in a sample of military personnel.;2017
The development of information and communication technology has improved the stability in wireless network services at various levels. The services provided can be accessed by the network users through a variety of devices like Mobile phones PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and communication media. The quality of service in wireless network highly depends on various factors like service availability data availability throughput and latency. Many approaches were introduced earlier for location-based services but still there are hurdles in data management service selection and other QoS metrics. It is necessary to develop an optimized location based service selection approach using multi attribute data estimation (MADE) technique. In that intention the service requested by the user is identified with similar service. Upon identifying the service the set of supporting services which are necessary to complete the request are recognized. Based on the services' necessity user location and service availability the service availability measure (SAM) is computed based on the selected service point. By selecting the service according to their SAM value the service selection efficiency can be improved. The selection of service point is performed as per the data availability and multi attribute data estimation technique. The MADE approach enables to collect the data requested and the data sensor which possess the data. Further it facilitates the data depth of each sensor. Based on these contents a service support score is computed by SAM MADE to select a single service point. The proposed algorithm improves the performance in service selection and increases the quality of service parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2017
The increasing availability and capabilities of mobile phones make them a feasible means of data collection. Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems have been used widely for public health monitoring and surveillance activities but documentation of their use in complicated research studies requiring multiple systems is limited. This paper shares our experiences of designing and implementing a complex multi-component EDC system for a community-based four-armed cluster-Randomised Controlled Trial in the rural plains of Nepal to help other researchers planning to use EDC for complex studies in low-income settings. We designed and implemented three interrelated mobile phone data collection systems to enrol and follow-up pregnant women (trial participants) and to support the implementation of trial interventions (women's groups food and cash transfers). 720 field staff used basic phones to send simple coded text messages 539 women's group facilitators used Android smartphones with Open Data Kit Collect and 112 Interviewers Coordinators and Supervisors used smartphones with CommCare. Barcoded photo ID cards encoded with participant information were generated for each enrolled woman. Automated systems were developed to download recode and merge data for nearly real-time access by researchers. The systems were successfully rolled out and used by 1371 staff. A total of 25089 pregnant women were enrolled and 17839 follow-up forms completed. Women's group facilitators recorded 5717 women's groups and the distribution of 14647 food and 13482 cash transfers. Using EDC sped up data collection and processing although time needed for programming and set-up delayed the study inception. EDC using three interlinkedmobile data management systems (FrontlineSMS ODK and CommCare) was a feasible and effective method of data capture in a complex large-scale trial in the plains of Nepal. Despite challenges including prolonged setup times the systems met multiple data collection needs for users with varying levels of literacy and experience.;2017
The mobile Food Record (mFR) is an image-based dietary assessment method for mobile devices. The study primary aim was to test the accuracy of the mFR by comparing reported energy intake (rEI) to total energy expenditure (TEE) using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method. Usability of the mFR was assessed by questionnaires before and after the study. Participants were 45 community dwelling men and women 21-65 years. They were provided pack-out meals and snacks and encouraged to supplement with usual foods and beverages not provided. After being dosed with DLW participants were instructed to record all eating occasions over a 7.5 days period using the mFR. Three trained analysts estimated rEI from the images sent to a secure server. rEI and TEE correlated significantly (Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.58 p < 0.0001). The mean percentage of underreporting below the lower 95% confidence interval of the ratio of rEI to TEE was 12% for men (standard deviation (SD) +/- 11%) and 10% for women (SD +/- 10%). The results demonstrate the accuracy of the mFR is comparable to traditional dietary records and other image-based methods. No systematic biases could be found. The mFR was received well by the participants and usability was rated as easy.;2017
The tourism sector in the province of Teruel (Aragon Spain) is increasing rapidly. Although the number of domestic and foreign tourists is continuously growing there are some tourist attractions spread over a wide geographical area which are only visited by a few people at specific times of the year. Additionally having human tourist guides everywhere and speaking different languages is unfeasible. An integrated solution based on smart and interactive Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) tourist guides combined with ontologies would overcome this problem. This paper presents a smart tourist information points approach which gathers tourism information about Teruel structured according to a novel lightweight ontology built on OWL (Ontology Web Language) known as TITERIA (Touristic Information of TEruel for Intelligent Agents). Our proposal which combines TITERIA with the Maxine platform is capable of responding appropriately to the users thanks to its Artificial Intelligence Modeling Language (AIML) database and the AI techniques added to Maxine. Preliminary results indicate that our prototype is able to inform users about interesting topics as well as to propose other related information allowing them to acquire a complete information about any issue. Furthermore users can directly talk with an artificial actor making communication much more natural and closer.;2017
The use of expressive Virtual Characters is an effective complementary means of communication for social networks offering multi-user 3D-chatting environment. In such contexts the facial expression channel offers a rich medium to translate the ongoing emotions conveyed by the text-based exchanges. However until recently only purely symmetric facial expressions have been considered for that purpose. In this article we examine human sensitivity to facial asymmetry in the expression of both basic and complex emotions. The rationale for introducing asymmetry in the display of facial expressions stems from two well-established observations in cognitive neuroscience: first that the expression of basic emotions generally displays a small asymmetry second that more complex emotions such as ambivalent feeling may reflect in the partial display of different potentially opposite emotions on each side of the face. A frequent occurrence of this second case results from the conflict between the truly felt emotion and the one that should be displayed due to social conventions. Our main hypothesis is that a much larger expressive and emotional space can only be automatically synthesized by means of facial asymmetry when modeling emotions with a general Valence-Arousal-Dominance dimensional approach. Besides we want also to explore the general human sensitivity to the introduction of a small degree of asymmetry into the expression of basic emotions. We conducted an experiment by presenting 64 pairs of static facial expressions one symmetric and one asymmetric illustrating eight emotions (three basic and five complex ones) alternatively for a male and a female character. Each emotion was presented four times by swapping the symmetric and asymmetric positions and by mirroring the asymmetrical expression. Participants were asked to grade on a continuous scale the correctness of each facial expression with respect to a short definition. Results confirm the potential of introducing facial asymmetry for a subset of the complex emotions. Guidelines are proposed for designers of embodied conversational agent and emotionally reflective avatars.;2017
There is growing conviction that the future of computing depends on our ability to exploit big data on the Web to enhance intelligent systems. This includes encyclopedic knowledge for factual details common sense for human-like reasoning and natural language generation for smarter communication. With recent chatbots conceivably at the verge of passing the Turing Test there are calls for more common sense oriented alternatives e.g. the Winograd Schema Challenge. The Aristo QA system demonstrates the lack of common sense in current systems in answering fourth-grade science exam questions. On the language generation front despite the progress in deep learning current models are easily confused by subtle distinctions that may require linguistic common sense e.g.quick food vs. fast food. These issues bear on tasks such as machine translation and should be addressed using common sense acquired from text. Mining common sense from massive amounts of data and applying it in intelligent systems in several respects appears to be the next frontier in computing. Our brief overview of the state of Commonsense Knowledge (CSK) in Machine Intelligence provides insights into CSK acquisition CSK in natural language applications of CSK and discussion of open issues. This paper provides a report of a tutorial at a recent conference with a brief survey of topics.;2017
This article aims to assess multiple issues of resources staffing local opinion data quality cost and security while transitioning to electronic data collection (EDC) at a long-running community research site in northern Malawi. Levels of missing and error fields delay from data collection to availability and average number of interviews per day were compared between EDC and paper in a complex repeated annual household survey. Three focus groups with field and data staff with experience using both methods and in-depth interviews with participants were carried out. Cost for each method were estimated and compared. Missing data was more common on paper questionnaires than on EDC and a similar number were carried out per day. Fieldworkers generally preferred EDC but data staff feared for their employment. Most respondents had no strong preference for a method. The cost of the paper system was estimated to be higher than using EDC. The existing infrastructure and technical expertise could be adapted to using EDC but changes have an impact on data processing jobs as fewer and better qualified staff are required. EDC is cost-effective and for a long-running site may offer further savings as devices can be used in multiple studies and perform several other functions. EDC is accepted by fieldworkers and respondents has good levels of quality and timeliness and security can be maintained. EDC is well-suited for use in a well-established research site using and developing existing infrastructure and expertise.;2017
This article describes conversation-based assessments with computer agents that interact with humans through chat talking heads or embodied animated avatars. Some of these agents perform actions interact with multimedia hold conversations with humans in natural language and adaptively respond to a person's actions verbal contributions and emotions. Data are logged throughout the interactions in order to assess the individual's mastery of subject matters skills and proficiencies on both cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. There are different agent-based designs that focus on learning and assessment. Dialogues occur between one agent and one human as in the case of intelligent tutoring systems. Three-party conversations called trialogues involve two agents interacting with a human. The two agents can take on different roles (such as tutors and peers) model actions and social interactions stage arguments solicit help from the human and collaboratively solve problems. Examples of assessment with these agent-based environments are presented in the context of intelligent tutoring educational games and interventions to help struggling adult readers. Most of these involve assessment at varying grain sizes to guide the intelligent interaction but conversation-based assessment with agents is also currently being used in high stakes assessments.

This paper considers identification and estimation of a general model for online price competition. We show that when the number of competing firms is unknown the underlying parameters of the model can still be identified and estimated employing recently developed results on measurement errors. We illustrate our methodology using UK data for personal digital assistants and employ the estimates to simulate competitive effects. Our results reveal that heightened competition has differential effects on the prices paid by different consumer segments. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;2017
This paper deals with the relevance of the first impression of interactive systems based on short passive visual/auditory stimuli of system output. Individual consistency between such impressions and retrospective user ratings obtained directly after real interaction is studied in four exploratory experiments. All systems allow for voice user input. Two systems are considered to be multimodal as they support additional input other than speech (e.g. gesture) whereas the other two systems offering speech as the sole input modality are multimedia systems. The first impression of the four systems is based on screen-shots of typical display views and selected prompts of the systems' speech output. Measures used here were pragmatic quality (i.e. the functional aspects of a system such as efficiency and effectiveness that are closely related to the concept of usability) and hedonic qualities (i.e. the systems non-instrumental aspects such as its ability to provide stimulation and identification-to evoke the psychological well-being of the user. It was tested whether consistency found for web-sites can also be found for speech-based systems. In our case this consistency was assessed not between systems but within systems. Results indicate that users' first impression of system output does correlate with ratings collected after the interaction for each of the four systems. For the two truly multimodal systems ratings after single input (e.g. only voice only touch screen) also correlates with ratings of a multimodal interaction with the same system. This result confirms data from literature. However our assumption of lower correlations for the first impression of pragmatic quality expected due to its experience-based character is not supported. Instead pragmatic quality seems to represent a construct with low consistency in general. Reasons for this might be found in the benefit of pragmatic quality experienced during multimodal interaction that is neither covered by unimodal interaction nor predictable from a first impression. Additional multiple regression analysis for the two systems with multiple input modalities show that the first impression of the visual system output can complement predictors from the single modality interactions to model post-usage multimodal ratings. However which of the output channels has a relevant impact was found to be highly system dependent.;2017
This paper discusses the development of an emotion model for robot partner system. In our previous studies we have focused only on the robot's emotional state. However the emotional state of the other party is also an important factor for smooth conversation in human society. Therefore the robot partner has two emotional structures for human: empathy and robot emotion. First human empathy uses a perceptual based emotion model to know the human's emotional state based on the sensory information. Next we propose a recurrent simple spike response model to improve the robot's emotional model and we apply Hebbian-LMS learning to modify the weights in the spiking neural network. The robot's emotional state is calculated by using the human's emotional information internal and external information. The robot partner can use the emotional results to control the facial and gesture expression. The utterance style is also changed by the robot's emotional state. As a result the robot partner can interact emotionally and naturally with human. First we explain the related works and the development of the robot partner iPhonoid-C. Next we define the architecture of the emotional model to realize emotional empathy towards human. Then we discuss the algorithms and the methods for developing the emotional model. Finally we show experimental results of the proposed method and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed structure.;2017
This paper is in continuation of our previous published work in which effect of user's body is studied for quad band diversity antenna. The antenna has been successfully designed and studied in the free space. In this study three kinds of user effects on previously proposed antenna are considered namely Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) head and PDA hand (Talk mode) Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) hand (Data mode) and Dual hands (Read mode). There are two different positions of the quad band antenna over mobile circuit board is considered i.e. antenna at top position and bottom position of mobile circuit board. In the user proximity the optimal location of antenna over circuit board is chosen for real application based on the antenna performance parameters i.e. S-parameters diversity performances and radiation performances. The specific absorption rate (SAR) for American standard (1.6 W/kg average over 1 g tissues) and European standard (2 W/kg average over 10 g tissues) is calculated for the top and bottom position of the MIMO antenna elements and it is found that the values of SAR is well below the standard limit of FCC as well as European standard. Based on the study it is found that antenna at top position of mobile circuit board shows overall better performance in the presence of user's body.;2017
This paper presents a system to detect multiple intents (MIs) in an input sentence when only single-intent (SI)-labeled training data are available. To solve the problem this paper categorizes input sentences into three types and uses a two-stage approach in which each stage attempts to detect MIs in different types of sentences. In the first stage the system generates MI hypotheses based on conjunctions in the input sentence then evaluates the hypotheses and then selects the best one that satisfies specified conditions. In the second stage the system applies sequence labeling to mark intents on the input sentence. The sequence labeling model is trained based on SI-labeled training data. In experiments the proposed two-stage MI detection method reduced errors for written and spoken input by 20.54 and 17.34 % respectively.;2017
This paper presents GRASS (Graz corpus of Read and Spontaneous Speech) the first large scale speech database for Austrian German with both read and conversational speech. In total the corpus contains approximately 1900 min of speech in which 38 speakers produced more than 220000 word tokens from 14593 different word types. The corpus consists of three components. First the Conversational Speech Component contains free conversations of one hour length between friends colleagues couples or family members. Second the Commands Component contains commands and keywords which were either read or elicited by pictures. Third the Read Speech Component contains phonetically balanced sentences and digits. The speech of all components has been recorded at fullband quality in a soundproof recording-studio with head-mounted microphones large diaphragm microphones a laryngograph and with a video camera. The corpus was fully annotated at the orthographic level and partly also at the segmental sub-segmental and prosodic level. Our analysis of conversational speech characteristics such as overlapping speech laughter repetitions hesitations and the use of colloquial and dialectal words allows us to conclude that the conversational speech material is highly casual in nature. The collected corpus provides conversational material for phoneticians and linguists interested in topics specific for Austrian German (e.g. pronunciation variability prosody syntax of spoken Austrian German) and for those studying talk in interaction in general (turn-taking grounding entrainment extra-linguistic factors etc.). Furthermore it is a valuable resource for speech technologists interested in the development of ASR and dialogue systems for different speaking styles of Austrian German.;2017
This paper proposes a new approach to automatically detect dementia. Even though some works have detected dementia from speech and language attributes most have applied detection using picture descriptions narratives and cognitive tasks. In this paper we propose a new computer avatar with spoken dialog functionalities that produces spoken queries based on the mini-mental state examination the Wechsler memory scale-revised and other related neuropsychological questions. We recorded the interactive data of spoken dialogues from 29 participants (14 dementia and 15 healthy controls) and extracted various audiovisual features. We tried to predict dementia using audiovisual features and two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and logistic regression). Here we show that the support vector machines outperformed logistic regression and by using the extracted features they classified the participants into two groups with 0.93 detection performance as measured by the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also newly identified some contributing features e.g. gap before speaking the variations of fundamental frequency voice quality and the ratio of smiling. We concluded that our system has the potential to detect dementia through spoken dialog systems and that the system can assist health care workers. In addition these findings could help medical personnel detect signs of dementia.;2017
This research presents two studies in a lab (eye-tracking) and in a natural context that highlight the effects of interacting with an animated conversational agents (ACA) on the objective and perceived econsumer productivity. Results from Study 1 specify that only objective e-consumer productivity depends on interaction with the ACA. Going further Study 2 then reveals that individual characteristics affect perceived productivity either independently from ACA use (for involvement or product familiarity) or in interaction with using the ACA (for Internet skills and need for interaction). These findings highlight the need to personalize websites that display an agent fitting user profiles. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.;2017
This study investigates how user satisfaction and intention to use for an interactive movie recommendation system is determined by communication variables and relationship between conversational agent and user. By adopting the Computers-Are-Social-Actors (CASA) paradigm and uncertainty reduction theory this study examines the influence of self-disclosure and reciprocity as key communication variables on user satisfaction. A two-way ANOVA test was conducted to analyze the effects of self-disclosure and reciprocity on user satisfaction with a conversational agent. The interactional effect of self-disclosure and reciprocity on user satisfaction was not significant but the main effects proved to be both significant. PLS analysis results showed that perceived trust and interactional enjoyment are significant mediators in the relationship between communication variables and user satisfaction. In addition reciprocity is a stronger variable than self-disclosure in predicting relationship building between an agent and a user. Finally user satisfaction is an influential factor of intention to use. These findings have implications from both practical and theoretical perspective.;2017
This study was conducted with medical students physicians patients and carers in a paediatric and an adult hospital to determine use of mobile devices for learning and beliefs and attitudes about others' use. Awareness of ethical patient privacy and data security concerns was explored. The research was conducted using a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design through survey and focus groups for students and physicians and a separate survey for patients and carers. Each arm of the study was analysed individually followed by integration of quantitative and qualitative data which are the subject of this paper. Interpretation of the integrated student and physician quantitative data highlighted that both groups used mobile devices for information verification organisation and communication and these represented the best uses of mobile devices the worst aspects of mobile devices involved Internet access difficulties. Interpretation of the integrated student and physician qualitative data highlighted that students and physicians made individual decisions about their use of mobile devices despite some existing policies. Integration of all data from all arms of the study identified the benefits of using mobile devices and concerns about distraction. For many students and physicians the benefits of using mobile devices for learning at the patient bedside outweigh the possible risks. As society grapples with norms governing appropriate use of mobile devices many are devising their own rules to aid learning in clinical settings.;2017
To ensure satisfactory user experience dialog systems must be able to determine whether an input sentence is in-domain (ID) or out-of-domain (OOD). We assume that only ID sentences are available as training data because collecting enough OOD sentences in an unbiased way is a laborious and time-consuming job. This paper proposes a novel neural sentence embedding method that represents sentences in a low dimensional continuous vector space that emphasizes aspects that distinguish ID cases from OOD cases. We first used a large set of unlabeled text to pre-train word representations that are used to initialize neural sentence embedding. Then we used domain-category analysis as an auxiliary task to train neural sentence embedding for OOD sentence detection. After the sentence representations were learned we used them to train an autoencoder aimed at OOD sentence detection. We evaluated our method by experimentally comparing it to the state-of-the-art methods in an eight-domain dialog system our proposed method achieved the highest accuracy in all tests.

To investigate whether in-the-moment diary reports of daily experience taken collectively are a valid representation of health-related quality of life (HRQL). A total of 35 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) were recruited through four neuromuscular care providers across Australia. Participants completed the PedsQL (TM) Generic Core scales and one week of experience-sampling diary reporting on a personal digital assistant. Rasch analysis was undertaken on the diary data to derive a single valid measure score. The resulting measure score for each participant was correlated with the summary score from the PedsQL (TM) Generic Core scales to examine whether daily experience was representative of HRQL. The daily diary method showed good metric properties with adequate goodness of fit for data from items and participants suggesting unidimensionality of the construct: quality of everyday experience. The correlation of the daily diary measure score with overall PedsQL (TM) summary score showed moderate agreement (r = .60 p = 0.001). The benefits of measuring daily quality of life include detailed descriptions of day-to-day experiences of children without the need for retrospective recall. Diary methods on an electronic platform or software application for personal devices may be a useful tool to understand HRQL as the repeated measures data provide a detailed experience directly from the child and the platform makes data completion highly motivating.;2017
Uneven workload distributions in teams can lead to suboptimal team performance. This paper therefore describes the design of a virtual assistant that supports workload harmonization in teams by measuring workload informing team members about their own and other team members' workload and supporting team members in the redistribution of workload. The virtual assistant was developed in the context of train traffic control according to the situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) methodology which was extended to allow for a value sensitive design process. More specifically the values 'insight' 'helping others' and 'privacy' were explicitly accounted for throughout the design of the virtual assistant. A prototype of the virtual assistant was evaluated positively in a focus group. Thereby the contribution of the paper is twofold. First an improvement in a human-centered development methodology-sCE with values-is described and its use is demonstrated in an actual design case. Second a novel positively evaluated solution for workload harmonization in teams is presented.;2017
Until now the virtual assistants (like Siri Google Now and Cortana) have primarily been confined to voice input and output only. Is there a justification for voice only confinement or can we enhance the user experience by adding a visual output? We hypothesized that providing a higher level of visual/auditory immersion would enhance the quality of user experience. In order to test this hypothesis we first developed 4 variants of virtual assistant each with a different audio/visual level of immersion. Developed virtual assistant systems were the following audio only audio and 2D visual display audio and 3D visual display and audio and immersive 3D visual display. We developed a plan for usability testing of all 4 variants. The usability testing was conducted with 30 subjects against eight (8) dependent variables included presence involvement attention reliability dependency easiness satisfaction and expectations. Each subject rated these dependent variables based on a scale of 1-5 5 being the highest value. The raw data collected from usability testing was then analyzed through several tools in order to determine the factors contributing towards the quality of experience for each of the 4 variants. The significant factors were then used develop a model that measures the quality of user experience. It was found that each variant had a different set of significant variables. Hence in order to rate each system there is a need to develop a scale that is dependent upon the unique set of variables for the respective variant. Furthermore it was found that variant 4 scored the highest rate for Quality of Experience (QoE). Lastly several other qualitative conclusions were also drawn from this research that will guide future work in the field of virtual assistants.;2017
We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature to establish the evidence base for using visual activity schedules (VAS) with individuals with intellectual disability. Literature published after 2005 was evaluated for quality using the criteria developed by Horner et al. a total of 14 studies were included as acceptable. Findings suggest that VAS is an evidence-based practice for teaching a variety of daily living navigation vocational recreation and academic skills to adolescents and adults with intellectual disability. Results also show increases in independence and on-task behaviors. We conclude the article by discussing limitations and recommendations for future research.;2017
We hypothesize that conversational implicatures are a rich source of clarification requests and in this paper we do two things. First we motivate the hypothesis in theoretical practical and empirical terms and formulate it as a concrete clarification potential principle: implicatures may become explicit as fourth-level clarification requests. Second we present a framework for generating the clarification potential of an instruction by inferring its conversational implicatures with respect to a particular context. We evaluate the framework and illustrate its performance using a human human corpus of situated conversations. Much of the inference required can be handled using classical planning though as we shall note other forms of means-ends analysis are also required. Our framework leads us to view discourse structure as emerging via opportunistic responses to task structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2017
We reviewed literature from 2007 to 2016 (March) on mobile language learning in authentic environments. We aimed to understand publications' trend research focus technology used methodology and current issues. Our results showed that there was increasing trend in the publications. Students' perceptions towards mobile learning technologies and language proficiency were the most common research topics. The most frequently used technologies were smartphones mobile phones and personal digital assistants whereas the most common target language was English as a foreign language. In addition university and elementary school students were the most common participants. We found that learning activities in most studies were carried out in classroom and specified locations outside of campus. Authentic learning environments in most studies were familiar to students and learning activities were designed using instructor-centered approach. Most studies collected and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data. We also discovered some issues associated with earlier studies e.g. many studies did not focus on applying newly learned knowledge by students to solve their real-life problems or recently developed intelligent technologies for language learning were overlooked. Based on our results we discuss some implications and make suggestions over mobile language learning in authentic environments for the educators and researchers.;2017
When consumers post questions online who influences the content of the discussion more: the consumer posting the question or those who respond to the post? Analyses of data from real online discussion forums and four experiments show that early responses to a post tend to drive the content of the discussion as much as or more than the content of the initial query. Although advice seekers posting to online discussion forums often explicitly tell respondents which attributes are most important to them the authors demonstrate that one common online posting goal affiliation makes respondents more likely to repeat attributes mentioned by previous respondents even if those attributes are less important to the advice seeker or support a suboptimal choice given the advice seeker's decision criteria. Firms listening in on social media should account for this systematic bias when making decisions on the basis of the discussion content.;2017
While physical inactivity is a key risk factor for a range of chronic diseases and conditions associated with aging a significant proportion of midlife and older adults remain insufficiently active. This is particularly true for ethnic minority populations such as Latino adults for whom few culturally adapted programs have been developed and tested. The major objective of this 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial is to test the comparative effectiveness of two linguistically and culturally adapted community-based physical activity interventions with the potential for broad reach and translation. Ten local community centers serving a sizable number of Latino residents were randomized to receive one of two physical activity interventions. The Virtual Advisor program employs a computer-based embodied conversational agent named Carmen to deliver interactive individually tailored physical activity advice and support. A similar intervention program is delivered by trained Peer Advisors. The target population consists of generally healthy insufficiently active Latino adults ages 50 years and older living within proximity to a designated community center. The major outcomes are changes in walking and other forms of physical activity measured via self-report and accelerometry. Secondary outcomes include physical function and well-being variables. In addition to these outcome analyses comparative cost analysis of the two programs potential mediators of intervention success and baseline moderators of intervention effects will be explored to better determine which subgroups do best with which type of intervention. Here we present the study design and methods including recruitment strategies and yield as well as study baseline characteristics.;2017
While prior research has examined the effects of interactive e-commerce avatars that simulate the roles of virtual assistants and recommender agents there is lack of empirical study that investigates the effects of non-interactive talking avatars in e-commerce. This is unfortunate as many websites today utilize non-interactive talking avatars that provide one-way dialogue in the forms of greetings introduction of the company and description of products and services offered. To bridge this gap our study aims to investigate the effects of non-interactive talking avatar on perceptions of social presence credibility website trust and patronage intention in an online store. Comparing between the experimental (website with avatar) and control (website without avatar) conditions the experimental results showed that perceived social presence was significantly enhanced by the presence of the non-interactive talking avatar. Furthermore the presence of the avatar had positive effects on website trust and patronage intention among male participants but had negative effects on perceptions of information credibility and website patronage intention among females. Analysis based on participants' comments suggests that females were more critical towards certain shortcomings of the non-interactive talking avatar citing limited interactivity and artificial dialogue from text-to-speech engine. Additionally the comment analysis suggests that females preferred processing textual over auditory information (as spoken by the avatar) about the products in the online store. Theoretical and managerial implications related to non-interactive talking avatars are discussed in this paper.;2017
With the exponential growth in computing power and progress in speech recognition technology spoken dialog systems (SDSs) with which a user interacts through natural speech has been widely used in human-computer interaction. However error-prone automatic speech recognition (ASR) results usually lead to inappropriate semantic interpretation so that miscommunication happens easily. This paper presents an approach to error-aware dialog state (DS) detection for robust miscommunication handling in an SDS. Non-understanding (Non-U) and misunderstanding (Mis-U) are considered for miscommunication handling in this study. First understanding evidence (UE) derived from the recognition confidence is adopted for Non-U detection followed by Non-U recovery. For Mis-U with the recognized sentence containing uncertain recognized words the partial sentences obtained by removing potentially misrecognized words from the input utterance are organized based on regular expressions as a tree structure to tolerate the deletion or rejection of keywords resulting from misrecognition for Mis-U DS modeling. Latent semantic analysis is then employed to consider the verified words and their n-grams for DS detection including Mis-U and predefined Base DSs. Historical information-based n-grams are employed to find the most likely DS for the SDS. Several experiments were performed with a dialog corpus for the restaurant reservation task. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved a promising performance for Non-U recovery and Mis-U repair as well as a satisfactory task success rate for the dialogs using the proposed method.;2017
Working in an interdisciplinary manner at the crossroads of alcohol and HIV research is a challenge. This paper presents six novel approaches that could be applied to activities at the intersection of alcohol and HIV. These approaches are (i) address the fact that the availability of new technology is unevenly distributed around the world (ii) use technology to move beyond both paper and digital surveys (iii) introduce a focus on advocacy and partnerships with large technology companies (iv) harness technological innovation to utilise digital counselling (v) explore the use of virtual reality in both research and delivering interventions and (vi) consider alternative funding models to those currently in existence to improve efficiencies and innovations. Aiming to understand the interplay of alcohol and HIV will require creativity. The six approaches outlines in this paper provide possible directions from which new approaches may emerge.;2017
A chatbot is an example of a text-based conversational agent. While natural language understanding and machine learning techniques have advanced rapidly current fully automated chatbots still struggle to serve their users well. Human intelligence brought by crowd workers freelancers or even full-time employees can be embodied in the chatbot logic to fill the gaps caused by limitations of fully automated solutions. In this paper we investigate human-aided bots i.e. bots (including chatbots) using humans in the loop to operate. We survey industrial and academic examples of human-aided bots discuss their differences and common patterns and identify open research questions.;2018
A constant voltage AC-DC converter based on digital assistant technology is proposed in this paper which has rapid dynamic response capability. The converter operates in the PFM (Pulse Frequency Modulation) mode. According to the load state the compensation current produced by the digital compensation module was injected into the CS pin to adjust the switching pulse width dynamically and improve the dynamic response. The control chip is implemented based on NEC 1 mu m 5V/40V HVCMOS process. A 5V/1.2A prototype has been built to verify the proposed control method. When the load jumps from idle to heavy the undershoot time is only 7.4ms.;2018
A dialogue system should capture speakers' intentions which can be represented by combinations of speech acts predicators and sentiments. To identify these intentions from speakers' utterances many studies have independently dealt with speech acts predicators and sentiments. However these three elements composing speakers' intentions are tightly associated with each other. To resolve this problem we propose a convolutional neural network model that simultaneously identifies speech acts predicators and sentiments. The proposed model has well-designed hidden layers for embedding informative abstractions appropriate for speech act identification predicator identification and sentiment identification. Nodes in the hidden layers are partially trained by three cycles of error backpropagation: training the nodes associated with speech act identification predicator identification and sentiment identification. In the experiments the proposed model showed higher F1-scores than independent models: 6.8% higher in speech act identification 6.2% higher in predicator identification and 4.9% higher in sentiment identification. Based on the experimental results we conclude that the proposed integration architecture and partial error backpropagation can help to increase the performance of intention identification.

After much debate and synthesis social learning scholarship is entering an era of empirical research. Given the range across individual- network- and systems-level perspectives and scales clear documentation of social learning processes is critical for making claims about social learning outcomes and their impacts. Past studies have relied on participant recall and concept maps to document perceptions of social learning process and outcome. Using an individual-centric perspective and importing ideas from communication and psychology on question-answer learning through conversational agents we contribute an expanded conceptual framework and qualitative analytical strategy for assessing stakeholder dialogue for evidence of social learning. We observed stakeholder dialogue across five workshops coordinated for the Bruneau-Owyhee Sage-Grouse Habitat Project (BOSH) in Owyhee County Idaho USA. Participants' dialogue was audio recorded transcribed and analyzed for cross-case patterns. Deductive and inductive coding techniques were applied to illuminate cognitive relational and epistemic dimensions of learning and topics of learning. A key finding supports our inclusion of the epistemic dimension and highlights a need for future research: although some participants articulated epistemic positions they did not challenge each other to share sources or justify factual claims. These findings align with previous research suggesting that in addition to considering diversity and representation (who is at the table) we should pay more attention to how participants talk perhaps prompting specific patterns of speech as we endeavor to draw causal connections between social learning processes and outcomes.;2018
Agri-food companies operating in the packaging storage and distribution of fruit and vegetables need to be provided with information systems able to meet the requirements imposed by the current European regulations in terms of traceability. This paper evaluates the benefits and drawbacks of a semi-automated information management tracking system for a warehouse specialised in the fruit market. It is targeted to small and medium-sized companies with limited financial means for investments and without technical support in their premises. These requirements are met by using a personal digital assistant (PDA) equipped with an radio frequency identification (RFID) reader: the information collected throughout the production process are locally stored in the PDA and occasionally sent to a server. In this way the proposed system does not rely neither on a widespread wireless network nor on fixed RFID readers which can increase automation but need more investment and assistance.;2018
Although behavior analysts have at times struggled with self-management as a concept research shows that self-management training has been an effective means of promoting independence for individuals with disabilities across ages settings and target behaviors. This paper explores the philosophical concerns with self-management as a behavioral intervention and provides answers to these objections. A review of selected self management procedures including audio cues tactile prompting devices video modeling and personal digital assistants is presented. Particular attention is paid to the development of more sophisticated self-management procedures as technology has improved over time with suggestions for future directions based on access to continued improvements in available technology.

As chatbots have become increasingly popular over the past years most social networking sites have recognized their far-reaching potential for commercial purposes. Their rapid and widespread usage warrants a better understanding. This study examines the effectiveness of chatbots on Facebook for brands. The study proposes and tests a model based on the Consumer Acceptance of Technology model (CAT-model) including three cognitive (i.e. perceived usefulness perceived ease-of-use and perceived helpfulness) and three affective (pleasure arousal and dominance PAD-dimensions) determinants that potentially influence consumers' attitude toward brands providing a chatbot and hence their likelihood to use and recommend the chatbot (i.e. patronage intention). Structural equation modeling analyses show that two cognitive (i.e. perceived usefulness and perceived helpfulness) and all three affective predictors are positively related to consumers' attitude toward the chatbot brand. The findings further indicate that attitude toward the brand explained a significant amount of variation in consumers' patronage intention. Finally all the significant determinants also have an indirect effect on patronage intention mediated through attitude toward the brand. In conclusion our findings hold valuable practical implications as well as relevant suggestions for future research.;2018
As genetic testing gains ground in medicine the ability to search across the suite of biomedical and clinical care databases offered through the National Library of Medicine/National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)-such as PubMed GENE Structure the Genetic Testing Registry and others-holds the potential to enhance quality of clinical care best practices. Plutchik is a voice-enabled embodied artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that can perform highly technical medical searches in and across the NCBI suite of databases.;2018
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are obstructive respiratory diseases that affect negatively the quality of life for patients and their families worldwide. Despite the significance of these diseases their management has been considered suboptimal around the world whereas the improper inhaler use has been underlined as one of the main causes. Toward this direction this paper presents an integrated mHealth system that provides real-time personalized feedback to patients for assessing the proper medication use and educating them and helping them avoid common mistakes. The identification of proper inhaler use is based on conventional and data-driven feature extraction and classification methods employed for the identification of four events (inhaler actuation inhalation exhalation and background noise). The proposed scheme reaches 98% classification accuracy significantly outperforming recent and relevant state-of-the-art approaches. Finally intuitive feedback interfaces were implemented in the form of a virtual guidance agent integrated with the mobile application which can help patients follow their action plan and assess their inhaler technique in a more engaging manner. Extensive simulation studies carried out using 12 subjects demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approaches in both indoor and outdoor environments.;2018
Automatic chatbots (also known as chat-agents) have attracted much attention from both researching and industrial fields. Generally the semantic relevance between users' queries and the corresponding responses is considered as the essential element for conversation modeling in both generation and ranking based chat systems. By contrast it is a nontrivial task to adopt the users' information such as preference social role etc. into conversational models reasonably while users' profiles play a significant role in the procedure of conversations by providing the implicit contexts. This paper aims to address the personalized response ranking task by incorporating user profiles into the conversation model. In our approach users' personalized representations are latently learned from the contents posted by them via a two-branch neural network. After that a deep neural network architecture is further presented to learn the fusion representation of posts responses and personal information. In this way the proposed model could understand conversations from the users' perspective hence the more appropriate responses are selected for a specified person. The experimental results on two datasets from social network services demonstrate that our approach is hopeful to represent users' personal information implicitly based on user generated contents and it is promising to perform as an important component in chatbots to select the personalized responses for each user.;2018
Background: A World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel long waiting times perceived stigma and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled empathetic and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled empathetic text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app Wysa on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app engaged in text-based messaging and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie high vs low users n=108 and n=21 respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]) Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.;2018
Background: Conversational agents cannot yet express empathy in nuanced ways that account for the unique circumstances of the user. Agents that possess this faculty could be used to enhance digital mental health interventions. Objective: We sought to design a conversational agent that could express empathic support in ways that might approach or even match human capabilities. Another aim was to assess how users might appraise such a system. Methods: Our system used a corpus-based approach to simulate expressed empathy. Responses from an existing pool of online peer support data were repurposed by the agent and presented to the user. Information retrieval techniques and word embeddings were used to select historical responses that best matched a user's concerns. We collected ratings from 37169 users to evaluate the system. Additionally we conducted a controlled experiment (N=1284) to test whether the alleged source of a response (human or machine) might change user perceptions. Results: The majority of responses created by the agent (2986/3770 79.20%) were deemed acceptable by users. However users significantly preferred the efforts of their peers (P<.001). This effect was maintained in a controlled study (P=.02) even when the only difference in responses was whether they were framed as coming from a human or a machine. Conclusions: Our system illustrates a novel way for machines to construct nuanced and personalized empathic utterances. However the design had significant limitations and further research is needed to make this approach viable. Our controlled study suggests that even in ideal conditions nonhuman agents may struggle to express empathy as well as humans. The ethical implications of empathic agents as well as their potential iatrogenic effects are also discussed.;2018
Background: Conversational assistants such as Siri Alexa and Google Assistant are ubiquitous and are beginning to be used as portals for medical services. However the potential safety issues of using conversational assistants for medical information by patients and consumers are not understood. Objective: To determine the prevalence and nature of the harm that could result from patients or consumers using conversational assistants for medical information. Methods: Participants were given medical problems to pose to Siri Alexa or Google Assistant and asked to determine an action to take based on information from the system. Assignment of tasks and systems were randomized across participants and participants queried the conversational assistants in their own words making as many attempts as needed until they either reported an action to take or gave up. Participant-reported actions for each medical task were rated for patient harm using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality harm scale. Results: Fifty-four subjects completed the study with a mean age of 42 years (SD 18). Twenty-nine (54%) were female 31 (57%) Caucasian and 26 (50%) were college educated. Only 8 (15%) reported using a conversational assistant regularly while 22 (41%) had never used one and 24 (44%) had tried one  a few times. Forty-four (82%) used computers regularly. Subjects were only able to complete 168 (43%) of their 394 tasks. Of these 49 (29%) reported actions that could have resulted in some degree of patient harm including 27 (16%) that could have resulted in death. Conclusions: Reliance on conversational assistants for actionable medical information represents a safety risk for patients and consumers. Patients should be cautioned to not use these technologies for answers to medical questions they intend to act on without further consultation from a health care provider.;2018
Background: Currently the eHealth field calls for detailed descriptions of theory-based interventions in order to support improved design of such interventions. This article aims to provide a systematic description of the design rationale behind an interactive web-based tailored intervention promoting HPV-vaccination acceptability. Methods: The 6-step Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to describe the design rationale. After the needs assessment in Step 1 intervention objectives were formulated in Step 2. In Step 3 we translated theoretical methods into practical applications which were integrated into a coherent intervention in Step 4. In Step 5 we anticipated future implementation and adoption and finally an evaluation plan was generated in Step 6. Results: Walking through the various steps of IM resulted in a detailed description of the intervention. The needs assessment indicated HPV-vaccination uptake remaining lower than expected. Mothers play the most important role in decision-making about their daughter's immunization. However they generally feel ambivalent after they made their decisions and their decisions are based on rather unstable grounds. Therefore intervention objectives were to improve HPV-vaccination uptake and informed decision-making and to decrease decisional conflict among mothers of invited girls. Computer-tailoring was chosen as the main method virtual assistants were chosen as a practical application to deliver interactive tailored feedback. To maximize compatibility with the needs of the target group a user-centered design strategy by means of focus groups and online experiments was applied. In these prototypes were tested and sequentially refined. Finally efficacy effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention were tested in a randomized controlled trial. Results showed a significant positive effect of the intervention on informed decision-making decisional conflict and nearly all determinants of HPV-vaccination uptake (P < 0.001). Mothers evaluated the intervention as highly positive. Discussion: Using IM led to an innovative effective intervention for promoting HPVvaccination acceptability. The intervention maps will aid in interpreting the results of our evaluation studies. Moreover it will ease the comparison of design rationales across interventions and may provide leads for the development of other eHealth interventions. This paper adds to the plea for systematic reporting of design rationales constituting the process of developing interventions.;2018
Background: Disease-related malnutrition is a common challenge among hospitalized patients. There seems to be a lack of an effective system to follow-up nutritional monitoring and treatment of patients at nutritional risk after risk assessment. We identify a need for a more standardized system to prevent and treat disease-related malnutrition. Objective: We aimed to develop a dietary assessment app for tablets for use in a hospital setting and to evaluate the app's ability to measure individual intake of energy protein liquid and food and beverage items among hospitalized patients for two days. We also aimed to measure patients' experiences using the app. Methods: We have developed the MyFood app which consists of three modules: 1) collection of information about the patient 2) dietary assessment function and 3) evaluation of recorded intake compared to individual needs. We used observations from digital photography of the meals combined with partial weighing of the meal components as a reference method to evaluate the app's dietary assessment system for two days. Differences in the intake estimations of energy protein liquid and food and beverage items between MyFood and the photograph method were analyzed on both group and individual level. Results: Thirty-two patients hospitalized at Oslo University Hospital were included in the study. The data collection period ran from March to May 2017. About half of the patients had >= 90% agreement between MyFood and the photograph method for energy protein and liquid intake on both recording days. Dinner was the meal with the lowest percent agreement between methods. MyFood overestimated patients' intake of bread and cereals and underestimated fruit consumption. Agreement between methods increased from day 1 to day 2 for bread and cereals spreads egg yogurt soup hot dishes and desserts. Ninety percent of participants reported that MyFood was easy to use and 97% found the app easy to navigate. Conclusions: We developed the MyFood app as a tool to monitor dietary intake among hospitalized patients at nutritional risk. The recorded intake of energy protein and liquid using MyFood showed good agreement with the photograph method for the majority of participants. The app's ability to estimate intake within food groups was good except for bread and cereals which were overestimated and fruits which were underestimated. The app was well accepted among study participants and has the potential to be a dietary assessment tool for use among patients in clinical practice.;2018
Background: Healthcare services particularly in patient-provider interaction often involve highly emotional situations and it is important for physicians to understand and respond to their patients' emotions to best ensure their well-being. Methods: In order to model the emotion domain we have created the Visualized Emotion Ontology (VEO) to provide a semantic definition of 25 emotions based on established models as well as visual representations of emotions utilizing shapes lines and colors. Results: As determined by ontology evaluation metrics VEO exhibited bettermachine-readability (z = 1.12) linguistic quality (z = 0.61) and domain coverage (z = 0.39) compared to a sample of cognitive ontologies. Additionally a survey of 1082 participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk revealed that a significantly higher proportion of people agree than disagree with 17 out of our 25 emotion images validating the majority of our visualizations. Conclusion: From the development evaluation and serialization of the VEO we have defined a set of 25 emotions using OWL that linked surveyed visualizations to each emotion. In the future we plan to use the VEO in patient-facing software tools such as embodied conversational agents to enhance interactions between patients and providers in a clinical environment.;2018
Background: Recent years have seen an increase in the use of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy in the area of mental health. Although lower effectiveness and higher dropout rates of unguided than those of guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy remain critical issues not incurring ongoing human clinical resources makes it highly advantageous. Objective: Current research in psychotherapy which acknowledges the importance of therapeutic alliance aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability in terms of mental health of an application that is embodied with a conversational agent. This application was enabled for use as an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy preventative mental health measure. Methods: Analysis of the data from the 191 participants of the experimental group with a mean age of 38.07 (SD 10.75) years and the 263 participants of the control group with a mean age of 38.05 (SD 13.45) years using a 2-way factorial analysis of variance (group x time) was performed. Results: There was a significant main effect (P=.02) and interaction for time on the variable of positive mental health (P=.02) and for the treatment group a significant simple main effect was also found (P=.002). In addition there was a significant main effect (P=.02) and interaction for time on the variable of negative mental health (P=.005) and for the treatment group a significant simple main effect was also found (P=.001). Conclusions: This research can be seen to represent a certain level of evidence for the mental health application developed herein indicating empirically that internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy with the embodied conversational agent can be used in mental health care. In the pilot trial given the issues related to feasibility and acceptability it is necessary to pursue higher quality evidence while continuing to further improve the application based on the findings of the current research.;2018
Background: Self-monitoring is a cornerstone of behavioral lifestyle interventions for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mobile technology has the potential to improve adherence to self-monitoring and patient outcomes. However no study has tested the use of a smartphone to facilitate self-monitoring in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus living in the underserved community. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of and compare preliminary efficacy of a behavioral lifestyle intervention using smartphone- or paper-based self-monitoring of multiple behaviors on weight loss and glycemic control in a sample of overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus living in underserved communities. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a behavioral lifestyle intervention. Overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited from an underserved minority community health center in Houston Texas. They were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: (1) behavior intervention with smartphone-based self-monitoring (2) behavior intervention with paper diary-based self-monitoring and (3) usual care group. Both the mobile and paper groups received a total of 11 face-to-face group sessions in a 6-month intervention. The mobile group received an Android-based smartphone with 2 apps loaded to help them record their diet physical activity weight and blood glucose along with a connected glucometer whereas the paper group used paper diaries for these recordings. Primary outcomes of the study included percentage weight loss and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) changes over 6 months. Results: A total of 26 patients were enrolled: 11 in the mobile group 9 in the paper group and 6 in the control group. We had 92% (24/26) retention rate at 6 months. The sample is predominantly African Americans with an average age of 56.4 years and body mass index of 38.1. Participants lost an average of 2.73% (mobile group) and 0.13% (paper group) weight at 6 months whereas the control group had an average 0.49% weight gain. Their HbA(1c) changed from 8% to 7 % in mobile group 10% to 9% in paper group and maintained at 9% for the control group. We found a significant difference on HbA(1c) at 6 months among the 3 groups (P=.01). We did not find statistical group significance on percentage weight loss (P=.20) and HbA(1c) changes (P=.44) overtime however we found a large effect size of 0.40 for weight loss and a medium effect size of 0.28 for glycemic control. Conclusions: Delivering a simplified behavioral lifestyle intervention using mobile health-based self-monitoring in an underserved community is feasible and acceptable and shows higher preliminary efficacy as compared with paper-based self-monitoring. A full-scale randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm the findings in this pilot study.;2018
Background: Students in need of mental health care face many barriers including cost location availability and stigma. Studies show that computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a less-intensive and more cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although CBT is one of the most effective treatment methods applying an integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment improvement. Integrative psychological artificial intelligence (AI) offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable convenient lasting and secure support grows. Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using an integrative psychological AI Tess to reduce self-identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial 75 participants were recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All participants completed Web-based surveys including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks later (T2). The 2 test groups consisted of 50 participants in total and were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks (n=24) or 4 weeks (n=26). The information-only control group participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) eBook on depression among college students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the study. Results: A sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0% attrition from the test group and less than 1% attrition from the control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years with 70% of participants being female (52/74) mostly Asian (37/74 51%) and white (32/74 41%). Group 1 received unlimited access to Tess with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group 2 received unlimited access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only control group was provided with an electronic link to the NIMH's eBook. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and group 1 such that group 1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03) whereas those in the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found between the control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety whereas the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did impact scores.

Background: Substance use disorders are under-detected and not systematically diagnosed or screened for by primary care. In this study we present the acceptability and validity of an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) designed to screen tobacco and alcohol use disorder in individuals who did not seek medical help for these disorders. Methods: Individuals were included from June 2016 to May 2017 in the Outpatient Sleep Clinic of the University Hospital of Bordeaux. DSM-5 diagnoses of tobacco and alcohol use disorders were assessed by human interviewers. The ECA interview integrated items from the Cigarette Dependence Scale-5 (CDS-5) for tobacco use disorder screening and the Cut Down Annoyed Guilty Eye-opener (CAGE) questionnaire for alcohol use disorder screening. Paper version of CDS-5 and CAGE questionnaires and acceptability questionnaire was also self-administered. Results: Of the 139 participants in the study (mean age 43.0 [SD = 13.7] years) 71 were women and 68 were men. The ECA was well accepted by the patients. Paper self-administered CDS-5 and CAGE scores had a strong agreement with the ECA (p < 0.0001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of the ECA interview showed AUC of 0.97 (95% CI 0.93-1.0) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.69-0.98) for CDS-5 and CAGE respectively with p-value < 0.0001. Conclusions: This ECA was acceptable and valid to screen tobacco or alcohol use disorder among patients not requesting treatment for addiction. The ECA could be used in hospitals and potentially in primary care settings to help clinicians to better screen their patients for alcohol and tobacco use disorders.;2018
BackgroundPersonal digital assistants technology with various functions have been applied in international clinical practice. Great benefits in reducing medical errors and enhancing the efficiency of clinical work have been achieved but little research has investigated nurses' satisfaction with the use of personal digital assistants. AimTo investigate nurses' satisfaction with use of personal digital assistants and to explore the predictors of this. DesignThis is a cross-sectional descriptive study. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey targeting nurses who used personal digital assistants in a comprehensive tertiary hospital in Beijing. ResultsA total of 383 nurses were recruited in this survey in 2015. The total score of nurses' satisfaction with use of personal digital assistants was 238.91 (SD 39.25). Nurses were less satisfied with the function of documentation compared with the function of administering medical orders. The time length of using personal digital assistants academic degree and different departments predicted nurses' satisfaction towards personal digital assistant use (all P<0.05). ConclusionNurses were satisfied with the accuracy of administering medical orders and the safety of recording data. The stability of the wireless network and efficiency related to nursing work were less promising. To some extent nurses with higher education and longer working time with personal digital assistants were more satisfied with them.;2018
Chatbots are computer programs designed to chat with users via text or voice through the use of techniques of Web services data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI). Currently the use of chatbot is becoming an important trend in the field of data science. An increasing number of chatbots are being built on social platforms such as Facebook LINE and Slack. This has led to the development of numerous tools and online platforms for the construction of chatbots however most of these services do not provide comprehensive support for the visual representation and control of conversational flows bi-directional Web service integration or the systematic reuse of conversations. Developing a complex chatbot with external Web services requires the writing of extensive conversation scripts and additional coding. In this paper we propose a visual flow-based approach to the construction of chatbots on the Node-RED platform referred to as FCF (Flow-based Chatbot Framework). This system is based on the newly-devised data format for Webhook thereby allowing bidirectional service integration for software applications. Five chatbot dialogue patterns and three chatbot application scenarios are provided to be components for the construction of complex chatbot applications.;2018
Communities are at risk from extreme events and natural disasters that can lead to dangerous situations for residents. Improving resilience by helping people learn how to better prepare for recover from and adapt to disasters is critical to reduce the impacts of these extreme events. This project presents an intelligent system Flood AI designed to improve societal preparedness for flooding by providing a knowledge engine that uses voice recognition artificial intelligence and natural language processing based on a generalized ontology for disasters with a primary focus on flooding. The knowledge engine uses flood ontology to connect user input to relevant knowledge discovery channels on flooding by developing a data acquisition and processing framework using environmental observations forecast models and knowledge bases. The framework's communication channels include web-based systems agent-based chatbots smartphone applications automated web workflows and smart home devices opening the knowledge discovery for flooding to many unique use cases.;2018
Contemporary mobile devices are the result of an evolution process during which computational and networking capabilities have been continuously pushed to keep pace with the constantly growing workload requirements. This has allowed devices such as smartphones tablets and personal digital assistants to perform increasingly complex tasks up to the point of efficiently replacing traditional options such as desktop computers and notebooks. However due to their portability and size these devices are more prone to theft to become compromised or to be exploited for attacks and other malicious activity. The need for investigation of the aforementioned incidents resulted in the creation of the Mobile Forensics (MF) discipline. MF a subdomain of digital forensics is specialized in extracting and processing evidence from mobile devices in such a way that attacking entities and actions are identified and traced. Beyond its primary research interest on evidence acquisition from mobile devices MF has recently expanded its scope to encompass the organized and advanced evidence representation and analysis of future malicious entity behavior. Nonetheless data acquisition still remains its main focus. While the field is under continuous research activity new concepts such as the involvement of cloud computing in the MF ecosystem and the evolution of enterprise mobile solutions-particularly mobile device management and bring your own device-bring new opportunities and issues to the discipline. The current article presents the research conducted within the MF ecosystem during the last 7 years identifies the gaps and highlights the differences from past research directions and addresses challenges and open issues in the field.;2018
Conversational agents (CM) are becoming an increasingly common component in a wide range of information systems. A great deal of research to date has focused on enhancing traits that make CM more humanlike. However few studies have examined the influence such traits have on information disclosure. This research builds on self-disclosure social desirability and social presence theories to explain how CA anthropomorphism affects disclosure of personally sensitive information. Taken together these theories suggest that as CM become more humanlike the social desirability of user responses will increase. In this study we use a laboratory experiment to examine the influence of two elements of CA design-conversational relevance and embodiment on the answers people give in response to sensitive and non-sensitive questions. We compare the responses given to various CM to those given in a face-to-face interview and an online survey. The results show that for sensitive questions CAs with better conversational abilities elicit more socially desirable responses from participants with a less significant effect found for embodiment. These results suggest that for applications where eliciting honest answers to sensitive questions is important CAs that are better in terms of humanlike realism may not be better for eliciting truthful responses to sensitive questions.;2018
Conversational agents could provide timely and cost-effective social support to promote behavioral changes and improve healthcare outcomes. The authors evaluated the performance of their social media-based conversational agent in a smoking cessation program. Results showed that the presence of a conversational agent effectively increased participant engagement and enhanced their smoking cessation outcomes.;2018
Conversational robots which are used in the fields of education therapy and in expositions are expected to keep a user engaged in conversation. However these robots sometimes utter comments that are irrelevant topic to the current context owing to a failure in recognizing the human user's speech or intention. Such a sudden topic shift is considered to interfere with what we call the sense of conversation with which a person can feel as if he or she is participating in a conversation. In this paper to reduce the interferes of the sudden topic shift we propose to use multiple robots in a conversation in which even an actually irrelevant sudden topic shift sounds involving possible relevance to be shared with subjects in the ongoing conversation. To verify it we conducted an experiment in which subjects experienced a conversation with either one or two robots and then evaluated their impression of the conversations. The experimental results showed that the subjects who talked with two robots felt less ignored by the robots and had less difficulty in continuing the conversation with them than those who talked with a single robot. Further analysis considering subjects' social skills raised the possibility of an additional effect on robot coherence perception. Finally we discuss a new disruption-tolerant conversational system design using multiple robots based on the experimental results.;2018
Data collected in psychological studies are mainly characterized by containing a large number of variables (multidimensional data sets). Analyzing multidimensional data can be a difficult task especially if only classical approaches are used (hypothesis tests analyses of variance linear models etc.). Regarding multidimensional models visual techniques play an important role because they can show the relationships among variables in a data set. Parallel coordinates and Chernoff faces are good examples of this. This article presents self-organizing maps (SOM) a multivariate visual data mining technique used to provide global visualizations of all the data. This technique is presented as a tutorial with the aim of showing its capabilities how it works and how to interpret its results. Specifically SOM analysis has been applied to analyze the data collected in a study on the efficacy of a cognitive and behavioral treatment (CBT) for childhood obesity. The objective of the CBT was to modify the eating habits and level of physical activity in a sample of children with overweight and obesity. Children were randomized into two treatment conditions: CBT traditional procedure (face-to-face sessions) and CBT supported by a web platform. In order to analyze their progress in the acquisition of healthier habits self-register techniques were used to record dietary behavior and physical activity. In the traditional CBT condition children completed the self-register using a paper-and-pencil procedure while in the web platform condition participants completed the self-register using an electronic personal digital assistant. Results showed the potential of SOM for analyzing the large amount of data necessary to study the acquisition of new habits in a childhood obesity treatment. Currently the high prevalence of childhood obesity points to the need to develop strategies to manage a large number of data in order to design procedures adapted to personal characteristics and increase treatment efficacy.;2018
Dependency analysis is vital for spoken language understanding in spoken dialogue systems. However existing research has mainly focused on western spoken languages Japanese and so on. Little research has been done for spoken Chinese in terms of dependency parsing. Therefore the new spoken corpus D-ESCSC (Dependency-Expressive Speech Corpus of Standard Chinese) is built by adding new dependency relations special to spoken Chinese based on a written Chinese annotation scheme. Since spoken Chinese contains typical ill-grammatical phenomena e.g. translocation repetition duplication and omission the new atom feature related to punctuation and three feature templates are proposed to improve a graph-based dependency parser. Experimental results on spoken Chinese corpus show that the atom feature and three templates really work and the new parser outperforms the baseline parser. To our best knowledge it is the first work to report dependency parsing results of spoken Chinese.;2018
Dialog state tracking in a spoken dialog system is the task that tracks the flow of a dialog and identifies accurately what a user wants from the utterance. Since the success of a dialog is influenced by the ability of the system to catch the requirements of the user accurate state tracking is important for spoken dialog systems. This paper proposes a two-step neural dialog state tracker which is composed of an informativeness classifier and a neural tracker. The informativeness classifier which is implemented by a CNN first filters out noninformative utterances in a dialog. Then the neural tracker estimates dialog states from the remaining informative utterances. The tracker adopts the attention mechanism and the hierarchical softmax for its performance and fast training. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed model we do experiments on dialog state tracking in the human-human task-oriented dialogs with the standard DSTC4 data set. Our experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed model by showing that the proposed model outperforms the neural trackers without the informativeness classifier the attention mechanism or the hierarchical softmax.;2018
Digitalization has advanced spreading to all industries. Companies are required to improve marketing efficiency and strengthen engagement with customers more than ever by utilizing digital technology. Promoting emotional value through the customers service user experience is important and contact centers play a key role in the experience as customer contact points for companies. However contact centers currently face a mountain of problems including labor shortages support for diversifying channels and the need to improve efficiency by making use of Al. To solve these problems Fujitsu has started offering the Customer Engagement Solution CHORDSHIP a contact point sophistication solution. The CHORDSHIP Digital Agent which is at the core of CHORDSHIP is equipped with an Al technology ideal for contact centers: conversation-machine learning hybrid Al. Its biggest feature is the capability to deliver highly accurate automatic answers simply by using existing FAQ data in addition to its realization of support for diversifying channels and 24/7 service availability. This paper outlines the contact point sophistication solution offered by Fujitsu and describes the Al chatbot technology behind the solution.;2018
Disclosing personal information to another person has beneficial emotional relational and psychological outcomes. When disclosers believe they are interacting with a computer instead of another person such as a chatbot that can simulate human-to-human conversation outcomes may be undermined enhanced or equivalent. Our experiment examined downstream effects after emotional versus factual disclosures in conversations with a supposed chatbot or person. The effects of emotional disclosure were equivalent whether participants thought they were disclosing to a chatbot or to a person. This study advances current understanding of disclosure and whether its impact is altered by technology providing support for media equivalency as a primary mechanism for the consequences of disclosing to a chatbot.;2018
Disembodied conversational agents in the form of chatbots are increasingly becoming a reality on social media and messaging applications and are a particularly pressing topic for service encounters with companies. Adopting an experimental design with actual chatbots powered with current technology this study explores the extent to which human-like cues such as language style and name and the framing used to introduce the chatbot to the consumer can influence perceptions about social presence as well as mindful and mindless anthropomorphism. Moreover this study investigates the relevance of anthropomorphism and social presence to important company-related outcomes such as attitudes satisfaction and the emotional connection that consumers feel with the company after interacting with the chatbot.

Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) are interactive characters that exhibit human-like qualities such as facial expressions lip-synch or emotional voice and are able to communicate with humans or with other ECAs by using natural human capabilities (speech gestures etc.). However to make current ECAs' dialogue management strategies more appealing and real to the user they should be aware of general knowledge about the external world. This factual knowledge which is independent of personal experience should be stored in their semantic memory. This paper presents a knowledge-based solution to improve learning through ECAs with factual knowledge based on semantics. In particular we build this semantic memory by means of a novel proposal known as Daira. Moreover we integrated Daira with Maxine a powerful animation engine for developing applications with embodied animated agents. To illustrate the potential of our approach we designed a proof of concept in which our system is able to provide data from the online Great Aragonese Encyclopedia (GEA) written in Spanish to engage students. The experiments performed show the feasibility and efficiency of our proposal. In particular we demonstrated that using enriched ECAS when searching information can enhance learning motivation and learning performance making the interaction process much more accurate simpler and near to the students.;2018
Empathy has been defined in the scientific literature as the capacity to relate another's emotional state and assigned to a broad spectrum of cognitive and behavioral abilities. Advances in neuroscience psychology and ethology made it possible to refine the defined functions of empathy to reach a working definition and a model of empathy. Recently cognitive science and artificial intelligence communities made attempts to model empathy in artificial agents which can provide means to test these models and hypotheses. A computational model of empathy not only would help to advance the technological artifacts to be more socially compatible but also understand the empathy mechanisms test theories and address the ethics and morality problems the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community is facing today. In this paper we will review the empathy research from various fields gather the requirements for empathic capacity and construct a model of empathy that is suitable for interactive conversational agents.;2018
For a medical treatment with IoT-based facilities physicians always have to pay much more attentions to the raw medical records of target patients instead of directly making medical advice conclusions or diagnosis from their experiences. Because the medical records in IoT-based hospital information system (HIS) are dispersedly obtained from distributed devices such as tablet computer personal digital assistant automated analyzer and other medical devices they are raw simple weak-content and massive. Such medical records cannot be used for further analyzing and decision supporting due to that they are collected in a weak-semantic manner. In this paper we propose a novel approach to enrich IoT-based medical records by linking them with the knowledge in linked open data. A case study is conducted on a real-world IoT-based HIS system in association with our approach the experimental results show that medical records in the local HIS system are significantly enriched and useful for healthcare analysis and decision making and further demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach for knowledge accessing.;2018
In distributed speech recognition applications the front-end device that stands for any hand-held electronic device like smartphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) captures the speech signal extracts the speech features and then sends the speech-feature vector sequence to the back-end server for decoding. Since the front-end mobile device has limited computation capacity battery power and bandwidth there exists a feasible strategy of reducing the frame rate of the speech-feature vector sequence to alleviate the drawback. Previously we proposed a method for adjusting the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov model to enable it to address the degradation of recognition accuracy caused by the frame-rate mismatch between the input and the original model. The previous model adaptation method is referred to as the adapting-then-connecting approach that adapts each model individually and then connects the adapted models to form a word network for speech recognition. We have found that this model adaption approach introduces transitions that skip too many states and increase the number of insertion errors. In this study we propose an improved model adaptation approach denoted as the connecting-then-adapting approach that first connects the individual models to form a word network and then adapts the connected network for speech recognition. This new approach calculates the transition matrix of a connected model adapts the transition matrix of the connected model according to the frame rate and then creates a transition arc for each transition probability. The new approach can better align the speech feature sequence with the states in the word network and therefore reduce the number of insertion errors. We conducted experiments to investigate the effectiveness of our new approach and analyzed the results with respect to insertion deletion and substitution errors. The experimental results indicate that the proposed new method obtains a better recognition rate than the old method.;2018
In light of recent trends toward enhancing customer contact points companies must clarify the issues they face how they intend to solve them and their specific objectives while aiming for step-by-step improvements. To this end many companies are starting to provide chatbots to automate communication with people using computers as a service for interacting with customers. This movement is also being felt in the financial industry that handles a variety of complex products and services and there are already cases of using chatbots for customer support and sales. Fujitsu has developed FUJITSU Financial Services Solution Finplex Robot Agent Platform (hereafter FRAP) an AI-based enterprise chatbot service. FRAP achieves automatic robot support of financial-product sales and customer support by having users converse in a chat format with a robot having knowledge accumulated by machine learning. This paper first introduces trends in enterprise chatbot services and examples of using them in business applications. It then presents a case study of introducing FRAP in Sony Bank Inc. and describes its features.;2018
In recent times with the increasing interest in conversational agents for smart homes task-oriented dialog systems are being actively researched. However most of these studies are focused on the individual modules of such a system and there is an evident lack of research on a dialog framework that can integrate and manage the entire dialog system. Therefore in this study we propose a framework that enables the user to effectively develop an intelligent dialog system. The proposed framework ontologically expresses the knowledge required for the task-oriented dialog system's process and can build a dialog system by editing the dialog knowledge. In addition the framework provides a module router that can indirectly run externally developed modules. Further it enables a more intelligent conversation by providing a hierarchical argument structure (HAS) to manage the various argument representations included in natural language sentences. To verify the practicality of the framework an experiment was conducted in which developers without any previous experience in developing a dialog system developed task-oriented dialog systems using the proposed framework. The experimental results show that even beginner dialog system developers can develop a high-level task-oriented dialog system.;2018
In spoken dialogue systems we aim to deploy artificial intelligence to build automated dialogue agents that can converse with humans. A part of this effort is the policy optimization task which attempts to find a policy describing how to respond to humans in the form of a function taking the current state of the dialogue and returning the response of the system. In this paper we investigate deep reinforcement learning approaches to solve this problem. Particular attention is given to actor-critic methods off-policy reinforcement learning with experience replay and various methods aimed at reducing the bias and variance of estimators. When combined these methods result in the previously proposed ACER algorithm that gave competitive results in gaming environments. These environments however are fully observable and have a relatively small action set so in this paper we examine the application of ACER to dialogue policy optimization. We show that this method beats the current state of the art in deep learning approaches fir spoken dialogue systems. This not only leads to a more sample efficient algorithm that can train faster but also allows us to apply the algorithm in more difficult environments than before. We thus experiment with learning in a very large action space which has two orders of magnitude more actions than previously considered. We find that ACER trains significantly faster than the current state of the art.;2018
In this paper we highlight the different challenges in modeling communicative gestures for Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs). We describe models whose aim is to capture and understand the specific characteristics of communicative gestures in order to envision how an automatic communicative gesture production mechanism could be built. The work is inspired by research on how human gesture characteristics (e.g. shape of the hand movement orientation and timing with respect to the speech) convey meaning. We present approaches to computing where to place a gesture which shape the gesture takes and how gesture shapes evolve through time. We focus on a particular model based on theoretical frameworks on metaphors and embodied cognition that argue that people can represent reason about and convey abstract concepts using physical representations and processes which can be conveyed through physical gestures.;2018
In this paper we present a software platform called Chatbot designed to introduce high school students to Computer Science (CS) concepts in an innovative way: by programming chatbots. A chatbot is a bot that can be programmed to have a conversation with a human or robotic partner in some natural language such as English or Spanish. While programming their chatbots students use fundamental CS constructs such as variables conditionals and finite state automata among others. Chatbot uses pattern matching state of the art lemmatization techniques and finite state automata in order to provide automatic formative assessment to the students. When an error is found the formative feedback generated is immediate and task-level. We evaluated Chatbot in two observational studies. An online nation-wide competition where more than 10000 students participated. And a mandatory in-class 15-lesson pilot course in three high schools. We measured indicators of student engagement (task completion participation self reported interest etc.) and found that girls' engagement with Chatbot was higher than boys' for most indicators. Also in the online competition the task completion rate for the students that decided to use Chatbot was five times higher than for the students that chose to use the renowned animation and game programming tool Alice. Our results suggest that the availability of automatic formative assessment may have an impact on task completion and other engagement indicators among high school students.;2018
In this paper a web-based spoken dialog generation environment which enables users to edit dialogs with a video virtual assistant is developed and to also select the 3D motions and tone of voice for the assistant. In our proposed system anyone can easily post/edit contents of the dialog for the dialog system. The dialog type corresponding to the system is limited to the question-and-answer type dialog in order to avoid editing conflicts caused by editing by multiple users. The spoken dialog sharing service and FST generator generates spoken dialog content for the MMDAgent spoken dialog system toolkit which includes a speech recognizer a dialog control unit a speech synthesizer and a virtual agent. For dialog content creation question-and-answer dialogs posted by users and FST templates are used. The proposed system was operated for more than a year in a student lounge at the Nagoya Institute of Technology where users added more than 500 dialogs during the experiment. Images were also registered to 65% of the postings. The most posted category is related to animation video games manga.The system was subjected to open examination by tourist information staff who had no prior experience with spoken dialog systems. Based on their impressions of tourist use of the dialog system they shortened the length of some of the system's responses and added pauses to the longer responses to make them easier to understand.;2018
In this paper we address issues in situated language understanding in a moving car. More specifically we propose a reference resolution method to identify user queries about specific target objects in their surroundings. We investigate methods of predicting which target object is likely to be queried given a visual scene and what kind of linguistic cues users naturally provide to describe a given target object in a situated environment. We propose methods to incorporate the visual saliency of the visual scene as a prior. Crowdsourced statistics of how people describe an object are also used as a prior. We have collected situated utterances from drivers using our research system which was embedded in a real vehicle. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithms improve target identification rate by 15.1% absolute over the baseline method that does not use visual saliency-based prior and depends on public database with a limited number of category information.

In this paper we present a novel strategy to face the problem of dimensionality within datasets involved in conversational and feature selection systems. We base our work on a sound and complete logic along with an efficient attribute closure method to manage implications. All of them together allow us to reduce the overload of information we encounter when dealing with these kind of systems. An experiment carried out over a dataset containing real information comes to expose the benefits of our design. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;2018
In this paper we present a novel system for cognitive stimulation therapy to progressively assess cognitive impairment and emotional well-being of dementia patients in social care settings. The system assesses patients interactions and computes performance scores for different areas of cognitive stimulation. Patient interactions are initially classified into predefined performance categories through clustering of a sampled population. New personalized stimulation plans tailored to match the patient's changing level of impairment are generated automatically through a set of fuzzy rule based systems using quantitative attributes and the overall scores of patients interactions. Therapists can redefine evaluate and adjust the rules governing difficulty and activity levels for different stimulation areas to fine tune generated activity plans. The system can also be combined with an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled patient dialogue system for determining the affective state of participants during therapy sessions that could be used as a pervasive condition monitoring platform. Experiments consisting of therapy sessions of patients interacting with the system were performed in which the activity plans were automatically generated. Initial results showed that the system outputs were in agreement with the therapists own assessment in most of the stimulation areas. Simulation experiments were also conducted to analyse the system performance over multiple sessions. The results suggest that the system is able to adapt therapy plans overtime in response to changing levels of impairment/performance while supporting therapists to tune and evaluate therapy plans more effectively.

In this study we investigate if a digital coach for low-literate learners that provides cognitive learning support based on scaffolding can be improved by adding affective learning support based on motivational interviewing and social learning support based on small talk. Several knowledge gaps are identified: motivational interviewing and small talk must be translated to control rules for this coach a formal model of participant emotional states is needed to allow the coach to parse the learner's emotional state and various sensors must be used to let the coach detect and act on this state. We use the situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) method to update an existing foundation of knowledge with emotional models motivational interviewing and small talk theory technology and a new exercise in the volunteer work domain. We use this foundation to create a design specification for an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) coach that provides cognitive affective and social learning support for this exercise. A prototype is created and compared to a prototype that only provides cognitive support in a within-and between-subjects experiment. Results show that both prototypes work as expected: learners interact with the coach and complete all exercises. Almost no significant differences are found between the two prototypes indicating that the affective and social support were not effective as designed. Potential improvements are provided for future work. Results also show significant differences between two subgroups of low-literate participants and between men and women reinforcing the importance of using individualized support measures with this demographic.;2018
In this work we present a morphological segmenter for the Mexican indigenous languageWixarika. Segmentation is fundamental for rich morphological languages a common aspect of the native American languages to improve other tasks like machine translation dialogue systems summarization etc. On top of the agglutinative nature of the language the low amount of resources and the lack of an orthographic standard among dialects add to the challenge. Our proposal is based on a probabilistic finite-state approach that exploits regular agglutinative patterns and requires little linguistic knowledge. We show that our approach outperforms unsupervised and semi-supervised methods in a low-resource context. The dataset used in this work was openly released for future work by the community.;2018
Integrating different perspectives is a sophisticated strategy for developing constructive interactions in collaborative problem solving. However cognitive aspects such as individuals' knowledge and bias often obscure group consensus and produce conflict. This study investigated collaborative problem solving focusing on a group member interacting with another member having a different perspective (a maverick). It was predicted that mavericks might mitigate disadvantages and facilitate perspective taking during problem solving. Thus 344 university students participated in two laboratory-based experiments by engaging in a simple rule-discovery task that raised conflicts among perspectives. They interacted with virtual partners whose conversations were controlled by multiple conversational agents. Results show that when participants interacted with a maverick during the task they were able to take others' perspectives and integrate different perspectives to solve the problem. Moreover when participants interacted in groups with a positive mood groups with a maverick outperformed groups having several perspectives.;2018
Midwives and other women's health care providers are charged with providing high-quality care to women based on the most current available evidence. Quick reliable and accurate access to evidence-based information is essential. Numerous smartphone and mobile device applications (apps) are available to assist clinicians in providing care for women. This article discusses clinical reference apps including those for evidence-based care guidelines women's health care pharmacologic reference laboratory and diagnostic guides as well as apps for information storage and management electronic health records and client education. Midwives and other clinicians are encouraged to thoughtfully integrate mobile apps into their clinical practices to improve client outcomes and clinician and client satisfaction. Although the thousands of health care apps that are available may seem daunting this article highlights key apps that may help clinicians improve their care of women. By adding one app at a time midwives and other women's health care providers can successfully integrate mobile apps into clinical practice.;2018
Miscommunication phenomena such as repair in dialogue are important indicators of the quality of communication. Automatic detection is therefore a key step toward tools that can characterize communication quality and thus help in applications from call center management to mental health monitoring. However most existing computational linguistic approaches to these phenomena are unsuitable for general use in this way and particularly for analyzing human-human dialogue: Although models of other-repair are common in human-computer dialogue systems they tend to focus on specific phenomena (e.g. repair initiation by systems) missing the range of repair and repair initiation forms used by humans and while self-repair models for speech recognition and understanding are advanced they tend to focus on removal of disfluent material important for full understanding of the discourse contribution and/or rely on domain-specific knowledge. We explain the requirements for more satisfactory models including incrementality of processing and robustness to sparsity. We then describe models for self- and other-repair detection that meet these requirements (for the former an adaptation of an existing repair model for the latter an adaptation of standard techniques) and investigate how they perform on datasets from a range of dialogue genres and domains with promising results. Purver et al. note that most models of repair in dialogue tend to focus on the system initiating repair but are not able to detect repair initiated by humans. They develop a repair detection model based on strict incrementalism and parallelism detecting the match between the turn that is repaired and the turn that is doing the repairing. Their model achieves state-of-the-art performance on most corpora of spoken English.;2018
Monitoring sample areas is the basis of ecological management. Songshan National Nature Reserve is one of the most important components of the ecosystem of the central metropolitan area of Beijing and has fallen behind in its monitoring technology and methods. So updating the existing equipment and technology is necessary. The current system suffers from high equipment costs and is not convenient to carry so the work efficiency is low. Furthermore the data cannot be visualized in three dimensions (3D) and complex terrain conditions cannot be measured. Therefore this study researched and developed a continuous terrestrial photogrammetric measurement system that is theoretically based on the principles of photogrammetry image processing technology and dendrometry. The system applies a self-developed personal digital assistant (PDA) photogrammetry-based dendrometer and software to continuously evaluate stand sampling areas. Through experimental verification the relative root mean square error (RMSE) of the trunk diameter measurements was found to be 5.59% and the relative RMSE of hypsometrical measurements was 3.93% which are both higher than the accuracy required for traditional forestry surveys. Furthermore the advantages of this system include its low cost lightweight equipment easy operation high measurement efficiency 3D visualization and applicability under complex terrain conditions. Since it is highly accurate and efficient the continuous terrestrial photogrammetric system can be easily applied to monitor stand sampling areas in Songshan National Nature Reserve. In addition it can be applied to second-class forest surveys in China thus guaranteeing the monitoring of big data for the ecological environment of China.;2018
Nonlife threatening chronic health conditions can significantly reduce the quality of life for the patient and their family. Given pressure on specialist services and lengthy wait times we propose a novel approach that involves awebsite and virtual specialist for patients while they are awaiting their specialist appointment. To capture patient history and provide tailored treatment advice an interactive website was developed. To increase adherence the website was enhanced with an empathic embodied conversational agent to allow discussion of the suggested treatment. A six-month trial with 74 children with urinary incontinence showed an overall improvement in 74% of patients with 38% those who used the program reporting a resolution of their wetting without needing a specialist appointment. Capturing the expertise of medical specialists to provide online tailored treatment advice and use of humanlike face-to-face conversations to educate and build rapport with the patient appeared to increase treatment adherence compared to an earlier text-based version without the empathic agent.;2018
Objective Self-anamnesis is a procedure in which a patient answers questions about the personal medical history without interacting directly with a doctor or medical assistant. If collected digitally the anamnesis data can be shared among the health care team. In this article we introduce a concept for digital anamnesis collection and assess the applicability of a conversational user interface (CUI) for realizing a mobile self-anamnesis application. Materials and Methods We implemented our concept for self-anamnesis for the concrete field of music therapy. We collected requirements with respect to the application from music therapists and by reviewing the literature. A rule-based approach was chosen for realizing the anamnesis conversation between the system and the user. The Artificial Intelligence Markup Language was exploited for encapsulating the questions and responses of the system. For studying the quality of the system and analyzing performance humanity effect and accessibility of the system we performed a usability test with 22 persons. Results The current version of the self-anamnesis application is equipped with 63 questions on the music biography of a patient that are asked subsequently to the user by means of a chatbot conversation. The usability study showed that a CUI is a practical way for collecting anamnesis data. Users felt engaged of answering the questions and liked the human characteristics of the chatbot. They suggested to extend the conversation capabilities of the chatbot so that the system can react appropriately in particular when the user is not feeling well. Conclusions We could demonstrate the applicability of a CUI for collecting anamnesis data. In contrast to digital anamnesis questionnaires the application of a CUI provides several benefits: the user can be encouraged to complete all queries and can ask clarifying questions in case something is unclear.;2018
Objective To compare voice-activated internet searches by smartphone (two digital assistants) with laptop ones for information and advice related to smoking cessation. Design Responses to 80 questions on a range of topics related to smoking cessation (including the FAQ from a NHS website) compared for quality. Setting Smartphone and internet searches as performed in New Zealand. Main outcome measures Ranked responses to the questions. Results Google laptop internet searches came first (or first equal) for best quality smoking cessation advice for 83% (66/80) of the responses. Voiced questions to Google Assistant (OK Google) came first/first equal 76% of the time vs Siri (Apple) at 28%. Google and Google Assistant were statistically significantly better than Siri searches (odds ratio 12.4 and 8.5 respectively p<0.0001 in each comparison). When asked FAQs from the National Health Service website or to find information the Centers for Disease Control has made videos on the best search results used expert sources 59% (31/52) of the time some expertise (eg Wikipedia) 18% of the time but also magazines and other low quality sources 19% of the time. Using all three methods failed to find relevant information 8% (6/80) of the time with Siri having the most failed responses (53% of the time). Conclusion Google Internet searches and Google Assistant were found to be significantly superior to the Siri digital assistant for smoking cessation information. While expert content was returned over half the time there is still substantial room for improvement in how these software systems deliver smoking cessation advice.;2018
Objective: The PAL project develops a conversational agent with a physical (robot) and virtual (avatar) embodiment to support diabetes self-management of children ubiquitously. This paper assesses 1) the effect of perceived similarity between robot and avatar on children's' friendship towards the avatar and 2) the effect of this friendship on usability of a self-management application containing the avatar (a) and children's motivation to play with it (b). Methods: During a four-day diabetes camp in the Netherlands 21 children participated in interactions with both agent embodiments. Questionnaires measured perceived similarity friendship motivation to play with the app and its usability. Results: Children felt stronger friendship towards the physical robot than towards the avatar. The more children perceived the robot and its avatar as the same agency the stronger their friendship with the avatar was. The stronger their friendship with the avatar the more they were motivated to play with the app and the higher the app scored on usability. Conclusion: The combination of physical and virtual embodiments seems to provide a unique opportunity for building ubiquitous long-term child-agent friendships. Practice implications: an avatar complementing a physical robot in health care could increase children's motivation and adherence to use self-management support systems. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One of many ways in which spoken dialogue systems (SDS) are becoming more and more flexible is in their choice of words (e.g. alignment to the user's vocabulary). We examined how users perceive such adaptive and non-adaptive SDS regarding trustworthiness and usability. In Experiment 1 130 participants read out questions to an SDS that either made or did not make lexical alignment in its replies. They perceived higher cognitive demand when the SDS did not employ alignment. In Experiment 2135 participants listened to a conversation between a human and the same SDS in an online study. They judged the aligned SDS to have more integrity and to be more like-able. Implications for the design of SDS are discussed.;2018
Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model has been demonstrated many times to be suited for developing robust spoken dialogue systems unreliable speech recognition. In this paper we propose a new factored POMDP model to describe a new application on building affective tutoring system (ATS). Different from previous models the user's state space is divided into three components: goals dialogue states and emotions. Moreover the system's action space is factored into two parts: goal response and emotion response in order to respond to the user's goal and emotion respectively. We further describe how to apply the proposed model to build an ATS in detail. Five experiments are designed to reveal the influence of some key parameters on the system performance and the simulation results demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed model.

People as members of a society and members of the intelligentsia are inevitably involved in discourse and conversational systems which define their diverse positions of power in the discourse. The term discourse is used mostly to label the forms of representation and routines of language that yield certain reactions and customarily located denotations. This article examines the unsuccessful discourse attempts by university management education authorities and students in South Africa during the #FeesMustFall campaign. It analyses the forms of engagement used by the parties involved in the campaign by means of Critical Discourse Analysis. It suggests that contradictory discourses may lead to conflict instability and intolerance amongst the parties involved.;2018
Pronouns are frequently dropped in Korean sentences especially in text messages in the mobile phone environment. Restoring dropped pronouns can be a beneficial preprocessing task for machine translation information extraction spoken dialog systems and many other applications. In this work we address the problem of dropped pronoun recovery by resolving two simultaneous subtasks: detecting zero-pronoun sentences and determining the type of dropped pronouns. The problems are statistically modeled by encoding the sentence and classifying types of dropped pronouns using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Various RNN-based encoding architectures were investigated and the stacked RNN was shown to be the best model for Korean zero-pronoun recovery. The proposed method does not require any manual features to be implemented nevertheless it shows good performance.;2018
Purpose - Recent technological and digital developments have opened new avenues for customer data utilization in insurance services. One form of this data transformation is automated chatbots that provide convenient access to data leveraged through a discussion-like interface. The purpose of this paper is to uncover how insurance chatbots support customers' value creation. Design/methodology/approach - Three complementary theoretical perspectives - artificial intelligence service logic and reverse use of customer data - are briefly discussed and integrated into a conceptual framework. The suggested framework is further shown through illustrative case examples that characterize different ways of supporting customers' value creation. Findings - Chatbots represent a new type of interaction through which companies can influence customers' value creation by providing them with additional resources. Based on the proposed conceptual framework and the illustrative case examples four metaphors are identified that characterize how insurance chatbots can support customers' value creation. Research limitations/implications - The study is conceptual in nature and the case examples are used for illustrative purposes. No representative data from those users who will eventually determine whether chatbots are of value was used. Practical implications - Using the suggested framework which is aligned with provider service logic insurance companies can consider what kind of a role they wish to play in customers' value-creating processes. Originality/value - Automated chatbots provide convenient access to data leveraged through a discussion-like interface. This study is among the earliest to address their value-creating potential in insurance.;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore innovations in customer experience at the intersection of the digital physical and social realms. It explicitly considers experiences involving new technology-enabled services such as digital twins and automated social presence (i.e. virtual assistants and service robots). Design/methodology/approach Future customer experiences are conceptualized within a three-dimensional space - low to high digital density low to high physical complexity and low to high social presence - yielding eight octants. Findings The conceptual framework identifies eight dualities or specific challenges connected with integrating digital physical and social realms that challenge organizations to create superior customer experiences in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets. The eight dualities are opposing strategic options that organizations must reconcile when co-creating customer experiences under different conditions. Research limitations/implications A review of theory demonstrates that little research has been conducted at the intersection of the digital physical and social realms. Most studies focus on one realm with occasional reference to another. This paper suggests an agenda for future research and gives examples of fruitful ways to study connections among the three realms rather than in a single realm. Practical implications This paper provides guidance for managers in designing and managing customer experiences that the authors believe will need to be addressed by the year 2050. Social implications This paper discusses important societal issues such as individual and societal needs for privacy security and transparency. It sets out potential avenues for service innovation in these areas. Originality/value The conceptual framework integrates knowledge about customer experiences in digital physical and social realms in a new way with insights for future service research managers and public policy makers.;2018
Purpose: To ascertain the accuracy and reliability of tablet as an imaging console for detection of radiological signs of acute appendicitis [on focused appendiceal computed tomography (FACT)] using Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) workstation as reference standard. Methods: From January 2014 to June 2015 225 patients underwent FACT at our institution. These scans were blindly re-interpreted by an independent consultant radiologist first on PACS workstation and two weeks later on tablet. Scans were interpreted for the presence of radiological signs of acute appendicitis. Accuracy of tablet was calculated using PACS as reference standard. Kappa (kappa) statistics were calculated as a measure of reliability. Results: Of 225 patients 99 had radiological evidence of acute appendicitis on PACS workstation. Tablet was 100% accurate in detecting radiological signs of acute appendicitis. Appendicoliths free fluid lymphadenopathy phlegmon/abscess and perforation were identified on PACS in 90 43 39 10 and 12 scans respectively. There was excellent agreement between tablet and PACS for detection of appendicolith (kappa = 0.924) phlegmon/abscess (kappa = 0.904) free fluid (kappa = 0.863) lymphadenopathy (kappa = 0.879) and perforation (kappa = 0.904). Conclusions: Tablet computer as an imaging console was highly reliable and was as accurate as PACS workstation for the radiological diagnosis of acute appendicitis.;2018
Service providers from public institutions to primary care facilities need to constantly attend to clients' inquiries to provide useful information and directive guidelines. Ensuring high quality service is challenging as it not only demands detailed domain-specific knowledge but also the ability to quickly understand the clients' issues through their diverse and often casual descriptions. This paper aims to provide a framework for the development of an automated information broker agent who performs the task of a helper. The main task of the agent is to interact with the client and direct them to obtain further services that cater their personalized need. To do so the agent should accomplish a sequence of tasks that include natural language inquiry knowledge gathering reasoning and giving feedback in this way it simulates a human helper to engage in interaction with the client. The framework combines a question-answering reasoning mechanism while utilizing domain-specific knowledge base. When the users cannot describe clearly their needs the system tries to narrow down the possibilities by an iterative question-answering process until it eventually identifies the target. In realizing our framework we make a proof-of-concept project Mandy a primary care chatbot system created to assist healthcare staffs by automating the patient intake process. We describe in detail the system functionalities and design of the system and evaluate our proof-of-concept on benchmark case studies.;2018
Study Design. Cross-sectional study. Objective. To evaluate the association between back pain and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among adolescents. Summary of Background Data. The prevalence of back pain has been increasing not only in the adult population but also among children and adolescents. The better knowledge about the association between back pain and health-related quality of life could facilitate the implementation of new intervention strategies on prevention and treatment of back pain. Methods. A sample of 350 students from the fifth to ninth grades of one public school in Niteroi Rio de Janeiro Brazil. Anthropometric measures and information regarding sociodemographic lifestyle frequency and intensity of neck (NP) thoracic (TP) and low back pain in the previous month were collected using a personal digital assistant. HRQoL was assessed by KIDSCREEN-27. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between back pain and HRQoL by sex. Results. The mean age of participants was 12.7 (+/- 1.6) years. Frequency of NP TP and low back pain was 34.3 27.1 and 13.1% respectively. The mean intensity of pain was 2.3 (+/- 0.2) for neck 2.0 (+/- 0.2) for thoracic and 1.3 (+/- 0.1) for low back pain. The presence of two/three painful sites was reported by 21.7% of the adolescents. The frequency and severity of neck pain were inversely associated with global HRQoL in both the sexes. There is a strong inverse association between the number of painful sites and global HRQoL and domains. Conclusion. The presence and intensity of cervical pain and the number of painful regions were associated with lower HRQoL in adolescents which is worrying due to the important relationship between back pain in the adolescence and in the adulthood.;2018
Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) proposed by Mishra and Koehler is a theoretical construct of teacher knowledge that describes how teachers teach subject matter content using certain instructional methods with specific technology in particular contexts. This study aims to explore the interface between TPACK and SLA intending to examine (a) how a Taiwanese English teacher enhanced L2 interaction and (b) how her students perceived such teaching. While data regarding the teacher's TPACK-SLA knowledge was collected through lesson plans classroom observations and interviews data associated with students' perceptions was obtained through a questionnaire survey and focus-group interviews. The findings suggest that the teacher enhanced L2 interaction by(a) drawing students' attention to grammatical patterns through annotated animations (b) consolidating vocabulary use through image-based exercises and a bilingual concordancer and (c) evaluating the use of sentence patterns through text-chatting with a chatbot. While the students could improve learner-computer interaction through obtaining enhanced input they could also develop inter-personal communication competency through negotiating meaning. In addition the students appreciated the ways their teacher taught English using Cool English. This study contributes some empirical insights into how EFL teachers can draw upon practices explored in instructed SLA to develop TPACK.;2018
The aim of this paper is to illustrate an overview of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) module in a spoken dialog system and how it has evolved from the conventional GMM-HMM (Gaussian mixture model - hidden Markov model) architecture toward the recent nonlinear DNN-HMM (deep neural network) scheme. GMMs have dominated for a long time the baseline of speech recognition but in the past years with the resurgence of artificial neural networks (ANNs) the former models have been surpassed in most recognition tasks. An outstanding consideration for ANNs-based acoustic model is the fact that their weights can be adjusted in two training steps: i) initialization of the weights (with or without pre-training) and ii) fine-tuning. To exemplify these frameworks a case study is realized by using the Kaldi toolkit employing a mid-vocabulary with a personalized speaker-independent voice corpus on a connected-words phone dialing environment operated for recognition of digit strings and personal name lists in Spanish from Mexico. The obtained results show a reasonable accuracy in the speech recognition performance through the DNN acoustic modeling. A word error rate (WER) of 1.49% for context-dependent DNN-HMM is achieved providing a 30% relative improvement with regard to the best GMM-HMM result in these experiments (2.12% WER).;2018
The application of natural language to improve the interaction of human users with information systems is a growing trend in the recent years. Advances in cognitive computing enable a new way of interaction that accelerates insight from existing information sources. In this paper we propose a modular cognitive agent architecture for question answering featuring social dialogue improved for a specific knowledge domain. The proposed system has been implemented as a personal agent to assist students learning Java programming language. The developed prototype has been evaluated to analyze how users perceive the interaction with the system. We claim that including social dialogue in QA systems increases users satisfaction and makes them easily engage with the system. Finally we present the evaluation results that support our hypotheses.

The Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) is a multiyear direct imaging survey of 600 stars to discover and characterize young Jovian exoplanets and their environments. We have developed an automated data architecture to process and index all data related to the survey uniformly. An automated and flexible data processing framework which we term the Data Cruncher combines multiple data reduction pipelines (DRPs) together to process all spectroscopic polarimetric and calibration data taken with GPIES. With no human intervention fully reduced and calibrated data products are available less than an hour after the data are taken to expedite follow up on potential objects of interest. The Data Cruncher can run on a supercomputer to reprocess all GPIES data in a single day as improvements are made to our DRPs. A backend MySQL database indexes all files which are synced to the cloud and a front-end web server allows for easy browsing of all files associated with GPIES. To help observers quicklook displays show reduced data as they are processed in real time and chatbots on Slack post observing information as well as reduced data products. Together the GPIES automated data processing architecture reduces our workload provides real-time data reduction optimizes our observing strategy and maintains a homogeneously reduced dataset to study planet occurrence and instrument performance.

The increasing popularity of chatbots as virtual assistants has lead to many organizations releasing If-This-Then-That frameworks to engineer such chatbots. However these frameworks often result in inflexible and difficult-to-maintain chatbots. This paper outlines a high-level conceptual framework for realizing flexible chatbots founded upon agent-oriented abstractions: goals plans and commitments.;2018
The introduction of smart virtual assistants (VAs) and corresponding smart devices brought a new degree of freedom to our everyday lives. Voice-controlled and Internet-connected devices allow intuitive device controlling and monitoring from all around the globe and define a new era of human-machine interaction. Although VAs are especially successful in home automation they also show great potential as artificial intelligence-driven laboratory assistants. Possible applications include stepwise reading of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and recipes recitation of chemical substance or reaction parameters to a control and readout of laboratory devices and sensors. In this study we present a retrofitting approach to make standard laboratory instruments part of the Internet of Things (IoT). We established a voice user interface (VUI) for controlling those devices and reading out specific device data. A benchmark of the established infrastructure showed a high mean accuracy (95% +/- 3.62) of speech command recognition and reveals high potential for future applications of a VUI within the laboratory. Our approach shows the general applicability of commercially available VAs as laboratory assistants and might be of special interest to researchers with physical impairments or low vision. The developed solution enables a hands-free device control which is a crucial advantage within the daily laboratory routine.;2018
The need for experimentation of facial expression recognition in a more ecological manner necessitates the use of multimodal interactive experimental stimuli. At the same time the prerequisite of reproducibility of results and controlled conditions is still mandatory. An embodied conversational agent (ECA) is a pertinent framework that meets all these requirements. The VIB (Virtual Interactive Behavior) Platform is a SAIBA compliant system which supports the real-time generation of multimodal behavior for interacting with socio-emotional virtual agents. We created a new feature for this platform namely VIB-Ex which can be used for presenting real-time facial expressions and recording the user's reaction time and interaction while exporting data for statistical purposes. In this paper we present our proof of concept study in which a 3D male virtual character has been used to convey joyful or sad facial expressions. At the same time the same character pronounced joyful or sad words in congruence or incongruence with its facial expression in order to trigger an emotional Stroop effect. Only 12 adults were sufficient in order to obtain an emotional Stroop effect within our virtual agent. The results of this study confirmed that the VIB-Ex platform can replicate a robust effect of psychological phenomena concerning recognition of facial expressions. VIB-Ex proves itself to be a suitable and a pertinent tool to perform experiments on a human's automatic process of facial expression recognition. Finally we discuss the possible future research topics with VIB-Ex to carry out other type of experiments in the field of social cognition.;2018
This article becomes the first step towards technoscience as an opened and inter-penetrated enabler. For this the authors develop a theoretical and hermeneutical analysis of the techno-scientific system. A brief history of the modern occidental science is presented. Later this article offers the first approach to a trans-subjective or trans-personal theory within the Latin American context. The authors show different reactions to the so-called 'monologated scientific system' in relationship to the hermeneutic of the person. Later the authors show a more dialogistic system in which other epistemic views are considered. These are connected with the philosophy of wisdom the theory of personal care etc. In this sense and finally it is considered that the techno-scientific system could be inter-penetrated for the psychic and social scope. In fact this affirmation is defended to reach a scientific personal progress in a permanent dialogue with other wisdom knowledge.;2018
This article provides an overview and evaluation of the usesactual and potentialof automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue systems (SDS) related technologies that can be applied to second language speaking assessment given particular definitions of the construct. Both technologies have only gradually moved in the direction of supporting language learning and only more recently used for grading purposes. How the speaking construct is defined determines one's evaluation of the extent to which assessments using these technologies are adequate to the task given different test use contexts and what the challenges and future research requirements are. In any event there are many opportunities for their use in assessment and these would be facilitated by increased cross-disciplinary research among the language testing and speech technology communities.;2018
This article reports on the development of capabilities for (on-screen) virtual agents and robots to support isolated older adults in their homes. A real-time architecture was developed to use a virtual agent or a robot interchangeably to interact via dialog and gesture with a human user. Users could interact with either agent on 12 different activities some of which included on-screen games and forms to complete. The article reports on a pre-study that guided the choice of interaction activities. A month-long study with 44 adults between the ages of 55 and 91 assessed differences in the use of the robot and virtual agent.;2018

This letter focuses on a multimodal language understanding method for carry-and-place tasks with domestic service robots. We address the case of ambiguous instructions that is when the target area is not specified. For instance put away the milk and cereal is a natural instruction where there is ambiguity regarding the target area considering environments in daily life. Conventionally this instruction can he disambiguated from a dialogue system but at the cost of time and cumbersome interaction. Instead we propose a multimodal approach in which the instructions are disambiguated using the robot's state and environment context. We develop the Multi-Modal Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (MMC-GAN) to predict the likelihood of different target areas considering the robot's physical limitation and the target clutter. Our approach MMC-GAN significantly improves accuracy compared with baseline methods that use instructions only or simple deep neural networks.;2018
This paper focuses on the ethical challenges presented by direct-to-consumer (DTC) digital psychotherapy services that do not involve oversight by a professional mental health provider. DTC digital psychotherapy services can potentially assist in improving access to mental health care for the many people who would otherwise not have the resources or ability to connect with a therapist. However the lack of adequate regulation in this area exacerbates concerns over how safety privacy accountability and other ethical obligations to protect an individual in therapy are addressed within these services. In the traditional therapeutic relationship there are ethical obligations that serve to protect the interests of the client and provide warnings. In contrast in a DTC therapy app there are no clear lines of accountability or associated ethical obligations to protect the user seeking mental health services. The types of DTC services that present ethical challenges include apps that use a digital platform to connect users to minimally trained nonprofessional counselors as well as services that provide counseling steered by artificial intelligence and conversational agents. There is a need for adequate oversight of DTC nonprofessional psychotherapy services and additional empirical research to inform policy that will provide protection to the consumer.;2018
This paper illuminates how gendered stereotypes can be leveraged to assuage anxieties surrounding artificially intelligent virtual assistants (AI VA). In particular the analysis shows that these AI objects routinely traffic in normative gender roles of the feminine as caretaker mother and wife in order to obfuscate modes of surveillance and mediate the relationship users and potential users have with late-capitalist market logics in the platform economy. Mobilizing essentialist feminine personas characterized in this paper as digital domesticity artificially intelligent objects orient users to engage productively with surveillance capitalism as natural. To illustrate this relationship between femininity and surveillance this paper focuses on two case studies of AI VA. The essay turns to Apple's Sid and Amazon's Alexa as emblematic of AI VA that perform a stereotypically feminine persona that invites users to participate in increasingly intimate forms of data exchange that in turn contribute to surveillance capitalism. The study of AI VA like Sid and Alexa demonstrates the significant rhetorical capacities of the feminine persona as they are applied to objects with weak (that is limited) artificial intelligence.;2018
This paper presents a nonlinear control method for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of doubly fed induction generator-based wind energy conversation systems. The proposed control structure is wind speed sensorless and independent from turbine characteristics and parameters such as optimal power-speed curve and optimum tip-speed-ratio. The presented MPPT scheme is designed based on adaptive backstepping control method and shown to be robust and stable against parametric uncertainties and wind speed disturbances. The validity effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MPPT control method is demonstrated through simulation studies in the MATLAB (R) software environment. (C) 2018 Karabuk University.

This paper studies response selection for human-computer conversation systems. Existing retrieval based human-computer conversation systems are intended to reply to user utterances based on existing utterance-response pairs. However collecting sufficient utterance-response pairs is intractable in practical situations especially for many specific domains. We introduce DocChat a novel information retrieval approach for human-computer conversation systems that can use unstructured documents rather than semi-structured utterance-response pairs to react to user utterances. The key of DocChat is a learning to rank model with features designed at various levels of granularity which is proposed to quantify the relevance between utterances and responses directly. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both sentence selection and real human-computer conversation scenarios. Empirical studies of sentence selection datasets shows reasonable improvements and the strong adaptability of our model. We compare DocChat with Xiaoice a famous open domain chitchat engine in China. Side-by-side evaluation shows that DocChat is a good complement for human-computer conversation systems using utterance-response pairs as the primary source of responses. Furthermore we release a large scale open-domain dataset for sentence selection which contains 304413 query-sentence pairs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2018
This paper studies the optimization and implementation of human-machine dialog system based on cloud computing technology. Firstly the coarse-perceived hash generation based on the formant frequency is studied and the detail-aware hash generation based on the energy difference in the time domain is studied. Then the combination of coarse-perceived hash and detail-aware hash is elaborated. Secondly the algorithm is tested and emulated. The algorithm matches the coarse-perceived hash sequence with fewer bits and returns the voice number with similar rough features to the index voice after matching successfully and matches the detail-aware hash sequence of the corresponding number voice. Then the exact match of the result is gotten. Finally it is concluded that the algorithm in this paper can effectively recognize the human voice.;2018
This project explores the recent censorship of two Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots on Tencent's popular WeChat messaging platform. Specifically I am advancing a technographic approach in ways that give agency to bots as not just computing units but as interlocutors and informants. I seek to understand these chatbots through their intended design-by chatting with them. I argue that this methodological inquiry of chatbots can potentially points to fissures and deficiencies within the Chinese censorship machine that allows for spaces of subversion. AI chatbot development China presents a rich site of study because it embodies the extremes of surveillance and censorship. This is all the more important as China have elevated disruptive technologies like AI and big data as critical part of state security and a key component to fulfilling the Chinese Dream of National Rejuvenation. Whether it is the implementation of a national social credit system or the ubiquitous use facial recognition systems much of Western fears about data security and state control have been already realized in China. Yet this also implies China is at the frontlines of potential points of resistance and fissures against the party-state-corporate machine. In doing so I not only seek to raise questions dealing with the limits of our humanity in the light of our AI-driven futures but also present methodological concerns related to human-machine interfacing in conceptualizing new modes of resistance.;2018
This study aimed to test the feasibility of using a mobile device (Apple technology: iPodTouch (R) iPhone (R) or iPad (R)) among people with severe mental illness (SMI) in a rehabilitation and recovery process and to document the parameters to be taken into account and the issues involved in implementing this technology in living environments and mental health care settings. A qualitative multiple case study design and multiple data sources were used to understand each case in depth. A clinical and comprehensive analysis of 11 cases was conducted with exploratory and descriptive aims (and the beginnings of explanation building). The multiple-case analysis brought out four typical profiles to illustrate the extent of integration of a personal digital assistant (PDA) as a tool to support mental health rehabilitation and recovery. Each profile highlights four categories of variables identified as determining factors in this process: (1) state of health and related difficulties (cognitive or functional) (2) relationship between comfort level with technology motivation and personal effort deployed (3) relationship between support required and support received and (4) the living environment and follow-up context. This study allowed us to consider the contexts and conditions to be put in place for the successful integration of mobile technology in a mental health rehabilitation and recovery process.;2018
This study demonstrates that rumination is reflected in two behavioural signals that both play an important role in face-to-face interactions and provides evidence for the negative impact of rumination on social cognition. Sixty-one students were randomly assigned either to a condition in which rumination was induced or to a control condition. Their task was to play a speech-based word association game with an Embodied Conversational Agent during which their word associations pitch imitation and eye movements were measured. Two questionnaires assessed their ruminative tendencies and mind wandering thoughts respectively. Rumination predicted differences in task-related mind wandering polarity of lexical associations pitch imitation and blinks while mind wandering predicted differences in saccades. This outcome may show that rumination has a negative impact on certain aspects of social interactions.;2018
This study examined the effect of problematic Internet use social appearance anxiety and social media use on nursing students' nomophobia levels. This study was conducted with 755 undergraduate nursing students. Sociodemographic data were evaluated using percentages and means. The effect of problematic Internet use social appearance anxiety and social media use on nomophobia levels was assessed by simple linear regression analysis. The mean age of participants was 21.4 +/- 1.3 82.5% were female and 59.7% (n = 450) had adequate incomes. According to the regression analysis nomophobia levels have a strong positive and significant relationship with the variables of problematic Internet use (beta = .39 P < .000) social appearance anxiety (beta = .27 P < .001) and social media dependency (beta = .28 P < .001). Examining the correlation between nursing students' problematic Internet use social appearance anxiety and social media use levels nomophobia levels had a positively moderate relationship with problematic Internet use (r = 0.259 P < .001) social appearance anxiety (r = 0.320 P < .001) and social media use levels (r = 0.433 P < .001). There is a direct correlation between nomophobia levels and the variables of problematic Internet use social appearance anxiety and social media use.;2018
To address the problem of limited opportunities for practicing second language speaking in interaction especially delicate interactions requiring pragmatic competence we describe computer simulations designed for the oral practice of extended pragmatic routines and report on the affordances of such simulations for learning pragmatically appropriate communication. Twelve highly proficient learners of English completed six simulated conversations focused on making requests in academic contexts. Evidence of learning was examined microgenetically by comparing data across the simulated conversations and triangulated by written reflections surveys and interviews. Results showed that participants gained content and linguistic forms from expert speaker models and their interactions in scenario-based simulations indicated greater pragmatic awareness and changes in oral production over time. The majority of participants viewed the program positively commenting on features such as its authenticity and predictive accuracy.;2018
To advance the state of the art in conversational AI Amazon launched the Alexa Prize a $2.5 million competition that challenges university teams to build conversational agents or socialbots that can converse coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics for 20 minutes. The Alexa Prize offers the academic community a unique opportunity to perform research at scale with real conversational data obtained by interacting with millions of Alexa users along with user-provided ratings and feedback over several months. This opportunity enables teams to effectively iterate improve and evaluate their socialbots throughout the competition. Eighteen teams were selected for the inaugural competition last year. To build their socialbots the students combined state-of-the-art techniques with their own novel strategies in the areas of natural language understanding and conversational AI. This article reports on the research conducted over the 2017-2018 year. While the 20-minute grand challenge was not achieved in the first year the competition produced several conversational agents that advanced the state of the art that are interesting for everyday users to interact with and that help form a baseline for the second year of the competition.;2018
Ubiquitous mobile computing offers innovative approaches in the delivery of information that can facilitate free roaming of the city informing and guiding the tourist as the city unfolds before them. However making frequent visual reference to mobile devices can be distracting the user having to interact via a small screen thus disrupting the explorative experience. This research reports on an EU funded project SpaceBook that explored the utility of a hands-free eyes-free virtual tour guide that could answer questions through a spoken dialogue user interface and notify the user of interesting features in view while guiding the tourist to various destinations. Visibility modelling was carried out in real-time based on a LiDAR sourced digital surface model fused with a variety of map and crowd sourced datasets (e.g. Ordnance Survey OpenStreetMap Flickr Foursquare) to establish the most interesting landmarks visible from the user's Iodation at any giVen moment. A number of variations of the SpaceBook system were trialled in Edinburgh (Scotland). The research highlighted the pleasure derived from this novel form of interaction and revealed the complexity of prioritising route guidance instruction alongside identification description and embellishment of landmark information there being a delicate balance between the level of information 'pushed' to the user and the user's requests for further inforrnation. Among a number of challenges were issues regarding the fidelity of spatial data and positioning information required for pedestrian based systems - the pedestrian having much greater freedom of movement than vehicles.;2018
Using a Wizard-of-Oz approach the authors explored the effectiveness of engaging drivers in conversation with a digital assistant as an operational strategy to combat the symptoms of passive task-related fatigue. Twenty participants undertook two 30min drives in a medium-fidelity driving simulator between 13:00 and 16:30 when circadian and homeostatic influences naturally reduce alertness. Participants were asked to follow a lead-car travelling at a constant speed of 68mph in a sparsely populated UK motorway scenario. During one of the counterbalanced drives participants were engaged in conversation by a digital assistant (Vid'). Results show that interacting with Vid had a positive effect on driving performance and arousal evidenced by better lane-keeping earlier response to a potential hazard situation larger pupil diameter and an increased spread of attention to the road-scene (i.e. fewer fixations concentrated on the road-centre indicating a lower incidence of cognitive tunnelling'). Drivers also reported higher levels of alertness and lower sleepiness following the Vid drive. Subjective workload ratings suggest that drivers exerted less effort to stay awake' when engaged with Vid. The findings support the development and application of in-vehicle natural language interfaces and can be used to inform the design of novel countermeasures for driver fatigue.;2018
Viewing dialogue management as a reinforcement learning task enables a system to learn to act optimally by maximising a reward function. This reward function is designed to induce the system behaviour required for the target application and for goal oriented applications this usually means fulfilling the user's goal as efficiently as possible. However in real-world spoken dialogue system applications the reward is hard to measure because the user's goal is frequently known only to the user. Of course the system can ask the user if the goal has been satisfied but this can be intrusive. Furthermore in practice the accuracy of the user's response has been found to be highly variable. This paper presents two approaches to tackling this problem. Firstly a recurrent neural network is utilised as a task success predictor which is pre-trained from off-line data to estimate task success during subsequent on-line dialogue policy learning. Secondly an on-line learning framework is described whereby a dialogue policy is jointly trained alongside a reward function modelled as a Gaussian process with active learning. This Gaussian process operates on a fixed dimension embedding which encodes each varying length dialogue. This dialogue embedding is generated in both a supervised and unsupervised fashion using different variants of a recurrent neural network. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both off-line and on-line methods. These methods enable practical on-line training of dialogue policies in real-world applications.

We consider incorporating topic information into message-response matching to boost responses with rich content in retrieval-based chatbots. To this end we propose a topic aware attentive recurrent neural network in which representations of the message and the response are enhanced by the topic information. The model first leverages the message and the response represented by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to weight topic words given by a pre-trained LDA model and forms topic vectors as linear combinations of the topic words. It then refines the representations of the message and the response with the topic vectors through an attention mechanism. The attention mechanism weights the hidden sequences of the message and the response not only by themselves but also by their topic vectors. Thus both the parts that are important to matching and the parts that are semantically related to the topics are highlighted in the representations.Empirical studies on public data and human annotated data show that our model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods and rank more responses with rich content in high positions.

We introduce an extension to Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules (MCRDR) called Contextual MCRDR (C-MCRDR). We apply C-MCRDR knowledge-base systems (KBS) to the Textual Question Answering (TQA) and Natural Language Interface to Databases (NLIDB) paradigms in restricted domains as a type of spoken dialog system (SDS) or conversational agent (CA). C-MCRDR implicitly maintains topical conversational context and intra-dialog context is retained allowing explicit referencing in KB rule conditions and classifications. To facilitate NLIDB post-inference C-MCRDR classifications can include generic query referencing - query specificity is achieved by the binding of pre-identified context. In contrast to other scripted or syntactically complex systems the KB of the live system can easily be maintained courtesy of the RDR knowledge engineering approach. For evaluation we applied this system to a pedagogical domain that uses a production database for the generation of offline course-related documents. Our system complemented the domain by providing a spoken or textual question-answering alternative for undergraduates based on the same production database. The developed system incorporates a speech-enabled chatbot interface via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and experimental results from a live integrated feedback rating system showed significant user acceptance indicating the approach is promising feasible and further work is warranted. Evaluation of the prototype's viability found the system responded appropriately for 80.3% of participant requests in the tested domain and it responded inappropriately for 19.7% of requests due to incorrect dialog classifications (4.4%) or out of scope requests (15.3%). Although the semantic range of the evaluated domain was relatively shallow we conjecture that the developed system is readily adoptable as a CA NLIDB tool in other more semantically-rich domains and it shows promise in single or multi-domain environments.

We investigate algorithms and tools for the semi-automatic authoring of grammars for spoken dialogue systems (SDS) proposing a framework that spans from corpora creation to grammar induction algorithms. A realistic human-in-the-loop approach is followed balancing automation and human intervention to optimize cost to performance ratio for grammar development. Web harvesting is the main approach investigated for eliciting spoken dialogue textual data while crowdsourcing is also proposed as an alternative method. Several techniques are presented for constructing web queries and filtering the acquired corpora. We also investigate how the harvested corpora can be used for the automatic and semi-automatic (human-in-the-loop) induction of grammar rules. SDS grammar rules and induction algorithms are grouped into two types namely low- and high-level. Two families of algorithms are investigated for rule induction: one based on semantic similarity and distributional semantic models and the other using more traditional statistical modeling approaches (e.g. slot-filling algorithms using Conditional Random Fields). Evaluation results are presented for two domains and languages. High-level induction precision scores up to 60% are obtained. Results advocate the portability of the proposed features and algorithms across languages and domains. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2018
We investigate the occurrence of user restatement when there is no apparent error in Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) understanding in a multimodal customer service environment. Analysis was performed on 2998 sessions with a live customer service IVA deployed on a major airline company website and mobile application. Restatements of a user's previous turn in a conversation are separated into two classes by evidence of dissatisfaction in the IVA response. We consider combinations of response media and linguistic complexity features and determine through detailed statistical analysis which combinations of features should be minimized to improve user comprehension. A discussion of these findings follows demonstrating how the presentation of response in addition to the formulation of response text in a multimodal environment can have an effect on user understanding. Through this analysis (1) we derive guidelines when crafting responses for designers of multi modal IVAs.;2018
We present an engagement-driven Topic Manager that enables a conversational agent to personalise the topics of interaction in human-agent information-giving chat. The Topic Selection component of this computational model decides what the agent should talk about and when. For this it takes into account the agent's dynamically updated perception of the user's engagement as well as the agent's own mental state. The Topic Transition component of the Topic Manager computes how the agent should introduce the topics in the ongoing interaction without loosing the coherence of the interaction. We have implemented the Topic Manager in a virtual agent endowing it with the ability to adapt the topics of the interaction on the fly to promote the user's engagement. By means of an evaluation study we have found that third party observers perceive the actions of the Topic Manager in the agent's behaviour.;2018
We propose a computational model that endows conversational agents with the capability to coordinate their speaking turns (turn-taking management) in the context of mixed-initiative two-party dialogs. In human conversations participants are continuously adjusting their verbal and non-verbal productions for ensuring the effective coordination of speaking turns. In our model the decision making is a continuous process based on the intrinsic current goal of the agent with respect to turn-taking namely its motivation to keep-or to leave-its current role (speaker or listener) and on its perception of the intentions of its partner. Concurrently the agent is also producing signals indicating its willingness to maintain or leave its current role. Our model is based on two models from cognitive psychology: the drift-diffusion model and the theory of behavioral dynamics. After presenting simulations showing how our model makes the coordination emerge from the interactions we propose a SAIBA-Compliant architecture named BeAware created to support the implementation of our model. Finally using our model we investigate how an agent's turn-taking strategy may impact the user's experience and the effectiveness of the coordination.;2018
When checking students' source codes teachers tend to overlook some errors. This work introduces Soploon a tool that automatically detects novice programmer errors. By using this tool teachers can reduce the number of overlooked errors. Thus students receive a more complete and exhaustive feedback about their errors and misconceptions.;2018
When we ask a chatbot for advice about a personal problem should it simply provide informational support and refrain from offering emotional support? Or should it show sympathy and empathize with our situation? Although expression of caring and understanding is valued in supportive human communications do we want the same from a chatbot or do we simply reject it due to its artificiality and uncanniness? To answer this question we conducted two experiments with a chatbot providing online medical information advice about a sensitive personal issue. In Study 1 participants (N=158) simply read a dialogue between a chatbot and a human user. In Study 2 participants (N=88) interacted with a real chatbot. We tested the effect of three types of empathic expressionsympathy cognitive empathy and affective empathyon individuals' perceptions of the service and the chatbot. Data reveal that expression of sympathy and empathy is favored over unemotional provision of advice in support of the Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm. This is particularly true for users who are initially skeptical about machines possessing social cognitive capabilities. Theoretical methodological and practical implications are discussed.;2018
Whereas substance-use researchers have long combined self-report with objective measures of behavior and physiology inside the laboratory developments in mobile/wearable electronic technology are increasingly allowing for the collection of both subjective and objective information in participants' daily lives. For self-report ecological momentary assessment (EMA) as implemented on contemporary smartphones or personal digital assistants can provide researchers with near-real-time information on participants' behavior and mood in their natural environments. Data from portable/wearable electronic sensors measuring participants' internal and external environments can be combined with EMA (e.g. by timestamps recorded on questionnaires) to provide objective information useful in determining the momentary context of behavior and mood and/or validating participants' self-reports. Here we review three objective ambulatory monitoring techniques that have been combined with EMA with a focus on detecting drug use and/or measuring the behavioral or physiological correlates of mental events (i.e. emotions cognitions): (1) collection and processing of biological samples in the field to measure drug use or participants' physiological activity (e.g. hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity) (2) global positioning system (GPS) location information to link environmental characteristics (disorder/ disadvantage retail drug outlets) to drug use and affect (3) ambulatory electronic physiological monitoring (e.g. electrocardiography) to detect drug use and mental events as advances in machine learning algorithms make it possible to distinguish target changes from confounds (e.g. physical activity). Finally we consider several other mobile/wearable technologies that hold promise to be combined with EMA as well as potential challenges faced by researchers working with multiple mobile/wearable technologies simultaneously in the field.;2018
Wireless body area networks (WBANs) comprise many tiny sensor nodes which are planted in or around a patient's body. These sensor nodes can collect biomedical data of the patient and transmit these valuable data to a data sink or a personal digital assistant. Later health care service providers can get access to these data through authorization. The biomedical data are usually personal and privacy. Consequently data confidentiality and user privacy are primary concerns for WBANs. In order to achieve these goals we propose an anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs based on low-entropy password and prove its security in the random oracle model. Our scheme enjoys strong anonymity in the sense that only the client knows his identity during the authentication phase of the scheme. Compared with other related proposals our scheme is efficient in terms of computation. Moreover the authentication of the client relies on human-rememberable password which makes our scheme more suitable for applications in WBANs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2018
With advanced innovation in digital technology demand for virtual assistants is arising which can assist a person and at the same time minimize the need for interaction with the human. Acknowledging the requirement we propose an interactive and intelligent student assistant StuA which can help new-corner in a college who are hesitant in interacting with the seniors as they fear of being ragged. StuA is capable of answering all types of queries of a new-corner related to academics examinations library hostel and extra curriculum activities. The model is designed using CLIPS which allows inferring using forward chaining. Nevertheless a generalized algorithm for backward chaining for CLIPS is also implemented. Validation of the proposed model is presented in five steps which show that the model is complete and consistent with 99.16% accuracy of the knowledge model. Moreover the backward chaining algorithm is found to be 100% accurate.;2018
With the recent advances of the sequence-to-sequence framework generation approaches for the short text conversation (STC) become attractive. The traditional sequence-to-sequence approaches for the STC often suffer from poor diversity and general reply without substantiality. It is also hard to control the topic or semantics of the selected reply from multiple generated candidates. In this paper a novel external-memory-driven sequence-to-sequence learning approach is proposed to address these problems. A tensor of the external memory is constructed to represent interpretable topics or semantics. During generation a controllable memory trigger is extracted given the input sequence and a reply is then generated using the memory trigger as well as the sequence-to-sequence model. Experiments show that the proposed approach can generate much richer diversity than the traditional sequence-to-sequence training with attention. Meanwhile it achieves better quality score in human evaluation. It is also observed that by manually manipulating the memory trigger it is possible to interpretably guide the topics or semantics of the reply.;2018
With the spread of smart devices people may obtain a variety of information on their surrounding environment thanks to sensing technologies. To design more context-aware systems psychological user context (e.g. emotional status) is a substantial factor for providing useful information in an appropriate timing. As a typical use case that has a high demand for context awareness but is not tackled widely yet we focus on the tourism domain. In this study we aim to estimate the emotional status and satisfaction level of tourists during sightseeing by using unconscious and natural tourist actions. As tourist actions behavioral cues (eye and head/body movement) and audiovisual data (facial/vocal expressions) were collected during sightseeing using an eye-gaze tracker physical-activity sensors and a smartphone. Then we derived high-level features e.g. head tilt and footsteps from behavioral cues. We also used existing databases of emotionally rich interactions to train emotion-recognition models and apply them in a cross-corpus fashion to generate emotional-state prediction for the audiovisual data. Finally the features from several modalities are fused to estimate the emotion of tourists during sightseeing. To evaluate our system we conducted experiments with 22 tourists in two different touristic areas located in Germany and Japan. As a result we confirmed the feasibility of estimating both the emotional status and satisfaction level of tourists. In addition we found that effective features used for emotion and satisfaction estimation are different among tourists with different cultural backgrounds.;2018
A barrier to incorporating genomics more broadly is limited access to providers with genomics expertise. Chatbots are a technology-based simulated conversation used in scaling communications. Geisinger and Clear Genetics Inc. have developed chatbots to facilitate communication with participants receiving clinically actionable genetic variants from the MyCode (R) Community Health Initiative (MyCode (R)). The consent chatbot walks patients through the consent allowing them to opt to receive more or less detail on key topics (goals benefits risks etc.). The follow-up chatbot reminds participants of suggested actions following result receipt and the cascade chatbot can be sent to at-risk relatives by participants to share their genetic test results and facilitate cascade testing. To explore the acceptability usability and understanding of the study consent post-result follow-up and cascade testing chatbots we conducted six focus groups with MyCode (R) participants. Sixty-two individuals participated in a focus group (n = 33 consent chatbot n = 29 follow-up and cascade chatbot). Participants were mostly female (n = 42 68%) Caucasian (n = 58 94%) college-educated (n = 3353%) retirees (n = 38 61%) and of age 56 years or older (n = 52 84%). Few participants reported that they knew what a chatbot was (n = 10 16%) and a small number reported that they had used a chatbot (n = 5 8%). Qualitative analysis of transcripts and notes from focus groups revealed four main themes: (a) overall impressions (b) suggested improvements (c) concerns and limitations and (d) implementation. Participants supported using chatbots to consent for genomics research and to interact with healthcare providers for care coordination following receipt of genomic results. Most expressed willingness to use a chatbot to share genetic information with relatives. The consent chatbot presents an engaging alternative to deliver content challenging to comprehend in traditional paper or in-person consent. The cascade and follow-up chatbots may be acceptable user-friendly scalable approaches to manage ancillary genetic counseling tasks.;2019
A dialog act represents the communicative function of an utterance in a conversation and thus provides informative cues for understanding managing and generating dialog. While most spoken dialog systems process user input and system output at the turn level a single turn can consist of multiple dialog acts in human conversations. Therefore segmenting turn-level tokens into a meaningful dialog act unit is just as important as recognizing the dialog act. Towards joint segmentation and recognition of dialog acts we propose an encoder-decoder model featuring joint coding and incorporate contextual information by means of an attentional mechanism. The proposed encoder-decoder outperforms other models in segmentation and the application of attentions significantly reduces recognition error rates. By combining the encoder-decoder model with contextual attention we achieve state-of-the-art performance in the joint evaluation of dialog act segmentation and recognition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A dialogue system will often ask followup clarification questions when interacting with a user if the agent is unsure how to respond. In this new study we explore deep reinforcement learning (RL) for asking followup questions when a user records a meal description and the system needs to narrow down the options for which foods the person has eaten. We build off of prior work in which we use novel convolutional neural network models to bypass the standard feature engineering used in dialogue systems to handle the text mismatch between natural language user queries and structured database entries demonstrating that our model learns semantically meaningful embedding representations of natural language. In this new nutrition domain the followup clarification questions consist of possible attributes for each food that was consumed for example if the user drinks a cup of milk the system should ask about the percent milkfat. We investigate an RL agent to dynamically follow up with the user which we compare to rule-based and entropy-based methods. On a held-out test set assuming the followup questions are answered correctly deep RL significantly boosts top five food recall from 54.9% without followup to 89.0%. We also demonstrate that a hybrid RL model achieves the hest perceived naturalness ratings in a human evaluation.;2019
Accurate and objective assessment of energy intake remains an ongoing problem. We used features derived from annotated video observation and a chewing sensor to predict mass and energy intake during a meal without participant self-report. 30 participants each consumed 4 different meals in a laboratory setting and wore a chewing sensor while being videotaped. Subject-independent models were derived from bite chew and swallow features obtained from either video observation or information extracted from the chewing sensor. With multiple regression analysis a forward selection procedure was used to choose the best model. The best estimates of meal mass and energy intake had (mean +/- standard deviation) absolute percentage errors of 25.2% +/- 18.9% and 30.1% +/- 33.8% respectively and mean +/- standard deviation estimation errors of -17.7 +/- 226.9 g and -6.1 +/- 273.8 kcal using features derived from both video observations and sensor data. Both video annotation and sensor-derived features may be utilized to objectively quantify energy intake.;2019
Acquiring knowledge for conversation modeling is an important task in the process of building a Conversational Agent (Chatbot). However it is a quite difficult process that requires too much time and efforts. To overcome these difficulties in this paper we demonstrate a novel methodology for the automatic conversational knowledge extraction from an existing Chatbot. Extracted knowledge will be used as training dataset for building a Neural Network Conversational Agent. The experiments in the paper show that our proposed approach can be used for the automatic knowledge extraction from any type of Chatbot on the Internet. The experiment that is presented in this paper has two phases. In the first phase we present a methodology for the conversational knowledge extraction. In the second phase of the experiment we introduce a methodology for building a new Neural Conversational Agent using a deep learning Neural Network framework. The key novelty of our proposed approach is the automated machine-machine conversational knowledge sharing and reuse. This is an important step towards building the new conversational agents skipping the difficult and time-consuming procedure of knowledge acquisition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Activity recognition a key component in pervasive healthcare monitoring relies on classification algorithms that require labeled data of individuals performing the activity of interest to train accurate models. Labeling data can be performed in a lab setting where an individual enacts the activity under controlled conditions. The ubiquity of mobile and wearable sensors allows the collection of large datasets from individuals performing activities in naturalistic conditions. Gathering accurate data labels for activity recognition is typically an expensive and time-consuming process. In this paper we present two novel approaches for semi-automated online data labeling performed by the individual executing the activity of interest. The approaches have been designed to address two of the limitations of self-annotation: (i) The burden on the user performing and annotating the activity and (ii) the lack of accuracy due to the user labeling the data minutes or hours after the completion of an activity. The first approach is based on the recognition of subtle finger gestures performed in response to a data-labeling query. The second approach focuses on labeling activities that have an auditory manifestation and uses a classifier to have an initial estimation of the activity and a conversational agent to ask the participant for clarification or for additional data. Both approaches are described evaluated in controlled experiments to assess their feasibility and their advantages and limitations are discussed. Results show that while both studies have limitations they achieve 80% to 90% precision.;2019
Advanced attackers use online social networks in order to extract useful information about targeted organizations including the names of the organization's members their connections affiliations positions etc. Using artificial profiles (socialbots) attackers connect to real members of the organization thus establishing a foothold inside the organization and greatly increasing the amount of sensitive information they can collect. The connection methods used by attackers are versatile ranging from random friend requests to carefully crafted manually operated social engineering attempts. In this paper we provide an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of strategies used to monitor organizational social networks and detect the socialbots that penetrate a target organization. These strategies were evaluated against heterogeneous attackers with different levels of knowledge about the monitoring strategies using simulation on actual social network data and data from a real scenario of socialbot intrusion. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the monitoring strategies in detecting less sophisticated attackers and slowing down attackers that deliberately avoid the monitored profiles.;2019
Advances in technology are changing the ways cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be delivered. Through mobile technologies effective interventions exist that allow people to receive CBT without ever visiting a practitioner's office. Additionally mobile technologies are increasingly entering practitioners' offices combining technological and human elements to create hybrid forms of care. Although clinical research has demonstrated exciting possibilities for mobile technologies to deliver and support CBT for the most part clinical practice has been unchanged. We provide an overview of mobile CBT tools used either to deliver or to support CBT highlighting what works and noting current limitations of our understanding. We also discuss new avenues in mobile CBT that leverage peers artificial intelligence and chatbots and mobile sensing to create scalable personalized and context-aware interventions. The future of mobile CBT should not be confined to digitizing current practices but should leverage technological affordances to improve CBT as it exists today.;2019
Aiming at the problem of insufficient integration and sharing of forestry information resources under the current communication network and the lack of the concept set of forestry information attributes which leads to poor information retrieval performance a fast retrieval method of forestry information features based on symmetry function is studied in depth and the method is implemented by PDA (Personal Digital Assistant)-BA (Buliding Automation). Using the SED (Stream Editor) forestry information acquisition method under a communication network to collect forestry information a forestry signal noise cancellation method based on symmetric function method is obtained. In order to improve the accuracy of forestry information acquisition denoising of the signal in the information was carried out. Constructing forestry information data ontology integrating forestry resources establishing a conceptual set of forestry information attributes distinguishing forestry information attributes establishing a fast retrieval model of forestry information features based on the synonym library and completing the fast retrieval of forestry information features. The experimental results show that the recall and precision of this method are 99.25% and 99.24% respectively and the retrieval performance is superior which has a certain application value.;2019
Although current social machine technology cannot fully exhibit the hallmarks of human morality or agency popular culture representations and emerging technology make it increasingly important to examine human interlocutors' perception of social machines (e.g. digital assistants chatbots robots) as moral agents. To facilitate such scholarship the notion of perceived moral agency (PMA) is proposed and defined and a metric developed and validated through two studies: (1) a large-scale online survey featuring potential scale items and concurrent validation metrics for both machine and human targets and (2) a scale validation study with robots presented as variably agentic and moral. The PMA metric is shown to be reliable valid and exhibiting predictive utility.;2019
Although studies have explored the gender categorization effect in both face-to-face and mediated communication environments in relation to the use of gender-linked language whether the effect still holds in the context of human-machine communication (HMC) remains unknown. To examine this question in this study we asked 245 participants to assign gender categories to targets after viewing transcripts of the targets conversations with a chatbot and a human interlocutor. The results showed that the participants had a better-than-chance probability (68.98%) of correctly guessing the gender of the target based on the target-human conversation transcripts. However the predictive power of the language cues decreased sharply to a less-than-chance level (42.86%) based on target-chatbot conversation transcripts. We also examined the roles that social media use and demographics played in the gender categorization processes in both computer-mediated communication and HMC contexts. Although far from conclusive our results suggested that there were significant differences between the styles of conversation in the target-chatbot and target-human interlocutor transcripts. These findings imply that people use different approaches when communicating with human and non-human interlocutors.;2019
Although various methods have been developed to evaluate conversational interfaces there has been a lack of methods specifically focusing on evaluating user experience. This paper reviews the understandings of user experience (UX) in conversational interfaces literature and examines the six questionnaires commonly used for evaluating conversational systems in order to assess the potential suitability of these questionnaires to measure different UX dimensions in that context. The method to examine the questionnaires involved developing an assessment framework for main UX dimensions with relevant attributes and coding the items in the questionnaires according to the framework. The results show that (i) the understandings of UX notably differed in literature (ii) four questionnaires included assessment items in varying extents to measure hedonic aesthetic and pragmatic dimensions of UX (iii) while the dimension of affect was covered by two questionnaires playfulness motivation and frustration dimensions were covered by one questionnaire only. The largest coverage of UX dimensions has been provided by the Subjective Assessment of Speech System Interfaces (SASSI). We recommend using multiple questionnaires to obtain a more complete measurement of user experience or improve the assessment of a particular UX dimension.

Amazon Alexa is a voice-controlled application that is rapidly gaining popularity. We examined user interactions with this technology and focused on the types of tasks requested of Alexa the variables that affect user behaviors with Alexa and Alexa's alternatives. The data about Alexa usage were collected from 19 participants via the online questionnaire and diary methods over the course of several days. The results indicate that across all age groups Alexa was primarily used for checking weather forecasts playing music and controlling other devices. Several participants reported using Apple Siri and Google Now applications in addition to Alexa for similar purposes except for controlling other devices. Alexa uses over the weekends were more frequent than on weekdays but its overall usage tended to decrease over time. The users reported being satisfied with Alexa even when it did not produce sought information suggesting that the interaction experience is more important to the users than the interaction output. More work is required to understand whether users treat Alexa and similar voice-controlled applications as primarily a traditional information retrieval system a casual leisure system a control interface for smart home devices or simply a new toy.;2019
An embodied conversational agent can serve as a relational agent and provide information motivation and behavioral skills. To evaluate the feasibility acceptability and preliminary efficacy of My Personal Health Guide a theory-based mobile-delivered embodied conversational agent intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy in young African American men who have sex with men we conducted this prospective pilot study using a 3-month pre-post design. Outcome measures included adherence acceptability feasibility pre versus post health literacy and pre versus post self-efficacy. There were 43 participants. Pill count adherence > 80% improved from 62% at baseline to 88% at follow-up (p = .05). The acceptability of the app was high. Feasibility issues identified included loss of usage data from unplanned participant app deletion. Health literacy improved whereas self-efficacy was high at baseline and follow-up. This pilot study of My Personal Health Guide demonstrated acceptability and preliminary efficacy in improving adherence in this important population.;2019

Implications of AI are applicable to counseling ethics existentialism clinical practice and public policy.;2019
As an important component in dialogue system Dialogue Act Recognition (DAR) has attracted much attention of researchers. Most of the existing approaches only focus on the information of utterances but relatively few investigate the roles of DA labels in different layers of a conversation and also some semantic inference in irregular conversations such as questions and answers skipping back and forth has not been probed properly so that some dialogue acts are not always recognized correctly. To overcome the aforementioned deficiencies we propose a hierarchical project method in which DA labels are embedded in three levels (word utterance and DA) to calculate the importance of each word provide contextual and pragmatic information and guide the model to generate the category of utterance respectively. Both multiple attention mechanism and semantic update mechanism are applied to infer the more accurate representation of utterance for DA recognition in a general case. Experimental results show that our model can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art models with less extra information.;2019
As social media replace traditional communication channels we are often exposed to too much information to process. The presence of too many participants for example can turn online public spaces into noisy overcrowded fora where no meaningful conversation can be held. Here we analyse a large dataset of public chat logs from Twitch a popular video-streaming platform in order to examine how information overload affects online group communication. We measure structural and textual features of conversations such as user output interaction and information content per message across a wide range of information loads. Our analysis reveals the existence of a transition from a conversational state to a cacophony-a state with lower per capita participation more repetition and less information per message. This study provides a quantitative basis for further studies of the social effects of information overload and may guide the design of more resilient online conversation systems.;2019
As the uses of conversational agents increase the affective and social abilities of agents become important with their functional abilities. Agents that lack affective abilities could frustrate users during interaction. This study applied personality to implement the natural feedback of conversational agents referring to the concept of affective computing. Two types of feedback were used to express conversational agents' personality: (1) visual feedback and (2) verbal cues. For visual feedback participants (N = 45) watched visual feedback with different colors and motions. For verbal cues participants (N = 60) heard different conditions of agents' voices with different scripts. The results indicated that the motions of visual feedback were more significant than colors. Fast motions could express distinct and positive personalities. Different verbal cues were perceived as different personalities. The perceptions of personalities differed according to the vocal gender. This study provided design implications for personality expressions applicable to diverse interfaces.;2019
Automatic generation of texts with different sentiment labels has wide use in artificial intelligence applications such as conversational agents. It is an important problem to be addressed for achieving emotional intelligence. In this paper we propose two novel models SentiGAN and C-SentiGAN which have multiple generators and one multiclass discriminator to address this problem. In our models multiple generators are trained simultaneously aiming at generating texts of different sentiment labels without supervision. We propose a penalty-based objective in generators to force each of them to generate diversified examples of a specific sentiment label. Moreover the use of multiple generators and one multi-class discriminator can make each generator focus on generating its own texts of a specific sentiment label accurately. Experimental results on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our SentiGAN model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art text generation models in the sentiment accuracy and quality of generated texts. In addition experiments on conditional text generation tasks show that our C-SentiGAN model has good prospects for specific text generation tasks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2019
Automation of journalistic tasks is growing with the development of increasingly sophisticated software for newsgathering production and distribution. Bots are one form of algorithmic technology that has found a place in the modern newsroom with chatbots leading the way as news organisations seek to attract new audiences using conversational forms of journalism. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (Al) and machine teaming (ML) have fuelled increasing experimentation with machine autonomy and there has been much hyperbole in the press about the extent and impact of this on journalism. Looking at on-the-ground trials in audience-facing bots at the UK's largest public broadcaster we find a significantly more restricted picture. News bots at The BBC to-date have been basic do not use ML and have rarely been integrated into news production. The organisation is laying groundwork for development of more interactive news formats with an increasingly conversational tone and individual mode of address as part of a strategy for increased personalisation which is likely to involve growing levels of ML In the process bots are reconfiguring working practices and infrastructure posing new editorial and technical challenges and redefining relationships with audiences. We discuss the implications of this for public service media.;2019
Autonomous speech-enabled applications such as speech-to-speech machine translation conversational agents and spoken dialogue systems need to be able to distinguish system-directed user input from off-talk to function appropriately. Off-talk occurs when users speak to themselves or to others often causing the system to mistakenly respond to speech that was not directed to it. Automatic detection of off-talk could help prevent such errors and make the user's interaction with the system more natural. It has been observed that speech in human-human dialogue and in soliloquy is prosodically different from speech directed at machines and that the right hemisphere of the human brain is the locus of control of speech prosody. In this study we explore human brain activity prior to speech articulation alone and in combination with prosodic features to create models for off-talk prediction. The proposed EEG based models are a step towards improving response time in detecting system-directed speech in comparison with audio-based methods of detection opening new possibilities for the integration of brain-computer interface techniques into interactive speech systems.;2019
Background Although the use of technology viz. mobile phones personalised digital assistants smartphones notebook and tablets to monitor health and health care (mHealth) is mushrooming only small localised studies have described their use as a data collection tool. This paper describes the complexity functionality and feasibility of mHealth for large scale surveillance at national and sub-national levels in South Africa a high HIV-prevalence setting. Methods In 2010 2011-12 and 2012-13 three nationally representative surveys were conducted amongst infants attending 580 facilities across all 51 districts within all nine provinces of South Africa to monitor the effectiveness of the programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). In all three surveys a technical protocol and iterative system for mobile data collection was developed. In 2012-13 the system included automated folders to store information about upcoming interviews. Paper questionnaires were used as a back-up in case of mHealth failure. These included written instructions per question on limits skips and compulsory questions. Data collectors were trained on both systems. Results In the 2010 2011-12 and 2012-2013 surveys respectively data from 10554 10071 and 10536 interviews and approximately 186 variables per survey were successfully uploaded to 151 mobile phones collecting data from 580 health facilities in 51 districts across all nine provinces of South Africa. A technician costing approximately U$D20 000 p.a. was appointed to support field-based staff. Two percent of data were gathered using paper- questionnaires. The time needed for mHealth interviews was approximately 15 times less than the time needed for paper questionnaires 30-45 min versus approximately 120 min (including 60-70 min for the interview with an additional 45 min for data capture). In 2012-13 1172 data errors were identified via the web-based console. There was a four-week delay in resolving data errors from paper-based surveys compared with a 3-day turnaround time following direct capture on mobile phones. Conclusion Our experiences demonstrate the feasibility of using mHealth during large-scale national surveys in the presence of a supportive data management team. mHealth systems reduced data collection time by almost 1.5 times thus reduced data collector costs and time needed for data management.;2019
Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents capable of promoting health providing education and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake however few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants' willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results Three broad themes: 'Understanding of chatbots' 'AI hesitancy' and 'Motivations for health chatbots' were identified outlining concerns about accuracy cyber-security and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%) correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13-0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60-0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08-8.43] positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77-4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13-3.25]. Conclusion Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients' concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients' perspectives motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.;2019
Background In the United States and parts of the world the human papillomavirus vaccine uptake is below the prescribed coverage rate for the population. Some research have noted that dialogue that communicates the risks and benefits as well as patient concerns can improve the uptake levels. In this paper we introduce an application ontology for health information dialogue called Patient Health Information Dialogue Ontology for patient-level human papillomavirus vaccine counseling and potentially for any health-related counseling. Results The ontology's class level hierarchy is segmented into 4 basic levels - Discussion Goal Utterance and Speech Task. The ontology also defines core low-level utterance interaction for communicating human papillomavirus health information. We discuss the design of the ontology and the execution of the utterance interaction. Conclusion With an ontology that represents patient-centric dialogue to communicate health information we have an application-driven model that formalizes the structure for the communication of health information and a reusable scaffold that can be integrated for software agents. Our next step will to be develop the software engine that will utilize the ontology and automate the dialogue interaction of a software agent.;2019
Background Psychological factors have been reported to have influence on the eating habits of patients with diabetes. However previous studies have used questionnaires to investigate the association and thus include recall bias. To overcome this disadvantage ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can be used to record subjective symptoms and behavior in subjects' daily lives. Therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of preceding psychological factors on calorie intake using computerized EMA for 6 months. Methods The participants were nine outpatients with type 2 diabetes aged 34-72. They were instructed to use a personal digital assistant as an electronic diary for 6 months to record subjective symptoms such as psychological stress anxiety and depressive mood and the food and drink that they consumed. The association between a preceding psychological factor and calorie intake within 5 hours was investigated using multilevel modeling. Results Preceding psychological stress was positively associated with calorie intake from snacks. Preceding psychological stress anxiety and depressive mood were negatively associated with calorie intake from regular meals. Conclusions Preceding psychological factors influence the calorie intake of patients with type 2 diabetes. Understanding the role of these factors will be useful for developing psychological interventions to prevent overeating.;2019
Background: Almost two thirds of patients diagnosed with cancer are age 65 years or older. In order to follow up on older patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy at home we implemented remote phone monitoring conducted by skilled oncology nurses. However given the rising number of patients assessed and the limited time that hospital professionals can spend on their patients after discharge we needed to modernize this program. In this paper we present the preliminary results and the ongoing evaluation. Method: We implemented a semi-automated messaging application to upgrade the current follow-up procedures. The primary aim is to collect patient's key data over time and to free up nurses' time so that during phone calls they can focus on education and support. The Chatbot feasibility was assessed in a sub-sample of unselected patients before its wider dissemination and pragmatic evaluation. Main results: During the first deployment period 9 unselected patients benefited from the Chatbot (mean 83 y.o.) with a total of 52 completed remote evaluations. Each participant answered 6 questionnaires over 7 weeks with an 86% compliance rate. The average completion time for the questionnaires was 3.5 min and the answer rate was 100%. The 'free text' field was used in 58% of the questionnaires. The Chatbot solution is currently proposed to all eligible patients thanks to the regional cancer network support. We are measuring acceptability health outcomes and health network impact. Discussion and conclusion: The results of this first phase are encouraging. The integration of the solution into the health care organization was feasible and acceptable. Moreover the answers revealed serious health (e.g. fever) or adherence (e.g. blood test) issues that require timely interventions. The major strength of this solution is to rely on end-users' current knowledge of technologies (text-messaging) which allows a seamless integration into a complex clinical network.;2019
Background: Conversational interfaces (CIs) in different modalities have been developed for health purposes such as health behavioral intervention patient self-management and clinical decision support. Despite growing research evidence supporting CIs' potential CI-related research is still in its infancy. There is a lack of systematic investigation that goes beyond publication review and presents the state of the art from perspectives of funding agencies academia and industry by incorporating CI-related public funding and patent activities. Objective: This study aimed to use data systematically extracted from multiple sources (ie grant publication and patent databases) to investigate the development research and fund application of health-related CIs and associated stakeholders (ie countries organizations and collaborators). Methods: A multifaceted search query was executed to retrieve records from 9 databases. Bibliometric analysis social network analysis and term co-occurrence analysis were conducted on the screened records. Results: This review included 42 funded projects 428 research publications and 162 patents. The total dollar amount of grants awarded was US $30297932 of which US $13513473 was awarded by US funding agencies and US $16784459 was funded by the Europe Commission. The top 3 funding agencies in the United States were the National Science Foundation National Institutes of Health and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Boston Medical Center was awarded the largest combined grant size (US $2246437) for 4 projects. The authors of the publications were from 58 countries and 566 organizations the top 3 most productive organizations were Northeastern University (United States) Universiti Teknologi MARA (Malaysia) and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS France). US researchers produced 114 publications. Although 82.0% (464/566) of the organizations engaged in interorganizational collaboration 2 organizational research-collaboration clusters were observed with Northeastern University and CNRS as the central nodes. About 112 organizations from the United States and China filed 87.7% patents. IBM filed most patents (N=17). Only 5 patents were co-owned by different organizations and there was no across-country collaboration on patenting activity. The terms patient child elderly and robot were frequently discussed in the 3 record types. The terms related to mental and chronic issues were discussed mainly in grants and publications. The terms regarding multimodal interactions were widely mentioned as users' communication modes with CIs in the identified records. Conclusions: Our findings provided an overview of the countries organizations and topic terms in funded projects as well as the authorship collaboration content and related information of research publications and patents. There is a lack of broad cross-sector partnerships among grant agencies academia and industry particularly in the United States. Our results suggest a need to improve collaboration among public and private sectors and health care organizations in research and patent activities.;2019
Background: Digital health interventions can fill gaps in mental healthcare provision. However autonomous e-mental health (AEMH) systems also present challenges for effective risk management. To balance autonomy and safety AEMH systems need to detect risk situations and act on these appropriately. One option is sending automatic alerts to carers but such 'auto-referral' could lead to missed cases or false alerts. Requiring users to actively self-refer offers an alternative but this can also be risky as it relies on their motivation to do so. This study set out with two objectives. Firstly to develop guidelines for risk detection and auto-referral systems. Secondly to understand how persuasive techniques mediated by a virtual agent can facilitate self-referral. Methods: In a formative phase interviews with experts alongside a literature review were used to develop a risk detection protocol. Two referral protocols were developed - one involving auto-referral the other motivating users to self-refer. This latter was tested via crowd-sourcing (n = 160). Participants were asked to imagine they had sleeping problems with differing severity and user stance on seeking help. They then chatted with a virtual agent who either directly facilitated referral tried to persuade the user or accepted that they did not want help. After the conversation participants rated their intention to self-refer to chat with the agent again and their feeling of being heard by the agent. Results: Whether the virtual agent facilitated persuaded or accepted influenced all of these measures. Users who were initially negative or doubtful about self-referral could be persuaded. For users who were initially positive about seeking human care this persuasion did not affect their intentions indicating that a simply facilitating referral without persuasion was sufficient. Conclusion: This paper presents a protocol that elucidates the steps and decisions involved in risk detection something that is relevant for all types of AEMH systems. In the case of self-referral our study shows that a virtual agent can increase users' intention to self-refer. Moreover the strategy of the agent influenced the intentions of the user afterwards. This highlights the importance of a personalised approach to promote the user's access to appropriate care.;2019
Background: Hospitalized older adults often experience isolation and disorientation while receiving care placing them at risk for many inpatient complications including loneliness depression delirium and falls. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are technological entities that can interact with people through spoken conversation. Some ECAs are also relational agents which build and maintain socioemotional relationships with people across multiple interactions. This study utilized a novel form of relational ECA provided by Care Coach (care.coach inc): an animated animal avatar on a tablet device monitored and controlled by live health advocates. The ECA implemented algorithm-based clinical protocols for hospitalized older adults such as reorienting patients to mitigate delirium risk eliciting toileting needs to prevent falls and engaging patients in social interaction to facilitate social engagement. Previous pilot studies of the Care Coach avatar have demonstrated the ECA's usability and efficacy in home-dwelling older adults. Further study among hospitalized older adults in a larger experimental trial is needed to demonstrate its effectiveness. Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the effect of a human-in-the-loop protocol-driven relational ECA on loneliness depression delirium and falls among diverse hospitalized older adults. Methods: This was a clinical trial of 95 adults over the age of 65 years hospitalized at an inner-city community hospital. Intervention participants received an avatar for the duration of their hospital stay participants on a control unit received a daily 15-min visit from a nursing student. Measures of loneliness (3-item University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale) depression (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale) and delirium (confusion assessment method) were administered upon study enrollment and before discharge. Results: Participants who received the avatar during hospitalization had lower frequency of delirium at discharge (P<.001) reported fewer symptoms of loneliness (P=.01) and experienced fewer falls than control participants. There were no significant differences in self-reported depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The study findings validate the use of human-in-the-loop relational ECAs among diverse hospitalized older adults.;2019
Background: In addition to addiction and substance abuse motivational interviewing (MI) is increasingly being integrated in treating other clinical issues such as mental health problems. Most of the many technological adaptations of MI however have focused on delivering the action-oriented treatment leaving its relational component unexplored or vaguely described. This study intended to design a conversational sequence that considers both technical and relational components of MI for a mental health concern. Objective: This case study aimed to design a conversational sequence for a brief motivational interview to be delivered by a Web-based text messaging application (chatbot) and to investigate its conversational experience with graduate students in their coping with stress. Methods: A brief conversational sequence was designed with varied combinations of MI skills to follow the 4 processes of MI. A Web-based text messaging application Bonobot was built as a research prototype to deliver the sequence in a conversation. A total of 30 full-time graduate students who self-reported stress with regard to their school life were recruited for a survey of demographic information and perceived stress and a semistructured interview. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by Braun and Clarke's thematic method. The themes that reflect the process of impact of and needs for the conversational experience are reported. Results: Participants had a high level of perceived stress (mean 22.5 [SD 5.0]). Our findings included the following themes: Evocative Questions and Cliched Feedback Self-Reflection and Potential Consolation and Need for Information and Contextualized Feedback. Participants particularly favored the relay of evocative questions but were less satisfied with the agent-generated reflective and affirming feedback that filled in-between. Discussing the idea of change was a good means of reflecting on themselves and some of Bonobot's encouragements related to graduate school life were appreciated. Participants suggested the conversation provide informational support as well as more contextualized feedback. Conclusions: A conversational sequence for a brief motivational interview was presented in this case study. Participant feedback suggests sequencing questions and MI-adherent statements can facilitate a conversation for stress management which may encourage a chance of self-reflection. More diversified sequences along with more contextualized feedback should follow to offer a better conversational experience and to confirm any empirical effect.;2019
Background: Many potential benefits for the uses of chatbots within the context of health care have been theorized such as improved patient education and treatment compliance. However little is known about the perspectives of practicing medical physicians on the use of chatbots in health care even though these individuals are the traditional benchmark of proper patient care. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the perceptions of physicians regarding the use of health care chatbots including their benefits challenges and risks to patients. Methods: A total of 100 practicing physicians across the United States completed a Web-based self-report survey to examine their opinions of chatbot technology in health care. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used to examine the characteristics of participants. Results: A wide variety of positive and negative perspectives were reported on the use of health care chatbots including the importance to patients for managing their own health and the benefits on physical psychological and behavioral health outcomes. More consistent agreement occurred with regard to administrative benefits associated with chatbots many physicians believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments (78% 78/100) locating health clinics (76% 76/100) or providing medication information (71%71/100). Conversely many physicians believed that chatbots cannot effectively care for all of the patients' needs (76% 76/100) cannot display human emotion (72% 72/100) and cannot provide detailed diagnosis and treatment because of not knowing all of the personal factors associated with the patient (71% 71/100). Many physicians also stated that health care chatbots could be a risk to patients if they self-diagnose too often (714% 74/100) and do not accurately understand the diagnoses (74% 74/100). Conclusions: Physicians believed in both costs and benefits associated with chatbots depending on the logistics and specific roles of the technology. Chatbots may have a beneficial role to play in health care to support motivate and coach patients as well as for streamlining organizational tasks in essence chatbots could become a surrogate for nonmedical caregivers. However concerns remain on the inability of chatbots to comprehend the emotional state of humans as well as in areas where expert medical knowledge and intelligence is required.;2019
Background: Positive psychology interventions show promise for reducing psychosocial distress associated with health adversity and have the potential to be widely disseminated to young adults through technology. Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility of delivering positive psychology skills via the Vivibot chatbot and its effects on key psychosocial well-being outcomes in young adults treated for cancer. Methods: Young adults (age 18-29 years) were recruited within 5 years of completing active cancer treatment by using the Vivibot chatbot on Facebook messenger. Participants were randomized to either immediate access to Vivibot content (experimental group) or access to only daily emotion ratings and access to full chatbot content after 4 weeks (control). Created using a human-centered design process with young adults treated for cancer Vivibot content includes 4 weeks of positive psychology skills daily emotion ratings video and other material produced by survivors and periodic feedback check-ins. All participants were assessed for psychosocial well-being via online surveys at baseline and weeks 2 4 and 8. Analyses examined chatbot engagement and open-ended feedback on likability and perceived helpfulness and compared experimental and control groups with regard to anxiety and depression symptoms and positive and negative emotion changes between baseline and 4 weeks. To verify the main effects follow-up analyses compared changes in the main outcomes between 4 and 8 weeks in the control group once participants had access to all chatbot content. Results: Data from 45 young adults (36 women mean age: 25 [SD 2.9] experimental group: n=25 control group: n=20) were analyzed. Participants in the experimental group spent an average of 74 minutes across an average of 12 active sessions chatting with Vivibot and rated their experience as helpful (mean 2.0/3 SD 0.72) and would recommend it to a friend (mean 6.9/10 SD 2.6). Open-ended feedback noted its nonjudgmental nature as a particular benefit of the chatbot. After 4 weeks participants in the experimental group reported an average reduction in anxiety of 2.58 standardized t-score units while the control group reported an increase in anxiety of 0.7 units. A mixed-effects models revealed a trend-level (P=.09) interaction between group and time with an effect size of 0.41. Those in the experimental group also experienced greater reductions in anxiety when they engaged in more sessions (z=-1.9 P=.06). There were no significant (or trend level) effects by group on changes in depression positive emotion or negative emotion. Conclusions: The chatbot format provides a useful and acceptable way of delivering positive psychology skills to young adults who have undergone cancer treatment and supports anxiety reduction. Further analysis with a larger sample size is required to confirm this pattern.;2019
Background: The ability of nursing undergraduates to communicate effectively with health care providers patients and their family members is crucial to their nursing professions as these can affect patient outcomes. However the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients their family members and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. Methods: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation design and development followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine Google Cloud's Dialogflow and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. Results: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman (2) taking the history of a depressed patient (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development technological limitations and expectations management which can be resolved by contingency planning open communication constant program updates refinement and training. Conclusions: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However given the infancy stage of this project further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.;2019
Background: The data regarding the use of conversational agents in oncology are scarce. Objective: The aim of this study was to verify whether an artificial conversational agent was able to provide answers to patients with breast cancer with a level of satisfaction similar to the answers given by a group of physicians. Methods: This study is a blind noninferiority randomized controlled trial that compared the information given by the chatbot Vik with that given by a multidisciplinary group of physicians to patients with breast cancer. Patients were women with breast cancer in treatment or in remission. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Group information questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-INFO25) was adapted and used to compare the quality of the information provided to patients by the physician or the chatbot. The primary outcome was to show that the answers given by the Vik chatbot to common questions asked by patients with breast cancer about their therapy management are at least as satisfying as answers given by a multidisciplinary medical committee by comparing the success rate in each group (defined by a score above 3). The secondary objective was to compare the average scores obtained by the chatbot and physicians for each INFO25 item. Results: A total of 142 patients were included and randomized into two groups of 71. They were all female with a mean age of 42 years (SD 19). The success rates (as defined by a score >3) was 69% (49/71) in the chatbot group versus 64% (46/71) in the physicians group. The binomial test showed the noninferiority (P<.001) of the chatbot's answers. Conclusions: This is the first study that assessed an artificial conversational agent used to inform patients with cancer. The EORTC INFO25 scores from the chatbot were found to be noninferior to the scores of the physicians. Artificial conversational agents may save patients with minor health concerns from a visit to the doctor. This could allow clinicians to spend more time to treat patients who need a consultation the most.;2019
Background: The integration of new scientific discoveries into clinical practice costs considerable time and resources. With the increased use of social media for scientific communication new opportunities arise to bridge the gap in translational medicine. The present study aimed to investigate how medical professionals access scientific information and understand their view on the role of social media in translational medicine. Methods: A questionnaire regarding (i) the use of social media for scientific updates (ii) the opportunities and challenges of social media for translational medicine (iii) social media function Chatbot and (iv) participant demographics was developed. The survey link was posted online from February 2018 until April 2018. Results: A total of 555 professionals responded to the survey. Respondents identified themselves predominantly as researcher/scientists (27%) or medical/biomedical students (15%). The majority of participants was employed at a university or research institute (59%) and most practiced either in Europe (48%) or in Asia (37%). Seventy-eight percent of respondents reported receiving most of scientific news and updates via non-social media options such as journal websites and newspapers. Fifty-one percent of respondents believed that social media could contribute to closing the gap between scientific discovery and translation to medical application. The most crucial opportunity created by social media was found to be connecting the right scientist to the right clinician. Participants rated the translation of scientific finding to clinical practice is too fast before the safety is properly demonstrated as the most crucial challenge. Half of the respondents were aware of their institutions policy on the professional use of social media. Only 2% of respondents had previously used Chatbot. Conclusions: Overall medical professionals were positive about the idea that social media could contribute to the progress of translational medicine. However it is clear that they are still being cautious about using social media for professional purposes. To fully harness the potential of social media on translational medicine the medical community needs to be provided with educational programs guidelines and support infrastructure within social media.;2019
Background: The use of chatbots has increased considerably in recent years. These are used in different areas and by a wide variety of users. Due to this fact it is essential to incorporate usability in their development. Aim: Our objective is to identify the state-of-the-art in chatbot usability and applied human-computer interaction techniques to analyze how to evaluate chatbot usability. Method: We have conducted a systematic mapping study by searching the main scientific databases. The search retrieved 170 references and 21 articles were retained as primary studies. Results: The works were categorized according to four criteria: usability techniques usability characteristics research methods and type of chatbots. Conclusions: Chatbot usability is still a very incipient field of research where the published studies are mainly surveys usability tests and rather informal experimental studies. Hence it becomes necessary to perform more formal experiments to measure user experience and exploit these results to provide usability-aware design guidelines.;2019
Background: The wide scale and severity of consequences of tobacco use benefits derived from cessation low rates of intervention by healthcare professionals and new opportunities stemming from novel communications technologies are the main factors motivating this project. Thus the purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention that helps people cease smoking and increase their nicotine abstinence rates in the long term via a chat-bot compared to usual practice utilizing a chemical validation at 6 months. Methods: Design: Randomized controlled multicentric pragmatic clinical trial with a 6-month follow-up. Setting: Healthcare centers in the public healthcare system of the Community of Madrid (Madrid Regional Health Service). Participants: Smokers > 18 years of age who attend a healthcare center and accept help to quit smoking in the following month. N = 460 smokers (230 per arm) who will be recruited prior to randomization. Intervention group: use of a chat-bot with evidence-based contents to help quit smoking. Control group: Usual treatment (according to the protocol for tobacco cessation by the Madrid Regional Health Service Main variable: Continuous nicotine withdrawal with chemical validation (carbon monoxide in exhaled air). Intention-to-treat analysis. Difference between groups in continuous abstinence rates at 6 months with their corresponding 95% confidence interval. A logistic regression model will be built to adjust for confounding factors. Results: First expected results in January 2020. Discussion: Providing science-based evidence on the effectiveness of clinical interventions via information technologies without the physical presence of a professional is essential. In addition to being more efficient the characteristics of these interventions can improve effectiveness accessibility and adherence to treatment. From an ethics perspective this new type of intervention must be backed by scientific evidence to circumvent pressures from the market or particular interests improve patient safety and follow the standards of correct practices for clinical interventions.;2019
Background: There are an estimated 800000 suicides per year globally and approximately 16000000 suicide attempts. Mobile apps may help address the unmet needs of people at risk. We assessed adherence of suicide prevention advice in depression management and suicide prevention apps to six evidence-based clinical guideline recommendations: mood and suicidal thought tracking safety plan development recommendation of activities to deter suicidal thoughts information and education access to support networks and access to emergency counseling. Methods: A systematic assessment of depression and suicide prevention apps available in Google Play and Apple's App Store was conducted. Apps were identified by searching 42matters in January 2019 for apps launched or updated since January 2017 using the terms depression depressed depress mood disorders suicide and self-harm. General characteristics of apps adherence with six suicide prevention strategies identified in evidence-based clinical guidelines using a 50-question checklist developed by the study team and trustworthiness of the app based on HONcode principles were appraised and reported as a narrative review using descriptive statistics. Results: The initial search yielded 2690 potentially relevant apps. Sixty-nine apps met inclusion criteria and were systematically assessed. There were 20 depression management apps (29%) 3 (4%) depression management and suicide prevention apps and 46 (67%) suicide prevention apps. Eight (12%) depression management apps were chatbots. Only 5/69 apps (7%) incorporated all six suicide prevention strategies. Six apps (6/69 9%) including two apps available in both app stores and downloaded more than one million times each provided an erroneous crisis helpline number. Most apps included emergency contact information (65/69 apps 94%) and direct access to a crisis helpline through the app (46/69 apps 67%). Conclusions: Non-existent or inaccurate suicide crisis helpline phone numbers were provided by mental health apps downloaded more than 2 million times. Only five out of 69 depression and suicide prevention apps offered all six evidence-based suicide prevention strategies. This demonstrates a failure of Apple and Google app stores and the health app industry in self-governance and quality and safety assurance. Governance levels should be stratified by the risks and benefits to users of the app such as when suicide prevention advice is provided.;2019
Background: This meta-analysis focused on the teaching of skills to individuals with intellectual disability (ID) to maximise independence increase the likelihood of full participation in all aspects of life economic self-sufficiency and independent living. Visual activity schedules (VAS) is an intervention with a growing evidence base that focuses on developing independence. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of VAS effects on independence skills of individuals with ID. Thirteen single-case design studies met the meta-analytic inclusion criteria including evidence of a functional relationship via visual analysis. For each graph three effect size metrics were calculated. The overall effect sizes were calculated with a random effect models and potential influence of moderators with meta-analytic regression models. Results: Results suggest that VAS has a meaningful impact on increasing independent skills for individuals with ID with type of instruction the only moderator. Conclusions: The results suggest all modes of VAS are likely to yield positive effects across age groups settings and skills.;2019
Background: Training therapists is both expensive and time-consuming. Degree-based training can require tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Counseling skills practice often involves role-plays standardized patients or practice with real clients. Performance-based feedback is critical for skill development and expertise but trainee therapists often receive minimal and subjective feedback which is distal to their skill practice. Objective: In this study we developed and evaluated a patient-like neural conversational agent which provides real-time feedback to trainees via chat-based interaction. Methods: The text-based conversational agent was trained on an archive of 2354 psychotherapy transcripts and provided specific feedback on the use of basic interviewing and counseling skills (ie open questions and reflections-summary statements of what a client has said). A total of 151 nontherapists were randomized to either (1) immediate feedback on their use of open questions and reflections during practice session with ClientBot or (2) initial education and encouragement on the skills. Results: Participants in the ClientBot condition used 91% (21.4/11.2) more reflections during practice with feedback (P<.001) and 76% (14.1/8) more reflections after feedback was removed (P<.001) relative to the control group. The treatment group used more open questions during training but not after feedback was removed suggesting that certain skills may not improve with performance-based feedback. Finally after feedback was removed the ClientBot group used 31% (32.5/24.7) more listening skills overall (P<.001). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that practice and feedback can improve trainee use of basic counseling skills.;2019
BackgroundTo assess the educational impact of a one-to-one tablet PC (TPC) program by analysing university students' learning skills and related scores of the National Dental Examination (NDE) in Germany.MethodsThe study design was a mixed-method approach consisting of a survey and a comparison of NDE scores. Students received a loaned non-preloaded and non-managed TPC during three consecutive orthodontic semesters. Usability and learning benefits in clinical and nonclinical settings were assessed by a survey. After the participating students had passed the NDE in a standard period of study their grades were compared with those of students from the semester prior to TPC introduction.ResultsOne hundred and eight students (36 females and 72 males) received an TPC and participated in the survey. Of these 53 passed the NDE in a standard period of study. 64 students from the semester before TPC introduction who passed in the regular period of study were chosen as non-TPC control group.Survey: Students' expectations concerning TPC benefits increased significantly after TPC usage (P=0.000). TPCs were rated more useful for learning at places outside the clinic setting than for inside (P=0.000). PDFs and communication applications were used more in nonclinical settings (P=0.008 and 0.000 respectively). NDE scores: Concerning the examination parts relating to theoretical knowledge and clinical knowledge students with full TPC use achieved higher scores than did those without TPC use (P=0.006 and 0.002 respectively). Scores for manual skills showed no differences neither for students with and without TPC nor within the semester after TPC introduction (P=1.000).ConclusionsThis is the first study to analyse a one-to-one TPC program in the orthodontic curriculum and measure the effect of TPC usage on NDE scores. Students' expectations concerning the TPC benefit in the orthodontic curriculum improved significantly after using the devices. We have shown that NDE scores in theoretical knowledge increased significantly after TPC deployment whereas scores in motor skills remained unchanged. The results suggest that the TPC has a positive learning effect on theoretical knowledge in orthodontics.;2019
BackgroundVariations in care models contribute to cancer pain being under-recognised and under-treated in half of all patients with cancer. International and national cancer pain management guidelines are achievable with minimal investment but require practice changes. While much of the cancer pain research over the preceding decades has focused on management interventions little attention has been given to achieving better adherence to recommended cancer pain guideline screening and assessment practices. This trial aims to reduce unrelieved cancer pain by improving cancer and palliative doctors' and nurses' (clinicians') pain assessment capabilities through a targeted inter-professional clinical education intervention delivered to participants' mobile devices (mHealth').MethodsA wait-listed randomised control trial design. Cancer and/or palliative care physicians and nurses employed at one of the six participating sites across Australia will be eligible to participate in this trial and on enrolment will be allocated to the active or wait-listed arm. Participants allocated to the active arm will be invited to complete the mHealth cancer pain assessment intervention. In this trial mHealth is defined as medical or public health practice supported by mobile devices (i.e. phones patient monitoring devices personal digital assistants and other wireless devices). This mHealth intervention integrates three evidence-based elements namely: the COM-B theoretical framework spaced learning pedagogy and audit and feedback. This intervention will be delivered via the QStream online platform to participants' mobile devices over four weeks. The trial will determine if a tailored mHealth intervention targeting clinicians' cancer pain assessment capabilities is effective in reducing self-reported cancer pain scores as measured by a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).DiscussionIf this mHealth intervention is found to be effective in addition to improving cancer pain assessment practices it will provide a readily transferable evidence-based framework that could readily be applied to other evidence practice gaps and a scalable intervention that could be administered simultaneously to multiple clinicians across diverse geographical locations. Moreover if found to be cost-effective it will help transform clinical continuing professional development. In summary this mHealth intervention will provide health services with an opportunity to offer an evidence-based pedagogically robust cost-effective scalable training alternative.Trial registrationAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12618001103257.

Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are unique ways to incorporate the benefits of technology and psychology to address differing health needs through various media including Internet interventions mobile apps and video games. BITs present several possible benefits including increased dissemination and accessibility cost-effectiveness increased engagement and decreased stigma especially among youth. A behavioral coaching chatbot Tess addresses different facets of behavioral health such as depression and anxiety. Available 24/7 Tess delivers customized integrative support psychoeducation and interventions through brief conversations via existing communication channels (i.e. SMS text messaging and Facebook Messenger). This study assessed the feasibility of integrating Tess in behavioral counseling of adolescent patients (n = 23 M-age = 15.20 years Range(age) = 9.78-18.54 years 57% female) coping with weight management and prediabetes symptoms. Tess engaged patients via a preferred method of communication (SMS text messaging) in individualized conversations to promote treatment adherence behavior change and overall wellness. Adolescent patients reported experiencing positive progress toward their goals 81% of the time. The 4123 messages exchanged and patients' reported usefulness ratings (96% of the time) illustrate that adolescents engaged with and viewed this chatbot as helpful. These results highlight the feasibility and benefit of support through artificial intelligence specifically in a pediatric setting which could be scaled to serve larger groups of patients. As a partner to clinicians Tess can continue the therapeutic interaction outside office hours while maintaining patient satisfaction. Due to Tess's capacity for continuous learning future iterations may have additional features to increase the user experience.;2019
Big Data and Deep Learning algorithms combined with enormous computing power have paved ways for significant technological advancements. Technology is evolving to anticipate understand and address our unmet needs. However to fully meet human needs machines or computers must deeply understand human behavior including emotions. Emotions are physiological states generated in humans as a reaction to internal or external events. They are complex and studied across numerous fields including computer science. As humans on reading Why don't you ever text me! we can either interpret it as a sad or an angry emotion and the same ambiguity exists for machines as well. Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations make detecting emotions in text a challenging problem. However in today's online world humans are increasingly communicating using text messaging applications and digital agents. Hence it is imperative for machines to understand emotions in textual dialogue to provide emotionally aware responses to users. In this paper we propose a novel Deep Learning based approach to detect emotions- Happy Sad and Angry in textual dialogues. The essence of our approach lies in combining both semantic and sentiment based representations for more accurate emotion detection. We use semi-automated techniques to gather large scale training data with diverse ways of expressing emotions to train our model. Evaluation of our approach on real world dialogue datasets reveals that it significantly outperforms traditional Machine Learning baselines as well as other off-the-shelf Deep Learning models.;2019
Building an empathic conversation agent in open-domain is a key step towards affective computing and intelligent interactions. However most current methods either focus on the consistency of content or the controllability of emotion and handling both factors are not yet properly solved. In this paper we propose the multi-task and dual attentions (MTDA) framework for generating an emotional response. The MTDA framework decomposes the input utterance into the content layer and emotional layer and then encodes and decodes them separately which makes this end-to-end model more interpretable and controllable. A multi-task learning based encoder is employed in the MTDA framework which can obtain the representation of the content and the emotion through unsupervised learning and supervised learning. A dual attention mechanism is adopted for decoding which ensures that specific emotional responses are coherent with the content and the emotion of the input. We also combine the MTDA framework with state of the art generative models to train emotional generation systems. Extensive experiments show that our model can not only adapt to different target emotion goals but also generate coherent and informative responses.;2019
Chatbots are predicted to play a key role in customer service. Users' trust in such chatbots is critical for their uptake. However there is a lack of knowledge concerning users' trust in chatbots. To bridge this knowledge gap we present a questionnaire study (N = 154) that investigated factors of relevance for trust in customer service chatbots. The study included two parts: an explanatory investigation of the relative importance of factors known to predict trust from the general literature on interactive systems and an exploratory identification of other factors of particular relevance for trust in chatbots. The participants were recruited as part of their dialogue with one of four chatbots for customer service. Based on the findings we propose an initial model of trust in chatbots for customer service including chatbot-related factors (perceived expertise and responsiveness) environment-related factors (risk and brand perceptions) and user-related factors (propensity to trust technology). RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS We extend the current knowledge base on natural language interfaces by investigating factors affecting users' trust in chatbots for customer service. Chatbot-related factors specifically perceived expertise and responsiveness are found particularly important to users' trust in such chatbots but also environment-related factors such as brand perception and user-related factors such as propensity to trust technology. On the basis of the findings we propose an initial model of users' trust chatbots for customer service.;2019
Chatbots are replacing human agents in a number of domains from online tutoring to customer-service to even cognitive therapy. But they are often machine-like in their interactions. What can we do to humanize chatbots? Should they necessarily be driven by human operators for them to be considered human? Or will an anthropomorphic visual cue on the interface and/or a high-level of contingent message exchanges provide humanness to automated chatbots? We explored these questions with a 2 (anthropomorphic visual cues: high vs. low anthropomorphism) x 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low message interactivity) x 2 (identity cue: chat-bot vs. human) between-subjects experiment (N = 141) in which participants interacted with a chat agent on an e-commerce site about choosing a digital camera to purchase. Our findings show that a high level of message interactivity compensates for the impersonal nature of a chatbot that is low on anthropomorphic visual cues. Moreover identifying the agent as human raises user expectations for interactivity. Theoretical as well as practical implications of these findings are discussed.;2019
Chatbots are used frequently in business to facilitate various processes particularly those related to customer service and personalization. In this article we propose novel methods of tracking human-chatbot interactions and measuring chatbot performance that take into consideration ethical concerns particularly trust. Our proposed methodology links neuroscientific methods text mining and machine learning. We argue that trust is the focal point of successful human-chatbot interaction and assess how trust as a relevant category is being redefined with the advent of deep learning supported chatbots. We propose a novel method of analyzing the content of messages produced in human-chatbot interactions using the Condor Tribefinder system we developed for text mining that is based on a machine learning classification engine. Our results will help build better social bots for interaction in business or commercial environments. (C) 2019 Kelley School of Business Indiana University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Chatbots are very much an emerging technology and there is still much to learn about how conversational user interfaces will affect the way in which humans communicate not only with computers but also with one another. Further studies on anthropomorphic agents and the projection of human characteristics onto a system are required to further develop this area. Gender stereotypes operate a profound effect on human behaviour. The application of gender to a conversational agent brings along with it the projection of user biases and preconceptions. These feelings and perceptions about an agent can be used to develop mental models of a system. Users can be inclined to measure the success of a system based on their biases and emotional connections with the agent rather than that of the system's performance. There have been many studies that show how gender affects human perceptions of a conversational agent. However there is limited research on the effect of gender when applied to a chatbot system. This chapter presents early results from a research study which indicate that chatbot gender does have an effect on users overall satisfaction and gender-stereotypical perception. Subsequent studies could focus on examining the ethical implications of the results and further expanding the research by increasing the sample size to validate statistical significance as well as recruiting a more diverse sample size from various backgrounds and experiences. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Many studies have indicated how gender affects human perceptions of a conversational agent. However there is limited research on the effect of gender when applied to a chatbot system. This research study presents early results which indicate that chatbot gender does have an effect on users overall satisfaction and gender-stereotypical perception. Users are more likely to apply gender stereotypes when a chatbot system operates within a gender-stereotypical subject domain such as mechanics and when the chatbot gender does not conform to gender stereotypes. This study raise ethical issues. Should we exploit this result and perpetuate the bias and stereotyping? Should we really have a male chatbot for technical advice bots? Is this perpetuating stereotyping the dilemma being that a male version would elicit more trust?;2019
Chatbots on social networking sites are a recent innovation in computer-mediated marketing communication. In this study 245 Facebook users between 18 and 35 years of age (M-age = 25.97 SD = 4.92) were asked to order tickets for the movies through Cinebot a Facebook chatbot specifically built for the study. Afterwards they were asked to evaluate their experiences via an online survey. The first purpose of this article was to investigate whether and how perceived helpfulness and usefulness of a chatbot consulted on the Facebook Messenger platform affected perceived intrusiveness of chatbot-initiated advertising in a later stage. In a second analysis the relation between perceived intrusiveness and patronage intentions (i.e. purchase and recommendation intention of the product) was investigated. In addition the role of message acceptance as a mediator and perceived message relevance as a moderator in this latter model were explored. As to the best of our knowledge our study is the first to investigate chatbot advertising our research findings may hold important managerial implications.;2019
Chat-oriented dialogue systems sometimes generate inappropriate response utterances to user utterances that cause dialogue breakdown. Detecting such inappropriate utterances and suppressing them will support the continuation of the dialogue. Although a previous state-of-the-art dialogue breakdown detector leveraged dialogue-act transitions and word-based similarities between utterance pairs these features are insufficient to evaluate the appropriateness of question-answering or relatedness between utterances that share few topic words. In this paper we propose novel features to assess these problems and examine their effectiveness for improving the performance of dialogue breakdown detection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Contemporary research on aging has provided mixed evidence for whether older adults are less effective than younger adults at designing and delivering spoken utterances. However mast of these studies have focused on only specific aspects of this process. In addition they tend to vary significantly in terms of the degree of complexity in their chosen stimuli or task. The present study compares younger and older adults' performance using a referential production paradigm involving simple everyday objects. We varied referential context such 5 that a target object was either unique in its category (e.g. one shirt) or was accompanied by a same-category object (e.g. two shirts). We evaluated whether speakers' descriptions provided listeners with sufficient information for identification and whether speakers spontaneously adapt their speech for different addressee types (younger adult older adult automated dialogue system). A variety of measures were included to provide a comprehensive perspective on adults' performance. Interestingly the results revealed few or no age differences in measures related to production performance (speech onset latency speech rate and fluency). In contrast consistent differences were observed for measures related to descriptive content both in terms of informativity and variability in lexical selection: Older adults not only provided more information than necessary for referential success (e.g. superfluous modifiers) but also exhibited greater variability in their selection of modifiers. The results show that although certain aspects of the production process are well-preserved across the adult lifespan meaningful age-related differences can still be found in simple referential tasks with everyday objects.;2019
Conversation practice while paramount for all language learners can be difficult to get enough of and very expensive. In this mobile age chatbots are an obvious means of filling this gap but have yet to realize their potential as practice partners. The current study was undertaken to examine why chatbots are not yet a substantial instrument for language learning engagement/practice and to provide direction for future practice and chatbot development. To this end building on a recent experimental study examining chatbot novelty effects students undertook a pair of conversation activities: human and human-chatbot (via speech-to-text software). Immediately following the practice conversations students' interest in the two partners was surveyed and open-ended textual feedback was collected. With these data sources and prior standardised test results regression and content analysis of the data was undertaken. Findings indicated: 1) prior interest in human conversation partners was the best single predictor of future interest in chatbot conversations 2) prior language competency was more strongly linked to interest in chatbot than human conversations 3) that the qualitative experience of having learned more with the chatbot was strongly connected to task interest even when reporting communication difficulties. Implications for practicing languages with currently available chatbots for chatbots and related educational technology as sources of student interest and directions for chatbots future development are discussed.;2019
Conversational agents (CAs) are software-based systems designed to interact with humans using natural language and have attracted considerable research interest in recent years. Following the Computers Are Social Actors paradigm many studies have shown that humans react socially to CAs when they display social cues such as small talk gender age gestures or facial expressions. However research on social cues for CAs is scattered across different fields often using their specific terminology which makes it challenging to identify classify and accumulate existing knowledge. To address this problem we conducted a systematic literature review to identify an initial set of social cues of CAs from existing research. Building on classifications from interpersonal communication theory we developed a taxonomy that classifies the identified social cues into four major categories (i.e. verbal visual auditory invisible) and ten subcategories. Subsequently we evaluated the mapping between the identified social cues and the categories using a card sorting approach in order to verify that the taxonomy is natural simple and parsimonious. Finally we demonstrate the usefulness of the taxonomy by classifying a broader and more generic set of social cues of CAs from existing research and practice. Our main contribution is a comprehensive taxonomy of social cues for CM. For researchers the taxonomy helps to systematically classify research about social cues into one of the taxonomy's categories and corresponding subcategories. Therefore it builds a bridge between different research fields and provides a starting point for interdisciplinary research and knowledge accumulation. For practitioners the taxonomy provides a systematic overview of relevant categories of social cues in order to identify implement and test their effects in the design of a CA.;2019
Conversational agents (CAs) play an important role in human computer interaction (HCI). Creating believable movements for CAs is challenging since the movements have to be meaningful and natural reflecting the coupling between gestures and speech. Studies in the past have mainly relied on rule-based or data-driven approaches. Rule-based methods focus on creating meaningful behaviors conveying the underlying message but the gestures cannot be easily synchronized with speech. Data-driven approaches especially speech-driven models can capture the relationship between speech and gestures. However they create behaviors disregarding the meaning of the message. This study proposes to bridge the gap between these two approaches overcoming their limitations. The approach builds a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) where a discrete variable is added to constrain the behaviors on the underlying constraint. The study implements and evaluates the approach with two constraints: discourse functions and prototypical behaviors. By constraining on the discourse functions (e.g. questions) the model learns the characteristic behaviors associated with a given discourse class learning the rules from the data. By constraining on prototypical behaviors (e.g. head nods) the approach can be embedded in a rule-based system as a behavior realizer creating trajectories that are timely synchronized with speech. The study proposes a DBN structure and a training approach that (1) models the cause-effect relationship between the constraint and the gestures and (2) captures the differences in the behaviors across constraints by enforcing sparse transitions between shared and exclusive states per constraint. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach over an unconstrained baseline model.;2019
Conversational agents (CM) are an integral component of many personal and business interactions. Many recent advancements in CA technology have attempted to make these interactions more natural and human-like. However it is currently unclear how human-like traits in a CA impact the way users respond to questions from the CA. In some applications where CAs may be used detecting deception is important. Design elements that make CA interactions more human-like may induce undesired strategic behaviors from human deceivers to mask their deception. To better understand this interaction this research investigates the effect of conversational skill-that is the ability of the CA to mimic human conversation-from CAs on behavioral indicators of deception. Our results show that cues of deception vary depending on CA conversational skill and that increased conversational skill leads to users engaging in strategic behaviors that are detrimental to deception detection. This fading suggests that for applications in which it is desirable to detect when individuals are lying the pursuit of more human-like interactions may be counter-productive.;2019
Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the way mental health care is delivered. By gathering diagnostic information facilitating treatment and reviewing clinician behavior conversational AI is poised to impact traditional approaches to delivering psychotherapy. While this transition is not disconnected from existing professional services specific formulations of clinician-AI collaboration and migration paths between forms remain vague. In this viewpoint we introduce four approaches to AI-human integration in mental health service delivery. To inform future research and policy these four approaches are addressed through four dimensions of impact: access to care quality clinician-patient relationship and patient self-disclosure and sharing. Although many research questions are yet to be investigated we view safety trust and oversight as crucial first steps. If conversational AI isn't safe it should not be used and if it isn't trusted it won't be. In order to assess safety trust interfaces procedures and system level workflows oversight and collaboration is needed between AI systems patients clinicians and administrators.;2019
Conversational data in social media contain a great deal of useful information and conversation anomaly detection is an important research direction in the field of sentiment analysis. Each user has his or her own specific emotional characteristic and by studying the distribution and sampling the users' emotional transitions we can simulate specific emotional transitions in the conversations. Anomaly detection in conversation data refers to detecting users' abnormal opinions and sentiment patterns as well as special temporal aspects of such patterns. This paper proposes a hybrid model that combines the convolutional neural network long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to identify users' emotions sample users' emotional transition and detect anomalies according to the transition tensor. The emotional transition sampling is implemented by improving the MCMC algorithm and the anomalies are detected by calculating the similarity between the normal transition tensor and the current transition tensor of the user. The experiment was carried on four corpora and the results show that emotions can be well sampled to conform to user's characteristics and anomaly can be detected by the proposed method. The model proposed can be used in intelligent conversation systems such as simulating the emotional transition and detecting the abnormal emotions.;2019
Conversational robots have been used to convey information to people in the real world. Android robots which have a human-like appearance are expected to be able to convey not only objective information but also subjective information such as a robot's feelings. Meanwhile as an approach to realize attractive conversation multi-party conversation by multiple robots was the focus of this study. By collaborating among several robots the robots provide information while maintaining the naturalness of conversation. However the effectiveness of interaction with people has not been surveyed using this method. In this paper to develop more efficient media to convey information we propose a scenario-based semi-passive conversation system using two androids. To verify its effectiveness we conducted a subjective experiment comparing it to a system that does not include any interaction with people and we investigated how much information the proposed system successfully conveys by using a recall test and a questionnaire about the conversation and androids. The experimental results showed that participants who engaged with the proposed system recalled more content from the conversation and felt more empathic concern for androids.;2019
Customer services are critical to all companies as they may directly connect to the brand reputation. Due to a great number of customers e-commerce companies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers' questions for example Chatbot and Hotline. On one hand each channel has limited capacity to respond to customers' requests on the other hand customers have different preferences over these channels. The current production systems are mainly built based on business rules that merely consider the tradeoffs between the resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve the optimal tradeoff between the resources and customers' satisfaction we propose a new framework based on deep reinforcement learning that directly takes both resources and user model into account. In addition to the framework we also propose a new deep-reinforcement-learning-based routing method-double dueling deep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay (PER-DoDDQN). We evaluate our proposed framework and method using both synthetic and a real customer service log data from a large financial technology company. We show that our proposed deep-reinforcement-learning-based framework is superior to the existing production system. Moreover we also show that our proposed PER-DoDDQN is better than all other deep Q-learning variants in practice which provides a more optimal routing plan. These observations suggest that our proposed method can seek the tradeoff where both channel resources and customers' satisfaction are optimal.;2019
Data-driven untying of a recursive autoencoder (RAE) is proposed for utterance intent classification for spoken dialogue systems. Although an RAE expresses a nonlinear operation on two neighboring child nodes in a parse tree in the application of spoken language understanding (SLU) of spoken dialogue systems the nonlinear operation is considered to be intrinsically different depending on the types of child nodes. To reduce the gap between the single nonlinear operation of an RAE and intrinsically different operations depending on the node types a data-driven untying of autoencoders using part-of-speech (PoS) tags at leaf nodes is proposed. When using the proposed method the experimental results on two corpora: ATIS English data set and Japanese data set of a smartphone-based spoken dialogue system showed improved accuracies compared to when using the tied RAE as well as a reasonable difference in untying between two languages.;2019
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of conversation modeling. A lot of the research has been toward making the conversational agent more human-like. As a result overall the model size increases. Bigger models require more data and are costly to build and maintain. Often for some tasks high-quality responses are not necessary. In this paper a model that consumes fewer resources and a way to augment conversation data without increasing the size of the vocabulary is proposed. The proposed model uses a modified version of the GRU instead of the LSTM to encode and decode sequences of text.;2019
Designing dialogue policies that take user behavior into account is complicated due to user variability and behavioral uncertainty. Attributed probabilistic finite-state bi-automata (A-PFSBA) have proven to be a promising framework to develop dialogue managers that capture the users' actions in its structure and adapt to them online yet developing policies robust to high user uncertainty is still challenging. In this paper the theoretical A-PFSBA dialogue management framework is augmented by formally defining the notation of exploitation policies over its structure. Under such definition multiple path-based policies are implemented those that take into account external information and those which do not. These policies are evaluated on the Let's Go corpus before and after an online learning process whose goal is to update the initial model through the interaction with end users. In these experiments the impact of user uncertainty and the model structural learning is thoroughly analyzed.;2019
Despite deep reinforcement learning has attained performance beyond human beings in many domains including games dialogue systems and robotics sample inefficient is still a limitation in the application of deep reinforcement learning. This paper develops a novel and simple gradient-based meta learning method suitable for improving learning efficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods. Rather than designing complex network or adding excessive fine tuning parameters the proposed method is simple and does not introduce any learned parameters for meta learning. Specifically according to the characteristic of different trajectories this paper proposes to weight every trajectory in model-agnostic meta-learning for meta updating gradient effectively. The key idea underlying this method is to take advantage of the relationship between different trajectories and the direction of parameter update. Additionally an end-to-end training approach is also introduced so that the proposed model can attain good results with a small amount of training data on new tasks. The statistical results of the experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm delivers state-of-the-art performance on both discrete and continuous control tasks.;2019
Despite our best efforts pediatric obesity remains an important public health issue. Although many different approaches to address this condition have been utilized few have achieved long-term success. Technology is increasingly being explored as a convenient and accessible method for delivering behavioral interventions. Stephens and colleagues report the feasibility of using a behavioral coaching social chatbot Tess to extend a multicomponent pediatric obesity intervention for adolescents. We examine the pros and cons of this approach. Although social chatbots offer an interesting and novel method for promoting round-the-clock support important issues and decisions must be carefully considered during the design phase to help ensure a safe environment for a vulnerable population.;2019
Dialog agents like digital assistants and automated chat interfaces (e.g. chatbots) are becoming more and more popular as users adapt to conversing with their devices as they do with humans. In this paper we present approaches and available tools for dialog management (DM) a component of dialog agents that handles dialog context and decides the next action for the agent to take. In this paper we establish an overview of the field of DM compare approaches and state-of-the-art tools in industry and research work on a set of dimensions and identify directions for further research work.;2019
Dialog management plays an important role in the task-oriented dialog system. Most of the previous works divide dialog management into state tracker and action selector. The two parts are modeled separately and implemented in a pipelined way which suffers from the problem of error accumulation and the feedback signal from action selector cannot be propagated to state tracker and natural language understanding module. This paper proposes a word-based partially observable Markov decision processes' dialog management that integrates natural language understanding state tracker and action selector into an end-to-end architecture. Our proposed dialog management takes the words from user utterances as inputs and then produces optimal action as well as slot values of natural language understanding which are necessary for response generation. To this end we propose a hybrid learning method which integrates reinforcement learning and supervised learning to optimize the action selector and slot filler jointly. In addition we develop a high-return prioritized experience replay to speed up the convergence of the training process. The experimental results show that the proposed dialog management outperforms four strong baselines in a series of different dialog tasks. A human user's evaluation also shows the same results. The high-return prioritized experience replay accelerates the convergence effectively especially in the scenario in which the proposed dialog management works on more complex tasks.;2019
Dialog state tracking (DST) is the key component of goal-driven Spoken Dialog Systems. Almost all existing dialog state trackers are unable to handle unknown slot values. The continuous emergence of unknown slot values in dialogs is inevitable. If unknown slot values cannot be accurately detected and distinguished the dialog states cannot be correctly updated in real time. This paper proposes a hierarchical dialog state tracking framework to model the dialog state tracking with unknown slot values. Three levels are included in the framework. Unknown slot values are identified at the first-level by a two-layer cascaded neural network as well as known slot values. Distributions for unknown and known slot values are updated separately in the second level and integrated in the third level. Experimental results on DSTC and WOZ2.0 datasets show that the proposed framework achieves good performance. Especially the detection and distinction of unknown slot values greatly improve the final performance of dialog state tracking illustrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework for addressing the problem of unknown slot values.;2019
Dialogue breakdown is a significant problem in conversational agents. Timely breakdown detection helps the agents quickly recover from mistakes minimizing the impact on user experience. In this paper we focus on two problems: variations in determining a response that breakdowns a conversation i.e. subjectivity and variations in breakdown types due to designs of conversational agents i.e. variationality. To address the subjectivity which decreases the agreement rate among annotators our methods detect a dialogue breakdown by ensembling detectors trained by different sets of annotators that are grouped using a clustering algorithm. To address the variationality our methods apply two types of detector architectures to capture global and local breakdowns. The long short-term memory detector considers the global context and the convolutional neural networks detector is sensitive to the local characteristics. The ensemble of all detectors makes a final judgment. The results of the Japanese task in the Dialogue Breakdown Detection Challenge 3 (DBDC3) confirm that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline which uses the conventional conditional random field. Detailed error analysis reveals that our encoders based on a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory have different characteristics. It also confirms the effects of annotator clustering. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2019
Dialogue management (DM) is responsible for predicting the next action of a dialogue system according to the current dialogue state and thus plays a central role in task-oriented dialogue systems. Since DM requires having access not only to local utterances but also to the global semantics of the entire dialogue session modeling the long-range history information is a critical issue. To this end we propose MAD a novel memory-augmented dialogue management model that employs a memory controller and two additional memory structures (i.e. a slot-value memory and an external memory). The slot-value memory tracks the dialogue state by memorizing and updating the values of semantic slots (i.e. cuisine price and location) and the external memory augments the representation of hidden states of traditional recurrent neural networks by storing more context information. To update the dialogue state efficiently we also propose slot-level attention on user utterances to extract specific semantic information for each slot. Experiments show that our model can obtain state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing baselines.;2019
Dialogue policy plays an important role in task-oriented spoken dialogue systems. It determines how to respond to users. The recently proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have been used for policy optimization. However these deep models are still challenging for two reasons: first many DRL-based policies are not sample efficient and second most models do not have the capability of policy transfer between different domains. In this paper we propose a universal framework AgentGraph to tackle these two problems. The proposed AgentGraph is the combination of graph neural network (GNN) based architecture and DRL-based algorithm. It can be regarded as one of the multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches. Each agent corresponds to a node in a graph which is defined according to the dialogue domain ontology. When making a decision each agent can communicate with its neighbors on the graph. Under AgentGraph framework we further propose dual GNN-based dialogue policy which implicitly decomposes the decision in each turn into a high-level global decision and a low-level local decision. Experiments show that AgentGraph models significantly outperform traditional reinforcement learning approaches on most of the 18 tasks of the PyDial benchmark. Moreover when transferred from the source task to a target task these models not only have acceptable initial performance but also converge much faster on the target task.;2019
Digital assistants (e.g. Apple's Siri Amazon's Alexa Google's Google Assistant) are highly complex and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) based technologies. Individuals can use digital assistants to perform basic personal tasks as well as for more advanced capabilities. Yet the functional and topical use of a digital assistant tends to vary by individual. This study reflects the contextual experiences of the respondents. At present there is little empirical evidence of customer satisfaction with digital assistants. PLS-SEM was used to analyse 244 survey responses to examine this research gap. The results confirmed that expectations and confirmation of expectations have a positive and significant relationship on customer satisfaction with digital assistants. This study provides evidence that customer expectations are being satisfied through the digital assistant interaction experience. As firms integrate digital assistants into their operations they must help customers properly define what to expect from the firm's interactive experience.;2019
Digital family health history tools have been developed but few have been tested with non-English speakers and evaluated for acceptability and usability. This study describes the cultural and linguistic adaptation and evaluation of a family health history tool (VICKY: VIrtual Counselor for Knowing Your Family History) for Spanish speakers. In-depth interviews were conducted with 56 Spanish-speaking participants a subset of 30 also participated in a qualitative component to evaluate the acceptability and usability of Spanish VICKY. Overall agreement in family history assessment was moderate between VICKY and a genetic counselor (weighted kappa range: 0.4695 for stroke-0.6615 for heart disease) although this varied across disease subtypes. Participants felt comfortable using VICKY and noted that VICKY was very likeable and possessed human-like characteristics. They reported that VICKY was very easy to navigate felt that the instructions were very clear and thought that the time it took to use the tool was just right. Spanish VICKY may be useful as a tool to collect family health history and was viewed as acceptable and usable. The study results shed light on some cultural differences that may influence interactions with family history tools and inform future research aimed at designing and testing culturally and linguistically diverse digital systems.;2019
Domain adaptation using source domain data is preferable in the development of Deep Q Network (DQN) based dialog systems because of the training cost for additional target domains. However the inherent domain shift hinders feature-space level generalization which degrades performance. We introduce Adversarial Calibrator based Transfer learning (ACT) to aid the coherent training of the target domain feature extractor network. In ACT the feature extractor of the target domain is considered as a generator which is trained to be matched with a pre-stored latent feature set of the source domain with adversarial training losses. We verified ACT with the PyDial framework conducting domain adaptation experiment with the following domains: San Francisco Restaurant (SFR) Cambridge Restaurant (CR) and Laptop11 (LAP). The result demonstrates that ACT outperforms beta-VAE based adaptation between the pair of distinct domains (SFR-LAP) and even outperforms individual learning between the pair of similar domains (SFR-CR).

Domain-specific goal-oriented dialogue systems typically require modeling three types of inputs namely (i) the knowledge-base associated with the domain (ii) the history of the conversation which is a sequence of utterances and (iii) the current utterance for which the response needs to be generated. While modeling these inputs current state-of-the-art models such as Mem2Seq typically ignore the rich structure inherent in the knowledge graph and the sentences in the conversation context. Inspired by the recent success of structure-aware Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for various NLP tasks such as machine translation semantic role labeling and document dating we propose a memory-augmented GCN for goal-oriented dialogues. Our model exploits (i) the entity relation graph in a knowledge-base and (ii) the dependency graph associated with an utterance to compute richer representations for words and entities. Further we take cognizance of the fact that in certain situations such as when the conversation is in a code-mixed language dependency parsers may not be available. We show that in such situations we could use the global word co-occurrence graph to enrich the representations of utterances. We experiment with four datasets: (i) the modified DSTC2 dataset (ii) recently released code-mixed versions of DSTC2 dataset in four languages (iii) Wizard-of-Oz style CAM676 dataset and (iv) Wizard-of-Oz style MultiWOZ dataset. On all four datasets our method outperforms existing methods on a wide range of evaluation metrics.;2019
Driven by 'success stories' reported by private sector firms government agencies have also started adopting various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in diverse domains (e.g. health taxation and education) however extensive research is required in order to exploit the full potential of AI in the public sector and leverage various AI technologies to address important problems/needs. This paper makes a contribution in this direction: it presents a novel approach as well as the architecture of an ICT platform supporting it for the advanced exploitation of a specific AI technology namely chatbots in the public sector in order to address a crucial issue: the improvement of communication between government and citizens (which has for long time been problematic). The proposed approach builds on natural language processing machine learning and data mining technologies and leverages existing data of various forms (such as documents containing legislation and directives structured data from government agencies' operational systems social media data etc.) in order to develop a new digital channel of communication between citizens and government. Making use of appropriately structured and semantically annotated data this channel enables 'richer' and more expressive interaction of citizens with government in everyday language facilitating and advancing both information seeking and conducting of transactions. Compared to existing digital channels the proposed approach is appropriate for a wider range of citizens' interactions with higher levels of complexity ambiguity and uncertainty. In close co-operation with three Greek government agencies (the Ministry of Finance a social security organization and a big local government organization) this approach has been validated through a series of application scenarios.;2019
Emotion is intrinsic to humans and consequently emotion understanding is a key part of human-like artificial intelligence (AI). Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is becoming increasingly popular as a new research frontier in natural language processing (NLP) due to its ability to mine opinions from the plethora of publicly available conversational data on platforms such as Facebook Youtube Reddit Twitter and others. Moreover it has potential applications in health-care systems (as a tool for psychological analysis) education (understanding student frustration) and more. In Addition ERC is also extremely important for generating emotion-aware dialogues that require an understanding of the user's emotions. Catering to these needs calls for effective and scalable conversational emotion-recognition algorithms. However it is a difficult problem to solve because of several research challenges. In this paper we discuss these challenges and shed light on recent research in this field. We also describe the drawbacks of these approaches and discuss the reasons why they fail to successfully overcome the research challenges in ERC.;2019
Emotional conversation generation has elicited a wide interest in both academia and industry. However existing emotional neural conversation systems tend to ignore the necessity to combine topic and emotion in generating responses possibly leading to a decline in the quality of responses. This paper proposes a topic-enhanced emotional conversation generation model that incorporates emotional factors and topic information into the conversation system by using two mechanisms. First we use a Twitter latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to obtain topic words of the input sequences as extra prior information ensuring the consistency of content between posts and responses for emotional conversation generation. Second the system uses a dynamic emotional attention mechanism to adaptively acquire content-related and affective information of the input texts and extra topics. The advantage of this study lies in the fact that the presented model can generate abundant emotional responses with the contents being related and diverse. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method we conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Weibo post-response pairs. Experimental results show that our method achieves good performance even outperforming some existing models. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2019
Empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are surging as new technologies with both business potential and customer pushback. This study exploits field experiment data on more than 6200 customers who are randomized to receive highly structured outbound sales calls from chatbots or human workers. Results suggest that undisclosed chatbots are as effective as proficient workers and four times more effective than inexperienced workers in engendering customer purchases. However a disclosure of chatbot identity before the machine-customer conversation reduces purchase rates by more than 79.7%. Additional analyses find that these results are robust to nonresponse bias and hang-ups and the chatbot disclosure substantially decreases call length. Exploration of the mechanisms reveals that when customers know the conversational partner is not a human they are curt and purchase less because they perceive the disclosed bot as less knowledgeable and less empathetic. The negative disclosure effect seems to be driven by a subjective human perception against machines despite the objective competence of AI chatbots. Fortunately such negative impact can be mitigated by a late disclosure timing strategy and customer prior AI experience. These findings offer useful implications for chatbot applications customer targeting and advertising in conversational commerce.;2019
End-to-end dialog systems are gaining interest due to the recent advances of deep neural networks and the availability of large human-human dialog corpora. However in spite of being of fundamental importance to systematically improve the performance of this kind of systems automatic evaluation of the generated dialog utterances is still an unsolved problem. Indeed most of the proposed objective metrics shown low correlation with human evaluations. In this paper we evaluate a two-dimensional evaluation metric that is designed to operate at sentence level which considers the syntactic and semantic information carried along the answers generated by an end-to-end dialog system with respect to a set of references. The proposed metric when applied to outputs generated by the systems participating in track 2 of the DSTC-6 challenge shows a higher correlation with human evaluations (up to 12.8% relative improvement at the system level) than the best of the alternative state-of-the-art automatic metrics currently available.

Even without speech recognition errors robots may face difficulties interpreting natural-language instructions. We present a method for robustly handling miscommunication between people and robots in task-oriented spoken dialogue. This capability is implemented in TeamTalk a conversational interface to robots that supports detection and recovery from the situated grounding problems of referential ambiguity and impossible actions. We introduce a representation that detects these problems and a nearest-neighbor learning algorithm that selects recovery strategies for a virtual robot. When the robot encounters a grounding problem it looks back on its interaction history to consider how it resolved similar situations. The learning method is trained initially on crowdsourced data but is then supplemented by interactions from a longitudinal user study in which six participants performed navigation tasks with the robot. We compare results collected using a general model to user-specific models and find that user-specific models perform best on measures of dialogue efficiency while the general model yields the highest agreement with human judges. Our overall contribution is a novel approach to detecting and recovering from miscommunication in dialogue by including situated context namely information from a robot's path planner and surroundings.;2019
For generative conversational agents especially service-oriented systems it is of great importance to improve the informativeness of generated responses and avoid bland results. In this paper we describe our attempt at generating natural and informative responses for customer service oriented dialog systems by incorporating dialog history related information and external knowledge. Two improved sequence-to-sequence frameworks are proposed to generate responses based on extra information in addition to the current user input one encodes the entire dialogue history while the other integrates external knowledge extracted from a search engine. The experimental results on the DSCT6-Track2 and Ubuntu Dialog corpora demonstrate that the proposed systems are promising to generate more informative responses. However case studies suggest that some particular features of the proposed systems and the datasets might restrict the systems to fully exploit such extra information. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

For many professional services advice adherence is a necessary condition for achieving service success for both customers and service providers. Despite their pivotal roles in value co-creation typical conversational interactions often lead to low adherence. We propose that enabling a dominance transition from provider dominance in the pre-advice stage to customer dominance in the post-advice stage enhances advice adherence because it increases customers' perceived common ground. Furthermore providers' consultation focus customers' prior knowledge and customers' perceived adherence effort moderate this process. Using mixed methods including both empirical modeling and controlled and field experiments we validate the proposed model in various contexts (healthcare financial services and fitness and wellness counseling). The findings establish several theoretical contributions and offer managerial implications for improving advice adherence by managing dominance transitions in conversational interactions more effectively through training service providers or even programming AI chatbots.;2019
Generative conversational systems consisting of a neural network-based structural model and a linguistic model have always been considered to be an attractive area. However conversational systems tend to generate single-turn responses with a lack of diversity and informativeness. For this reason the conversational system method is further developed by modeling and analyzing the joint structural and linguistic model as presented in the paper. Firstly we establish a novel dual-encoder structural model based on the new Convolutional Neural Network architecture and strengthened attention with intention. It is able to effectively extract the features of variable-length sequences and then mine their deep semantic information. Secondly a linguistic model combining the maximum mutual information with the foolish punishment mechanism is proposed. Thirdly the conversational system for the joint structural and linguistic model is observed and discussed. Then to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method some different models are tested evaluated and compared with respect to Response Coherence Response Diversity Length of Conversation and Human Evaluation. As these comparative results show the proposed method is able to effectively improve the response quality of the generative conversational system.;2019
Goal-oriented dialog systems require a different approach from chit-chat conversational systems in that they should perform various subtasks as well as continue the conversation itself. Since these systems typically interact with an external knowledge base that changes over time it is desirable to incorporate domain knowledge to deal with such changes yet with minimum human effort. This paper presents an extended version of the Hybrid Code Network (HCN) developed for the Facebook AI research (FAIR) dialog dataset used in the Sixth Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC6). Compared to the original HCN the system was more adaptable to changes in the knowledge base due to the modules that are extended to be learned from data. Using the proposed learning scheme with fairly elementary domain-specific rules the proposed model achieved 100% accuracy in all test datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2019
Google's Apple's and other companies automated assistants are increasingly serving as personal shoppers. These digital intermediaries will save us time by purchasing grocery items transferring bank accounts and subscribing to cable. The literature has only begun to hint at the paradigm shift needed to navigate the legal risks and rewards of this coming era of automated commerce. This Article begins to fill that gap first by surveying legal battles related to contract exit data access and deception that will determine the extent to which automated assistants are able to help consumers to search and switch potentially bringing tremendous societal benefits. Whereas observers have largely focused on protecting consumers and sellers from digital intermediaries market power sellers like Amazon Comcast and Wells Fargo can also harm consumers by obstructing automated assistants. Advancing consumer welfare in the automated era requires not just consumer protection but digital intermediary protection. The Article also shows the unpredictable side of the end of switching costs. If digital assistants become pervasive they could gain the ability to rapidly direct millions of consumers to new purchases whenever a lower price or new innovation becomes available. Significantly accelerated consumer switching-what I call hyperswitching-does not inevitably harm society. But in the extreme it could make some large markets more volatile raising unemployment costs or financial stability concerns as more firms fail. This new kind of disruption could pose challenges for commercial and banking regulators akin to those familiar to securities regulators who deploy idiosyncratic tools such as a pause button for the stock market. Even if sellers prevent extreme hyperswitching managers may strategically prepare for hyperswitching with economically costly behavior such as hoarding liquid assets or forming conglomerates to provide insurance against a sudden exodus of customers. The transaction-cost focused literature has missed more macro-level drawbacks. The regulatory architecture reflects these scholarly gaps. One set of agencies regulates automated assistants for consumer protection and antitrust violations but does not go beyond those microeconomic inquiries. Nor do they prioritize strengthening digital intermediaries. Regulators with more macroeconomic missions lack jurisdiction over automated assistants. The intellectual framework and regulatory architecture should expand to encompass both the upsides and downsides of digital consumer sovereignty.;2019
Hazardous alcohol use remains a significant global public health problem. A better understanding of relapse may assist the development of new interventions. Low levels of dispositional mindfulness may be a risk factor for craving and alcohol use but few studies have examined these associations prospectively in an alcohol-dependent sample. In an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study. Dutch alcohol dependent patients (N = 43) carried around a personal digital assistant for 4 weeks while trying to maintain abstinence. Participants completed assessments at random times 3 times per day. and when they felt a strong urge to drink or came to the brink of drinking without doi ng so. At each assessment stress negative affect craving recent drinking and attentional or approach bias were assessed. Dispositional mindfulness was assessed at baseline with the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). More mindful individuals (higher MAAS scores) reported lower craving than less mindful individuals. There was no evidence that stress negative affect attentional bias or approach bias mediated the association between MAAS and craving. However there was evidence for an indirect path from MAAS to drinking such that higher mindfulness was associated with lower craving ratings that in turn were associated with less drinking. There was no evidence that MAAS significantly moderated associations between stress/negative affect/cognitive biases and craving. or between craving and drinking. In sum more mindful recovering alcohol dependent patients reported lower craving ratings than less mindful patients and this association appeared to be independent of stress/negative affect and cognitive biases.;2019
Human-human interaction consists of various nonverbal behaviors that are often emotion-related. To establish rapport it is essential that the listener respond to reactive emotion in a way that makes sense given the speaker's emotional state. However human-robot interactions generally fail in this regard because most spoken dialogue systems play only a question-answer role. Aiming for natural conversation we examine an emotion processing module that consists of a user emotion recognition function and a reactive emotion expression function for a spoken dialogue system to improve human-robot interaction. For the emotion recognition function we propose a method that combines valence from prosody and sentiment from text by decision-level fusion which considerably improves the performance. Moreover this method reduces fatal recognition errors thereby improving the user experience. For the reactive emotion expression function the system's emotion is divided into emotion category and emotion level which are predicted using the parameters estimated by the recognition function on the basis of distributions inferred from human-human dialogue data. As a result the emotion processing module can recognize the user's emotion from his/her speech and expresses a reactive emotion that matches. Evaluation with ten participants demonstrated that the system enhanced by this module is effective to conduct natural conversation.;2019
Implementing development surveys in developing countries can be challenging. Limited time high survey costs lack of information and technical difficulties are some of the general constraints that plague development researchers. These constraints can hinder data collection and introduce selection bias into the survey data. We outline a multilevel sampling approach for use in areas where comprehensive information on geographical or household characteristics of local population are not readily available. Our approach includes the use of geographical information systems (GIS) for random spatial sampling and personal digital assistants (PDAs) with a global positioning system (GPS) for household systematic random sampling with random walk. Evidence from our field application in Malawi show that the multilevel sampling approach yields relevant survey data which is comparable to historical and nationally representative values and supports rapid aggregation of preliminary results after the survey. This multilevel design is cost-effective in implementation and reduces bias avenues in the household selection. Overall this multilevel sampling approach can be used to generate survey data in developing countries where detailed geographical information and household characteristics data are not readily available. It also presents ways of reducing bias in survey data given budget constraints.;2019
IMPORTANCE Biologic systems involved in the regulation of motor activity are intricately linked with other homeostatic systems such as sleep feeding behavior energy and mood. Mobile monitoring technology (eg actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment devices) allows the assessment of these multiple systems in real time. However most clinical studies of mental disorders that use mobile devices have not focused on the dynamic associations between these systems. OBJECTIVES To examine the directional associations among motor activity energy mood and sleep using mobile monitoring in a community-identified sample and to evaluate whether these within-day associations differ between people with a history of bipolar or other mood disorders and controls without mood disorders. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This study used a nested case-control design of 242 adults a subsample of a community-based sample of adults. Probands were recruited by mail from the greater Washington DC metropolitan area from January 2005 to June 2013. Enrichment of the sample for mood disorders was provided by volunteers or referrals from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center or by participants in the National Institute of Mental Health Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. The inclusion criteria were the ability to speak English availability to participate and consent to contact at least 2 living first-degree relatives. Data analysis was performed from June 2013 through July 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Motor activity and sleep duration data were obtained from minute-to-minute activity counts from an actigraphy device worn on the nondominant wrist for 2 weeks. Mood and energy levels were assessed by subjective analogue ratings on the ecological momentary assessment (using a personal digital assistant) by participants 4 times per day for 2 weeks. RESULTS Of the total 242 participants 92 (38.1%) were men and 150 (61.9%) were women with a mean (SD) age of 48 (16.9) years. Among the participants 54 (22.3%) had bipolar disorder (25 with bipolar I 29 with bipolar II) 91 (37.6%) had major depressive disorder and 97 (40.1%) were controls with no history of mood disorders. A unidirectional association was found between motor activity and subjective mood level (beta = -0.018 P = .04). Bidirectional associations were observed between motor activity (beta = 0.176 P = .03) and subjective energy level (beta = 0.027 P = .03) as well as between motor activity (beta = -0.027 P = .04) and sleep duration (beta = -0.154 P = .04). Greater cross-domain reactivity was observed in bipolar disorder across all outcomes including motor activity sleep mood and energy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that interventions focused on motor activity and energymay have greater efficacy than current approaches that target depressed mood both active and passive tracking of multiple regulatory systems are important in designing therapeutic targets.;2019
In a Turing test a judge decides whether their conversation partner is either a machine or human. What cues does the judge use to determine this? In particular are presumably unique features of human language actually perceived as humanlike? Participants rated the humanness of a set of sentences that were manipulated for grammatical construction: linear right-branching or hierarchical center-embedded and their plausibility with regard to world knowledge. We found that center-embedded sentences are perceived as less humanlike than right-branching sentences and more plausible sentences are regarded as more humanlike. However the effect of plausibility of the sentence on perceived humanness is smaller for center-embedded sentences than for right-branching sentences. Participants also rated a conversation with either correct or incorrect use of the context by the agent. No effect of context use was found. Also participants rated a full transcript of either a real human or a real chatbot and we found that chatbots were reliably perceived as less humanlike than real humans in line with our expectation. We did however find individual differences between chatbots and humans. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2019
In dialogue systems understanding the user utterances is crucial for providing appropriate responses. A traditional dialogue act classification (DA) task is to classify each user reply into ACCEPT REJECT PROPOSE and others. In contrast in this paper we define the DA task on multiple round conversations between humans. The re-defined task is to classify a full dialogue according to the intention of one participant. We term this task as intention classification (IC). We then propose a hybrid neural network-based ensemble model for solving this problem. Two novel ensemble schemes are introduced for combining the classification results or features from various classifiers. One is ensembling features from each individual classifier using stacking and we term this scheme as SEE. The other is adding wrong examples' weight to loss functions of each individual classifier using the AdaBoost scheme and we term this scheme as MN-Ada. We have empirically examined the performance of the proposed ensemble schemes by using three popular deep neural networks as well as one newly modified networks for IC. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a Chinese dialogue corpus. Our model can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the experimental dialogue corpus.;2019
In human-to-human conversations the context generally provides several backgrounds and strategic points for the following response. Therefore many response generation approaches have explored the methodologies to incorporate the context into the encoder-decoder architecture to generate context-aware responses that are remarkably relevant and cohesive to the given context. However most approaches pay less attention to semantic interactions implicitly existing within contextual utterances which are of great importance to capture semantic clues of the given dialog context indeed. This paper proposes a dynamic working memory mechanism to model long-term semantic hints in the conversation context by performing semantic interactions between utterances and updating context representation dynamically. Then the outputs of the dynamic working memory are employed to provide helpful clues for the encoder-decoder architecture to generate responses to the given dialog. We have evaluated the proposed approach on Twitter Customer Service Corpus and OpenSubtitles Corpus with several automatic evaluation metrics and the human evaluation and the empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.;2019
In many applications Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) must be able to express various affects such as emotions or social attitudes. Non-verbal signals such as smiles or gestures contribute to the expression of attitudes. Social attitudes affect the whole behavior of a person: they are characteristic of an affective style that colors the entire interaction [1] . Moreover recent findings have demonstrated that non-verbal signals are not interpreted in isolation but along with surrounding signals. Non-verbal behavior planning models designed to allow ECAs to express attitudes should thus consider complete sequences of non-verbal signals and not only signals independently of one another. However existing models do not take this into account or in a limited manner. The contribution of this paper is a methodology for the automatic extraction of sequences of non-verbal signals characteristic of a social phenomenon from a multimodal corpus and a non-verbal behavior planning model that takes into account sequences of non-verbal signals rather than signals independently. This methodology is applied to design a virtual recruiter capable of expressing social attitudes which is then evaluated in and out of an interaction context.;2019
In recent years deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved impressive performance in many different fields including playing games robotics and dialogue systems. However there are still a lot of restrictions here one of which is the demand for massive amounts of sampled data. In this paper a hierarchical meta-learning method based on the actor-critic algorithm is proposed for sample efficient learning. This method provides the transferable knowledge that can efficiently train an actor on a new task with a few trials. Specifically a global basic critic meta critic and task specified network are shared within a distribution of tasks and are capable of criticizing any actor trying to solve any specified task. The hierarchical framework is applied to a critic network in the actor-critic algorithm for distilling meta-knowledge above the task level and addressing distinct tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple classic control tasks with reinforcement learning algorithms including the start-of-the-art meta-learning methods. The experimental results statistically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and attains better results with more depth of meta critic network.;2019
In recent years mental health management of employees in companies has become increasingly important. As the number of psychotherapists is not enough it is necessary for employees to be able to keep their mental wellness on their own. A self-guided mental healthcare course using VR devices has been developed and its stress reduction effect has been validated previously. This study proposes a new version of the course using smartphones and chatbots to enhance its convenience for use and to maintain user motivation for daily and repeated use. The effects of stress reduction and motivation maintenance were acknowledged.;2019
In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) IoT conversational agents (IoT-CAs) have become the gateways for smart spaces. Users will inevitably self-disclose some types of personal information while interacting with IoT-CAs. In this study users' willingness to disclose different types of information to IoT-CAs in two smart spaces (living space and workspace) and two user contexts (one user or two users) was investigated. One living space and one workspace were built for users to experience interactions with IoT-CAs. Subsequently users' willingness to self-disclose six types of personal information was measured. Two experiments were separately conducted for a single user (N = 36) and two users (N = 48). The results indicated that users were most willing to disclose information about their tastes and interests and least willing to disclose money information. Users in the living space were willing to disclose more information than those in the workspace which was mediated by users' expectations for the reciprocal services of IoT-CAs rather than the awareness of other persons or external factors. Participants had a high private self-awareness in the living space and workspace their attention was focused on themselves rather than on external factors in smart spaces.;2019
In the imminent future people are likely to engage with smart devices by instructing them in natural language. A fundamental question to ask is how might intelligent agents interpret such instructions and learn new tasks. In this article we present the first speech-based virtual assistant that can be taught new commands by speech. A user study on our agent has shown that people can teach it new commands. We also show that people see great advantage in using an instructable agent and determine what users believe are the most important use cases of such an agent.;2019
In the present study we tested a daily messaging intervention aimed at promoting the reduction of red and processed meat consumption (RPMC). We randomly allocated 180 young adults to three different message conditions. Participants in the informational condition read messages on the consequences of excessive RPMC on one's health and the environment. Participants in the emotional condition read messages eliciting anticipated regret for the consequences of excessive RPMC on ones health and the environment. Participants in the control condition read messages on the health and the environment consequences of sugar consumption. We sent messages through a chatbot every morning for two weeks. RPMC attitude intention and anticipated regret regarding RPMC were measured three times: before the two-week messaging intervention (baseline) immediately after the intervention (post intervention) and two months thereafter (follow up). RPMC was also measured through food diaries completed for two weeks after the intervention. Compared to the control condition participants exposed to emotional messages reduced RPMC at follow up while this was not the case for participants exposed to informational messages. In addition anticipated regret and intention mediated the effects of emotional messages on RPMC. Implications for devising effective messaging interventions to change RPMC are discussed.;2019
In this article we argue that journalism studies and particularly research focused on automated journalism has much to learn from Human-Machine Communication (HMC) an emerging conceptual framework and empirically grounded research domain that has formed in response to the growing number of technologies-such as chatbots sodas bots and other communicative agents enabled by developments in artificial intelligence (AI)-that are designed to function as message sources rather than as message channels. While the underlying but often unquestioned theoretical assumption in most communication research is that humans are communicators and machines are mediators within HMC this assumption is challenged by asking what happens when a machine steps into this formerly human role. More than merely a semantic move this theoretical reorientation opens up new questions about who or what constitutes a communicator how social relationships are established through exchange among humans and machines and what the resulting implications may be for self society and communication. In the particular case of automated journalism-in which software assumes a news-writing role that has long been considered a distinctly central and indeed human element of journalism-the introduction of HMC offers a generative starting point for theory development advancing our understanding of humans machines and news for an oncoming era of AI technologies.;2019
In this paper we propose to combine speech-based and linguistic classification in order to obtain better emotion recognition results for user spoken utterances. Usually these approaches are considered in isolation and even developed by different communities working on emotion recognition and sentiment analysis. We propose modeling the users emotional state by means of the fusion of the outputs generated with both approaches taking into account information that is usually neglected in the individual approaches such as the interaction context and errors and the peculiarities of transcribed spoken utterances. The fusion approach allows to employ different recognizers and can be integrated as an additional module in the architecture of a spoken conversational agent using the information generated as an additional input for the dialog manager to decide the next system response. We have evaluated our proposal using three emotionally-colored databases and obtained very positive results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2019
In this paper we introduce the Task Dependent Recurrent Entity Network (TDREN) to solve Dialogue System Technology Challenges 6 (DSTC 6) track 1. Traditionally there have been methods such as collecting the intent of the user in a conversation directly using rules. We design an end-to-end structure that properly models the restaurant pre-related user preferences that appear in the dialogue and gives appropriate responses. We perform experiments on the TDREN and achieved 97.7% at precision 1. We propose a new artificial neural network structure and recurrent cell for modeling user preference information. Then we show that task-oriented dialogue modeling experiment results using the structure and the recurrent cell. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2019
In this paper we present a methodology for the development of embodied conversational agents for social virtual worlds. The agents provide multimodal communication with their users in which speech interaction is included. Our proposal combines different techniques related to Artificial Intelligence Natural Language Processing Affective Computing and User Modeling. A statistical methodology has been developed to model the system conversational behavior which is learned from an initial corpus and improved with the knowledge acquired from the successive interactions. In addition the selection of the next system response is adapted considering information stored into user's profiles and also the emotional contents detected in the user's utterances. Our proposal has been evaluated with the successful development of an embodied conversational agent which has been placed in the Second Life social virtual world. The avatar includes the different models and interacts with the users who inhabit the virtual world in order to provide academic information. The experimental results show that the agent's conversational behavior adapts successfully to the specific characteristics of users interacting in such environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we propose a new natural language generation (NLG) method for spoken dialog systems and demonstrate its capacity. Studies on NLG often employ sequence decoding which generates the words comprising a sentence in sequential order and uses the input generated by each word in the previous step. In contrast we propose a decoding method that employs a sequence generated by traversing a dependency tree with feed input to a pair consisting of a parent and sibling in the dependency tree. As a result the most important words are generated first thereby enabling words with greater relevance to be fed into the process. At prediction time our model generates dependency trees and converts the trees into sentences. The proposed decoding method was evaluated by re-implementing a semantically controlled long short-term memory structure for NLG and the input and predicted sequence were converted to allow dependency tree decoding. The experimental results indicated that our suggested approach i.e. dependency tree decoding dramatically elevates the BLEU-score and naturalness. Furthermore when creating sentences with n-best using dependency tree decoding the word diversity of the output sentences was increased by approximately 6% offering a more diverse sentence pattern.;2019
Incorporating prior knowledge like lexical constraints into the model's output to generate meaningful and coherent sentences has many applications in dialogue system machine translation image captioning etc. However existing auto-regressive models incrementally generate sentences from left to right via beam search which makes it difficult to directly introduce lexical constraints into the generated sentences. In this paper we propose a new algorithmic framework dubbed BFGAN to address this challenge. Specifically we employ a backward generator and a forward generator to generate lexically constrained sentences together and use a discriminator to guide the joint training of two generators by assigning them reward signals. Due to the difficulty of BFGAN training we propose several training techniques to make the training process more stable and efficient. Our extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets with human evaluation demonstrate that BFGAN has significant improvements over previous methods.;2019
Integrating speech recondition technology into an electronic health record (EHR) has been studied in recent years. However the full adoption of the system still faces challenges such as handling speech errors transforming raw data into an understandable format and controlling the transition from one field to the next field with speech commands. To reduce errors cost and documentation time we propose a dialogue system care record (DSCR) based on a smartphone for nursing documentation. We describe the effects of DSCR on (1) documentation speed (2) document accuracy and (3) user satisfaction. We tested the application with 12 participants to examine the usability and feasibility of DSCR. The evaluation shows that DSCR can collect data efficiently by achieving 96% of documentation accuracy. Average documentation speed was increased by 15% (P = 0.012) compared to traditional electronic forms (e-forms). The participants' average satisfaction rating was 4.8 using DSCR compared to 3.6 using e-forms on a scale of 1-5 (P = 0.032).;2019
Intelligent tutors and conversational agents (CAs) have proven to be useful learning tools. They have potential not only as stand-alone devices but also as integrable components to enrich and complement other educational resources. For this new authoring approaches and platforms are required. They should be accessible to non-programmers (such as most teachers) and they should be integrable into current web-based educational platforms. This paper proposes a new approach to define such agents through a visual domain-specific language based on Google Blockly (a scratch-like language). It also develops a web-based integrable authoring platform to serve as a prototype describing the requirements and architecture. To evaluate whether this novel approach is effective a multi-stage experiment was conducted. First participants learned to use the prototype authoring platform through an interactive tutorial. Second they created a CA with a specific domain model. Times and performance were measured. Finally they answered a standardized usability questionnaire (UMUX) and a purpose-specific survey. Results show that participants were able to learn to use the domain-specific language in a short time. Moreover the purpose-specific survey indicates that their perception of the approach (and its potential) is positive. The standardized questionnaire indicates that even in its prototype stage its usability is satisfactory.;2019
Introduction: Improving adherence to antidiabetic medication is crucial resulting in improved health outcomes cost reduction and minimization of waste. A lack of underlying theory in existing interventions may explain the limited success in sustaining behavior change. This paper describes the development of a theory and evidence-based complex intervention to improve adherence to oral antidiabetics in older people via a software prototype with an anthropomorphic virtual assistant. Methods: The Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) was used to develop a theoretical understanding of the change process corresponding to the first phase of the Medical Research Council Framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. At the BCW core is a model of human behavior (COM-B) which posits that human behavior (B) results from the interaction between capabilities (C) opportunities (0) and motivation (M). Literature-derived medication adherence determinants were mapped onto COM-B components. Then intervention functions (IFs) were selected employing the APEASE criteria. Finally standardized behavior change techniques (BCTs) were chosen based on their suitability and their effectiveness on medication adherence trials. The prototype was developed for android devices its core was implemented in Unity3D using a female 3D virtual assistant named Vitoria. Results: Two COM-B components were identified as main targets for behavior change-psychological capability and reflective motivation these were linked with four IFs- education persuasion enablement and environmental restructuring. Eleven BCTs were in turn linked with the IFs. An example of a BCT is problem solving it requires users to pinpoint factors influencing non-adherence and subsequently offers strategies to achieve the desired behavior. BCTs were operationalized into the dialogues with Vitoria and into supplementary software features. Vitoria communicates with users verbally and non-verbally expressing emotions. Input options consist of buttons or recording values such as medication taken. Conclusion: The present approach enabled us to derive the most appropriate BCTs for our intervention. The use of an explicit bundle of BCTs often overlooked in interventions promoting medication adherence is expected to maximize effectiveness and facilitates replication. The first prototype is being refined with users and health professionals' contributions. Future work includes subjecting the prototype to usability tests and a feasibility trial.;2019
Introduction: Sentiment analysis may be a useful technique to derive a user's emotional state from free text input allowing for more empathic automated feedback in online cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) interventions for psychological disorders such as depression. As guided iCBT is considered more effective than unguided iCBT such automated feedback may help close the gap between the two. The accuracy of automated sentiment analysis is domain dependent and ft is unclear how well the technology is applicable to iCBT. This paper presents an empirical study in which automated sentiment analysis by an algorithm for the Dutch language is validated against human judgment. Methods: A total of 493 iCBT user texts were evaluated on overall sentiment and the presence of five specific emotions by an algorithm and by 52 psychology students who evaluated 75 randomly selected texts each providing about eight human evaluations per text. Inter-rater agreement (IRR) between algorithm and humans and humans among each other was analyzed by calculating the intra-class correlation under a numerical interpretation of the data and Cohen's kappa and Krippendorff's alpha under a categorical interpretation. Results: All analyses indicated moderate agreement between the algorithm and average human judgment with respect to evaluating overall sentiment and low agreement for the specific emotions. Somewhat surprisingly the same was the case for the IRR among human judges which means that the algorithm performed about as well as a randomly selected human judge. Thus considering average human judgment as a benchmark for the applicability of automated sentiment analysis the technique can be considered for practical application. Discussion/Conclusion: The low human-human agreement on the presence of emotions may be due to the nature of the texts it may simply be difficult for humans to agree on the presence of the selected emotions or perhaps trained therapists would have reached more consensus. Future research may focus on validating the algorithm against a more solid benchmark on applying the algorithm in an application in which empathic feedback is provided for example by an embodied conversational agent or on improving the algorithm for the iCBT domain with a bottom-up machine learning approach.;2019
Learning is challenging especially in the self-paced online learning environment. Not all the students start online learning with the skills to manage their learning plans balance work-study and find learning resources. Therefore as an online educational institution providing learner support services are essential to improving learning outcomes and student satisfaction. The existing studies have analyzed the impact of learner support services on student satisfaction learning outcomes and course retention. However the relationship between these services and student engagement in the long-term learning process has not been fully examined. To address this issue this paper investigates students' usage of two online learner support (OLS) services and their impact on student engagement. We examined four student groups categorized by their usage of two OLS services and analyzed student engagement with an online course using learning log data and visual analytics techniques. The findings indicate that the use of services and how many times the services are used are highly relevant to the pattern and level of student engagement which suggests that the use of OLS services can be added to the indicators that reflect student learning status.;2019
Loneliness is a growing public health issue that substantially increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Artificial agents such as robots embodied conversational agents and chatbots present an innovation in care delivery and have been shown to reduce patient loneliness by providing social support. However similar to doctor and patient relationships the quality of a patient's relationship with an artificial agent can impact support effectiveness as well as care engagement. Incorporating mammalian attachment-building behavior in neural network processing as part of an agent's capabilities may improve relationship quality and engagement between patients and artificial agents. We encourage developers of artificial agents intended to relieve patient loneliness to incorporate design insights from evolutionary neuropsychiatry.;2019
Matching an appropriate response with its multi-turn context is a crucial challenge in retrieval-based chatbots. Current studies construct multiple representations of context and response to facilitate response selection but they use these representations in isolation and ignore the relationships among representations. To address these problems we propose a hierarchical aggregation network of multi-representation (HAMR) to leverage abundant representations sufficiently and enhance valuable information. First we employ bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BiRNN) to extract syntactic and semantic representations of sentences and use a self-aggregation mechanism to combine these representations. Second we design a matching aggregation mechanism for fusing different matching information between each utterance in context and response which is generated by an attention mechanism. By considering the candidate response as the real part of the context we try to integrate all of them in chronological order and then accumulate the vectors to calculate the final matching degree. An extensive empirical study on two multi-turn response selection data sets indicates that our proposed model achieves a new state-of-the-art result.;2019
Measuring the cognitive cost of interpreting the meaning of sentences in a conversation is a complex task but it is also at the core of Sperber and Wilson's Relevance Theory. In cognitive sciences the delay between a stimulus and its response is often used as an approximation of the cognitive cost. We have noticed that such a tool had not yet been used to measure the cognitive cost of interpreting the meaning of sentences in a free-flowing and interactive conversation. The following experiment tests the ability to discriminate between sentences with a high cognitive cost and sentences with a low cognitive cost using the response time of the participants during an online conversation in a protocol inspired by the Turing Test. We have used violations of Grice's Cooperative Principle to create conditions in which sentences with a high cognitive cost would be produced. We hypothesized that response times are directly correlated to the cognitive cost required to generate implicatures from a statement. Our results are coherent with the literature in the field and shed some new light on the effect of violations on the humanness of a conversational agent. We show that violations of the maxim of Relation had a particularly important impact on response times and the perceived humanness of a conversation partner. Violations of the first maxim of Quantity and the fourth maxim of Manner had a lesser impact and only on male participants.;2019
Mobile devices are becoming ever more widely available with growing functionality giving students access to educational material anytime and anywhere. Thus mobile devices have become more attractive for education. However owing to the nature of mobile devices such as small screen size it poses number of challenges to create a usable learning environment. Therefore it becomes noteworthy to explore usability of these devices and the students' expectations. The present empirical study regarding the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) aimed to explore expectations of students from mobile devices in order to support mobile learning. Data was collected from 30 university students through pre and post interviews while students were conducting a set of e-learning actions such as uploading files communicating and acquiring course contents on a mobile device. With the analyses of interviews using constant comparative approach expectations of the students were classified into 11 categories which are related to interaction and usability.;2019
Multi-role dialogue is challenging in natural language processing (NLP) which needs not only to understand sentences but also to simulate interaction among roles. However the existing methods assume that only two speakers are present in a conversation. In real life this assumption is not always valid. More often there are multiple speakers involved. To address this issue we propose a multi-role interposition dialogue system (MIDS) that generates reasonable responses based on the dialogue context and next speaker prediction. The MIDS employs multiply role-defined encoders to understand each speaker and an independent sequence model to predict the next speaker. The independent sequence model also works as a controller to integrate encoders with weights. Then an attention-enhanced decoder generates responses based on the dialogue context speaker prediction and integrated encoders. Moreover with the help of unique speaker prediction the MIDS is able to generate diverse responses and allow itself to join (interpose) the conversation when appropriate. Furthermore a novel reward function and an updating policy of reinforcement learning (RL) are applied to the MIDS which further enable MIDS the ability to write drama scripts. The experimental results demonstrate that the MIDS offers a significant improvement to the accuracy of speaker prediction and the reduction of response generation perplexity. It is also able to interact with users without cues during real-life online conversations and avoid meaningless conversation loops while generating scripts. This paper marks the first step toward multi-role humorous dialogue generation.;2019
Multi-turn response selection is essential to retrieval-based chatbots. The task requires multi-turn response selection model to match a response candidate with a conversation context. Existing methods may lose relationship features in the context. In this article we propose an improved method that extends the learning granularity of the multi-turn response selection model to enhance the model's ability to learn relationship features of utterances in the context which is a key to understand a conversation context for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves sequential matching network for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots.;2019
Neural end-to-end goal-oriented dialog systems showed promise to reduce the workload of human agents for customer service as well as reduce wait time for users. However their inability to handle new user behavior at deployment has limited their usage in real world. In this work we propose an end-toend trainable method for neural goal-oriented dialog systems that handles new user behaviors at deployment by transferring the dialog to a human agent intelligently. The proposed method has three goals: 1) maximize user's task success by transferring to human agents 2) minimize the load on the human agents by transferring to them only when it is essential and 3) learn online from the human agent's responses to reduce human agents' load further. We evaluate our proposed method on a modified-bAbI dialog task1 which simulates the scenario of new user behaviors occurring at test time. Experimental results show that our proposed method is effective in achieving the desired goals.;2019
New decision-support systems are being built using AI services that draw insights from a large corpus of data and incorporate those insights in human-in-the-loop decision environments. They promise to transform businesses such as health care with better affordable and timely decisions. However it will be unreasonable to expect people to trust AI systems out of the box if they have been shown to exhibit discrimination across a variety of data usages: unstructured text structured data or images. Thus AI systems come with certain risks such as failing to recognize people or objects introducing errors in their output and leading to unintended harm. In response we propose ratings as a way to communicate bias risk and methods to rate AI services for bias in a black-box fashion without accessing services training data. Our method is designed not only to work on single services but also the composition of services which is how complex AI applications are built. Thus the proposed method can be used to rate a composite application like a chatbot for the severity of its bias by rating its constituent services and then composing the rating rather than rating the whole system.;2019
News media organisations are experimenting with a new generation of newsbots that move beyond automated headline delivery to the delivery of news according to a conversational format within the context of private messaging services. To build the newsbot journalists craft statements and answers to users' questions that mimic a natural conversation between a journalist and user. In so doing journalists are experimenting with styles of communication that reflect very particular journalistic personas. We investigate the persona of the news chatbot created by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) the better to understand how the public broadcaster's forays into social media service delivery and automation are shaping new relationships between public service broadcasters and their audiences. We find that for a section of the audience that uses it the friendly newsbot contrasts favourably with their previous experience with news and the journalists who produce it. The public service journalists who operate the bot are in turn using the bot to try to reach new audiences by experimenting with a more informal intimate relationship with citizen users. The supposedly intelligent (but in actual fact very much human-crafted) newsbot is the vehicle through which this new relationship is being forged.;2019
Nowadays most end-to-end task-oriented dialog systems are based on sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) which is an encoder-decoder framework. These systems sometimes produce grammatically correct but logically incorrect responses. This phenomenon is usually due to information mismatching. To solve this problem we introduce hierarchical attention and knowledge matching networks with information enhancement (HAMI) for task-oriented dialog systems. It contains a hierarchical attention dialog encoder (HADE) that models dialogs at the word and sentence level separately. HADE can focus on important words in a dialog history and generate context-aware representations. HAMI also contains a unique knowledge matching module to detect entities and interact with a knowledge base (KB). Then dialog history and KB result representations serve as guidance for system response generation. Finally HAMI's loss function is designed with an information regularization term to emphasize the importance of entities. The experimental results show that HAMI improves 9.8% in entity F1 compared with vanilla Seq2seq. HAMI also outperforms state-of-the-art models in both the entity F1 and dialog accuracy metrics.;2019
Objective Poor lifestyle represents a health risk factor and is the leading cause of morbidity and chronic conditions. The impact of poor lifestyle can be significantly altered by individual's behavioral modification. Although there are abundant lifestyle promotion applications and tools they are still limited in providing tailored social support that goes beyond their predefined functionalities. In addition virtual coaching approaches are still unable to handle user emotional needs. Our approach presents a human-virtual agent mediated system that leverages the conversational agent to handle menial caregiver's works by engaging users (e.g. patients) in a conversation with the conversational agent. The dialog used a natural conversation to interact with users delivered by the conversational agent and handled with a finite state machine automaton. Our research differs from existing approaches that replace a human coach with a fully automated assistant on user support. The methodology allows users to interact with the technology and access health-related interventions. To assist physicians the conversational agent gives weighting to user's adherence based on prior defined conditions. Materials and Methods This article describes the design and validation of CoachAI a conversational agent-assisted health coaching system to support health intervention delivery to individuals or groups. CoachAI instantiates a text-based health care conversational agent system that bridges the remote human coach and the users. Results We will discuss our approach and highlight the outcome of a 1-month validation study on physical activity healthy diet and stress coping. The study validates technology aspects of our human-virtual agent mediated health coaching system. We present the intervention settings and findings from the study. In addition we present some user-experience validation results gathered during or after the experimentation. Conclusions The study provided a set of dimensions when building a human-conversational agent powered health intervention tool. The results provided interesting insights when using human-conversational agent mediated approach in health coaching systems. The findings revealed that users who were highly engaged were also more adherent to conversational-agent activities. This research made key contributions to the literature on techniques in providing social yet tailored health coaching support: (1) identifying habitual patterns to understand user preferences (2) the role of a conversational agent in delivering health promoting microactivities (3) building the technology while adhering to individuals' daily messaging routine and (4) a socio-technical system that fits with the role of conversational agent as an assistive component. Future Work Future improvements will consider building the activity recommender based on users' interaction data and integrating users' dietary pattern and emotional wellbeing into the initial user clustering by leveraging information and communication technology approaches (e.g. machine learning). We will integrate a sentiment analysis capability to gather further data about individuals and report these data to the caregiver.;2019
Objective The objective of this study was to assess whether a version of the Smoke Free app with a supportive chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (versus a version without the chatbot) led to increased engagement and short-term quit success. Methods Daily or non-daily smokers aged >= 18 years who purchased the 'pro' version of the app and set a quit date were randomly assigned (unequal allocation) to receive the app with or without the chatbot. The outcomes were engagement (i.e. total number of logins over the study period) and self-reported abstinence at a one-month follow-up. Unadjusted and adjusted negative binomial and logistic regression models were fitted to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for the associations of interest. Results A total of 57214 smokers were included (intervention: 9.3% (5339) control: 90.7% (51875). The app with the chatbot compared with the standard version led to a 101% increase in engagement (IRRadj = 2.01 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.92-2.11 p < .001). The one-month follow-up rate was 10.6% (intervention: 19.9% (1061/5339) control: 9.7% (5050/51875). Smokers allocated to the intervention had greater odds of quit success (missing equals smoking: 844/5339 vs. 3704/51875 ORadj = 2.38 95% CI = 2.19-2.58 p < .001 follow-up only: 844/1061 vs. 3704/5050 ORadj = 1.36 95% CI = 1.16-1.61 p < .001). Conclusion The addition of a supportive chatbot to a popular smoking cessation app more than doubled user engagement. In view of very low follow-up rates there is low quality evidence that the addition also increased self-reported smoking cessation.;2019
Objective: The AAP AFP and ACP have authored statements and recommendations to clinicians about the importance of the transition from pediatric to adult care. The Got Transition program provides a framework and resources based on AAP AFP and ACP recommendations to promote skill attainment in self-care. Engaging adolescents along the transition journey has proven challenging. Use of smartphones text messaging and social media are prevalent among teenagers offering a unique opportunity to engage teenagers in their preferred channel to provide tools and resources to help them successfully transition to adult focused care. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of clinicians quality improvement facilitators and human-centered designers at the University of Vermont (UVM) Children's Hospital designed tools for teens with chronic conditions that support the Got Transition recommendations. Using a co-creative design process we created a novel tool to increase engagement among teenagers. We conducted a pilot study of 13 teenagers with a chronic medical condition using a text messaging platform (chatbot) with scripted interactions to increase engagement and deliver educational content according to Got Transition. Results: Mean engagement was 97% during the study period. Qualitative feedback from study participants suggests our chatbot should be extended and shows promise to help teenagers attain self-care skills on the transition journey. Conclusions: A scripted text messaging platform is feasible and appears to be well-received by patients and caregivers. Furthermore our approach emphasizes the need to engage teenagers through multiple platforms to effectively serve as coaches during the transition to adult care. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: To assess knowledge attitudes practices and perceptions of healthcare professionals regarding use of portable gadgets in daily clinical practice and for academic purposes. Methods: The questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was performed at Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi from February to March 2015 and comprised healthcare professionals recruited using convenience-based sampling. A self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Items in the instrument pertained to use of portable gadgets knowledge of radiology applications and perceptions regarding benefits/drawbacks of such gadgets. 'Portable gadgets' referred to any handheld electronic device such as mobile phones tablet or personal digital assistants. SPSS 20 was used for data analysis. Results: Of the 100 subjects 38(38%) were radiology residents 34(34%) consultant radiologists 28(28%) were radiographers. The overall mean age was 32.7 +/- 8.66 years. Overall 80 (80%) subjects possessed a portable gadget. Although 64(64%) participants commonly used the gadgets for clinical and academic activities only 46(46%) had heard of radiology smartphone applications. Majority 80(80%) preferred hardcopies for studying books as opposed to digital formats. However 78(78%) believed that portable gadgets had a positive impact on their clinical practice. Conclusion: Portable gadgets were being used by a substantial proportion of healthcare professionals for clinical and academic activities.;2019
Observed influences of system response delay in spoken human-machine dialogues are rather ambiguous and mainly focus on perceived system quality. Studies that systematically inspect effects on cognitive performance are still lacking and effects of individual characteristics are also often neglected. Building on benefits of cognitive training for decelerating cognitive decline this Wizard-of-Oz study addresses both issues by testing 62 elderly participants in a dialogue-based memory training with a virtual agent. Participants acquired the method of loci with fading instructional guidance and applied it afterward to memorizing and recalling lists of German nouns. System response delays were randomly assigned and training performance was included as potential mediator. Participants' age gender and subscales of affinity for technology (enthusiasm competence positive and negative perception of technology) were inspected as potential moderators. The results indicated positive effects on recall performance with higher training performance female gender and less negative perception of technology. Additionally memory retention and facets of affinity for technology moderated increasing system response delays. Participants also provided higher ratings in perceived system quality with higher enthusiasm for technology but reported increasing frustration with a more positive perception of technology. Potential explanations and implications for the design of spoken dialogue systems are discussed.;2019
Online interactions have emerged as a dominant exchange mode for companies and customers. Cultivating online relationshipsdefined as relational exchanges that are mediated by Internet-based channelspresents firms with challenges and opportunities. In lockstep with exponential advancements in computing technology a rich and ever-evolving toolbox is available to relationship marketers to manage customer relationships online in settings including e-commerce social media online communities mobile big data artificial intelligence and augmented reality. To advance academic knowledge and guide managerial decision making this study offers a comprehensive analysis of online relationship marketing in terms of its conceptual foundations evolution in business practice and empirical insights from academic research. The authors propose an evolving theory of online relationship marketing characterizing online relationships as uniquely seamless networked omnichannel personalized and anthropomorphized. Based on these five essential features six tenets and 11 corresponding propositions parsimoniously predict the performance effects of the manifold online relationship marketing strategies.;2019
Online learning environments could be well understood as a multifaceted phenomenon affected by different aspects of learner participation including synchronous/asynchronous interactions. The aim of this study was to investigate learners' participation in online courses synchronous interaction with a conversational virtual agent their relationships with learner performance and the participation/interaction factor identification. To examine learner participation we collected learning management system (LMS) log data that included the frequency and length of course access discussion board postings and final grades. To examine synchronous learner interaction we collected learners' conversation logs from the conversational agent. We calculated the quantity and quality of discussion postings and conversations with the agent. The results showed that the frequency and length of course access the quantity and quality of discussion postings and the quality of conversation with the agent were significantly associated with the learner achievement. This study also identified two factors that comprise online learning participation and interaction: interaction quality and LMS-oriented interaction.;2019
Operative experience for the contemporary trainee has become exceedingly more challenging in the setting of more stringent hospital regulations. Surgical training is thus shifting toward more self-directed independent learning to maximize operative opportunities as they become available yet this can prove difficult for complex surgeries like craniofacial procedures. The intricate anatomy and fine reconstructive techniques employed cannot be readily depicted onto a two-dimensional page. To address this educational gap the Craniofacial Interactive Virtual AssistantPro Edition (CIVA-Pro) was developed as a web-based surgical simulator to aid learners with conceptualizing the surgical principles utilized in these cases. The current work reviews the Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy module of CIVA-Pro providing detailed narratives for each chapter with expert commentary on broadened indications and future directions.;2019
Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) are a subset of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) in which mobile nodes negotiate connectivity via short-range wireless communication. Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) i.e. smartphones tablets laptops etc. and wearable smart devices that are capable of data communication more often are considered as nodes of an OppNet. Each node is programmed to record the location of other nodes which are visited and creates a history table over time of these interactions. For node to node communication messages are exchanged opportunistically with the aim of progressing the message towards the intended destination node. To send a message from a sender node to the final receiver node the optimized route composed of different nodes is identified by inspecting the history table which has been created by each node based on previous interactions. Therefore history table security is a must to prevent leaking of data or privacy and integrity compromise. In this paper a new Privacy-Preserving History-Based (PPHB) routing mechanism is proposed based on historical location tracking. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2019
Over the next decade one issue which will dominate sociotechnical studies in health informatics is the extent to which the promise of artificial intelligence in health care will be realized along with the social and ethical issues which accompany it. A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care. In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future. In health care artificial intelligence needs to pass the implementation game not the imitation game.;2019
Paying attention to the rising popularity of virtual assistants (VAs) that offer unique user experiences through voice-centered interaction this study examined the effects of modality device and task differences on perceived human likeness of and attitudes toward voice-activated VAs. To do so a 2 (modality: voice vs. text) x 2 (device: mobile vs. laptop) x 2 (task type: hedonic vs. utilitarian) mixed factorial experimental design was employed. Findings suggest that voice (vs. text) interaction leads to more positive attitudes toward the VA system mediated by heightened perceived human likeness of the VA but only with utilitarian (vs. hedonic) tasks. Interestingly laptop (vs. mobile phone) interaction also enhanced perceived human likeness of the VA. This study offers theoretical and practical implications for VA research by exploring the combinational effects of modality device and task differences on user perceptions through human-like interactions.;2019
Prior research has shown that the more patients know about their disease health and lifestyle the better the health outcomes are. Patients who are suffering from either a physical disease with mental consequences or from mental illnesses can contribute to their own feeling of mental well-being by following evidence-based online self-guided therapeutic interventions. These self-guided therapeutic interventions during which there is no contact with a care provider have shown high effectiveness. However users (patients) of self-guided eHealth interventions have difficulties fulfilling the entire trajectory as is mirrored in high non-adherence rates. Users have reported a need for support that is traditionally provided by human care providers. This study investigates the opportunities from within the technology to increase its support level toward the user. We deployed a pedagogical agent acting as an adjunct to a self-guided positive psychology psycho-education intervention. This agent provided instructions and user support in between and explicitly not during the online learning modules as to mitigate the risk of distraction. By setting up a between-subjects design and deploying three versions of a pedagogical agent (also known as Embodied Conversational Agent) varying the features of animation speech and visibility we investigated whether users felt more supported than by a fourth text-only control condition. All four conditions provided similar task-related support and emotion-related support to the user. Our results showed that our pedagogical agent made users feel guided and supported with respect to fulfilling their tasks. However no effects were found of emotion-related support resulting in higher user motivation and an improved learning experience. Significant effects of visibility and voice were found but animation of our pedagogical agent had no effect. On the feedback outcome variable we found a gender effect. Male participants graded the visible Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) higher than female participants and graded the non-visible ECA lower than female participants. In our view ECA's should not necessarily be deployed with the ambition to compete with the profound human potential to deliver support and guidance. Exploring ECA capabilities merits further attention from the stance that the technology itself can support users and potentially make them adhere.;2019
Purpose Mobile banking (m-banking) can be defined as a service offered by a bank or any other financial institution that allows the customers of such establishments to carry out a variety of banking operations via a mobile device such as a mobile phone tablet or personal digital assistant. The purpose of this paper is to examine factors that influence customers to adopt and subsequently use m-banking services in Ghana using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) model with age educational level user experience and gender as moderators. Design/methodology/approach Using questionnaire survey the study sampled 300 users of m-banking services in Ghana as respondents. The primary data collected were analyzed using SmartPLS software. Findings Findings of the study indicate that Habit Price Value and Trust are the main factors influencing adoption and use of m-banking in Ghana. Individual differences of gender age educational level and user experience responded differently as they moderate the relationship between UTAUT2 constructs and use bahaviour. The applicability of UTAUT2 model was confirmed in the context of the researc;2019
Purpose Performing tasks in public spaces can be demanding due to task complexity. Systems that can keep track of the current task state may help their users to successfully fulfill a task. These systems however require major implementation effort. The purpose of this paper is to investigate if and how a mobile information assistant which has only basic task-tracking capabilities can support users by employing a least effort approach. This means we are interested in whether such a system is able to have an impact on the way a workflow in public space is perceived. Design/methodology/approach The authors implement and test AIRBOT a mobile chatbot application that can assist air passengers in successfully boarding a plane. The authors apply a three-tier approach and first conduct expert and passenger interviews to understand the workflow and the information needs occurring therein second the authors implement a mobile chatbot application providing minimum task-tracking capabilities to support travelers by providing boarding-relevant information in a proactive manner. Finally the authors evaluate this application by means of an in situ study (n = 101 passengers) at a major European airport. Findings The authors provide evidence that basic task-tracking capabilities are sufficient to affect the users' task perception. AIRBOT is able to decrease the perceived workload airport services impose on users. It has a negative impact on satisfaction with non-personalized information offered by the airport though. Originality/value The study shows that the number of features is not the most important means to successfully provide assistance in public space workflows. The study can moreover serve as a blueprint to design task-based assistants for other contexts.;2019
Purpose Smart technologies and connected objects are rapidly changing the organizational frontline. Yet our understanding of how these technologies infuse service encounters remains limited. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to update existing classifications of Frontline Service Technology (FST) infusion. Moreover the authors discuss three promising smart and connected technologies - conversational agents extended reality (XR) and blockchain technology - and their respective implications for customers frontline employees and service organizations. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a conceptual approach integrating existing work on FST infusion with artificial intelligence robotics XR and blockchain literature while also building on insights gathered through expert interviews and focus group conversations with members of two service research centers. Findings The authors define FST and propose a set of FST infusion archetypes at the organizational frontline. Additionally the authors develop future research directions focused on understanding how conversational agents XR and blockchain technology will impact service. Originality/value This paper updates and extends existing classifications of FST while paving the road for further work on FST infusion.;2019
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand motivation of young consumers to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as chatbots voice assistants and augmented reality in shopping by generating Vroom's expectancy theory of motivation using grounded theory approach. Design/methodology/approach Grounded theory approach has been used to develop the Vroom's expectancy theory. Initially data were collected through participant interviews using theoretical sampling. These data were analyzed and coded using the three step process i.e. open coding axial coding and selective coding. The categories created during coding were integrated to generate Vroom's expectancy theory of motivation. Findings The findings indicate that Vroom's expectancy theory of motivation can be used to explain motivation of young consumers to use AI tools as an aid in taking shopping decisions. The motivation may be intrinsic motivation extrinsic motivation or force choice motivation. Expectancy represents the ease of using the tools instrumentality represents competence of tools in performing desired tasks while valence represents satisfaction rewarding experience and trust in using of tools. Research limitations/implications The findings of the study are based on grounded theory approach which is an inductive approach. Alternate research methodologies both inductive and deductive need to be employed to strengthen the external validity and generalize the results. The study is limited to shopping motives of young consumers in India. A comparison with other consumer motivational studies has not been done. Hence no claim is made regarding the advantage of Vroom's theory over other motivational theories. Practical implications The study has strong implications for retailers in developing countries which are seen as an emerging market for retail and have introduced AI tools in recent years. The Vroom's expectancy theory will help retailers to understand consumer motivation in using AI tools or shopping. Originality/value Vroom's expectancy theory to understand consumer motivation to use AI tools in shopping was generated using the grounded theory approach.;2019
Purpose: To evaluate the effects of iDecide on prostate cancer knowledge informed decision-making self-efficacy technology use self-efficacy and intention to engage in informed decision-making among African American men. Design: One-group pretest/posttest. Setting: Community settings in South Carolina. Participants: African American men ages 40 years + without a prior prostate cancer diagnosis (n = 354). Intervention: iDecide an embodied conversational agent-led computer-based prostate cancer screening decision aid. Measures: Prostate cancer knowledge informed decision-making self-efficacy technology use self-efficacy and intention to engage in informed decision-making. Analysis: Descriptive statistics paired t tests general linear modeling Spearman correlations. Results: On average participants experienced significant improvements in their prostate cancer knowledge (P <= .001) informed decision-making self-efficacy (P <= .001) and technology use self-efficacy (P <= .001) postintervention. Additionally 67% of participants reported an intention to engage in informed decision-making. Conclusion: Given the significant improvements across all measures this research demonstrates that embodied conversational agent-led decision aids can be used to enhance the capacity for making informed prostate cancer screening decisions among African American men and increase their technology use self-efficacy. One critical limitation of this study is that most men had received prostate cancer screening prior to engaging in our intervention so the implications of this intervention may be different for men who do not have a history of screening. Additionally actual engagement in informed decision-making postintervention was not assessed.;2019
PurposeTo assess the real-time' self-management strategies employed by prostate cancer survivors to inform personalised supportive care interventions in the future.MethodA purposive sampling framework was used to recruit men with different stages of cancer and treatment to an ecological momentary assessment (capturing experiences in real time) study. Each participant was prompted by an audio alert to complete self-report questionnaires three times per day (93 data entries in total) for a total duration of 31days. The personal digital assistant (PDA) and pocket interview software were used.ResultsProstate cancer survivors experienced a wide range of after-effects of therapy for which they used various self-management strategies. Many of the men experienced sexual dysfunction but did not perform any self-management.ConclusionOur findings reinforce the importance of having access to tailored timely and person-centred supported self-management care plans. Real-time monitoring data can provide helpful information to facilitate tailored recommendations for self-management.Implications for Cancer SurvivorsProstate cancer survivors can experience unmet supportive care needs which may increase men's demands to perform self-management of their condition. Future clinical intervention studies aimed at utilising the remote exchange of real-time data serves to optimise tailored supported self-management.;2019
Recent CALL technology reviews cover a plethora of technologies available to language learners to improve a variety of skills including speaking. However few technology-enhanced self-access tools are available for pragmatic development especially in oral modality. Recognizing the benefits of structured practice for second language development we demonstrate how such practice can be incorporated into three recently developed simulated speaking environments that vary on the targeted L2 (French English) domain of use (academic or everyday interaction) emphasis on higher-order and/or lower-order skills and accommodation of multiple L2 varieties. In the spirit of finding synergies and learning from each other's experiences in specific local contexts we address the following research questions: (1) How does the local context researcher and learner goals and technological possibilities influence the design of each computer application? (2) Based on the examination of the three programs what can we learn in view of redesign options and suggest to future developers of such programs?;2019
Recently real-time affect-awareness has been applied in several commercial systems such as dialogue systems and computer games. Real-time recognition of affective states however requires the application of costly feature extraction methods and/or labor-intensive annotation of large datasets especially in the case of Asian languages where large annotated datasets are seldom available. To improve recognition accuracy we propose the use of cognitive context in the form of emotion-sensitive intentions. Intentions are often represented through dialogue acts and as an emotion-sensitive model of dialogue acts a tagset of interpersonal-relations-directing interpersonal acts (the IA model) is proposed. The model's adequacy is assessed using a sentiment classification task in comparison with two well-known dialogue act models the SWBD-DAMSL and the DIT++. For the assessment five Japanese in-game dialogues were annotated with labels of sentiments and the tags of all three dialogue act models which were used to enhance a baseline sentiment classifier system. The adequacy of the IA tagset is demonstrated by a 9% improvement to the baseline sentiment classifier's recognition accuracy outperforming the other two models by more than 5%.;2019
Recently the rapid development of mobile multimedia intelligent voice systems has affected the rapid changes in user interaction. Meanwhile the continuous optimization of recommended algorithms makes the change of interaction mode from the original user's active search to the machine actively recommending continuously. It is an inevitable trend that multimedia intelligent voice dialogue system brings more efficient content services to users through active recommendation. However the existing multimedia intelligent voice dialogue systems are mainly based on the user's expression content to analyze the user's subject willingness and then provide the reply contents to user. This kind of interaction only drives the topic through the user which will cause some problems like single chat topic and missing points of interest. In order to address these problems this paper proposes an interactive topic guiding model. This model uses the surrounding similar users and user context information to guide users' topics and taking into account the harmony of human-computer interaction the game method is adopted to select the optimal content response strategy by considering the user's and robot's emotional friendliness and content friendliness. The experiments show that the model proposed in this paper can effectively guide topics. Moreover it has significant improvement in content richness compared with other models in human-machine natural interaction which can provide some research ideas for guiding the topic in the mobile multimedia intelligent voice system.;2019
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based approaches have recently shown promising in tackling Natural Language Generation (NLG) problems. This paper presents an approach to leverage gating mechanisms in which we incrementally propose three additional semantic cells into a traditional RNN model: a Refinement cell to filter the sequential inputs before RNN computations an Adjustment cell and an Output cell to select semantic elements and gate a feature vector during generation. The proposed gating-based generators can learn from unaligned data by jointly training both sentence planning and surface realization to generate natural language utterances. We conducted extensive experiments on four different NLG domains in which the results empirically show that the proposed methods not only achieved better performance on all the NLG domains in comparison with previous gating-based attention-based methods but also obtained highly competitive results compared to a hybrid generator.

Research regarding source orientation has demonstrated that when interacting with computers people direct their communication toward and react toward the technology itself. Users perceive technology to be a source in human-machine communication (HMC). This study provides a new dimension to those findings with regard to source orientation with voice-based mobile virtual assistants enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). In qualitative interviews regarding their conceptualizations of mobile conversational agents (Apple's Siri Google Voice Samsung S-Voice) and their perceptions of interactions with these specific technologies some participants describe the agent they can hear but not see as a voice in the mobile phone (assistant as distinct entity) while others perceive the technology that they command to be the voice of the phone (assistant as the device). Therefore congruent with existing research users of mobile assistants orient toward a technology instead of thinking they are interacting with a human but in contrast to existing research attend to different technologies. When technologies possess a disembodied voice and are designed with various social cues and degrees of intelligence the locus and nature of the digital interlocutor is not uniform in people's minds.;2019
Software is usually studied in terms of the changes triggered by its operations in the material world. Yet to understand its social and cultural impact one needs to examine also the different narratives that circulate about it. Software's opacity in fact makes it prone to being translated into a plurality of narratives that help people make sense of its functioning and presence. Drawing from the case of Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA widely considered the first chatbot ever created this article proposes a theoretical framework based on the concept of 'biographies of media' to illuminate the dynamics and implications of software's discursive life. The case of ELIZA is particularly relevant in this regard because it became the centre of competing narratives whose trajectories transcended the actual functioning of this programme and shaped key controversies about the implications of computing and artificial intelligence.;2019
Speeding up video encoding process is an important issue nowadays due to the high demand of increasing the video transmission speed for real-time video applications. Many algorithms and hardware implementations have been proposed for achieving such demand using pixel domain motion estimation. Moreover much savings in computations and hardware complexity can be achieved using frequency domain motion estimation (FDME). The key issues in the FDME encoder is to generate four different transforms that are used for deciding the best match motion vector in the motion estimation (ME) process. The related transformed-discrete cosine transform (RT-DCT) generator is responsible for generating such transforms in the FDME encoder. In this paper a fast RT-DCT generator is proposed to speed up the FDME encoding time by reducing its complexity. That makes the proposed RT-DCT appropriated for real-time video applications with limited resources such as mobile internet device cellular phones personal digital assistant (PDA) and ultra-mobile personal computer. Moreover the proposed architecture does not scarify the resolution. By adding the proposed RT-DCT generator to the whole FDME system implementation and simulation results show that the system performs ME for SDTV video sequence at 371 MHz.;2019
Spoken language understanding (SLU) plays an integral part in every dialogue system. To understand the intention of the user and extract the necessary information to help the user achieve desired goals is a challenging task. In this work we propose an end-to-end hierarchical multi-task model that can jointly perform both intent detection and slot filling tasks for the datasets of varying domains. The primary aim is to capture context information in a dialogue to help the SLU module in a dialogue system to correctly understand the user and assist the user in achieving the desired goals. It is vital for the SLU module to capture the past information along with the present utterance said by the user to retrieve correct information. The dependency and correlation between the two tasks i.e. intent detection and slot filling makes the multi-task learning framework effective in capturing the desired information provided by the user. We use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to capture contextual information for the utterances. We employ Conditional Random Field (CRF) to model label dependency. Both character and word level embeddings are provided as input to the models. We create a benchmark corpus for the SLU tasks on TRAINS and FRAMES dataset for capturing more realistic and natural utterances spoken by the speakers in a human/machine dialogue system. Experimental results on multiple datasets of various domains (ATIS SNIP TRAINS and FRAMES) show that our proposed approach is effective compared to the individual models and the state-of-the-art methods.

Teams need to co-construct meaning to establish shared understanding of crowdsourced ideas. This is challenging because team members are often faced with an excessive amount of ideas they have no access to the ideator to clarify ideas have limited meeting duration and do not necessarily share a common working history. Facilitation interventions can aid the co-construction of meaning. However it is uncertain if facilitation interventions that were successful in traditional convergence settings can be applied to convergence with crowdsourced ideas and what mechanisms can explain the positive association between facilitation interventions and co-creation of meaning. In this study I tested three facilitation techniques and the mediating role of evaluation and coordination in a laboratory experiment involving 199 participants. The participants were given an IT-supported convergence task with crowdsourced ideas. The findings show that facilitated teams receiving high attention guidance and discussion encouragement outperform non-facilitated teams and that evaluation and coordination are the mechanisms through which these effects come about. The findings are beneficial for the design of conversational agents in convergence settings and for team leaders who want to establish shared understanding in convergence settings with crowdsourced ideas.;2019
The authors propose methods to learn symbolic processing with deep learning and to build question answering systems by means of learned models. Symbolic processing performed by the Prolog processing systems which execute unification resolution and list operations is learned by a combination of deep learning models Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Word2Vec training. To our knowledge the implementation of a Prolog-like processing system using deep learning is a new experiment that has not been conducted in the past. The results of their experiments revealed that the proposed methods are superior to the conventional methods because symbolic processing (1) has rich representations (2) can interpret inputs even if they include unknown symbols and (3) can be learned with a small amount of training data. In particular (2) handling of unknown data which is a major task in artificial intelligence research is solved using Word2Vec. Furthermore question answering systems can be built from knowledge bases written in Prolog with learned symbolic processing which with conventional methods is extremely difficult to accomplish. Their proposed systems can not only answer questions through powerful inferences by utilizing facts that harbor unknown data but also have the potential to build knowledge bases from a large amount of data including unknown data on the Web. The proposed systems are a completely new trial there is no state-of-the-art methods in the sense of newest. Therefore to evaluate their efficiency they are compared with the most traditional and robust system i.e. the Prolog system. This is new research that encompasses the subjects of conventional artificial intelligence and neural network and their systems have higher potential to build applications such as FAQ chatbots decision support systems and energy-efficient estimation using a large amount of information on the Web. Mining hidden information through these applications will provide great value.;2019
The availability of always-on digital agents in hotel rooms providing agency and surveillance cues presents opportunities for behavioral interventions. This study tested the effectiveness of agency and social feedback on pro-environmental behavior intention of hotel consumers. A survey with scenario-based experimental design was distributed to US and UK travelers (N = 621). Results suggest that no one type of agent was more effective than the other in influencing pro-environmental behavior intention. Social feedback was found effective when given by a virtual assistant. Perception of another agent being 'present' in the room even when invisible is sufficient to induce normative behavior. This enriches literature on surveillance cues and behavior change and contributes to finding new ways of leveraging emerging technologies to foster sustainability.;2019
The breakthrough of nonprecious metal catalysts replacing platinum-based catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is extremely urgent for the development of high-efficiency energy conversation systems. Herein a solution-processed condensation polymerization using cyanuric chloride and piperazine as the monomers was proposed for the synthesis of a nitrogen-rich covalent organic polymer (COP). High contents of precisely tailored pyridinicN within the COP facilitate the formation of the Co/N coordination between Co ions and N species. As a result the subsequent carbonization of the Co-coordinated COP led to the formation of the cobalt nitrogen dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet-assembled flowers (Co/N-PCNF). The as obtained Co/N-PCNF catalyst with a nearly 4-electron oxygen reduction pathway exhibits an excellent ORR catalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.835 V comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.865 V). Most impressively the Co/N-PCNF catalyst displays a long-term stability and a much better resistance to methanol than the Pt/C catalyst because of its high surface area well-defined porous structure and homogeneous distributions of active sites within the carbon matrix. Therefore this work establishes an operating rule for tailored synthesis of COP-derived nonprecious metal catalysts offering high activity for the ORR in electrochemical energy conversations.;2019
The data science technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) Internet of Things (IoT) big data and behavioral/predictive analytics and blockchain are poised to revolutionize government and create a new generation of GovTech start-ups. The impact from the smartification' of public services and the national infrastructure will be much more significant in comparison to any other sector given government's function and importance to every institution and individual. Potential GovTech systems include Chatbots and intelligent assistants for public engagement Robo-advisors to support civil servants real-time management of the national infrastructure using IoT and blockchain automated compliance/regulation public records securely stored in blockchain distributed ledgers online judicial and dispute resolution systems and laws/statutes encoded as blockchain smart contracts. Government is potentially the major client' and also public champion' for these new data technologies. This review paper uses our simple taxonomy of government services to provide an overview of data science automation being deployed by governments world-wide. The goal of this review paper is to encourage the Computer Science community to engage with government to develop these new systems to transform public services and support the work of civil servants.;2019
The dialog state tracker is one of the most important modules on task-oriented dialog systems its accuracy strongly affects the quality of the system response. The architecture of the tracker has been changed from pipeline processing to an end-to-end approach that directly estimates a user's intention from each current utterance and a dialog history because of the growth in the use of the neural-network-based classifier. However tracking appropriate slot-value pairs of dialog states that are not explicitly mentioned in user utterances is still a difficult problem. In this research we propose creating feature vectors by using inference results on an external knowledge base. This inference process predicts associative entities in the knowledge base which contribute to the dialog state tracker for unseen entities of utterances. We extracted a part of a graph structure from an external knowledge base (Wikidata). Label propagation was used for inferring associative nodes (entities) on the graph structure to produce feature vectors. We used the vectors for the input of a fully connected neural network (FCNN) based tracker. We also introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) tracker as a state-of-the-art tracker and ensemble models of FCNN and CNN trackers. We used a common test bed Dialog State Tracking Challenge 4 for experiments. We confirmed the effectiveness of the associative knowledge feature vector and one ensemble model outperformed other models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2019
The dialogue response generation is a challenging task in chatbot applications. Recently neuralnetwork-based dialogue models including the sequence-to-sequence model and the RNN language models are able to generate fluent and grammatically compliant responses while there is a major limitation that most of the responses generated by these models are of chit-chat style instead of being informative. After investigating the currently used models we found that one primary challenge is to model and generate informative words such as named entities especially when the entities have sparsely existed in training corpus. To address this problem we propose to augment neural network-based generative architecture with knowledge embedding and knowledge attentive reader to incorporate external textual knowledge into the dialogue model to facilitate the dialogue modeling and generation. We evaluate the model with the Ubuntu dataset through automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation. The experimental study has shown our methods outperform strong baselines in multiple metrics. We also visualize how the attention works in the dialogue context to verify the effectiveness of knowledge attentive reader mechanism.;2019
The general role of personal assistants in form of anthropomorphised conversational virtual or robotic agents in cars is subject to research since a few years and the first results indicate numerous positive effects of these anthropomorphised interfaces. However no comprehensive review of the conducted studies has been comprised yet. Furthermore existing studies on the effect of anthropomorphism mainly focus on passenger cars. This article provides a comprehensive review and summary of the conducted studies and investigates the applicability to commercial transportation in particular to anthropomorphised interaction between truck driver and truck. In the first part of the article a literature review describes the details aspects and various forms of anthropomorphism as well as its observed positives effects. The review focusses on studies referring to anthropomorphism in passenger cars complemented by relevant research results from non-automotive disciplines. The second part of this article aims to derive innovative and applicable concepts for the anthropomorphised driver-truck interfaces using the Design-Thinking approach: building on a comprehensive literature review to identify user needs and problems an interdisciplinary expert workshop developed the two first anthropomorphised driver-truck interaction concepts. The paper finishes with carving out the differences between anthropomorphised car-driver and truck-driver interaction. The next step of research will then be the implementation of the developed interaction concepts in a first prototype followed by the respective user evaluation.;2019
The goal of automating complex human activities dates to antiquity. The mental health field has also made use of advances in technology to assist patients in need. Artificial Intelligence (Al) is the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. Al is increasingly being incorporated into the development of chatbots that can be deployed in both clinical and nonclinical settings. Chatbots are a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. The collaboration between Al therapists and more traditional providers of such care will only grow.;2019
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast-evolving ecosystem. As with any new and popular technology it includes important design details that need to be refined such as the standardization of APIs firmware architecture application development performance and security. There have been several studies on the IoT architecture the classification of IoT threats and the future of these devices. In this paper our goal is to create a general taxonomy for better understanding the large ecosystem of devices that span from commodity home appliances such as smart plugs digital assistants and web cameras to industry and health-care machines such as smart meters and robots. Our first contributions includes an IoT taxonomy based on generic building blocks that characterize IoT. Our second contribution is to demonstrate that this taxonomy is general and robust by including a simple yet effective algorithm to prove the taxonomy's completeness timelessness and precision. We compare our proposed taxonomy with another two taxonomies to identify any weaknesses or differences. We conclude that our taxonomy is more general and precise than the already existent ones. Finally our third contribution is to list two applications of this taxonomy. The first application demonstrates the classes defined by our taxonomy and how these groups of devices share similar architectures and can be standardized with common APIs tools and communication protocols. The second generates IoT models of correct operation that can be applied in intrusion detection or debugging faulty behavior. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2019
The paper reviews the state of the art of natural language engineering (NLE) around 1995 when this journal first appeared and makes a critical comparison with the current state of the art in 2018 as we prepare the 25th Volume. Specifically the then state of the art in parsing information extraction chatbots and dialogue systems speech processing and machine translation are briefly reviewed. The emergence in the 1980s and 1990s of machine learning (ML) and statistical methods (SM) is noted. Important trends and areas of progress in the subsequent years are identified. In particular the move to the use of n-grams or skip grams and/or chunking with part of speech tagging and away from whole sentence parsing is noted as is the increasing dominance of SM and ML. Some outstanding issues which merit further research are briefly pointed out including metaphor processing and the ethical implications of NLE.;2019
The present paper surveys neural approaches to conversational AI that have been developed in the last few years. We group conversational systems into three categories: (1) question answering agents (2) task-oriented dialogue agents and (3) chatbots. For each category we present a review of state-of-the-art neural approaches draw the connection between them and traditional approaches and discuss the progress that has been made and challenges still being faced using specific systems and models as case studies.;2019
The surgical treatment of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is one of the most common procedures performed by craniofacial surgeons. However for residents and fellows the high degree of difficulty and complex anatomy may result in slow progress along a steep learning curve. This is particularly important in the context of contemporary academic practice where work-hour limits and other factors restrict operative exposure and opportunities for trainees to learn. These issues have prompted the development of surgical simulation modalities that while prevalent in other surgical specialties have not been fully adopted in reconstructive surgery. Among these resources is the Craniofacial Interactive Virtual Assistant - Professional Edition (CIVA-Pro) a procedural cognition simulator that is free of charge. By integrating 3-dimensional virtual animation voice over and high-definition intraoperative video CIVA-Pro describes cardinal craniofacial surgery procedures in an engaging platform. In this study a detailed step-by-step description of the fronto-orbital advancement surgical technique to complement the corresponding CIVA-Pro module was presented. This synergistic combination of multimedia educational resources provides a unique didactic option for current trainees to prepare for surgery.;2019
The use of embodied conversational agents in mental health has increased in the last years. Several studies exist describing the benefits and advantages of this technology as a complement to psychotherapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment of depression anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder to name a few. A small number of these works implement capabilities in the virtual agent focused on the detection and prevention of suicidality risks. The work presented in this paper describes the development of an embodied conversational agent used as the main interface in HelPath a mobile-based application addressed to individuals detected with any of the suicidal behaviours: ideation planning or attempt. The main objective of HelPath is to continuously collect user's information that complemented with data from the electronic health record supports the identification of risks associated with suicidality. Through the virtual agent the users also receive information and suggestions based on cognitive behaviour therapy that would help them to maintain a healthy condition. The paper also presents the execution of an exploratory pilot to assess the acceptability perception and adherence of users towards the virtual agent. The obtained results are presented and discussed and some actions for further improvement of the embodied conversational agent are also identified.;2019
The use of new technologies to meet the demands of the agricultural market is increasing however technical information on application is scarce for some areas of knowledge including irrigation management. The objective of this study is to evaluate an automatic irrigation system with capacitance sensors connected to a local wireless network for the semiautomatic management of irrigation in tomato crops compared with a manual control system based on time-domain reflectometry (TDR)-type sensors. The experiments were carried out in a protected environment and the seedlings were transplanted following surface drip lines. The study adopted a completely randomized block design consisting of two treatments and 12 repetitions totaling 24 subplots. The evaluated treatments were an irrigation management system with TDR sensors and a manually-programmed controller and an irrigation management system with capacitance sensors and a semiautomatically-programmed controller connected to a digital assistant. Quantitative and qualitative parameters as well as the green and dry matter production were evaluated in each treatment. The results indicated that both sensors were effective in managing irrigation in tomato crops. Furthermore both systems were accurate and the Alexat digital assistant was efficient in programming the GreenIQ (R) semiautomatic system by voice commands.;2019
The virtual assistant concept is one that many technology companies have taken on despite having other well developed and popular user interfaces. We wondered whether it would be possible to create an effective virtual assistant for a medicinal chemistry organization the key being delivering the information the user would want to see directly to them at the right time. We introduce Kernel an early prototype virtual assistant created at Lilly and a number of examples of the scenarios that have been implemented to try to demonstrate the concept. A biochemical assay summary email is described that brings together new results and some basic analysis delivered within an hour of new data appearing for that assay and an email delivering new compound design ideas directly to the original submitter of a compound shortly after their compound was tested for the first time. We conclude with a high level description of the first example of a Design-Make-Test-Analyze cycle completed in the absence of any human intellectual input at Lilly. We believe that this concept has much potential in changing the way that computational results and analysis are delivered and consumed within a medicinal chemistry group and we hope to inspire others to implement their own similar solutions.;2019
The way doctors deliver bad news has a significant impact on the therapeutic process. In order to facilitate doctor's training we have developed an embodied conversational agent simulating a patient to train doctors to break bad news. In this article we present an evaluation of the virtual reality training platform comparing the users' experience depending on the virtual environment displays: a PC desktop a virtual reality headset and four wall fully immersive systems. The results of the experience including both real doctors and naive participants reveal a significant impact of the environment display on the perception of the user (sense of presence sense of co-presence perception of the believability of the virtual patient) showing moreover the different perceptions of the participants depending on their level of expertise.;2019

There has recently been a surge of development in augmented reality (AR) technologies that has led to an ecosystem of hardware and software for AR including tools for artists and designers to accelerate the design of AR content and experiences without requiring complex programming. AR is viewed as a key disruptive technology and future display technologies (such as digital eyewear) will provide seamless continuity between reality and the digitally augmented. This article will argue that the technologization of human perception and experience of reality coupled with the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language assistants may lead to a secular re-enchantment of the world in the sense outlined by Charles Taylor where human existence is shaped through AR inhabited by advanced personal and social AI agents in the form of digital avatars and daemons and that enchantment has been persistent throughout the formation of modernity and is being rekindled by the integration of AI in the plane of AR.;2019
This article explores how the shift from print to electronic calendars materializes and exacerbates a distinctively quantitative spreadsheet orientation to time. Drawing on interviews with engineers I argue that calendaring systems are emblematic of a larger design rationale in Silicon Valley to mechanize human thought and action in order to make them more efficient and reliable. The belief that technology can be profitably employed to control and manage time has a long history and continues to animate contemporary sociotechnical imaginaries of what automation will deliver. In the current moment we live in the age of the algorithm and machine learning so it is no wonder then that the contemporary design of digital calendars is driven by a vision of intelligent time management. As I go on to show in the second part of the article this vision is increasingly realized in the form of intelligent digital assistants whose tracking capacities and behavioral algorithms aim to solve life's existential problem-how best to organize the time of our lives. This article contributes to STS scholarship on the role of technological artifacts in generating new temporalities that shape people's perception of time how they act in the world and how they understand themselves.;2019
This article explores questions about chatbots in particular and artificial intelligence (AI) in general from a Pauline that is a Christian theological perspective. It does so in a way that focuses on a particular scene in the New Testament: Paul in the Athenian Areopagus considering an altar to an unknown God quoting Greek poets and philosophers and sharing curious theology as he dialogues with Stoic and Epicurean thinkers (Acts 17:16-34). By examining the sociohistorical nuances of this scene and their philosophical and theological implications this article shows how the altar Paul considers philosophically and theologically becomes the focal point for an important dialogue about apocalyptic ends or ideas about who we are where we are going and who or what is responsible for that who-ness and where-ness. In turn this can teach us how to ask practical questions which can uncover the unsuspected apocalyptic ends represented by or even contained within common technological objects such as chatbots.;2019
This article presents the results of a systematic review of the literature on dialogue-based CALL resulting in a conceptual framework for research on the matter. Applications allowing a learner to have a conversation in a foreign language with a computer have been studied from various perspectives and under different names (dialogue systems conversational agents chatbots horizontal ellipsis ). Considering the fragmentation of what we identify under the term dialogue-based CALL we attempt to offer a structured overview of these efforts into a conceptual framework. Through a methodical search strategy we collected a corpus of 343 publications. From this corpus we formalized an operational definition of dialogue-based CALL which allowed us to identify 96 relevant systems. Analyzing the type of dialogue they offer on a continuum of constraints on form and meaning we propose to classify those systems into four groups. We have called these branching form-focused goal-oriented and reactive systems and we describe their corresponding interactional instructional and technological traits. We summarize the main results from empirical studies on such systems distinguishing observational survey and experimental studies and discuss the impact of dialogue-based CALL on motivation and L2 development identifying positive evidence on both outcomes. Finally we propose two main avenues for future research: relative effectiveness of dialogue-based CALL approaches and dialogue systems as an environment for testing SLA hypotheses.;2019
This commentary for the special issue on the automation of journalism highlights the progress made in this area of study before advocating for researchers to pay greater attention to the audience and its perceptions of the technologies of automation including algorithms artificial intelligence chatbots recommender and personalization systems and automated news-writing software.;2019
This paper describes the experimental setups and the evaluation results of the sixth Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC6) aiming to develop end-to-end dialogue systems. Neural network models have become a recent focus of investigation in dialogue technologies. Previous models required training data to be manually annotated with word meanings and dialogue states but end-to-end neural network dialogue systems learn to directly output natural-language system responses without needing training data to be manually annotated. Thus this approach allows us to scale up the size of training data and cover more dialog domains. In addition dialogue systems require a meta-function to avoid deploying inappropriate responses generated by themselves. To challenge such issues the DSTC6 consists of three tracks (1). End-to-End Goal Oriented dialogue Learning to select system responses (2). End-to-End Conversation Modeling to generate system responses using Natural Language Generation (NLG) and (3). Dialogue Breakdown Detection. Since each domain has different issues to be addressed to develop dialogue systems we targeted restaurant retrieval dialogues to fill slot-value in Track 1 customer services on Twitter by combining goal-oriented dialogues and ChitChat in Track 2 and human-machine dialogue data for ChitChat in Track 3. DSTC6 had 141 people declaring their interests and 23 teams submitted their final results. 18 scientific papers were presented in the wrap-up workshop. We find the blending end-to-end trainable models associated to meaningful prior knowledge performs the best for the restaurant retrieval for Track 1. Indeed Hybrid Code Network and Memory Network have been the best models for this task. In Track 2 78.5% of the system responses automatically generated by the best system were rated better than acceptable by humans and this achieves 89% of the number of the human responses rated in the same class. In Track3 the dialogue breakdown detection technologies performed as well as human agreements in both data-sets of English and Japanese. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2019
This paper explores the potential of using chatbots to improve the academic research experience for university students with a literature-based discussion reflecting on a prototype being developed at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The paper proposes that information professionals need to adapt emerging technologies such as chatbots to innovate improve and support library services. Designing a positive experience for the user is essential to ensure that such technological solutions are sustainable. In this exploratory paper we argue that it is important that librarians engage with the conversational design of the library chatbot in collaboration with the technology developers in order to make it useful friendly trustworthy and customisable for university students.;2019
This paper presents adversarial training and decoding methods for neural conversation models that can generate natural responses given dialog contexts. In our prior work we built several end-to-end conversation systems for the 6th Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC6) Twitter help-desk dialog task. These systems included novel extensions of sequence adversarial training example-based response extraction and Minimum Bayes-Risk based system combination. In DSTC6 our systems achieved the best performance in most objective measures such as BLEU and METEOR scores and decent performance in a subjective measure based on human rating. In this paper we provide a complete set of our experiments for DSTC6 and further extend the training and decoding strategies more focusing on improving the subjective measure where we combine responses of three adversarial models. Experimental results demonstrate that the extended methods improve the human rating score and outperform the best score in DSTC6. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2019
This paper reports on an experiment that investigates the effect of interacting with a personality-driven embodied conversational agent (ECA) on the perceived social presence and game experience of people in a VR social simulator. Furthermore the dynamics between the different metrics of game experience and social presence of people are explored to determine which game experience metrics are the strongest predictors of perceived social presence in this context. A personality-based emotional model is used for personifying the employed ECA which governs the manifestation of its non-verbal behaviors. Three experimental conditions manipulating the existence and intensity of non-verbal behaviors exhibited by the ECA were used to investigate the effect of this proposed approach. The results of the experiment with 41 participants indicate that people who were exposed to an extrovert ECA experienced significantly higher levels of behavioral involvement as part of their social presence compared to the other conditions. These results suggest that incorporating personality by means of non-verbal behavior in the emotional model of an ECA influences users perceived feeling of social presence. Furthermore our results reveal that there is a bidirectional relationship between game experience metrics and perceived social presence of people as each predict the other.;2019
This project has been carried out in the context of recent major developments in botics and more widespread usage of virtual agents in personal and professional sphere. The general purpose of the experiment was to thoroughly examine the character of the human-non-human interaction process. Thus in the paper we present a study of human-chatbot interaction focusing on the affective responses of users to different types of interfaces with which they interact. The experiment consisted of two parts: measurement of psychophysiological reactions of chatbot users and a detailed questionnaire that focused on assessing interactions and willingness to collaborate with a bot. In the first quantitative stage participants interacted with a chatbot either with a simple text chatbot (control group) or an avatar reading its responses in addition to only presenting them on the screen (experimental group. We gathered the following psychophysiological data from participants: electromyography (EMG) respirometer (RSP) electrocardiography (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA). In the last declarative stage participants filled out a series of questionnaires related to the experience of interacting with (chat)bots and to the overall human-(chat)bot collaboration assessment. The theory of planned behaviour survey investigated attitude towards cooperation with chatbots in the future. The social presence survey checked how much the chatbot was considered to be a real person. The anthropomorphism scale measured the extent to which the chatbot seems humanlike. Our particular focus was on the so-called uncanny valley effect consisting of the feeling of eeriness and discomfort towards a given medium or technology that frequently appears in various kinds of human-machine interactions. Our results show that participants were experiencing lesser uncanny effects and less negative affect in cooperation with a simpler text chatbot than with the more complex animated avatar chatbot. The simple chatbot have also induced less intense psychophysiological reactions. Despite major developments in botics the user's affective responses towards bots have frequently been neglected. In our view understanding the user's side may be crucial for designing better chatbots in the future and thus can contribute to advancing the field of human-computer interaction.

This research aims to develop a dialogue system for eliminating difficulties encountered in the efficient and accurate utilization of information for decision makers at emergency operation centers (EOC). The rapid growth in the amount of data has caused complications in decision making tasks in disaster management. This has increased the difficulty for decision makers when they try to accomplish their mission accurately and efficiently. In our preliminary work we attempted to develop a chatbot for decision makers and staff at an EOC to assist them in the utilization selection and processing of information efficiently and accurately. A user experience test revealed that a better adaption of the dialogue system to the characteristics of disaster management and the EOC was required. Thus we specifically focused on the development of a technique of language understanding (LU) to be able to analyze the user's demands. As a solution we developed a framework for a dialogue system combining question answering features a knowledge base as the knowledge provider and a search module that can handle the relatively difficult querying tasks. To improve the performance of the system we focused on enhancing the capability in understanding users' questions. The construction of the question analysis and knowledge base were both adapted to the characteristics of disaster management. The validation shows that our method can analyze and process the user's questions into a machine-acceptable form with a success rate of approximately 70%.;2019
This research developed a keyword-based chatbot system Ask Diana for water-related disaster management. Disaster management has been considered difficult and tedious due to the complex characteristics of disaster-related data. To deal with this problem this research developed a chatbot system with a water-related disaster database a user intent mechanism and an intuitive mobile-device-based user interface. With such a system users are able to access important data or information they need for decision making by directly asking the proposed chatbot or operating the image-based menus. The system was validated through a usability test and a six-month field test. The results demonstrated that Ask Diana can help related personnel access disaster data intuitively and develop corresponding response strategies efficiently.;2019
This research investigated the strategic development of a large-scale transdisciplinary area named intelligent infrastructure for human-centred communities at Virginia Tech. Within such development this study explored the future vision and anticipated scenarios of data infrastructure and digital libraries for smart community development. It draws upon the mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic participant observation document analysis and semi-structured interviews. Grounded in socio-technical framework and rooted in empirical methods this research produces results that augment design thinking and visioning practice for digital data libraries beyond traditional boundaries. The findings reveal the emerging scenarios around complex adaptive systems intelligent data infrastructure and future digital libraries all in the context of building infrastructure for human-centred communities. Situated in this advancing reality the results further discuss the next-generation data and information user experience smart infrastructure data environment and future library capabilities. The article concludes that a smart library system whether in its conceptual form of a 'digital octopus' or a 'smart village data hub' or an 'intelligent virtual assistant' will provide intelligence in data gathering processing summarising communication and recommendations. By delivering unified and personalised data solutions it will offer an end-to-end seamless experience for users throughout their journey of knowledge pursuit.;2019
This review positions current conceptions of interest and its development as a critical and (importantly) sustainable source of motivation for learning a new language across formal education. We begin with the gap in our understanding of motivation to learn a new language generated by the longstanding dominance of applied linguistics identity/sociocultural theoretical frameworks in school learning environments. The Four-Phase Model (Hidi & Renninger 2006) and an extension with specific relevance for the highly structured nature of formal education is reviewed and implications for second and foreign language learning classrooms are drawn. This review concludes with future directions for interested language learning researchers and essential first steps for instructors seeking to support the initiation and continued development of students' interest in their languagelearning classrooms.

This special issue examines the growing importance of algorithms and automation in the gathering composition and distribution of news. It connects a long line of research on journalism and computation with scholarly and professional terrain yet to be explored. Taken as a whole these articles share some of the noble ambitions of the pioneering publications on 'reporting algorithms' such as a desire to see computing help journalists in their watchdog role by holding power to account. However they also go further firstly by addressing the fuller range of technologies that computational journalism now consists of: from chatbots and recommender systems to artificial intelligence and atomised journalism. Secondly they advance the literature by demonstrating the increased variety of uses for these technologies including engaging underserved audiences selling subscriptions and recombining and re-using content. Thirdly they problematize computational journalism by for example pointing out some of the challenges inherent in applying AI to investigative journalism and in trying to preserve public service values. Fourthly they offer suggestions for future research and practice including by presenting a framework for developing democratic news recommenders and another that may help us think about computational journalism in a more integrated structured manner.;2019
This study aimed to identify and describe the fundamental characteristics of spoken dialogue systems and their role in supporting human-robot interaction and enabling the communication between socially assistive robots and patients with dementia. First this work provides an overview of spoken dialogue systems by considering the underlying technologies approaches methods and general issues. Then the analysis focuses on studies systems and approaches that have investigated the role of dialogue systems and conversational agents in the interaction with elderly people with dementia by presenting the results of a literature review. While the overview of spoken dialogue systems relies on existing surveys and reviews a research was conducted to identify existing works in the literature that have investigated the role of conversational agents and dialogue systems in the elderly and people with cognitive impairments. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) use of conversational agents dialogue systems or language processing tools for people with cognitive impairments (2) age 60 years (3) diagnosis of dementia according to National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIAAA) criteria (4) presence of tests or experiments with qualitative or quantitative results. Initially 125 studies published between 2000 and 2017 were identified of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. The review identifies the issues and challenges that are reported when conversational agents and speech-based interfaces have been used for interacting with people with cognitive impairments. In addition the review led to the identification of studies that have investigated speech processing and natural language processing capabilities to assess the cognitive status of people with dementia.;2019
This study conducts a mapping study to survey the landscape of health chatbots along three research questions: What illnesses are chatbots tackling? What patient competences are chatbots aimed at? Which chatbot technical enablers are of most interest in the health domain? We identify 30 articles related to health chatbots from 2014 to 2018. We analyze the selected articles qualitatively and extract a triplet <technicalEnablers competence illness> for each of them. This data serves to provide a first overview of chatbot-mediated behavior change on the health domain. Main insights include: nutritional disorders and neurological disorders as the main illness areas being tackled affect as the human competence most pursued by chatbots to attain change behavior and personalization and consumability as the most appreciated technical enablers. On the other hand main limitations include lack of adherence to good practices to case-study reporting and a deeper look at the broader sociological implications brought by this technology.;2019
This study considers the problem of reliably detecting wind in portable devices such as mobile phones personal digital assistants (PDA) tablet computers and alike. A multi-microphone wind detector is presented that utilizes statistical analysis of microphone signals. This statistical analysis is used to quantify the discrepancy in dynamic behavior of the microphone signals. Empirical Distribution Function (EDF) is proposed to capture the dynamic behavior of each microphone signal and the discrepancy in this behavior is quantified using mean absolute difference between the corresponding EDFs. A decision about wind presence is made separately for each chosen sub-band in order to avoid performing wind noise reduction in a part of audio spectrum which was not affected by wind-induced noise. The proposed wind detector demonstrates reliable detection of wind for each chosen sub-band in an exemplary mobile phone application. Performance evaluation confirms superiority of the proposed sub-band wind detector in terms of correct detection and false alarm compared to a state-of-the art wind detector.;2019
This study examined effects of self-disclosure on relationship closeness with an Internet of Things (IoT) conversational agent (IoT-CA) and attributions of responsibility. Participants and IoT-CAs worked as dyads for two interdependent-outcome tasks: a creativity and a learning task (for measuring dyadic creativity ability and IoT-CAs' understanding of people's preferences respectively). Dyadic success or failure feedback was determined. Results showed in contrast to self-serving bias (SSB) people did not credit personal responsibility for dyadic success or blame the IoT-CA for dyadic failure. However when people had previously engaged in self-disclosure with IoT-CAs they showed reversed SSB and tended to attribute success to the IoT-CA and accept more personal responsibility for failure. The effect of self-disclosure on attributions of responsibility was mediated by closeness of the relationship. In terms of attributions of responsibility between tasks people who engaged in self-disclosure with IoT-CAs believed IoT-CAs understood them more and were more likely to attribute success to the learning task.;2019
This study experimentally investigated the design of effective interactions using pedagogical conversational agents (PCAs) in a learner-learner collaborative learning activity. While dyads engaged in a concept explanation task (explaining the mechanism of computer processing) PCAs served as facilitators and provided metacognitive suggestions to better improve learning performance. Previous studies have shown that learners who received several types of suggestions from multiple PCAs were motivated to produce effective explanations this study then further explored the effects of using multiple PCAs in different roles providing different types of facilitation. It was predicted that by using two different PCAs to offer suggestions with a delay learners may be able to process information more efficiently for example by paying closer attention to each type of suggestion. To investigate this possibility two types of facilitating content namely provision of metacognitive suggestions and advice on effective coordination were each implemented into two role-playing PCAs named the explanation adviser and the communication adviser respectively. The results show that when learners used PCAs playing different roles and offering suggestions corresponding to these roles learners generated explanations related to the suggestions and improved performance (efficacy of explanations) in several areas including learning performance for example better understanding the concept and becoming able to explain it using a greater range of technical words. This study shows empirically how multiple PCAs can be effectively designed to implement roles yielding different types of suggestions. The advantages of using such methods and implementing such functions of PCAs are further discussed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.;2019
This study investigates whether social-versus task-oriented interaction of virtual shopping assistants differentially benefits low versus high Internet competency older consumers with respect to social (perceived interactivity trust) cognitive (perceived information load) functional (self-efficacy perceived ease of use perceived usefulness) and behavioral intent (website patronage intent) outcomes in an online shopping task. A total of 121 older adults (61-89 years) participated in a laboratory experiment with a 2 (digital assistant interaction style: (social-vs. task-oriented) x 2 (user Internet competency: low vs. high) x 2 (user exchange modality: text vs. voice) between-subjects design. The results revealed that users Internet competency and the digital assistant's conversational style had significant interaction effects on social functional and behavioral intent outcomes. Social-oriented digital assistants lead to superior social outcomes (enhanced perceptions of two-way interactivity and trust in the integrity of the site) for older users with high Internet competency who need less task-related assistance. On the other hand low-competency older users showed significantly superior cognitive (lower perceived information load) and functional outcomes (greater perceived ease and self-efficacy of using the site) when the digital assistant employed a task-oriented interaction style. Theoretical and agent design implications are discussed.;2019
This study presents a learning-by-imitation technique that learns social robot interaction behaviors from natural human-human interaction data and requires minimum input from a designer. To solve the problem of responding to ambiguous human actions a novel topic clustering algorithm based on action co-occurrence frequencies is introduced. The system learns human-readable rules that dictate which action the robot should take based on the most recent human action and the current estimated topic of conversation. The technique is demonstrated in a scenario where the robot learns to play the role of a travel agent. The proposed technique outperformed several baseline techniques in qualitative and quantitative evaluations. It responded more accurately to ambiguous questions and participants found it was easier to understand provided more information and required less effort to interact with.;2019
This study presents a reference model (RM) and the architecture of a cognitive health advisor (CHA) that integrates information with ambient intelligence. By controlling the information using the CHA platform the reference model can provide various ambient intelligent solutions to a user. Herein a novel approach to a CHA RM based on evolutional cyber-physical systems is proposed. The objective of the CHA RM is to improve personal health by managing data integration from many devices as well as conduct a new feedback cycle which includes training and consulting to improve quality of life. The RM can provide an overview of the basis for implementing concrete software architectures. The proposed RM provides a standardized clarification for developers and service designers in the design and implementation process. The CHA RM provides a new approach to developing a digital healthcare model that includes integrated systems subsystems and components. New features for chatbots and feedback functions set the position of the conversational interface system to improve human health by integrating information analytics and decisions and feedback as an advisor on the CHA platform.;2019
To generate proper responses to user queries multi-turn chatbot models should selectively consider dialogue histories. However previous chatbot models have simply concatenated or averaged vector representations of all previous utterances without considering contextual importance. To mitigate this problem we propose a multi-turn chatbot model in which previous utterances participate in response generation using different weights. The proposed model calculates the contextual importance of previous utterances by using an attention mechanism. In addition we propose a training method that uses two types of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks to improve the quality of responses. In experiments with the DailyDialog dataset the proposed model outperformed the previous state-of-the-art models based on various performance measures.;2019
Today most of the users on the move require contextualized local and georeferenced information. Several solutions aim to meet these trends thus assisting users and satisfying their needs and preferences such as virtual assistants and Location-Aware Recommender Systems (LABS) both in commercial and research literature. However general purpose virtual assistants usually have to manage large domains dealing with big amounts of data and online resources losing focus on more specific requirements and local information. On the other hand traditional recommender systems are based on filtering techniques and contextual knowledge and they usually do not rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) features on users' queries which are useful to understand and contextualize users' necessities on the spot. Therefore comprehending the actual users' information needs and other key information that can be included in the user query such as geographical references is a challenging task which is not yet fully accomplished by current state-of-the-art solutions. In this paper we propose Paval (Location-Aware Virtual Personal Assistant(2)) a semantic assisting engine for suggesting local points of interest (POIs) and services by analyzing users' natural language queries in order to estimate the information need and potential geographic references expressed by the users. The system exploits NLP and semantic techniques providing as output recommendations on local geolocated POIs and services which best match the users' requests retrieved by querying our semantic Km4City Knowledge Base. The proposed system is validated against the most popular virtual assistants such as Google Assistant Apple Sid and Microsoft Cortana focusing the assessment on the request of geolocated POIs and services showing very promising capabilities in successfully estimating the users' information needs and multiple geographic references.;2019
Today's common practice in developing conversational agents is pipelining off-the-shelf modularized services as ready-made building blocks. However the discrete and sequential nature of the modules yields long response latency. We introduce Sci-Fii a speculative inference framework accelerating conversational agent systems built with off-the-shelf modules while keeping the modules unchanged.;2019
Trainable chatbots that exhibit fluent and human-like conversations remain a big challenge in artificial intelligence. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is promising for addressing this challenge but its successful application remains an open question. This article describes a novel ensemble-based approach applied to value-based DRL chatbots which use finite action sets as a form of meaning representation. In our approach while dialogue actions are derived from sentence clustering the training datasets in our ensemble are derived from dialogue clustering. The latter aim to induce specialised agents that learn to interact in a particular style. In order to facilitate neural chatbot training using our proposed approach we assume dialogue data in raw text only - without any manually-labelled data. Experimental results using chitchat data reveal that (1) near human-like dialogue policies can be induced (2) generalisation to unseen data is a difficult problem and (3) training an ensemble of chatbot agents is essential for improved performance over using a single agent. In addition to evaluations using held-out data our results are further supported by a human evaluation that rated dialogues in terms of fluency engagingness and consistency - which revealed that our proposed dialogue rewards strongly correlate with human judgements.

Voice has become a widespread and commercially viable interaction mechanism with the introduction of voice assistants (VAs) such as Amazon's Alexa Apple's Ski Google Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. Despite their prevalence we do not have a detailed understanding of how these technologies are used in domestic spaces. To understand how people use VAs we conducted interviews with 19 users and analyzed the log files of 82 Amazon Alexa devices totaling 193665 commands and 88 Google Home Devices totaling 65499 commands. In our analysis we identified music search and IoT usage as the command categories most used by VA users. We explored how VAs are used in the home investigated the role of VAs as scaffolding for Internet of Things device control and characterized emergent issues of privacy for VA users. We conclude with implications for the design of VAs and for future research studies of VAs.;2019
We aim to draw on an important overlooked potential of affective dialogue systems-their application to promote positive emotional states similar to that of emotional support between humans. This can be achieved by eliciting a more positive emotional valence throughout a dialogue system interaction i.e. positive emotion elicitation. Existing works on emotion elicitation have not yet paid attention to the emotional benefit for the users. Moreover a positive emotion elicitation corpus does not yet exist despite the growing number of emotion-rich corpora. Towards this goal first we propose a response retrieval approach for positive emotion elicitation by utilizing examples of emotion appraisal from a dialogue corpus. Second we efficiently construct a corpus using the proposed retrieval method by replacing responses in a dialogue with those that elicit a more positive emotion. We validate the corpus through crowdsourcing to ensure its quality. Finally we propose a novel neural network architecture for an emotion-sensitive neural chat-based dialogue system optimized on the constructed corpus to elicit positive emotion. Objective and subjective evaluations show that the proposed methods result in dialogue responses that are more natural and elicit a more positive emotional response. Further analyses of the results are discussed in this paper.;2019
We develop a model to satisfy the requirements of Dialog System Technology Challenge 6 (DSTC6) Track 1: building an end-to-end dialog systems for goal-oriented applications. This task involves learning a dialog policy from transactional dialogs in a given domain. Automatic system responses are generated using given task-oriented dialog data (http://workshop.colips.org/dstc6/index.html). As this task has a similar structure to a question answering task (Weston et al. 2015) we employ the MemN2N architecture (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015) which outperforms models based on recurrent neural networks or long short-term memory (LSTM). However two problems arise when applying this model to the DSTC6 task. First we encounter an out-of-vocabulary problem which we resolve by categorizing the metadata types of words that exist in the knowledge base the metadata is similar to the named entity. Second the original memory network model has a weak ability to reflect sufficient temporal information because it only uses sentence-level embeddings. Therefore we add bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) at the beginning of the model to better reflect temporal information. The experimental results demonstrate that our model reflects temporal features well. Furthermore our model achieves state-of-the-art performance among the memory networks and is comparable to hybrid code networks (Ham et al. 2017) and hierarchical LSTM model (Bai et al. 2017) which is not an end-to-end architecture.

We have developed MMDAgent (a fully open-source toolkit for voice interaction systems) which runs on a variety of platforms such as personal computers and smartphones. From this the editing environment of the dialog scenario also needs to be operated on various platforms. So we develop a scenario editor that is implemented on a Web browser. The purpose of this paper also includes making it easy to edit the scenario. Experiments were conducted for subjects using the proposed scenario editor. It was found that our proposed system provides better readability of a scenario and allows easier editing. (C) 2018 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS).

We introduce the task of Visual Dialog which requires an Al agent to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural conversational language about visual content. Specifically given an image a dialog history and a question about the image the agent has to ground the question in image infer context from history and answer the question accurately. Visual Dialog is disentangled enough from a specific downstream task so as to serve as a general test of machine intelligence while being sufficiently grounded in vision to allow objective evaluation of individual responses and benchmark progress. We develop a novel two-person real-time chat data-collection protocol to curate a large-scale Visual Dialog dataset (VisDial). VisDial v0.9 has been released and consists of similar to 1.2M dialog question-answer pairs from 10-round human-human dialogs grounded in similar to 120k images from the COCO dataset. We introduce a family of neural encoder-decoder models for Visual Dialog with 3 encoders-Late Fusion Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder and Memory Network (optionally with attention over image features)-and 2 decoders (generative and discriminative) which outperform a number of sophisticated baselines. We propose a retrieval-based evaluation protocol for Visual Dialog where the Al agent is asked to sort a set of candidate answers and evaluated on metrics such as mean-reciprocal-rank and recall@k of human response. We quantify the gap between machine and human performance on the Visual Dialog task via human studies. Putting it all together we demonstrate the first 'visual chatbot'! Our dataset code pretrained models and visual chatbot are available on https://visualdialog.org.;2019
We present artificial intelligent (AI) agents that act as interviewers to engage with a user in a text-based conversation and automatically infer the user's personality traits. We investigate how the personality of an AI interviewer and the inferred personality of a user influences the user's trust in the AI interviewer from two perspectives: the user's willingness to confide in and listen to an AI interviewer. We have developed two AI interviewers with distinct personalities and deployed them in a series of real-world events. We present findings from four such deployments involving 1280 users including 606 actual job applicants. Notably users are more willing to confide in and listen to an AI interviewer with a serious assertive personality in a high-stakes job interview. Moreover users' personality traits inferred from their chat text along with interview context influence their perception of and their willingness to confide in and listen to an AI interviewer. Finally we discuss the design implications of our work on building hyper-personalized intelligent agents.;2019
We present the interactive assistant ROBERT that provides situation-adaptive support in the realisation of do-it-yourself (DIY) home improvement projects. ROBERT assists its users by providing comprehensive step-by-step instructions for completing the DIY project. Each instruction is illustrated with detailed graphics written and spoken text as well as with videos. They explain how the steps of the project have to be prepared and assembled and give precise instructions on how to operate the required electric devices. The step-by-step instructions are generated by a hierarchical planner which enables ROBERT to adapt to a multitude of environments easily. Parts of the underlying model are derived from an ontology storing information about the available devices and resources. A dialogue manager capable of natural language interaction is responsible for hands-free interaction. We explain the required background technology and present preliminary results of an empirical evaluation.;2019
We present VICA a Visual Counseling Agent designed to create an engaging multimedia face-to-face interaction. VICA is a human-friendly agent equipped with high-performance voice conversation designed to help psychologically stressed users to offload their emotional burden. Such users specifically include non-computer-savvy elderly persons or clients. Our agent builds replies exploiting interlocutor's utterances expressing such as wishes obstacles emotions etc. Statements asking for confirmation details emotional summary or relations among such expressions are added to the utterances. We claim that VICA is suitable for positive counseling scenarios where multimedia specifically high-performance voice communication is instrumental for even the old or digital divided users to continue dialogue towards their self-awareness. To prove this claim VICA's effect is evaluated with respect to a previous text-based counseling agent CRECA and ELIZA including its successors. An experiment involving 14 subjects shows VICA effects as follows: (i) the dialogue continuation (CPS: Conversation-turns Per Session) of VICA for the older half (age>40) substantially improved 53% to CRECA and 71% to ELIZA. (ii) VICA's capability to foster peace of mind and other positive feelings was assessed with a very high score of 5 or 6 mostly out of 7 stages of the Likert scale again by the older. Compared on average such capability of VICA for the older is 5.14 while CRECA (all subjects are young students age<25) is 4.50 ELIZA is 3.50 and the best of ELIZA's successors for the older (>25) is 4.41.;2019
We propose novel interpersonal assistants a next-generation conversational agent which is always-on unobtrusively serving natural human-to-human conversations. We deepen the motivation and design insights with real practices in language delays and parent-child conflicts. We then present a common platform initiative to effectively support rapid development of interpersonal assistant applications with a highlight on the key functional element of turn isolations and technical insights on microstructural dynamics.;2019
We propose Quantized Dialog a novel approach for the development of conversational systems. The methodology relies on the semantic quantization and clustering of the dialog utterances in order to reduce the dialog interaction space making prediction of the next utterance more tractable. The effectiveness of this method is showcased using the goal-oriented dataset of the sixth Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC6). We compare the performance of Quantized Dialog based on an n-gram language model for next-utterance prediction against other models that employ popular deep-learning architectures such as multi-layer neural network classifiers memory networks long short-term memory recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate the promising potential of the new quantized approach in goal-oriented dialog prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2019
We study the problem of response selection for multi-turn conversation in retrieval-based chatbots. The task involves matching a response candidate with a conversation context the challenges for which include how to recognize important parts of the context and how to model the relationships among utterances in the context. Existing matching methods may lose important information in contexts as we can interpret them with a unified framework in which contexts are transformed to fixed-length vectors without any interaction with responses before matching. This motivates us to propose a new matching framework that can sufficiently carry important information in contexts to matching and model relationships among utterances at the same time. The new framework which we call a sequential matching framework (SMF) lets each utterance in a context interact with a response candidate at the first step and transforms the pair to a matching vector. The matching vectors are then accumulated following the order of the utterances in the context with a recurrent neural network (RNN) that models relationships among utterances. Context-response matching is then calculated with the hidden states of the RNN. Under SMF we propose a sequential convolutional network and sequential attention network and conduct experiments on two public data sets to test their performance. Experiment results show that both models can significantly outperform state-of-the-art matching methods. We also show that the models are interpretable with visualizations that provide us insights on how they capture and leverage important information in contexts for matching.;2019
Wearable biometric monitoring devices (BMDs) and artificial intelligence (Al) enable the remote measurement and analysis of patient data in real time. These technologies have generated a lot of hype but their real-world effectiveness will depend on patients' uptake. Our objective was to describe patients' perceptions of the use of BMDs and Al in healthcare. We recruited adult patients with chronic conditions in France from the Community of Patients for Research (ComPaRe). Participants (1) answered quantitative and open-ended questions about the potential benefits and dangers of using of these new technologies and (2) participated in a case-vignette experiment to assess their readiness for using BMD5 and Al in healthcare. Vignettes covered the use of Al to screen for skin cancer remote monitoring of chronic conditions to predict exacerbations smart clothes to guide physical therapy and Al chatbots to answer emergency calls. A total of 1183 patients (51% response rate) were enrolled between May and June 2018. Overall 20% considered that the benefits of technology (e.g. improving the reactivity in care and reducing the burden of treatment) greatly outweighed the dangers. Only 3% of participants felt that negative aspects (inadequate replacement of human intelligence risks of hacking and misuse of private patient data) greatly outweighed potential benefits. We found that 35% of patients would refuse to integrate at least one existing or soon-to-be available intervention using BMD5 and Al-based tools in their care. Accounting for patients' perspectives will help make the most of technology without impairing the human aspects of care generating a burden or intruding on patients' lives.;2019
Web API recommendations have recently been studied extensively. However recommending an API for a service is different than service intelligence. Web API automatic calls are widely used in question-answer dialog applications and service-composed workflow systems to achieve intelligent services. To finish an automatic Web API call not only requires the Web API ID but also its input parameters. In this paper we propose an end-to-end Web API automatic calls approach named WAAC that translates a goal's natural language sentences directly to the Web API invoking sequences including its ID and parameters. This end-to-end approach based on the seq2seq encoder-decoder framework adopts character-level RNN for the Chinese sentences and introduces a copying mechanism to retrieve API parameters. To train the network a Chinese version dataset of over 1 million natural sentences and API invoking sequence pairs are generated with some manually labeled data and 72 real Web API invoking logs. Experiments obtain a 96% precision on predicting API invoking sequences and show that the character-level RNN and copying mechanism both contribute considerably to achieving a high precision Web API automatic call system for goal-oriented services.;2019
When an Amazon Echo is activated the device is constantly recording and sending those recordings to Amazon's cloud. For an always recording device such as the Echo getting consent from every person subject to a recording proves difficult. An Echo-owner consents to the recordings when they purchase and register the device but when does a guest in an Echo-owner's home consent to being recorded? This Comment uses Amazon's Echo and Washington's privacy statute to illustrate the tension between speech-activated devices and two-party consent laws-which require that all parties subject to a recording consent to being recorded. This Comment argues that the Washington State Legislature should enact a statute that mirrors the Anti-Eavesdropping Act and carve out a civil cause of action against manufacturers of speech-activated devices for individuals that are harmed by violations of the two-party consent law.;2019
Why do we perceive virtual assistants as something radically new? Our hypothesis is that today virtual assistants are raising an expectation for natural interaction with the human. Human interaction is by nature cognitive and collaborative. Human sciences help to flesh the ingredients of such cognitive interaction. Uttering a sentence is at the same time: producing sound making a well-formed sentence giving meaning enriching a common background of beliefs and intentions making something together. In this paper we remind the basics of human cognitive communication as developed by human sciences particularly philosophy of mind. We propose a definition of this way of interacting with computer as 'cognitive interaction' and we summarize the main characteristics of this interaction mode into a layered model. Finally we develop case studies to illustrate concretely the concepts. We analyze in light of our theoretical model three approaches of conversational systems in Al to illustrate the different available options to implement the pragmatic dimension of cognitive interaction. We analyze first the seminal approach of Grosz and Sidner [20] and then we describe how the now classical approach of discourse structure developed by Asher and Lascarides [5] could capture the pragmatic dimension of interaction with an intelligent virtual assistant. Finally we wonder whether a state-of-the-art chat bot framework actually implements the needed level of cognitive interaction. The contribution of this paper is: to remind and summarize essential ideas from other disciplines which are relevant to understand what should be the interaction with virtual assistants should be to explain why the cooperation with virtual assistants is something special to delineate the challenges we have to solve if we are to develop truly collaborative virtual assistants.

Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is evolving as the successful way of monitoring patient health and offers enhanced healthcare solutions to provide the better quality of life for the urban community. As it involves wireless communications securing the privacy-related data is a key constraint in WBAN. To ensure privacy it is essential to include authentication to prevent unauthorized access by intruders. This paper proposes the privacy preserving LightwEight two factors Authentication Protocol (LEAP) for WBAN based on genus-2 Hyper Elliptic Curve (HEC). Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) collects signals from sensors from the BAN. PDA transmits the healthcare data to the Healthcare Service Provider (HSP) connected in the public network. Hence the two-factor mutual authentication protocol is established between PDA and HSP. Since PDA is considered as a resource constraint device the lightweight mutual authentication is required. Genus 2 Hyper elliptic curve (HEC) is carefully designed to prevent all possible cryptographic attacks which is more suitable for lightweight authentication since it provides the high degree of security with the lesser key size even as compared to the elliptic curve. Using the rigorous formal security analysis using BAN logic it is proved that the proposed scheme is secure against possible attacks. Also the privacy preserving lightweight authentication scheme is implemented using the most-widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool and the simulation results reveal that proposed scheme is secure and robust.;2019
With the growing use of information technology in all life domains hacking has become more negatively effective than ever before. Also with developing technologies attacks numbers are growing exponentially every few months and become more sophisticated so that traditional IDS becomes inefficient detecting them. This paper proposes a solution to detect not only new threats with higher detection rate and lower false positive than already used IDS but also it could detect collective and contextual security attacks. We achieve those results by using Networking Chatbot a deep recurrent neural network: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on top of Apache Spark Framework that has an input of flow traffic and traffic aggregation and the output is a language of two words normal or abnormal. We propose merging the concepts of language processing contextual analysis distributed deep learning big data anomaly detection of flow analysis. We propose a model that describes the network abstract normal behavior from a sequence of millions of packets within their context and analyzes them in near real-time to detect point collective and contextual anomalies. Experiments are done on MAWI dataset and it shows better detection rate not only than signature IDS but also better than traditional anomaly IDS. The experiment shows lower false positive higher detection rate and better point anomalies detection. As for prove of contextual and collective anomalies detection we discuss our claim and the reason behind our hypothesis. But the experiment is done on random small subsets of the dataset because of hardware limitations so we share experiment and our future vision thoughts as we wish that full prove will be done in future by other interested researchers who have better hardware infrastructure than ours.;2019
With the maturity and popularity of dialogue systems detecting user's unknown intent in dialogue systems has become an important task. It is also one of the most challenging tasks since we can hardly get examples prior knowledge or the exact numbers of unknown intents. In this paper we propose SofterMax and deep novelty detection (SMDN) a simple yet effective post-processing method for detecting unknown intent in dialogue systems based on pre-trained deep neural network classifiers. Our method can be flexibly applied on top of any classifiers trained in deep neural networks without changing the model architecture. We calibrate the confidence of the softmax outputs to compute the calibrated confidence score (i.e. SofterMax) and use it to calculate the decision boundary for unknown intent detection. Furthermore we feed the feature representations learned by the deep neural networks into traditional novelty detection algorithm to detect unknown intents from different perspectives. Finally we combine the methods above to perform the joint prediction. Our method classifies examples that differ from known intents as unknown and does not require any examples or prior knowledge of it. We have conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark dialogue datasets. The results show that our method can yield significant improvements compared with the state-of-the-art baselines(1).

With the recent increase in the interest of individuals in health lifecare and disease hospital medical services have been shifting from a treatment focus to prevention and health management. The medical industry is creating additional services for health- and life-promotion programs. This change represents a medical-service paradigm shift due to the prolonged life expectancy aging lifestyle changes and income increases and consequently the concept of the smart health service has emerged as a major issue. Due to smart health the existing health-promotion medical services that typically have been operated by large hospitals have been developing into remote medical-treatment services where personal health records are used in small hospitals moreover a further expansion has been occurring in the direction of u-Healthcare in which health conditions are continuously monitored in the everyday lives of the users. However as the amount of data is increasing and the medical-data complexity is intensifying the limitations of the previous approaches are increasingly problematic furthermore since even the same disease can show different symptoms depending on the personal health conditions lifestyle and genome information universal healthcare is not effective for some patients and it can even generate severe side effects. Thus research on the AI-based healthcare that is in the form of mining-based smart health which is a convergence technology of the 4IR is actively being carried out. Particularly the introduction of various smart medical equipment for which healthcare big data and a running machine have been combined and the expansion of the distribution of smartphone wearable devices have led to innovations such as personalized diagnostic and treatment services and chronic-disease management and prevention services. In addition various already launched applications allow users to check their own health conditions and receive the corresponding feedback in real time. Based on these innovations the preparation of a way to determine a user's current health conditions and to respond properly through contextual feedback in the case of unsound health conditions is underway. However since the previously made healthcare-related applications need to be linked to a wearable device and they provide medical feedback to users based solely on specific biometric data inaccurate information can be provided. In addition the user interfaces of some healthcare applications are very complicated causing user inconvenience regarding the attainment of desired information. Therefore we propose a chatbot-based healthcare service with a knowledge base for cloud computing. The proposed method is a mobile health service in the form of a chatbot for the provision of fast treatment in response to accidents that may occur in everyday life and also in response to changes of the conditions of patients with chronic diseases. A chatbot is an intelligent conversation platform that interacts with users via a chatting interface and since its use can be facilitated by linkages with the major social network service messengers general users can easily access and receive various health services. The proposed framework enables a smooth human-robot interaction that supports the efficient implementation of the chatbot healthcare service. The design of the framework comprises the following four levels: data level information level knowledge level and service level.;2019
With the rise of robotics and artificial intelligence good communication between humans and machines becomes more important. However users with language and hearing disadvantages may find synthetic speech systems to be difficult to understand. In this study we explore the types of sentence structure and level of word complexity that affect intelligibility of speech in unfamiliar context. Using semantically unpredictable sentences we found that sentence with more complex syntax such as relative pronouns and question words are harder to comprehend while on the word level it is the shorter and simpler words that contribute to misunderstandings. We found that although word frequency affects how well a word is recognised the effect from the occurring frequency is much less than the effect of how phonetically distinctive the word is. There was also evidence of significant difference between native speakers and non-native speakers on how well they could understand the sentences. These results may help us in designing better dialogue system for machine to human interactions especially in the healthcare arena where often users have disadvantages in language and hearing abilities.

A chatbot equipped with a conversational user interface often allows its users to feel as if they are conversing with a human being. The current study examined whether users' perception of a mind within a chatbot is associated with their feeling of co-presence closeness and intention to use and whether the influence of mind perception is reinforced when the chatbot presents social cues in its language. A laboratory experiment (N = 64) revealed that the more participants perceived a mind behind a chatbot the more co-presence and interpersonal closeness they experienced with the chatbot. The associations with co-presence and closeness became stronger when the chatbot used social cues. Furthermore mind perception had an indirect effect on intention to use via closeness when social cues were presented. These findings imply the importance of mind perception and social cues in a chatbot's language in creating a positive chatbot experience.;2020
A conversation-based system is proposed for supporting assessors in performing existing school building inspections. School building safety is a pressing issue however some difficulties in the overall process require solutions or improvements including the complexity of building inspection tasks the restrictions posed by the paperwork process and the ineffectiveness of the management of existing school building inspections. In this study we developed a conversation-based building inspection support system to reduce such problems with the proposed system notifying and guiding assessors to complete building inspections combined with a dashboard for managers to consume reports to determine whether further assessments or retrofits are required. The process of school building inspections was digitalized with a chatbot implemented that features notifications either according to a routine inspection schedule or postseismic events a conversation-based interface for guiding nonprofessional assessors the integration of intuitive activation of inspections after receiving notifications the use of multimedia to show damage directly without the possibility of mistakes and data visualization for supporting managerial decision-making to enhance the quality and accuracy of budget allocation.;2020
A satisfying experience is critical for the user to feel motivated over time especially in mobile health (m-Health) applications. Long-term user experience (UX) assesses more extended periods of use which may reveal the possible impact of a set of experiences. In this study using an in-app embed questionnaire available through a conversational interface we investigated long-term UX on an m-Health application to identify how it occurs over time. The methods were developed in 4 phases which included problem characterization search for UX aspects elaboration and verification of the questionnaire test period with questionnaire applied before during and after use interview with users and information mapping. For 3 months 37 users reported their experiences with the application describing their impressions regarding usage. Results demonstrated that the most satisfying experiences occurred mainly within the first weeks of the study and were associated with the app's features charts and visual resources and the practicality of treatment monitoring. For the less satisfactory experiences the main reasons identified were technical problems on the application and the effort and difficulty of use. All users appreciated the use of a character in the conversational interface as a gatherer of the answers to the assessment questionnaire.;2020
A synthetic voice personifies the system using it. In this work we examine the impact text content voice quality and synthesis system have on the perceived personality of two synthetic voices. Subjects rated synthetic utterances based on the Big-Five personality traits and naturalness. The naturalness rating of synthesis output did not correlate significantly with any Big-Five characteristic except for a marginal correlation with openness. Although text content is dominant in personality judgments results showed that voice quality change implemented using a unit selection synthesis system significantly affected the perception of the Big-Five for example tense voice being associated with being disagreeable and lax voice with lower conscientiousness. In addition a comparison between a parametric implementation and unit selection implementation of the same voices showed that parametric voices were rated as significantly less neurotic than both the text alone and the unit selection system while the unit selection was rated as more open than both the text alone and the parametric system. The results have implications for synthesis voice and system type selection for applications such as personal assistants and embodied conversational agents where developing an emotional relationship with the user or developing a branding experience is important.;2020
Accurate generative chatbots are usually trained on large datasets of question-answer pairs. Despite such datasets not existing for some languages it does not reduce the need for companies to have chatbot technology in their websites. However companies usually own small domain-specific datasets (at least in the form of an FAQ) about their products services or used technologies. In this research we seek effective solutions to create generative seq2seq-based chatbots from very small data. Since experiments are carried out in English and morphologically complex Lithuanian languages we have an opportunity to compare results for languages with very different characteristics. We experimentally explore three encoder-decoder LSTM-based approaches (simple LSTM stacked LSTM and BiLSTM) three word embedding types (one-hot encoding fastText and BERT embeddings) and five encoder-decoder architectures based on different encoder and decoder vectorization units. Furthermore all offered approaches are applied to the pre-processed datasets with removed and separated punctuation. The experimental investigation revealed the advantages of the stacked LSTM and BiLSTM encoder architectures and BERT embedding vectorization (especially for the encoder). The best achieved BLUE on English/Lithuanian datasets with removed and separated punctuation was similar to 0.513/similar to 0.505 and similar to 0.488/similar to 0.439 respectively. Better results were achieved with the English language because generating different inflection forms for the morphologically complex Lithuanian is a harder task. The BLUE scores fell into the range defining the quality of the generated answers as good or very good for both languages. This research was performed with very small datasets having little variety in covered topics which makes this research not only more difficult but also more interesting. Moreover to our knowledge it is the first attempt to train generative chatbots for a morphologically complex language.;2020
Accurate intent detection-based chatbots are usually trained on larger datasets that are not available for some languages. Seeking the most accurate models three English benchmark datasets that were human-translated into four morphologically complex languages (i.e. Estonian Latvian Lithuanian Russian) were used. Two types of word embeddings (fastText and BERT) three types of deep neural network (DNN) classifiers (convolutional neural network (CNN) long short-term memory method (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)) different DNN architectures (shallower and deeper) and various DNN hyperparameter values were investigated. DNN architecture and hyperparameter values were optimized automatically using the Bayesian method and random search. On three datasets of 2/5/8 intents for English Estonian Latvian Lithuanian and Russian languages accuracies of 0.991/0.890/0.712 0.972/0.890/0.644 1.000/0.890/0.644 0.981/0.872/0.712 and 0.972/0.881/0.661 were achieved respectively. The BERT multilingual vectorization with the CNN classifier was proven to be a good choice for all datasets for all languages. Moreover in the majority of models the same set of optimal hyperparameter values was determined. The results obtained in this research were also compared with the previously reported values (where hyperparameter values of DNN models were selected by an expert). This comparison revealed that automatically optimized models are competitive or even more accurate when created with larger training datasets.;2020
Adoption of intelligent personal assistants (IPA) is on the rise. Published studies on IPAs often focus on the analysis and critique of existing IPA features without understanding specific user needs that the technology aims to address. We present an exploratory study that gathered user recommendations for the design of their ideal IPA. The study relied on focus group and content analysis methods for data collection and analysis. Major themes in participants' recommendations for IPA design were identified and included feature improvements (e.g. speech recognition input/output modalities device feedback) customizability and increased control over IPA features and functions transparency and understanding of IPA hardware software and data management processes personification compatibility with third-party platforms accessibility and aesthetics. Many of these recommendations are rooted in basic user experience design principles and have been previously discussed in the context of PDAs (personal digital assistants) and other technology. Addressing these recommendations would advance IPA technology and improve user experiences with it.;2020
Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have influenced almost every field including computer science robotics social engineering psychology criminology and so on. Although AI has solved various challenges potential security threats of AI algorithms and training data have been stressed by AI researchers. As AI system inherits security threats of traditional computer system the concern about novel cyberattack enhanced by AI is also growing. In addition AI is deeply connected to physical space (e.g. autonomous vehicle intelligent virtual assistant) so AI-related crime can harm people physically beyond the cyberspace. In this context we represent a literature review of security threats and AI-related crime. Based on the literature review this article defines the term AI crime and classifies AI crime into 2 categories: AI as tool crime and AI as target crime inspired by a taxonomy of cybercrime: Computer as tool crime and Computer as tool crime. Through the proposed taxonomy foreseeable AI crimes are systematically studied and related forensic techniques are also addressed. We also analyze the characteristics of the AI crimes and present challenges that are difficult to be solved with the traditional forensic techniques. Finally open issues are presented with emphasis on the need to establish novel strategies for AI forensics.;2020
Along with the development of social media on the internet dialogue systems are becoming more and more intelligent to meet users' needs for communication emotion and social intercourse. Previous studies usually use sequence-to-sequence learning with recurrent neural networks for response generation. However recurrent-based learning models heavily suffer from the problem of long-distance dependencies in sequences. Moreover some models neglect crucial information in the dialogue contexts which leads to uninformative and inflexible responses. To address these issues we present a bichannel transformer with context encoding (BCTCE) for document-driven conversation. This conversational generator consists of a context encoder an utterance encoder and a decoder with attention mechanism. The encoders aim to learn the distributed representation of input texts. The multihop attention mechanism is used in BCTCE to capture the interaction between documents and dialogues. We evaluate the proposed BCTCE by both automatic evaluation and human judgment. The experimental results on the dataset CMU_DoG indicate that the proposed model yields significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines on most of the evaluation metrics and the generated responses of BCTCE are more informative and more relevant to dialogues than baselines.;2020
Although listening to a conversation partner is a key factor in the success of dialogue systems or conversational agents recent neural conversation systems have no interest in generating listening-oriented responses. In this paper we propose an end-to-end dialogue system that generates listening-oriented responses which make users disclose themselves and feel positive emotions. Our model uses 'self disclosure' and 'positiveness' as listening features and generate responses in an appropriate manner to the features. Furthermore the model infers a user response that will be brought out at the end of the dialogue and uses the inferred user response for generating a system response. By utilizing both listening features and user responses our model becomes capable of generating listening-oriented responses. In quantitative and qualitative experiments our model turned out to be capable of generating listening oriented responses that induce users to disclose themselves and talk positively. The results also show that the model utilizing user responses generates more listening-oriented responses than those only using listening features. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2020
An excellent dialogue system needs to not only generate rich and diverse logical responses but also meet the needs of users for emotional communication. However despite much work these two problems have not been solved. In this paper we propose a model based on conditional variational autoencoder and dual emotion framework (CVAE-DE) to generate emotional responses. In our model latent variables of the conditional variational autoencoder are adopted to promote the diversity of conversation. A dual emotion framework is adopted to control the explicit emotion of the response and prevent the conversation from generating emotion drift indicating that the emotion of the response is not related to the input sentence. A multiclass emotion classifier based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model is employed to obtain emotion labels which promotes the accuracy of emotion recognition and emotion expression. A large number of experiments show that our model not only generates rich and diverse responses but also is emotionally coherent and controllable.;2020
An important aspect of developing dialogue agents involves endowing a conversation system with emotion perception and interaction. Most existing emotion dialogue models lack the adaptability and extensibility of different scenes because of their limitation to require a specified emotion category or their reliance on a fixed emotional dictionary. To overcome these limitations we propose a neural conversation generation with auxiliary emotional supervised model (nCG-FSM) comprising a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) generation model and an emotional classifier used as an auxiliary model. The emotional classifier was trained to predict the emotion distributions of the dialogues which were then used as emotion supervised signals to guide the generation model to generate diverse emotional responses. The proposed nCG-ESM is flexible enough to generate responses with emotional diversity including specified or unspecified emotions which can be adapted and extended to different scenarios. We conducted extensive experiments on the popular dataset of Weibo post-response pairs. Experimental results showed that the proposed model was capable of producing more diverse appropriate and emotionally rich responses yielding substantial gains in diversity scores and human evaluations.;2020
Argumentation is a process of reaching a consensus through premises and rebuttals. If an artificial dialogue system can perform argumentation it can improve users' decisions and ability to negotiate with the others. Previously researchers have studied argumentative dialogue systems through a structured database regarding argumentation structure and evaluated the logical consistency of the dialogue. However these systems could not change its response based on the user's agreement or disagreement to its last utterance. Furthermore the persuasiveness of the generated dialogue has not been evaluated. In this study a method is proposed to generate persuasive arguments through a hierarchical argumentation structure that considers human agreement and disagreement. Persuasiveness is evaluated through a crowd sourcing platform wherein participants' written impressions of shown dialogue texts are scored via a third person Likert scale evaluation. The proposed method was compared to the baseline method wherein argument response texts were generated without consideration of the user's agreement or disagreement. Experiment results suggest that the proposed method can generate a more persuasive dialogue than the baseline method. Further analysis implied that perceived persuasiveness was induced by evaluations of the behavior of the dialogue system which was inherent in the hierarchical argumentation structure.;2020
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its real-life applications are among the most effervescent research topics of the last couple of years. In the past decade stakeholders such as private companies public institutions non-profit entities and even individuals have developed and used various AI algorithms to solve a wide range of problems. Given the extended applicability and the disruption potential of this technology it was just a matter of time until it connected to the field of cultural heritage. This paper presents the development of an intelligent conversational agent which was built to improve the accessibility to information inside a history museum. We present the cultural context the application architecture the implementation challenges and the visitors' feedback. We created a smart virtual agent that interacts with users in natural spoken language. This involved the design and implementation of the artificial intelligence-based core responsible for understanding the Romanian language. A short survey regarding the tourist acceptance of the system was conducted at the premises of our partners the Museum Casa Muresenilor from Brasov shows good acceptance levels from both visitors and museum staff. Given the flexibility of the implementation the system can be used by a large array of stakeholders with minor modifications.;2020
Artificial Intelligence (AI) personal assistant has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. Almost all existing AI personal assistants serve as service terminals to chat with human users for certain tasks. We are instead interested in building AI personal assistants for a different yet important dialog scenario where they chat with people to fulfill specific tasks on behalf of their human users. As the personal assistants are playing a requester role instead of a service terminal role the conversation goal becomes delivering or requesting information according to specific user requests precisely and efficiently. The challenge for the conversation policy is that all user requests must be delivered precisely while the challenge for the response generation is that it's generally expected for machine generated responses to cover multiple information slots either requesting or delivering to make the conversation efficient. In this paper we present Table-to-Dialogue a novel approach to address the above challenges when building a requester role AI personal assistant. We employ an encoder-decoder network to learn explicit conversation policy which generates the corresponding information slots based on the conversation context and the user request table. We further integrate a novel Multi-Slot Constrained Bi-directional Decoder (MS-CBD) into the above encoder-decoder network to generate machine response according to the multiple slot values and their intermediate representations from the policy decoder. Different from the existing single direction text decoder approaches MS-CBD leverage the bi-directional context of the response when generating it to enhance the semantic coherence. The experiments shows that our approach significantly outperform the state-of-the-art conversation approaches on automatic and human evaluation metrics.;2020
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) may save money and improve the efficiency of business processes but these technologies can also destroy business value sometimes with grave consequences. The inability to identify and manage that risk can lead some managers to delay the adoption of these technologies and thus prevent them from realizing their potential. This article proposes a new framework by which to map the components of an AI solution and to identify and manage the value-destruction potential of AI and ML for businesses. We show how the defining characteristics of AI and ML can threaten the integrity of the AI system's inputs processes and outcomes. We then draw from the concepts of value-creation content and value-creation process to show how these risks may hinder value creation or even result in value destruction. Finally we illustrate the application of our framework with an example of the deployment of an AI powered chatbot in customer service and we discuss how to remedy the problems that arise.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and people's interactions with it-through virtual agents socialbots and language-generation software-do not fit neatly into paradigms of communication theory that have long focused on human-human communication. To address this disconnect between communication theory and emerging technology this article provides a starting point for articulating the differences between communicative AI and previous technologies and introduces a theoretical basis for navigating these conditions in the form of scholarship within human-machine communication (HMC). Drawing on an HMC framework we outline a research agenda built around three key aspects of communicative AI technologies: (1) the functional dimensions through which people make sense of these devices and applications as communicators (2) the relational dynamics through which people associate with these technologies and in turn relate to themselves and others and (3) the metaphysical implications called up by blurring ontological boundaries surrounding what constitutes human machine and communication.;2020
Artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing about enormous changes in everyday life and today's society. Interest in AI is continuously increasing as many countries are creating new AI-related degrees short-term intensive courses and secondary school programs. This study was conducted with the aim of identifying the interrelationships among topics based on the understanding of various bodies of knowledge and to provide a foundation for topic compositions to construct an academic body of knowledge of AI. To this end machine learning-based sentence similarity measurement models used in machine translation chatbots and document summarization were applied to the body of knowledge of AI. Consequently several similar topics related to agent designing in AI such as algorithm complexity discrete structures fundamentals of software development and parallel and distributed computing were identified. The results of this study provide the knowledge necessary to cultivate talent by identifying relationships with other fields in the edutech field.;2020
Artificial intelligence applications in cognitive computing systems can be found in organizations across every market including chatbots that help customers navigate websites predictive analytics systems used for fraud detection and augmented decision-support systems for knowledge workers. In this article we share reflections and insights from our experience with AI projects in the public sector that can add value to any organization. We organized our findings into four thematic domains-(1) data (2) technology (3) organizational and (4) environmental-and examine them relative to the phases of AI. We conclude with best practices for capturing value with cognitive computing systems. (C) 2019 Kelley School of Business Indiana University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2020
Artificial intelligence virtual health assistants are a promising emerging technology. This study is a process evaluation of a 12-week pilot physical activity and diet program delivered by virtual assistant Paola. This single-arm repeated measures study (n = 28 aged 45-75 years) was evaluated on technical performance (accuracy of conversational exchanges) engagement (number of weekly check-ins completed) adherence (percentage of step goal and recommended food servings) and user feedback. Paola correctly asked scripted questions and responded to participants during the check-ins 97% and 96% of the time respectively but correctly responded to spontaneous exchanges only 21% of the time. Participants completed 63% of weekly check-ins and conducted a total of 3648 exchanges. Mean dietary adherence was 91% and was lowest for discretionary foods grains red meat and vegetables. Participants met their step goal 59% of the time. Participants enjoyed the program and found Paola useful during check-ins but not for spontaneous exchanges. More in-depth knowledge personalized advice and spontaneity were identified as important improvements. Virtual health assistants should ensure an adequate knowledge base and ability to recognize intents and entities include personality and spontaneity and provide ongoing technical troubleshooting of the virtual assistant to ensure the assistant remains effective.;2020
As a crucial task in conversation systems response generation for multi-turn conversation aims to generate a coherent informative and diverse response according to the conversation context. Existing models of this task are limited in their ability to capture long-term dependencies within and between utterances and to identify pertinent or important information in the context. Inspired by the Transformer neural network based solely on attention mechanisms recently proposed in machine translation we propose a novel hierarchical structured multi-head attention network (HMAN) model to address both problems. Specifically the context sequences are encoded in a hierarchical structure in which multi-head self-attention is first employed to compute the representation matrix of each utterance and then these utterance matrices are integrated to form a context representation with the complicated dependencies learned using multi-head attention. The experimental results on two public conversation datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines with respect to both automatic evaluation and human evaluation and can generate more diverse and informative responses.;2020
As agents social robots are expected to increase opportunities for dialogue with the elderly. However it is difficult to sustain a dialogue with an elderly user because speech recognition frequently fails during the dialogue. Here to overcome this problem regardless of speech recognition failure we developed a question-answer-response dialogue model. In this model a robot took initiative in the dialogue by asking the user various questions. Moreover to improve user experience during dialogue we extended the model such that two robots could participate in the dialogue. Implementing these features we conducted a field trial in a nursing home to evaluate the twin-robot dialogue system. The average word error rate of speech recognition was 0.778. Despite the frequently high number of errors participants talked for 14 min in a dialogue with two robots and felt slightly strange during the dialogue. Although we found no significant difference between a dialogue with one robot and that with two robots the effect size of the difference in the dialogue time with one robot and that with two robots was medium (Cohen's d = -0.519). The results suggested that the presence of two robots might likely encourage elderly people to sustain the talk. Our results will contribute to the design of social robots to engage in dialogues with the elderly.;2020
As life expectancy increases it has become more necessary to find ways to support healthy ageing. A number of active ageing initiatives are being developed nowadays to foster healthy habits in the population. This paper presents our contribution to these initiatives in the form of a multimodal conversational coach that acts as a coach for physical activities. The agent can be developed as an Android app running on smartphones and coupled with cheap widely available sport sensors in order to provide meaningful coaching. It can be employed to prepare exercise sessions provide feedback during the sessions and discuss the results after the exercise. It incorporates an affective component that informs dynamic user models to produce adaptive interaction strategies.;2020
As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rages on the mental health of both the infected and non-infected is a rising concern. We used administrative survey data (16402 responses in the last two weeks) using a chatbot on LINE the most popular social networking service (SNS) in Japan to show that people with COVID-19 patients in a close setting had higher psychological distress level than those without. We believe that the results indicate an urgent need to prioritize the establishment and implementation of mental health and psychosocial support tailored to family close relatives and friends of COVID-19 patients.;2020
As the inclusion of users in the design process receives greater attention designers need to not only understand users but also further cooperate with them. Therefore engineering design education should also follow this trend in order to enhance students' ability to communicate and cooperate with users in the design practice. However it is difficult to find users on teaching sites to cooperate with students because of time and budgetary constraints. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in recent years chatbots may be the solution to finding specific users to participate in teaching. This study used Dialogflow and Google Assistant to build a system architecture and applied methods of persona and semi-structured interviews to develop AI virtual product users. The system has a compound dialog mode (combining intent- and flow-based dialog modes) with which multiple chatbots can cooperate with students in the form of oral dialog. After four college students interacted with AI userbots it was proven that this system can effectively participate in student design activities in the early stage of design. In the future more AI userbots could be developed based on this system according to different engineering design projects for engineering design teaching.;2020
Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems which use sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to convert spoken language to text have become increasingly widespread powering popular virtual assistants facilitating automated closed captioning and enabling digital dictation platforms for health care. Over the last several years the quality of these systems has dramatically improved due both to advances in deep learning and to the collection of large-scale datasets used to train the systems. There is concern however that these tools do not work equally well for all subgroups of the population. Here we examine the ability of five state-of-the-art ASR systems-developed by Amazon Apple Google IBM and Microsoft-to transcribe structured interviews conducted with 42 white speakers and 73 black speakers. In total this corpus spans five US cities and consists of 19.8 h of audio matched on the age and gender of the speaker. We found that all five ASR systems exhibited substantial racial disparities with an average word error rate (WER) of 0.35 for black speakers compared with 0.19 for white speakers. We trace these disparities to the underlying acoustic models used by the ASR systems as the race gap was equally large on a subset of identical phrases spoken by black and white individuals in our corpus. We conclude by proposing strategies-such as using more diverse training datasets that include African American Vernacular English-to reduce these performance differences and ensure speech recognition technology is inclusive.;2020
Automatically generating meaningful and coherent text has many applications such as machine translation dialogue systems BOT application etc. Text generation technology has attracted more attention over the past decades. A bunch of excellent methods are proposed however there are still challenges to generate text rivals the real one by human such as most machines output fixed length text or can only generate text quite the same with the input training text. In this paper we put forward a novel text generation system called customizable conditional text generative adversarial network which is capable of generating diverse text content of variable length with customizable emotion label. It is more convenient for generating actual original text with specific sensitive orientation. We propose a conditional text generative adversarial network (CTGAN) in which emotion label is adopted as an input channel to specify the output text and variable length text generation strategy is put forward. After generating initial texts by CTGAN to make the generated text data match the real scene we design an automated word-level replacement strategy which extracts the keywords (e.g. nouns) from the training texts and replaces the specific keywords in the generated texts. Finally we design a comprehensive evaluation metric based on various text evaluations called mixed evaluation metric. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets testify that our proposed CTGAN behaves better than other text generation methods i.e. generated text are more real compared with the real text than other generation methods achieving state-of-the-art generation performance.

Autonomous vehicles not only provide a new impetus in the development of car models in the automotive industry-even in agriculture there has recently been talk of autonomous field robots (AFR). Great expectations are placed on these digital assistants from a wide variety of perspectives. However it is still unclear whether they will make the transition from market niches to broad-based distribution. Apart from various factors this depends on user acceptance of this new technology expected by the innovators since this is likely to be essential for the further development of AFR. For this purpose the ex ante user acceptance of farmers from the perspective of various AgTech startups with AFR involvement in Europe was investigated in this exploratory and qualitative study. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) served as the basis for the developed interview guideline. In summary the results confirm that a variety of factors potentially influence farmer acceptance and AFR diffusion from the perspective of AgTech startups with perceived usefulness being considered the main motivation for using AFR. The interviewed experts believe that AFR will initially be used in crops that have relatively high costs for crop protection treatments before becoming economically attractive for other crops. The basic prerequisite for a successful market launch is an adjustment of the legal framework which sets standards in relation to AFR and thus provides security in the production process. The results could support political decision-makers in dealing with this new technology and AFR manufacturers in the promotion of AFR.;2020
Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be transforming mental health. AI-based technologies and technique are now considered to have uses in almost every domain of mental health care: including decision-making assessment and healthcare management. What remains underexplored is whether/how mental health recovery is situated within these discussions and practices. Method Taking conversational agents as our point of departure we explore the ways official online materials explain and make sense of chatbots their imagined functionality and value for (potential) users. We focus on three chatbots for mental health: Woebot Wysa and Tess. Findings Recovery is largely missing as an overt focus across materials. However analysis does reveal themes that speak to the struggles over practice expertise and evidence that the concept of recovery articulates. We discuss these under the headings troubled clinical responsibility extended virtue of (technological) self-care and altered ontologies and psychopathologies of time. Conclusions Ultimately we argue that alongside more traditional forms of recovery chatbots may be shaped by and shaping an increasingly individualised form of a personal recovery imperative.;2020
Background For patients with cancer being well informed by their oncologist about treatment options and the implications thereof is highly relevant. Communication skills training (CST) programs have shown to be effective in improving clinicians' communication skills yet CSTs are time-consuming inconvenient to schedule and costly. Online education enables new ways of accessible learning in a safe and personalised environment. Aim and methods We describe the design of a digital CST-tool for information provision skills that meets oncologists' learning needs. We used the CeHRes Roadmap for user-centred design as a guiding framework. Phase 1 (Contextual Inquiry) involved consultation of the literature and a focus group interview study to uncover the learning needs and training preferences of clinicians' regarding a digital training for the skill of information-provision. In phase 2 (Value Specification) two multidisciplinary expert panels specified the learning content and format of a digital training. Phase 3 (Design) encompassed an iterative development process including two user group assessment sessions and 5 individual user sessions in which prototypes were tested. All sessions were recorded and independently analyzed by two researchers. Results Based on literature and consultation of the users in the inquiry phase of the development process and on expert opinion in the value specification phase relevant (sub) skills and user requirements were defined to consider for the digital training format. It was decided to develop a conventional e-learning and a chatbot. Personalization and interactivity were integrated in the prototypes by including features that allow for e.g. choosing text video or animation to upload video-recorded consultations to receive peer-feedback and to consult a communication expert. Results revealed that overall participants expressed a willingness to use a digital training tool to acquire information-provision skills. Individual user testing (including junior clinicians) indicated a preference for the chatbot over the e-learning. Conclusion We offer a description of extensive development work which was conducted in collaboration with multiple health care professionals to iteratively develop two innovative prototypes of digital tools that would appropriately engage oncologists in learning effective information giving skills. The resulting prototypes were well appreciated and thus provide a solid basis for further development and testing.;2020
Background In Nigeria anecdotes abound that female clients particularly within northern Nigeria have gender-based preferences for frontline health workers (FLHWs) who provide healthcare services. This may adversely affect uptake of maternal newborn and child health services especially at primary healthcare level in Nigeria where a huge proportion of the Nigerian population and rural community members in particular access healthcare services. This study explored female clients' gender preferences for frontline health workers who provide maternal newborn and child healthcare (MNCH) services at primary healthcare level in Nigeria. Methods The study adopted a cross-sectional quantitative design with 256 female clients' exit interviews from selected primary health facilities within two States - Bauchi (northern Nigeria) and Cross-River (southern Nigeria). Data was collected using Personal Digital Assistants and data analysis was done using SPSS software. Descriptive analysis was carried out using percentage frequency distribution tables. Bivariate analysis was also carried out to examine possible relationships between key characteristic variables and the gender preferences of female clients involved in the study. Results Out of 256 women who accessed maternal newborn and child health services within the sampled health facilities 44.1% stated preference for female FLHWs 2.3% preferred male FLHWs while 53.5% were indifferent about the gender of the health worker. However only 26.6% of female clients were attended to by male FLHWs. Bivariate analysis suggests a relationship between a female client's health worker gender preference and her pregnancy status the specific reason for which a female client visits a primary healthcare facility a female client's location in Nigeria as well as the gender of the health worker(s) working within the primary healthcare facility which she visits to access maternal newborn and child health services. Conclusions The study findings suggest that female clients at primary healthcare level in Nigeria possibly have gender preferences for the frontline health workers who provide services to them. There should be sustained advocacy and increased efforts at community engagement to promote the acceptability of healthcare services from male frontline health workers in order to have a significant impact on the uptake of MNCH services particularly within northern Nigeria.;2020
Background Mobile phones and personal digital assistants have been used for data collection in developing world settings for over three decades and have become increasingly common. However the use of electronic data capture (EDC) through mobile phones is limited in many areas by inconsistent network connectivity and poor access to electricity which thwart data transmission and device usage. This is the case in rural Liberia where many health workers live and work in areas without any access to cellular connectivity or reliable power. Many existing EDC mobile software tools are built for occasionally-disconnected settings allowing a user to collect data while out of range of a cell tower and transmit data to a central server when he/she regains a network connection. However few tools exist that can be used indefinitely in fully-disconnected settings where a user will never have access to the internet or a cell network. This led us to create and implement an EDC software tool that allows for completely offline data transfer and application updating. Results We designed pilot-tested and scaled an open-source fork of Open Data Kit Collect (an Android application that can be used to create EDC systems) that allows for offline Bluetooth-based bidirectional data transfer enabling a system in which permanently-offline users can collect data and receive application updates. We implemented this platform among a cohort of 317 community health workers and 28 supervisors in a remote area of rural Liberia with incomplete cellular connectivity and low access to power sources. Conclusions Running a fully-offline EDC program that completely bypasses the cellular network was found to be feasible the system is still running over 4 years after the initial pilot program. The users of this program can theoretically collect data offline for months or years assuming they receive hardware support when needed. Fully-offline EDC has applications in settings where cellular network coverage is poor as well as in disaster relief settings in which portions of the communications infrastructure may be temporarily nonfunctional.;2020
Background Preconception care focuses on improving women's health before pregnancy as a means to improve their health and future pregnancy outcomes. How to effectively deliver such care is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the impact of an embodied conversational agent system on preconception risks among African American and Black women. Methods We did an open-label randomised controlled trial of women aged 18-34 years self-identified as African American or Black or both and not pregnant recruited from 35 states in the USA. Sealed allocation envelopes (in permuted blocks of six and eight prepared using a random number generator) were opened after enrolment. Intervention participants received an online conversational agent called Gabby that assessed 102 preconception risks and delivered 12 months of tailored dialogue using synthesised speech non-verbal behaviour visual aids and health behaviour change techniques such as motivational interviewing. The control group received a letter listing their preconception risks and encouraging them to talk with a clinician. The primary outcome was the proportion of identified risks at the action or maintenance stage of change at months 6 and 12. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01827215. Findings From March 11 2014 through July 8 2018 528 women recruited from 35 states and 242 cities across the USA received the Gabby intervention (n=262) or were assigned to the control group (n=266). Participants identified a mean of 21 preconception risks per woman (SD 9.9). In the intention-to-treat analysis at 6 months intervention women reported reaching the action or maintenance stage of change for 50.0% (SD 28.9) of those preconception risks identified compared with 42.7% (28.3) in the control group (incidence rate ratio 1.16 95% CI 1.07-1.26 p=0.0004). This result persisted at 12 months. Interpretation The Gabby system has the potential to improve women's preconception health. Further research is needed to determine if improving preconception risks impacts outcomes such as preterm delivery. Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.;2020
Background The Assistant to Lift your Level of activitY (Ally) app is a smartphone application that combines financial incentives with chatbot-guided interventions to encourage users to reach personalized daily step goals. Purpose To evaluate the effects of incentives weekly planning and daily self-monitoring prompts that were used as intervention components as part of the Ally app. Methods We conducted an 8 week optimization trial with n = 274 insurees of a health insurance company in Switzerland. At baseline participants were randomized to different incentive conditions (cash incentives vs. charity incentives vs. no incentives). Over the course of the study participants were randomized weekly to different planning conditions (action planning vs. coping planning vs. no planning) and daily to receiving or not receiving a self-monitoring prompt. Primary outcome was the achievement of personalized daily step goals. Results Study participants were more active and healthier than the general Swiss population. Daily cash incentives increased step-goal achievement by 8.1% 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.1 14.1] and only in the no-incentive control group action planning increased step-goal achievement by 5.8% 95% CI: [1.2 10.4]. Charity incentives self-monitoring prompts and coping planning did not affect physical activity. Engagement with planning interventions and self-monitoring prompts was low and 30% of participants stopped using the app over the course of the study. Conclusions Daily cash incentives increased physical activity in the short term. Planning interventions and self-monitoring prompts require revision before they can be included in future versions of the app. Selection effects and engagement can be important challenges for physical-activity apps.;2020
Background: A large number of web-based COVID-19 symptom checkers and chatbots have been developed however anecdotal evidence suggests that their conclusions are highly variable. To our knowledge no study has evaluated the accuracy of COVID-19 symptom checkers in a statistically rigorous manner. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracies of web-based COVID-19 symptom checkers. Methods: We identified 10 web-based COVID-19 symptom checkers all of which were included in the study. We evaluated the COVID-19 symptom checkers by assessing 50 COVID-19 case reports alongside 410 non-COVID-19 control cases. A bootstrapping method was used to counter the unbalanced sample sizes and obtain confidence intervals (CIs). Results are reported as sensitivity specificity F1 score and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Results: The classification task between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative for high risk cases among the 460 test cases yielded (sorted by F1 score): Symptoma (F1=0.92 MCC=0.85) Infermedica (F1=0.80 MCC=0.61) US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (F1=0.71 MCC=0.30) Babylon (F1=0.70 MCC=0.29) Cleveland Clinic (F1=0.40 MCC=0.07) Providence (F1=0.40 MCC=0.05) Apple (F1=0.29 MCC=-0.10) Docyet (F1=0.27 MCC=0.29) Ada (F1=0.24 MCC=0.27) and Your.MD (F1=0.24 MCC=0.27). For high risk and medium risk combined the performance was: Symptoma (F1=0.91 MCC=0.83) Infermedica (F1=0.80 MCC=0.61) Cleveland Clinic (F1=0.76 MCC=0.47) Providence (F1=0.75 MCC=0.45) Your.MD (F1=0.72 MCC=0.33) CDC (F1=0.71 MCC=0.30) Babylon (F1=0.70 MCC=0.29) Apple (F1=0.70 MCC=0.25) Ada (F1=0.42 MCC=0.03) and Docyet (F1=0.27 MCC=0.29). Conclusions: We found that the number of correctly assessed COVID-19 and control cases varies considerably between symptom checkers with different symptom checkers showing different strengths with respect to sensitivity and specificity. A good balance between sensitivity and specificity was only achieved by two symptom checkers.;2020
Background: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a pragmatic approach to help individuals decrease avoidable pain. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effects of ACT delivered via an automated mobile messaging robot on postoperative opioid use and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with orthopedic trauma who underwent operative intervention for their injuries. Methods: Adult patients presenting to a level 1 trauma center who underwent operative fixation of a traumatic upper or lower extremity fracture and who used mobile phone text messaging were eligible for the study. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group who received twice-daily mobile phone messages communicating an ACT-based intervention for the first 2 weeks after surgery or the control group who received no messages. Baseline PROs were completed. Two weeks after the operative intervention follow-up was performed in the form of an opioid medication pill count and postoperative administration of PROs. The mean number of opioid tablets used by patients was calculated and compared between groups. The mean PRO scores were also compared between the groups. Results: A total of 82 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of the 82 participants 76 (38 ACT and 38 controls) completed the study. No differences between groups in demographic factors were identified. The intervention group used an average of 26.1 (SD 21.4) opioid tablets whereas the control group used 41.1 (SD 22.0) tablets resulting in 36.5% ([41.1-26.1]/41.1) less tablets used by subjects receiving the mobile phone based ACT intervention (P=.004). The intervention group subjects reported a lower postoperative Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Information System Pain Intensity score (mean 45.9 SD 7.2) than control group subjects (mean 49.7 SD 8.8 P=.04). Conclusions: In this study the delivery of an ACT-based intervention via an automated mobile messaging robot in the acute postoperative period decreased opioid use in selected patients with orthopedic trauma. Participants receiving the ACT-based intervention also reported lower pain intensity after 2 weeks although this may not represent a clinically important difference.;2020
Background: Almost half (46%) of Americans have used a smart assistant of some kind (eg Apple Siri) and 25% have used a stand-alone smart assistant (eg Amazon Echo). This positions smart assistants as potentially useful modalities for retrieving health-related information however the accuracy of smart assistant responses lacks rigorous evaluation. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the levels of accuracy misinformation and sentiment in smart assistant responses to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination-related questions. Methods: We systematically examined responses to questions about the HPV vaccine from the following four most popular smart assistants: Apple Siri Google Assistant Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana. One team member posed 10 questions to each smart assistant and recorded all queries and responses. Two raters independently coded all responses (k=0.85). We then assessed differences among the smart assistants in terms of response accuracy presence of misinformation and sentiment regarding the HPV vaccine. Results: A total of 103 responses were obtained from the 10 questions posed across the smart assistants. Google Assistant data were excluded owing to nonresponse. Over half (n=63 61%) of the responses of the remaining three smart assistants were accurate. We found statistically significant differences across the smart assistants (N=103 chi(2)(2) =7.807 P=.02) with Cortana yielding the greatest proportion of misinformation. Siri yielded the greatest proportion of accurate responses (n=26 72%) whereas Cortana yielded the lowest proportion of accurate responses (n=33 54%). Most response sentiments across smart assistants were positive (n=65 64%) or neutral (n=18 18%) but Cortana's responses yielded the largest proportion of negative sentiment (n=7 12%). Conclusions: Smart assistants appear to be average-quality sources for HPV vaccination information with Alexa responding most reliably. Cortana returned the largest proportion of inaccurate responses the most misinformation and the greatest proportion of results with negative sentiments. More collaboration between technology companies and public health entities is necessary to improve the retrieval of accurate health information via smart assistants.;2020
Background: Assistive technologies have become more important owing to the aging population especially when they foster healthy behaviors. Because of their natural interface virtual agents are promising assistants for people in need of support. To engage people during an interaction with these technologies such assistants need to match the users' needs and preferences especially with regard to social outcomes. Objective: Prior research has already determined the importance of an agent's appearance in a human-agent interaction. As seniors can particularly benefit from the use of virtual agents to maintain their autonomy it is important to investigate their special needs. However there are almost no studies focusing on age-related differences with regard to appearance effects. Methods: A 2x4 between-subjects design was used to investigate the age-related differences of appearance effects in a human-agent interaction. In this study 46 seniors and 84 students interacted in a health scenario with a virtual agent whose appearance varied (cartoon-stylized humanoid agent cartoon-stylized machine-like agent more realistic humanoid agent and nonembodied agent [voice only]). After the interaction participants reported on the evaluation of the agent usage intention perceived presence of the agent bonding toward the agent and overall evaluation of the interaction. Results: The findings suggested that seniors evaluated the agent more positively (liked the agent more and evaluated it as more realistic attractive and sociable) and showed more bonding toward the agent regardless of the appearance than did students. In addition interaction effects were found. Seniors reported the highest usage intention for the cartoon-stylized humanoid agent whereas students reported the lowest usage intention for this agent. The same pattern was found for participant bonding with the agent. Seniors showed more bonding when interacting with the cartoon-stylized humanoid agent or voice only agent whereas students showed the least bonding when interacting with the cartoon-stylized humanoid agent. Conclusions: In health-related interactions target group-related differences exist with regard to a virtual assistant's appearance. When elderly individuals are the target group a humanoid virtual assistant might trigger specific social responses and be evaluated more positively at least in short-term interactions.;2020
Background: At any given time most smokers in a population are ambivalent with no motivation to quit. Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based technique that aims to elicit change in ambivalent smokers. MI practitioners are scarce and expensive and smokers are difficult to reach. Smokers are potentially reachable through the web and if an automated chatbot could emulate an MI conversation it could form the basis of a low-cost and scalable intervention motivating smokers to quit. Objective: The primary goal of this study is to design train and test an automated MI-based chatbot capable of eliciting reflection in a conversation with cigarette smokers. This study describes the process of collecting training data to improve the chatbot's ability to generate MI-oriented responses particularly reflections and summary statements. The secondary goal of this study is to observe the effects on participants through voluntary feedback given after completing a conversation with the chatbot. Methods: An interdisciplinary collaboration between an MI expert and experts in computer engineering and natural language processing (NLP) co-designed the conversation and algorithms underlying the chatbot. A sample of 121 adult cigarette smokers in 11 successive groups were recruited from a web-based platform for a single-arm prospective iterative design study. The chatbot was designed to stimulate reflections on the pros and cons of smoking using MI's running head start technique. Participants were also asked to confirm the chatbot's classification of their free-form responses to measure the classification accuracy of the underlying NLP models. Each group provided responses that were used to train the chatbot for the next group. Results: A total of 6568 responses from 121 participants in 11 successive groups over 14 weeks were received. From these responses we were able to isolate 21 unique reasons for and against smoking and the relative frequency of each. The gradual collection of responses as inputs and smoking reasons as labels over the 11 iterations improved the Fl score of the classification within the chatbot from 0.63 in the first group to 0.82 in the final group. The mean time spent by each participant interacting with the chatbot was 21.3 (SD 14.0) min (minimum 6 4 and maximum 89.2). We also found that 34.7% (42/121) of participants enjoyed the interaction with the chatbot and 8.3% (10/121) of participants noted explicit smoking cessation benefits from the conversation in voluntary feedback that did not solicit this explicitly. Conclusions: Recruiting ambivalent smokers through the web is a viable method to train a chatbot to increase accuracy in reflection and summary statements the building blocks of MI. A new set of 21 smoking reasons (both for and against) has been identified. Initial feedback from smokers on the experience shows promise toward using it in an intervention.;2020
Background: Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. Objective: The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research and discuss ethical principles and considerations. Methods: We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. Results: Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background (2) building relational capacity (3) building persuasive conversational capacity and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper. Conclusions: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles.;2020
Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for panic disorder but many fewer patients receive this treatment compared to medication-based therapy. Mobile app-based interactive CBT using a chatbot can increase patient access to CBT. We performed a preliminary study to determine whether short-term use of a newly developed chatbot is feasible and effective for relieving panic symptoms. Method: Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to either a chatbot group (n = 21) or control group (n = 20) for a period of 4 weeks. The chatbot group was guided in the use of the chatbot application while the control group was provided with a book on panic disorder. Main results: The severity of panic disorder was significantly decreased in the chatbot group but not in the control group. The social phobia score was significantly decreased and the control helplessness score was significantly increased in the chatbot group compared to the control group. Discussion and conclusion: We found that mobile app-based interactive CBT using the chatbot was feasible and effective for reducing the severity of panic symptoms. Using this novel approach to provide CBT would allow clinicians to effect positive therapeutic outcomes with easy accessibility interactivity and self-management for patients with panic symptoms.;2020
Background: Conversational agents (CAs) are systems that mimic human conversations using text or spoken language. Their widely used examples include voice-activated systems such as Apple Siri Google Assistant Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana. The use of CAs in health care has been on the rise but concerns about their potential safety risks often remain understudied. Objective: This study aimed to analyze how commonly available general-purpose CAs on smartphones and smart speakers respond to health and lifestyle prompts (questions and open-ended statements) by examining their responses in terms of content and structure alike. Methods: We followed a piloted script to present health- and lifestyle-related prompts to 8 CAs. The CAs' responses were assessed for their appropriateness on the basis of the prompt type: responses to safety-critical prompts were deemed appropriate if they included a referral to a health professional or service whereas responses to lifestyle prompts were deemed appropriate if they provided relevant information to address the problem prompted. The response structure was also examined according to information sources (Web search-based or precoded) response content style (informative and/or directive) confirmation of prompt recognition and empathy. Results: The 8 studied CAs provided in total 240 responses to 30 prompts. They collectively responded appropriately to 41% (46/112) of the safety-critical and 39% (37/96) of the lifestyle prompts. The ratio of appropriate responses deteriorated when safety-critical prompts were rephrased or when the agent used a voice-only interface. The appropriate responses included mostly directive content and empathy statements for the safety-critical prompts and a mix of informative and directive content for the lifestyle prompts. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the commonly available general-purpose CAs on smartphones and smart speakers with unconstrained natural language interfaces are limited in their ability to advise on both the safety-critical health prompts and lifestyle prompts. Our study also identified some response structures the CAs employed to present their appropriate responses. Further investigation is needed to establish guidelines for designing suitable response structures for different prompt types.;2020
Background: Delivering self-management support to people with type 2 diabetes mellitus is essential to reduce the health system burden and to empower people with the skills knowledge and confidence needed to take an active role in managing their own health. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the adoption use and effectiveness of the My Diabetes Coach (MDC) program an app-based interactive embodied conversational agent Laura designed to support diabetes self-management in the home setting over 12 months. Methods: This randomized controlled trial evaluated both the implementation and effectiveness of the MDC program. Adults with type 2 diabetes in Australia were recruited and randomized to the intervention arm (MDC) or the control arm (usual care). Program use was tracked over 12 months. Coprimary outcomes included changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Data were assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months and analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression models. Results: A total of 187 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean 57 years SD 10 years 41.7% women) were recruited and randomly allocated to the intervention (n=93) and control (n=94) arms. MDC program users (92/93 participants) completed 1942 chats with Laura averaging 243 min (SD 212) per person over 12 months. Compared with baseline the mean estimated HbA1c decreased in both arms at 12 months (intervention: 0.33% and control: 0.20%) but the net differences between the two arms in change of HbA(1c) (-0.04% 95% CI -0.45 to 0.36 P=.83) was not statistically significant. At 12 months HRQoL utility scores improved in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (between-arm difference: 0.04 95% CI 0.00 to 0.07 P=.04). Conclusions: The MDC program was successfully adopted and used by individuals with type 2 diabetes and significantly improved the users' HRQoL. These findings suggest the potential for wider implementation of technology-enabled conversation-based programs for supporting diabetes self-management. Future studies should focus on strategies to maintain program usage and HbA(1c) improvement.;2020
Background: Due to time limitations the preanesthetic consultation (PAC) is not the best time for patients to integrate information specific to their perioperative care pathway. Objective: The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital companion on patients' knowledge of anesthesia and their satisfaction after real-life implementation. Methods: We conducted a prospective monocentric comparative study using a before-and-after design. In phase 1 a 9-item self-reported anesthesia knowledge test (Delphi method) was administered to patients before and after their PAC (control group: PAC group). In phase 2 the study was repeated immediately after the implementation of a digital conversational agent MyAnesth (@+PAC group). Patients' satisfaction and their representations for anesthesia were also assessed using a Likert scale and the Abric method of hierarchized evocation. Results: A total of 600 tests were distributed 205 patients and 98 patients were included in the PAC group and @+PAC group respectively. Demographic characteristics and mean scores on the 9-point preinformation test (PAC group: 4.2 points 95% CI 3.9-4.4 @+PAC: 4.3 points 95% CI 4-4.7 P=.37) were similar in the two groups. The mean score after receiving information was better in the @+PAC group than in the PAC group (6.1 points 95% CI 5.8-6.4 points versus 5.2 points 95% CI 5.0-5.4 points respectively P<.001) with an added value of 0.7 points (95% CI 0.3-1.1 P<.001). Among the respondents in the @+PAC group 82% found the information to be clear and appropriate and 74% found it easily accessible. Before receiving information the central core of patients' representations for anesthesia was focused on the fear of being put to sleep and thereafter on caregiver skills and comfort. Conclusions: The implementation of our digital conversational agent in addition to the PAC improved patients' knowledge about their perioperative care pathway. This innovative audiovisual support seemed clear adapted easily accessible and reassuring. Future studies should focus on adapting both the content and delivery of a digital conversational agent for the PAC in order to maximize its benefit to patients.;2020
Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly used in health care apps however their acceptability in type 2 diabetes (T2D) self-management apps has not yet been investigated. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of the ECA (Laura) used to deliver diabetes self-management education and support in the My Diabetes Coach (MDC) app. Methods: A sequential mixed methods design was applied. Adults with T2D allocated to the intervention arm of the MDC trial used the MDC app over a period of 12 months. At 6 months they completed questions assessing their interaction with and attitudes toward the ECA. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a subsample of the participants from the intervention arm to explore their experiences of using the ECA. The interview questions included the participants' perceptions of Laura including their initial impression of her (and how this changed over time) her personality and human character. The quantitative and qualitative data were interpreted using integrated synthesis. Results: Of the 93 intervention participants 44 (47%) were women the mean (SD) age of the participants was 55 (SD 10) years and the baseline glycated hemoglobin A1c level was 7.3% (SD 1.5%). Overall 66 of the 93 participants (71%) provided survey responses. Of these most described Laura as being helpful (57/66 86%) friendly (57/66 86%) competent (56/66 85%) trustworthy (48/66 73%) and likable (40/66 61%). Some described Laura as not real (18/66 27%) boring (26/66 39%) and annoying (20/66 30%). Participants reported that interacting with Laura made them feel more motivated (29/66 44%) comfortable (24/66 36%) confident (14/66 21%) happy (11/66 17%) and hopeful (8/66 12%). Furthermore 20% (13/66) of the participants were frustrated by their interaction with Laura and 17% (11/66) of the participants reported that interacting with Laura made them feel guilty. A total of 4 themes emerged from the qualitative data (N=19): (1) perceived role: a friendly coach rather than a health professional (2) perceived support: emotional and motivational support (3) embodiment preference acceptability of a human-like character and (4) room for improvement: need for greater congruence between Laura's words and actions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that an ECA is an acceptable means to deliver T2D self-management education and support. A human-like character providing ongoing friendly nonjudgmental emotional and motivational support is well received. Nevertheless the ECA can be improved by increasing congruence between its verbal and nonverbal communication and accommodating user preferences.;2020
Background: In the absence of widespread testing symptomatic monitoring efforts may allow for understanding the epidemiological situation of the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan. We obtained data from a social networking service (SNS) messaging application that monitors self-reported COVID-19 related symptoms in real time in Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. We aimed at not only understanding the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in the prefecture but also highlighting the usefulness of symptomatic monitoring approaches that rely on self-reporting using SNS during a pandemic and informing the assessment of Japan's emergency declaration over COVID-19. Methods: We analysed symptoms data (fever over 37.5 degrees and a strong feeling of weariness or shortness of breath) reported voluntarily via SNS chatbot by 227898 residents of Fukuoka Prefecture during March 27 to May 3 2020 including April 7 when a state of emergency was declared. We estimated the spatial correlation coefficient between the number of the self-reported cases of COVID-19 related symptoms and the number of PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases in the period (obtained from the prefecture website) and estimated the empirical Bayes age- and sex-standardised incidence ratio (EBSIR) of the symptoms in the period compared before and after the declaration. The number of symptom cases was weighted by age and sex to reflect the regional population distribution according to the 2015 national census. Findings: Of the participants 3.47% reported symptoms. There was a strong spatial correlation of 0.847 (p < 0.001) at municipality level between the weighted number of self-reported symptoms and the number of COVID-19 cases for both symptoms. The EBSIR at post-code level was not likely to change remarkably before and after the declaration of the emergency but the gap in EBSIR between high-risk and low-risk areas appeared to have increased after the declaration. Interpretation: While caution is necessary as the data was limited to SNS users the self-reported COVID-19 related symptoms considered in the study had high epidemiological evaluation ability. In addition though based on visual assessment after the declaration of the emergency regional containment of the infection risk might have strengthened to some extent. SNS which can provide a high level of real-time voluntary symptom data collection can be used to assess the epidemiology of a pandemic as well as to assist in policy assessments such as emergency declarations.

Background: Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) is more effective when it is guided by human support than when it is unguided. This may be attributable to higher adherence rates that result from a positive effect of the accompanying support on motivation and on engagement with the intervention. This protocol presents the design of a pilot randomized controlled trial that aims to start bridging the gap between guided and unguided interventions. It will test an intervention that includes automated support delivered by an embodied conversational agent (ECA) in the form of a virtual coach. Methods/design: The study will employ a pilot two-armed randomized controlled trial design. The primary outcomes of the trial will be (1) the effectiveness of iCBT as supported by a virtual coach in terms of improved intervention adherence in comparison with unguided iCBT and (2) the feasibility of a future larger-scale trial in terms of recruitment acceptability and sample size calculation. Secondary aims will be to assess the virtual coach's effect on motivation users' perceptions of the virtual coach and general feasibility of the intervention as supported by a virtual coach. We will recruitN = 70 participants from the general population who wish to learn how they can improve their mood by using Moodbuster Lite a 4-week cognitive-behavioral therapy course. Candidates with symptoms of moderate to severe depression will be excluded from study participation. Included participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either (1) Moodbuster Lite with automated support delivered by a virtual coach or (2) Moodbuster Lite without automated support. Assessments will be taken at baseline and post-study 4 weeks later. Discussion: The study will assess the preliminary effectiveness of a virtual coach in improving adherence and will determine the feasibility of a larger-scale RCT. It could represent a significant step in bridging the gap between guided and unguided iCBT interventions.;2020
Background: Lack of time for exercise is common among office workers given their busy lives. Because of occupational restrictions and difficulty in taking time off it is necessary to suggest effective ways for workers to exercise regularly. Sustaining lifestyle habits that increase nonexercise activity in daily life can solve the issue of lack of exercise time. Healthy Lifestyle Coaching Chatbot is a messenger app based on the habit formation model that can be used as a tool to provide a health behavior intervention that emphasizes the importance of sustainability and involvement. Objective: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the Healthy Lifestyle Coaching Chatbot intervention presented via a messenger app aimed at stair-climbing habit formation for office workers. Methods: From February 1 2018 to April 30 2018 a total of 106 people participated in the trial after online recruitment. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=57) or the control group (n=49). The intervention group received cues and intrinsic and extrinsic rewards for the entire 12 weeks. However the control group did not receive intrinsic rewards for the first 4 weeks and only received all rewards as in the intervention group from the fifth to twelfth week. The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) of participants was evaluated every week and the level of physical activity was measured at the beginning and end of the trial. SPSS Statistics version 21 (IBM Corp) was used for statistical analysis. Results: After 4 weeks of intervention without providing the intrinsic rewards in the control group the change in SRHI scores was 13.54 (SD 14.99) in the intervention group and 6.42 (SD 9.42) in the control group indicating a significant difference between the groups (P=.04). When all rewards were given to both groups from the fifth to twelfth week the change in SRHI scores of the intervention and control groups was comparable at 12.08 (SD 10.87) and 15.88 (SD 13.29) respectively (P=.21). However the level of physical activity showed a significant difference between the groups after 12 weeks of intervention (P=.045). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that intrinsic rewards are important to enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of an intervention. The Healthy Lifestyle Coaching Chatbot program can be a cost-effective method for healthy habit formation.;2020
Background: On April 7 2020 the Japanese government declared a state of emergency regarding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Given the nation-wide spread of the coronavirus in major Japanese cities and the rapid increase in the number of cases with untraceable infection routes large-scale monitoring for capturing the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in Japan is urgently required. Methods: A chatbot-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And AN care seeking) was developed to surveil the Japanese epidemiological situation in real-time. COOPERA asked questions regarding personal information location preventive actions COVID-19 related symptoms and their residence. Empirical Bayes estimates of the age-sex-standardized incidence rate and disease mapping approach using scan statistics were utilized to identify the geographical distribution of the symptoms in Tokyo and their spatial correlation r with the identified COVID-19 cases. Findings: We analyzed 353010 participants from Tokyo recruited from 27th March to 6th April 2020. The mean (SD) age of participants was 42.7 (12.3) and 63.4% 36.4% or 0.2% were female male or others respectively. 95.6% of participants had no subjective symptoms. We identified several geographical clusters with high spatial correlation (r = 0.9) especially in downtown areas in central Tokyo such as Shibuya and Shinjuku. Interpretation: With the global spread of COVID-19 medical resources are being depleted. A new system to monitor the epidemiological situation COOPERA can provide insights to assist political decision to tackle the epidemic. In addition given that Japan has not had a strong lockdown policy to weaken the spread of the infection our result would be useful for preparing for the second wave in other countries during the next flu season without a strong lockdown.

Background: Ongoing pain is one of the most common diseases and has major physical psychological social and economic impacts. A mobile health intervention utilizing a fully automated text-based health care chatbot (TBHC) may offer an innovative way not only to deliver coping strategies and psychoeducation for pain management but also to build a working alliance between a participant and the TBHC. Objective: The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to describe the design and implementation to promote the chatbot painSELfMAnagement (SELMA) a 2-month smartphone-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) TBHC intervention for pain self-management in patients with ongoing or cyclic pain and (2) to present findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial in which effectiveness influence of intention to change behavior pain duration working alliance acceptance and adherence were evaluated. Methods: Participants were recruited online and in collaboration with pain experts and were randomized to interact with SELMA for 8 weeks either every day or every other day concerning CBT-based pain management (n=59) or weekly concerning content not related to pain management (n=43). Pain-related impairment (primary outcome) general well-being pain intensity and the bond scale of working alliance were measured at baseline and postintervention. Intention to change behavior and pain duration were measured at baseline only and acceptance postintervention was assessed via self-reporting instruments. Adherence was assessed via usage data. Results: From May 2018 to August 2018 311 adults downloaded the SELMA app 102 of whom consented to participate and met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the women (88/102 86.4%) and men (14/102 13.6%) participating was 43.7 (SD 12.7) years. Baseline group comparison did not differ with respect to any demographic or clinical variable. The intervention group reported no significant change in pain-related impairment (P=.68) compared to the control group postintervention. The intention to change behavior was positively related to pain-related impairment (P=.01) and pain intensity (P=.01). Working alliance with the TBHC SELMA was comparable to that obtained in guided internet therapies with human coaches. Participants enjoyed using the app perceiving it as useful and easy to use. Participants of the intervention group replied with an average answer ratio of 0.71 (SD 0.20) to 200 (SD 58.45) conversations initiated by SELMA. Participants' comments revealed an appreciation of the empathic and responsible interaction with the TBHC SELMA. A main criticism was that there was no option to enter free text for the patients' own comments. Conclusions: SELMA is feasible as revealed mainly by positive feedback and valuable suggestions for future revisions. For example the participants' intention to change behavior or a more homogenous sample (eg with a specific type of chronic pain) should be considered in further tailoring of SELMA.;2020
Background: Patient follow-up is an essential part of hospital ward management. With the development of deep learning algorithms individual follow-up assignments might be completed by artificial intelligence (AI). We developed an AI-assisted follow-up conversational agent that can simulate the human voice and select an appropriate follow-up time for quantitative automatic and personalized patient follow-up. Patient feedback and voice information could be collected and converted into text data automatically. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of AI-assisted follow-up to manual follow-up of patients after surgery. The secondary objective was to compare the feedback from AI-assisted follow-up to feedback from manual follow-up. Methods: The AI-assisted follow-up system was adopted in the Orthopedic Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in April 2019. A total of 270 patients were followed up through this system. Prior to that 2656 patients were followed up by phone calls manually Patient characteristics telephone connection rate follow-up rate feedback collection rate time spent and feedback composition were compared between the two groups of patients. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in age gender or disease between the two groups. There was no significant difference in telephone connection rate (manual . 2478/2656 93.3% AI-assisted: 249/270 92.2% P=.50) or successful follow-up rate (manual: 2301/2478 92.9% AI-assisted: 231/249 92.8% P=.96) between the two groups. The time spent on 100 patients in the manual follow-up group was about 9.3 hours. In contrast the time spent on the AI-assisted follow-up was close to 0 hours. The feedback rate in the AI-assisted follow-up group was higher than that in the manual follow-up group (manual: 68/2656 2.5% AI-assisted: 28/270 10.3% P<.001). The composition of feedback was different in the two groups. Feedback from the AI-assisted follow-up group mainly included nursing health education and hospital environment content while feedback from the manual follow-up group mostly included medical consultation content. Conclusions: The effectiveness of AI-assisted follow-up was not inferior to that of manual follow-up. Human resource costs are saved by AI. AI can help obtain comprehensive feedback from patients although its depth and pertinence of communication need to be improved.;2020
Background: People have insufficient knowledge and many misconceptions about the blood donation process which hampers donors recruitment. Therefore novel strategies and resources are needed to provide information and improve these circumstances. Objective: We aimed at an interactive conversational agent to explain about blood donation. Methods: We used the Dialogflow framework to develop a conversational agent and deployed it publicly. Afterward we conducted an assessment of user experience (UX) with 50 participants who interacted with the agent. We analyzed participants' opinions the different UX scales and their association with participants' demographic variables. Results: The conversational agent is available on the Google Assistant platform in Brazil. It is capable of responding to utterances related to 30 common questions and concerns about donating blood. The user can interact and explore freely and in any order by typing speaking and selecting interface elements. The agent responds by speaking and displaying visual information some multimedia content and suggestions for continuing the dialogue. It enables a conversational sequence in which knowledge is imparted to the user in stages as the dialogue evolves. The overall UX assessed was very satisfactory and people with specific demographic characteristics were more likely to have better UX. All participants had positive opinions and attitudes towards the conversational agent. Conclusions: A conversational agent is a creative and captivating strategy of imparting knowledge and engage people regarding blood donation. The findings reaffirm the potential of using this technology for information outreach especially for socially relevant purposes.;2020
Background: Poor diet and physical inactivity are leading modifiable causes of death and disease. Advances in artificial intelligence technology present tantalizing opportunities for creating virtual health coaches capable of providing personalized support at scale. Objective: This proof of concept study aimed to test the feasibility (recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy of physical activity and Mediterranean-style dietary intervention (MedLiPal) delivered via artificially intelligent virtual health coach. Methods: This 12-week single-arm pre-post study took place in Adelaide Australia from March to August 2019. Participants were inactive community-dwelling adults aged 45 to 75 years recruited through news stories social media posts and flyers. The program included access to an artificially intelligent chatbot Paola who guided participants through a computer-based individualized introductory session weekly check-ins and goal setting and was available 24/7 to answer questions. Participants used a Garmin Vivofit4 tracker to monitor daily steps a website with educational materials and recipes and a printed diet and activity log sheet. Primary outcomes included feasibility (based on recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy for changing physical activity and diet. Secondary outcomes were body composition (based on height weight and waist circumference) and blood pressure. Results: Over 4 weeks 99 potential participants registered expressions of interest with 81 of those screened meeting eligibility criteria. Participants completed a mean of 109.8 (95% CI 1.9-217.7) more minutes of physical activity at week 12 compared with baseline. Mediterranean diet scores increased from a mean of 3.8 out of 14 at baseline to 9.6 at 12 weeks (mean improvement 5.7 points 95% CI 4.2-7.3). After 12 weeks participants lost an average 1.3 kg (95% CI -0.1 to -2.5 kg) and 2.1 cm from their waist circumference (95% CI -3.5 to -0.7 cm). There were no significant changes in blood pressure. Feasibility was excellent in terms of recruitment retention (90% at 12 weeks) and safety (no adverse events). Conclusions: An artificially intelligent virtual assistant-led lifestyle-modification intervention was feasible and achieved measurable improvements in physical activity diet and body composition at 12 weeks. Future research examining artificially intelligent interventions at scale and for other health purposes is warranted.;2020
Background: Pressure on the US health care system has been increasing due to a combination of aging populations rising health care expenditures and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to this pressure are hindered in part by reliance on a limited supply of highly trained health care professionals creating a need for scalable technological solutions. Digital symptom checkers are artificial intelligence-supported software tools that use a conversational chatbot format to support rapid diagnosis and consistent triage. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new attention to these tools due to the need to avoid face-to-face contact and preserve urgent care capacity. However evidence-based deployment of these chatbots requires an understanding of user demographics and associated triage recommendations generated by a large general population. Objective: In this study we evaluate the user demographics and levels of triage acuity provided by a symptom checker chatbot deployed in partnership with a large integrated health system in the United States. Methods: This population-based descriptive study included all web-based symptom assessments completed on the website and patient portal of the Sutter Health system (24 hospitals in Northern California) from April 24 2019 to February 1 2020. User demographics were compared to relevant US Census population data. Results: A total of 26646 symptom assessments were completed during the study period. Most assessments (17816/26646 66.9%) were completed by female users. The mean user age was 34.3 years (SD 14.4 years) compared to a median age of 37.3 years of the general population. The most common initial symptom was abdominal pain (2060/26646 7.7%). A substantial number of assessments (12357/26646 46.4%) were completed outside of typical physician office hours. Most users were advised to seek medical care on the same day (7299/26646 27.4%) or within 2-3 days (6301/26646 23.6%). Over a quarter of the assessments indicated a high degree of urgency (7723/26646 29.0%). Conclusions: Users of the symptom checker chatbot were broadly representative of our patient population although they skewed toward younger and female users. The triage recommendations were comparable to those of nurse-staffed telephone triage lines. Although the emergence of COVID-19 has increased the interest in remote medical assessment tools it is important to take an evidence-based approach to their deployment.;2020
Background: Previous research suggests that artificial agents may be a promising source of social support for humans However the bulk of this research has been conducted in the context of social support interventions that specifically address stressful situations or health improvements. Little research has examined social support received from artificial agents in everyday contexts. Objective: Considering that social support manifests in not only crises but also everyday situations and that everyday social support forms the basis of support received during more stressful events we aimed to investigate the types of everyday social support that can be received from artificial agents. Methods: In Study 1 we examined publicly available user reviews (N=1854) of Replika a popular companion chatbot. In Study 2 a sample (n=66) of Replika users provided detailed open-ended responses regarding their experiences of using Replika. We conducted thematic analysis on both datasets to gain insight into the kind of everyday social support that users receive through interactions with Replika. Results: Replika provides some level of companionship that can help curtail loneliness provide a safe space in which users can discuss any topic without the fear of judgment or retaliation increase positive affect through uplifting and nurturing messages and provide helpful information/advice when normal sources of informational support are not available. Conclusions: Artificial agents may be a promising source of everyday social support particularly companionship emotional informational and appraisal support but not as tangible support. Future studies are needed to determine who might benefit from these types of everyday social support the most and why. These results could potentially be used to help address global health issues or other crises early on in everyday situations before they potentially manifest into larger issues.;2020
Background: Recent advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence have led to widespread adoption of speech recognition technologies. In consumer health applications speech recognition is usually applied to support interactions with conversational agents for data collection decision support and patient monitoring. However little is known about the use of speech recognition in consumer health applications and few studies have evaluated the efficacy of conversational agents in the hands of consumers. In other consumer-facing tools cognitive load has been observed to be an important factor affecting the use of speech recognition technologies in tasks involving problem solving and recall. Users find it more difficult to think and speak at the same time when compared to typing pointing and clicking. However the effects of speech recognition on cognitive load when performing health tasks has not yet been explored. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of speech recognition for documentation in consumer digital health tasks involving problem solving and recall. Methods: Fifty university staff and students were recruited to undertake four documentation tasks with a simulated conversational agent in a computer laboratory. The tasks varied in complexity determined by the amount of problem solving and recall required (simple and complex) and the input modality (speech recognition vs keyboard and mouse). Cognitive load task completion time error rate and usability were measured. Results: Compared to using a keyboard and mouse speech recognition significantly increased the cognitive load for complex tasks (Z=-4.08 P<.001) and simple tasks (Z=-2.24 P=.03). Complex tasks took significantly longer to complete (Z=-2.52 P=.01) and speech recognition was found to be overall less usable than a keyboard and mouse (Z=-3.30 P=.001). However there was no effect on errors. Conclusions: Use of a keyboard and mouse was preferable to speech recognition for complex tasks involving problem solving and recall. Further studies using a broader variety of consumer digital health tasks of varying complexity are needed to investigate the contexts in which use of speech recognition is most appropriate. The effects of cognitive load on task performance and its significance also need to be investigated.;2020
Background: Respondent engagement of questionnaires in health care is fundamental to ensure adequate response rates for the evaluation of services and quality of care. Conventional survey designs are often perceived as dull and unengaging resulting in negative respondent behavior. It is necessary to make completing a questionnaire attractive and motivating. Objective: The aim of this study is to compare the user experience of a chatbot questionnaire which mimics intelligent conversation with a regular computer questionnaire. Methods: The research took place at the preoperative outpatient clinic. Patients completed both the standard computer questionnaire and the new chatbot questionnaire Afterward patients gave their feedback on both questionnaires by the User Experience Questionnaire which consists of 26 terms to score. Results: The mean age of the 40 included patients (25 [63%] women) was 49 (SD 18-79) years 46.73% (486/1040) of all terms were scored positive for the chatbot. Patients preferred the computer for 7.98% (83/1040) of the terms and for 47.88% (498/1040) of the terms there were no differences. Completion (mean time) of the computer questionnaire took 9.00 minutes by men (SD 2.72) and 7.72 minutes by women (SD 2.60 P=.148). For the chatbot completion by men took 8.33 minutes (SD 2.99) and by women 7.36 minutes (SD 2.61 P=.287). Conclusions: Patients preferred the chatbot questionnaire over the computer questionnaire Time to completion of both questionnaires did not differ though the chatbot questionnaire on a tablet felt more rapid compared to the computer questionnaire This is an important finding because it could lead to higher response rates and to qualitatively better responses in future questionnaires.;2020
Background: Seeking medical information can be an issue for physicians. In the specific context of medical practice chatbots are hypothesized to present additional value for providing information quickly particularly as far as drug risk minimization measures are concerned. Objective: This qualitative study aimed to elicit physicians' perceptions of a pilot version of a chatbot used in the context of drug information and risk minimization measures. Methods: General practitioners and specialists were recruited across France to participate in individual semistructured interviews. Interviews were recorded transcribed and analyzed using a horizontal thematic analysis approach. Results: Eight general practitioners and 2 specialists participated. The tone and ergonomics of the pilot version were appreciated by physicians. However all participants emphasized the importance of getting exhaustive trustworthy answers when interacting with a chatbot. Conclusions: The chatbot was perceived as a useful and innovative tool that could easily be integrated into routine medical practice and could help health professionals when seeking information on drug and risk minimization measures.;2020
Background: The clinical application of voice technology provides novel opportunities in the field of telehealth. However patients' readiness for this solution has not been investigated among patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Objective: This paper aims to evaluate patients' anticipated experiences regarding telemedicine including voice conversational agents combined with provider-driven support delivered by phone. Methods: A cross-sectional study enrolled patients with chronic CVD who were surveyed using a validated investigator-designed questionnaire combining 19 questions (eg demographic data medical history preferences for using telehealth services). Prior to the survey respondents were educated on the telemedicine services presented in the questionnaire while being assisted by a medical doctor. Responses were then collected and analyzed and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of willingness to use voice technology. Results: In total 249 patients (mean age 65.3 SD 13.8 years 158 [63.5%] men) completed the questionnaire which showed good repeatability in the validation procedure. Of the 249 total participants 209 (83.9%) reported high readiness to receive services allowing for remote contact with a cardiologist (176/249 70.7%) and telemonitoring of vital signs (168/249 67.5%). The voice conversational agents combined with provider-driven support delivered by phone were shown to be highly anticipated by patients with CVD. The readiness to use telehealth was statistically higher in people with previous difficulties accessing health care (OR 2.920 95% CI 1.377-6.192) and was most frequent in city residents and individuals reporting a higher education level. The age and sex of the respondents did not impact the intention to use voice technology (P=.20 and P=.50 respectively). Conclusions: Patients with cardiovascular diseases including both younger and older individuals declared high readiness for voice technology.;2020
Background: The emergence of chatbots in health care is fast approaching. Data on the feasibility of chatbots for chronic disease management are scarce. Objective: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of utilizing natural language processing (NLP) for the categorization of electronic dialog data of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) for use in the development of a chatbot. Methods: Electronic dialog data collected between 2013 and 2018 from a care management platform (UCLA eIBD) at a tertiary referral center for IBD at the University of California Los Angeles were used. Part of the data was manually reviewed and an algorithm for categorization was created. The algorithm categorized all relevant dialogs into a set number of categories using NLP. In addition 3 independent physicians evaluated the appropriateness of the categorization. Results: A total of 16453 lines of dialog were collected and analyzed. We categorized 8324 messages from 424 patients into seven categories. As there was an overlap in these categories their frequencies were measured independently as symptoms (2033/6193 32.83%) medications (2397/6193 38.70%) appointments (1518/6193 24.51%) laboratory investigations (2106/6193 34.01%) finance or insurance (447/6193 7.22%) communications (2161/6193 34.89%) procedures (617/6193 9.96%) and miscellaneous (624/6193 10.08%). Furthermore in 95.0% (285/300) of cases there were minor or no differences in categorization between the algorithm and the three independent physicians. Conclusions: With increased adaptation of electronic health technologies chatbots could have great potential in interacting with patients collecting data and increasing efficiency. Our categorization showcases the feasibility of using NLP in large amounts of electronic dialog for the development of a chatbot algorithm. Chatbots could allow for the monitoring of patients beyond consultations and potentially empower and educate patients and improve clinical outcomes.;2020
Background: The progressive development of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) implies the need to train health professionals in such field for which e-learning and blended learning methods are increasingly been used. Most nurses lack experience and training in MIS so a laparoscopic blended learning course for nursing has been created. Objectives: To perform the validation of the online theoretical module of such course to evaluate student perception and satisfaction sociability and usability metrics and also the interest of nurses in blended learning. Design: A quantitative design has been used. Participants: 24 nurses participated in the validation tests performing the online module of the course. Methods: Subjective (questionnaires) and objective (performance statistics) metrics were analysed. Results: The e-learning environment has ease of access good layout consistency and intuitive navigation. Chat and forums have not been used and nurses miss a moderator. Participants consider that videos provide added value to the course and contents are easily understandable and of high quality. However questionnaires are not well balanced in difficulty and few interactive 3D designs have been viewed. Participants consider blended learning as the most effective training method for its flexibility in time and place. Conclusions: This study suggests that a simple easy-to-use and attractive e-learning environment has been developed to train nurses in MIS. However installation of additional software should be avoided. A moderator/tutor should manage forums to encourage user participation using conversational agents. But nevertheless chats have no interest. Questionnaires for content evaluation should be designed with efficiency and equity. Videos designed according to micro-learning with audio and interactivity should be included. These courses should be designed to meet factors to promote the engagement of students. Blended learning is considered by nurses as ideal method for training but further research to assess whether it improves learning outcomes is needed.;2020
Background: The study of adverse childhood experiences and their consequences has emerged over the past 20 years. Although the conclusions from these studies are available the same is not true of the data. Accordingly it is a complex problem to build a training set and develop machine-learning models from these studies. Classic machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques cannot provide a full scientific understanding of the inner workings of the underlying models. This raises credibility issues due to the lack of transparency and generalizability. Explainable artificial intelligence is an emerging approach for promoting credibility accountability and trust in mission-critical areas such as medicine by combining machine-learning approaches with explanatory techniques that explicitly show what the decision criteria are and why (or how) they have been established. Hence thinking about how machine learning could benefit from knowledge graphs that combine common sense knowledge as well as semantic reasoning and causality models is a potential solution to this problem. Objective: In this study we aimed to leverage explainable artificial intelligence and propose a proof-of-concept prototype for a knowledge-driven evidence-based recommendation system to improve mental health surveillance. Methods: We used concepts from an ontology that we have developed to build and train a question-answering agent using the Google DialogFlow engine. In addition to the question-answering agent the initial prototype includes knowledge graph generation and recommendation components that leverage third-party graph technology. Results: To showcase the framework functionalities we here present a prototype design and demonstrate the main features through four use case scenarios motivated by an initiative currently implemented at a children's hospital in Memphis Tennessee. Ongoing development of the prototype requires implementing an optimization algorithm of the recommendations incorporating a privacy layer through a personal health library and conducting a clinical trial to assess both usability and usefulness of the implementation. Conclusions: This semantic-driven explainable artificial intelligence prototype can enhance health care practitioners' ability to provide explanations for the decisions they make.;2020
Background: The usability and effectiveness of conversational agents (chatbots) that deliver psychological therapies is under-researched. Objective: This study aimed to compare the system usability acceptability and effectiveness in older adults of 2 Web-based conversational agents that differ in theoretical orientation and approach. Methods: In a randomized study 112 older adults were allocated to 1 of the following 2 fully automated interventions: Manage Your Life Online (MYLO ie a chatbot that mimics a therapist using a method of levels approach) and ELIZA (a chatbot that mimics a therapist using a humanistic counseling approach). The primary outcome was problem distress and resolution with secondary outcome measures of system usability and clinical outcome. Results: MYLO participants spent significantly longer interacting with the conversational agent. Posthoc tests indicated that MYLO participants had significantly lower problem distress at follow-up. There were no differences between MYLO and ELIZA in terms of problem resolution. MYLO was rated as significantly more helpful and likely to be used again. System usability of both the conversational agents was associated with helpfulness of the agents and the willingness of the participants to reuse. Adherence was high. A total of 12% (7/59) of the MYLO group did not carry out their conversation with the chatbot. Conclusions: Controlled studies of chatbots need to be conducted in clinical populations across different age groups. The potential integration of chatbots into psychological care in routine services is discussed.;2020
Background: The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) to be a pandemic on March 11. 2020. Large-scale monitoring for capturing the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in Japan would improve preparation for and prevention of a massive outbreak. Methods: A chatbot-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And care seeking) was developed using the LINE app to evaluate the current Japanese epidemiological situation. LINE users could participate in the system either though a QR code page in the prefectures' websites or a banner at the top of the LINE app screen. COOPERA asked participants questions regarding personal information preventive actions and non-specific symptoms related to COVID-19 and their duration. We calculated daily cross correlation functions between the reported number of infected cases confirmed using polymerase chain reaction and the symptom-positive group captured by COOPERA. Results: We analyzed 206218 participants from three prefectures reported between March 5 and 30 2020. The mean age of participants was 44.2 (standard deviation 13.2) years. No symptoms were reported by 96.93% of participants but there was a significantly positive correlation between the reported number of COVID-19 cases and self-reported fevers suggesting that massive monitoring of fever might help to estimate the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic in real time. Conclusions: COOPERA is the first real-time system being used to monitor trends in COVID-19 in Japan and provides useful insights to assist political decisions to tackle the epidemic.;2020
Background: There has recently been exponential growth in the development and use of health apps on mobile phones. As with most mobile apps however the majority of users abandon them quickly and after minimal use. One of the most critical factors for the success of a health app is how to support users' commitment to their health. Despite increased interest from researchers in mobile health few studies have examined the measurement of user engagement with health apps. Objective: User engagement is a multidimensional complex phenomenon. The aim of this study was to understand the concept of user engagement and in particular to demonstrate the applicability of a user engagement scale (UES) to mobile health apps. Methods: To determine the measurability of user engagement in a mobile health context a UES was employed which is a psychometric tool to measure user engagement with a digital system. This was adapted to Ada developed by Ada Health an artificial intelligence-powered personalized health guide that helps people understand their health. A principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was conducted on 30 items. In addition sum scores as means of each subscale were calculated. Results: Survey data from 73 Ada users were analyzed. PCA was determined to be suitable as verified by the sampling adequacy of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.858 a significant Bartlett test of sphericity (chi(2)(300) =1127.1 P<.001) and communalities mostly within the 0.7 range. Although 5 items had to be removed because of low factor loadings the results of the remaining 25 items revealed 4 attributes: perceived usability aesthetic appeal reward and focused attention. Ada users showed the highest engagement level with perceived usability with a value of 294 followed by aesthetic appeal reward and focused attention. Conclusions: Although the UES was deployed in German and adapted to another digital domain PCA yielded consistent subscales and a 4-factor structure. This indicates that user engagement with health apps can be assessed with the German version of the UES. These results can benefit related mobile health app engagement research and may be of importance to marketers and app developers.;2020
Background: There is increasing interest in finding novel approaches to improve the preparation of children for hospital procedures such as surgery x-rays and blood tests. Well-prepared and informed children have better outcomes (less procedural anxiety and higher satisfaction). A digital therapeutic (DTx) platform (Xploro) was developed with children to provide health information through gamification serious games a chatbot and an augmented reality avatar. Objective: This before and after evaluation study aims to assess the acceptability of the Xploro DTx and examine its impact on children and their parent's procedural knowledge procedural anxiety and reported experiences when attending a hospital for a planned procedure. Methods: We used a mixed methods design with quantitative measures and qualitative data collected sequentially from a group of children who received standard hospital information (before group) and a group of children who received the DTx intervention (after group). Participants were children aged between 8 and 14 years and their parents who attended a hospital for a planned clinical procedure at a children's hospital in North West England. Children and their parents completed self-report measures (perceived knowledge procedural anxiety procedural satisfaction and procedural involvement) at baseline preprocedure and postprocedure. Results: A total of 80 children (n=40 standard care group and n=40 intervention group) and their parents participated in the study the children were aged between 8 and 14 years (average 10.4 SD 2.27 years) and were attending a hospital for a range of procedures. The children in the intervention group reported significantly lower levels of procedural anxiety before the procedure than those in the standard group (two-tailed t63.64=2.740 P=.008). The children in the intervention group also felt more involved in their procedure than those in the standard group (t75=-2.238 P=.03). The children in the intervention group also reported significantly higher levels of perceived procedural knowledge preprocedure (t59.98=-4.892 P=.001) than those in the standard group. As for parents those with access to the Xploro intervention reported significantly lower levels of procedural anxiety preprocedure than those who did not (t68.51=1.985 P=.05). During the semistructured write and tell interviews children stated that they enjoyed using the intervention it was fun and easy to use and they felt that it had positively influenced their experiences of coming to the hospital for a procedure. Conclusions: This study has shown that the DTx platform Xploro has a positive impact on children attending a hospital for a procedure by reducing levels of procedural anxiety. The children and parents in the intervention group described Xploro as improving their experiences and being easy and fun to use.;2020
Background: Until recently developing health technologies was time-consuming and expensive and often involved patients doctors and other health care professionals only as passive recipients of the end product. So far users have been minimally involved in the ideation and creation stages of digital health technologies. In order to best address users' unmet needs a transdisciplinary and user-led approach involving cocreation and direct user feedback is required. In this context hackathon events have become increasingly popular in generating enthusiasm for user-centered innovation. Objective: This case study describes preparatory steps and the performance of a health hackathon directly involving patients and health care professionals at all stages. Feasibility and outcomes were assessed leading to the development of systematic recommendations for future hackathons as a vehicle for bottom-up innovation in health care. Methods: A 2-day hackathon was conducted in February 2017 in Berlin Germany. Data were collected through a field study. Collected field notes were subsequently discussed in 15 informal meetings among the research team. Experiences of conducting two further hackathons in December 2017 and November 2018 were included. Results: In total 30 participants took part with 63% (19/30) of participants between 25 and 34 years of age 30% (9/30) between 35 and 44 years of age and 7% (2/30) younger than 25 years of age. A total of 43% (13/30) of the participants were female. The participation rate of medical experts including patients and health care professionals was 30% (9/30). Five multidisciplinary teams were formed and each tackled a specific health care problem. All presented projects were apps: a chatbot for skin cancer recognition an augmented reality exposure-based therapy (eg for arachnophobia) an app for medical neighborhood connectivity a doctor appointment platform and a self-care app for people suffering from depression. Patients and health care professionals initiated all of the projects. Conducting the hackathon resulted in significant growth of the digital health community of Berlin and was followed up by larger hackathons. Systematic recommendations for conducting cost-efficient hackathons (n <= 30) were developed including aspects of community building stakeholder engagement mentoring themes announcements follow-up and timing for each step. Conclusions: This study shows that hackathons are effective in bringing innovation to health care and are more cost- and time-efficient and potentially more sustainable than traditional medical device and digital product development. Our systematic recommendations can be useful to other individuals and organizations that want to establish user-led innovation in academic hospitals by conducting transdisciplinary hackathons.;2020
BackgroundA large proportion of apprentices shows addictive behaviours like cigarette smoking alcohol cannabis or compulsive Internet use others do not show such behaviours at all. ready4life is a smartphone application-based coaching program for apprentices which takes into account the heterogeneity of adolescent addictive behaviour by promoting life skills and reducing risk behaviours. The main objective of the planned study is to test the efficacy of ready4life for addiction prevention among apprentices in Switzerland within a controlled trial.Methods/designThe efficacy of the ready4life coaching program will be tested in comparison to an assessment only control group within a cluster-randomised controlled trial with one follow-up assessment after 6months. At the beginning of the program participants of the intervention group will receive an individual profile showing areas in which they have sufficient resources and in which there is a need for coaching. Based on this feedback they can select two out of the following six program modules: stress social skills Internet use tobacco/e-cigarettes cannabis and alcohol. Participants of the intervention group will receive individualised coaching by a conversational agent (chatbot) for a period of four months. The coaching relies on motivational and social-cognitive principles of behaviour change. Within weekly dialogues the coach provides individually tailored information in different formats such as videoclips texts or pictures. Study participants will be 1318 apprentices with a minimum age of 15 recruited in approximately 100 vocational school classes in Switzerland. Primary outcome will be a composite measure for addictive behaviours including (1) at risk-drinking (2) tobacco/e-cigarette smoking (3) cannabis use and (4) problematic Internet use.DiscussionThe study will reveal whether this universally implementable but individually tailored intervention approach is effective in preventing the onset and escalation of addictive behaviors among apprentices.Trial registrationISRCTN59908406 (registration date: 21/10/2020).;2020
Balinese calendar is defined as a unique calendar system for combining solar-based and lunar-based system and assuming local system. It is considered as guidance of Balinese societies' activities management starting from meeting arrangement wedding ceremony to religious ceremonies. Practically it has developed in the form of printed Balinese calendar and electronic Balinese calendar either web or mobile application. The core of the function is to find out the day with its various characteristics in the Balinese Calendar. In general society usually asks the religious leader to find out the day in detail. The technology of NLP combined with models of pattern discoveries supports the arrangement of the interaction model in searching the good day in Balinese Calendar to equip the conventional searching system in the previous applications. This study will design a dialog model with AIML method in multi-parameter basis therefore the users will be dynamically able to use the searching content in various ways by chatting in similar with consulting to a religious leader. This model will be applied in a chatbot basis service in telegram machine. The addition of the context recognition section into 4 paterns has been successfully improve the ability of AIML to recognize input patterns with many criteria. Based on the testing with 50 random input patterns obtained a success rate of 92.5%.;2020
Bots are destined to dominate how humans interact with the internet of things that continues to grow around them. Despite their still budding intellectual capacity major companies (e.g. Apple Google and Amazon) have already placed (chat)bots at the centre of their flagship devices. (Chat)Bots currently fill the internet acting as guides merchants and assistants. Chatbots designed as communicators however have yet to make a meaningful contribution to perhaps their most natural vocation: foreign language learning partners. This review engages in three questions that surround this issue: 1. Why are chatbots not already at the centre of foreign language learning? 2. What are two key developers of chatbots working towards that might push chatbots into the language learning spotlight? 3. What might researchers educators and developers together do to support chatbots as foreign language learning partners right now?;2020
Building a personalized task-oriented dialogue system is an important but challenging task. Significant success has been achieved in the template selection responses. However preparing a massive response template is time-consuming and human-labor intensive. In this paper we propose an end-to-end framework based on memory networks for response generation in a personalized task-oriented dialogue system. Our model consists of three parts: a retrieval module a memory encoder network and a memory decoder network. Retrieval module employs the user utterances and user attributes to collect relevant responses from other users. Memory encoder is trained with textual features to obtain dialogue representation. Memory decoder is composed of an RNN and a rule-memory network for response generation. Experiments on the benchmark dataset show that our model achieves better performance than strong baselines in personalized task-oriented dialogue generation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Building dialogue systems plays an important role in modern life. amongst them task-oriented dialogue for resolving problems in actual life is most worth exploring. Motivated by the development of end-to-end approaches a task-oriented dialogue model based on bidirectional LSTM and self-attention mechanism is proposed. It not only makes good use of context and effectively solves the long-term dependency but also identifies the relationship between sentences optimizes feature vectors and has good parallelism. In our method the dialogue state tracker(DST) is firstly improved. Our dialogue state tracker can identify the multiple slot key-value pairs involved in the utterance without manual label. In addition we apply the data augmentation of merging machine translation and bilingual dictionary to create more diversified data sets. Finally in the experimental part the enhanced data and the results of DST are fed into the proposed B&Anet (bidirectional long and short memory network and self-attention mechanism network) model. The evaluation results on DSTC2 (dialogue state tracking chanllenge2) show that our method achieves competitive performance.;2020
Business intelligence (BI) applications play an important role in the enterprise to make critical business decisions. Conversational interfaces enable non-technical enterprise users to explore their data democratizing access to data significantly. In this paper we describe an ontology-based framework for creating a conversation system for BI applications termed as Conversational BI. We create an ontology from a business model underlying the BI application and use this ontology to automatically generate various artifacts of the conversation system. These include the intents entities as well as the training samples for each intent. Our approach builds upon our earlier work and exploits common BI access patterns to generate intents their training examples and adapt the dialog structure to support typical BI operations. We have implemented our techniques in Health Insights (HI) an IBM Watson Healthcare offering providing analysis over insurance data on claims. Our user study demonstrates that our system is quite intuitive for gaining business insights from data. We also show that our approach not only captures the analysis available in the fixed application dashboards but also enables new queries and explorations.;2020
Cancer is a disease of evolutionary origin in which a group of cells in the body initiate evolutionary changes under certain circumstances that can lead to the formation of a tumor. It is currently believed that a hostile cell environment can lead to the cells of an organ or tissue initiating a whole series of physiological changes that will lead to the transformation of healthy cells into cancerous ones. During the process of transformation cells evolve under a paradigm known as somatic evolution. In this work the first stages of the formation of a cancerous tumor have been simulated assuming that the cause of the formation is the genetic instability of the cells being the cause of this instability the presence of chronic inflammation phenomenon responsible for the appearance of a hostile cellular environment. The model simulates a virtual patient where an altered state of mind whether depressive stressed or similar will lead to disturbed hormone levels that will eventually lead to a condition of chronic inflammation. A novelty of the work is the design of a genetic algorithm oriented to the simulation of somatic evolution representing the cells by means of a vector that encodes the nodes of a stochastic network. These nodes represent the states of the genes hallmarks of the cancer and genetic stability of a cell simulating the formation of a tumor in the caverns of the colon. Another novelty of the model is the design of a virtual patient in which a chatbot for the simulation of the state of mind is hybridized with differential equations simulating both the hormones of the so-called hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the cytokines involved in the mechanism of cellular inflammation. The work is a first step in the design of models that under a holistic vision allow the simulation and therefore a greater understanding of the different facets of a disease as complex as cancer.;2020
Challenges in attaining deliberative democratic ideals - such as inclusion authenticity and consequentiality - in wider political systems have driven the development of artificially-designed citizen deliberation. These designed deliberations however are expert-driven. Whereas they may achieve 'deliberativeness' their design and implementation are undemocratic and limit deliberative democracy's emancipatory goals. This is relevant in respect to the role of facilitation. In online deliberation algorithms and artificial actors replace the central role of human facilitators. The detachment of such designed settings from wider contexts is particularly troubling from a democratic perspective. Digital technologies in online deliberation are not developed in a manner consistent with democratic ideals and are not being amenable to scrutiny by citizens. I discuss the theoretical and the practical blind spots of algorithmic facilitation. Based on these I present recommendations to democratise the design and implementation of online deliberation with a focus on chatbots as facilitators.;2020
Chatbot (and voicebot) applications are increasingly adopted in various domains such as e-commerce or customer services as a direct communication channel between companies and end-users. Multiple frameworks have been developed to ease their definition and deployment. While these frameworks are efficient to design simple chatbot applications they still require advanced technical knowledge to define complex interactions and are difficult to evolve along with the company needs (e.g. it is typically impossible to change the NL engine provider). In addition the deployment of a chatbot application usually requires a deep understanding of the targeted platforms especially back-end connections increasing the development and maintenance costs. In this paper we introduce the Xatkit framework. Xatkit tackles these issues by providing a set of Domain Specific Languages to define chatbots (and voicebots and bots in general) in a platform-independent way. Xatkit also comes with a runtime engine that automatically deploys the chatbot application and manages the defined conversation logic over the platforms of choice. Xatkits modular architecture facilitates the separate evolution of any of its components. Xatkit is open source and fully available online.;2020
Chatbot communication in which a robot communicates with a human being in natural language in an open domain has achieved significant progress. However it still suffers from problems such as a lack of diversity and contextual relevance. In this paper we propose a retrieval-polished (RP) model for response generation that polishes a draft response based on a retrieved prototype. In particular we first adopt a prototype selector to retrieve a contextually similar prototype. Then a generation-based polisher is designed to obtain a polished response. Finally we introduce a polished response filter to choose whether the final reply should be the retrieved response or the polished response. Extensive experiments on a dialog corpus show that our method outperforms retrieval-based and generation-based chatbots with respect to fluency contextual relevance and response diversity. Specifically our model achieves substantial improvement compared with several strong baselines.;2020
ChatBot has potential as a language learning tool especially for learning Chinese vocabulary. This study aimed to investigate the impact of using a newly developed ChatBot to learn Chinese vocabulary by comparing how it works in different learning environments and to explore the ChatBot with reference to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This study was conducted with 58 students divided into two independent groups. The control group used ChatBot in a one-on-many classroom. The experimental group applied the ChatBot in one-on-one tutor sessions. A pretest and a posttest were used to measure the effect of the ChatBot while TAM was explored through questionnaire and interview. Data analysis includes a paired-samplettest analysis of covariance and levels of effect. The results indicated that the ChatBot significantly improved the students' learning achievement and that having a one-on-one environment may lead to better outcome than what could be achieved in a classroom. The TAM model was tested using partial least square. The result showed that perceived usefulness was the predictor of behavioral intention whereas perceived ease of use was not. The students agreed that the ChatBot benefited their learning of Chinese vocabulary with several adjustments need to be made for further progress.;2020
Chatbots are able to provide support to patients suffering from very different conditions. Patients with chronic diseases or comorbidities could benefit the most from chatbots which can keep track of their condition provide specific information encourage adherence to medication etc. To perform these functions chatbots need a suitable underlying software architecture. In this paper we introduce a chatbot architecture for chronic patient support grounded on three pillars: scalability by means of microservices standard data sharing models through HL7 FHIR and standard conversation modeling using AIML. We also propose an innovative automation mechanism to convert FHIR resources into AIML files thus facilitating the interaction and data gathering of medical and personal information that ends up in patient health records. To align the way people interact with each other using messaging platforms with the chatbot architecture we propose these very same channels for the chatbot-patient interaction paying special attention to security and privacy issues. Finally we present a monitored-data study performed in different chronic diseases and we present a prototype implementation tailored for one specific chronic disease psoriasis showing how this new architecture allows the change the addition or the improvement of different parts of the chatbot in a dynamic and flexible way providing a substantial improvement in the development of chatbots used as virtual assistants for chronic patients.;2020
Chatbots are gaining their popularity in society and have triggered heated discussions in academia as well. Currently few studies explored the applications of AI-powered mental health chatbots in a mass-shooting disaster context. Via integrating literature from multi-disciplines such as crisis management mental health and digital communication this quantitative study intends to contribute to close this gap and explore the associations between perceived gratifications and protection motivations of using mental health chatbot services active communicative action and online and offline engagement behaviours of solving mental health problems after disasters. This study surveyed 1114 US participants who ever used chatbot services from top healthcare companies. Implications of the results enhance theoretical discussions on how artificial intelligence has shaped individuals' motivations communicative action and engagement behaviour to treat mental health problems. This study also benefits professionals who want to learn more about chatbots for mental healthcare crisis management and customer engagement.;2020
Chatbots are mainly text-based conversational agents that simulate conversations with users. This study aims to investigate drivers of users' satisfaction and continuance intention toward chatbot-based customer service. We propose an analytical framework combining the expectation-confirmation model (ECM) information system success (ISS) model TAM and the need for interaction with a service employee (NFI-SE). Analysis of data collected from 370 actual chatbot users reveals that information quality (IQ) and service quality (SQ) positively influence consumers' satisfaction and that perceived enjoyment (PE) perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are significant predictors of continuance intention (CI). The need for interaction with an employee moderates the effects of PEOU and PU on satisfaction. The findings also revealed that satisfaction with chatbot e-service is a strong determinant and predictor of users' CI toward chatbots. Thus chatbots should enhance their information and service quality to increase users' satisfaction. The findings imply that digital technologies services such as chatbots could be combined with human service employees to satisfy digital users.;2020
Chatbots have become the go-to platform for users to receive answers to their queries. They are now being used by many businesses too to provide their customers with a virtual assistant to answer their queries. But when it comes to engaging with a user in a dialogue existing chatbots have several shortcomings with issues such as failing to provide a meaningful response to the user offering semantically incorrect information etc. This paper studies the working styles of existing chatbots in generating a response and then identifies their shortcomings from the viewpoint of engaging in a dialogue with a user. It then proposes a domain-specific chatbot named IntelliBot which is a response-generating dialogue-based chatbot that uses multiple strategies to generate a response. IntelliBot was trained on two datasets namely the Cornell movie dialogue and a custom-built insurance dataset so it has domain-specific knowledge. The performance of IntelliBot was then validated and compared with three other chatbots from the literature namely RootyAI ChatterBot and DeepQA. The results demonstrate IntelliBot's superiority in engaging with the user and providing a complete answer in the insurance domain. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2020
Chatbots such as Xiaoice have gained huge popularity in recent years. Users frequently mention their favorite works such as songs and movies in conversations with chatbots. Detecting these entities can help design better chat strategies and improve user experience. Existing named entity recognition methods are mainly designed for formal texts and their performance on the informal chatbot conversation texts may not be optimal In addition these methods rely on massive manually annotated data for model training. In this article we propose a neural approach to detect entities of works for Chinese chatbot. Our approach is based on a language model (LM) long-short term memory (LSTM) convolutional neural network (CNN) conditional random value (CRF) or LM-LSTM-CNN-CRF framework which contains a language model to generate context-aware character embeddings a Bi-LSTM network to learn contextual character representations from global contexts a CNN to learn character representations from local contexts and a CRF layer to jointly decode the character label sequence. In addition we propose an automatic text annotation method via quote marks to reduce the effort of manual annotation. Besides we propose an iterative data purification method to improve the quality of the automatically constructed labeled data. Massive experiments on a real-world dataset validate that our approach can achieve good performance on entity detection for Chinese chatbots.;2020
Commonsense Machine Comprehension (CMC) is a popular natural language understanding task. CMC enables computers to learn about causal and temporal reasoning by exploiting implicit commonsense knowledge and can be applied to Question Answering Search Engine and Dialogue System. Previous methods for CMC limit the vision on CMC task neglecting that Recognizing Textual Entailment(RTE) task has much similarities with CMC task. In this paper we propose a transfer learning model which can take advantage of commonsense knowledge in RTE task by mapping CMC examples and RTE examples to a shared feature space and comprehending in this feature space. Specifically we first establish a transfer learning framework which has three components: (1) source and target mappings (2) domain regularization and (3) CMC score function. Then we make selection for each component in our transfer learning framework and propose the Domain Transfer Comprehension(DTC) model. Experiments on Story Cloze Test show that our model outperforms most previous approaches and provides competitive results with state-of-art methods. We also show each components of our model have positive effect on performance. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.;2020
Context-aware pervasive systems mobile devices intelligent virtual assistants activating services or controlling connected devices are pervading our everyday life. These systems rely on centralized services provided by servers in a cloud gathering all requests performing pre-defined computations and involving pre-defined devices. Large-scale scenarios involving unanticipated devices adaptation to dynamically changing conditions call for alternative solutions favoring edge computing and decentralized behavior. For several years we have worked on a new type of applications built and spontaneously composed on-demand. Applications arise from the interactions of multiple sensors and devices working together as a decentralized collective adaptive system. Our solution relies on a learning-based coordination model providing decentralized communication platforms among agents working on behalf of heterogeneous devices. Each device provides few simple services and data regarding itself (properties and capabilities). In this article we discuss first the design of complex services arising from the spontaneous self-composition of simpler services. Second we present our learning-based coordination model combining coordination and reinforcement learning and how this approach ensures reliable self-composition of services in terms of functionality and expected quality of services. On the basis of a humanitarian scenario we show the feasibility of the approach and discuss our current implementation. Preliminary results show convergence toward learning and correct functionality. Spontaneous self-composition and learning provide a self-adaptive solution for creating on-demand complex services evolving in highly dynamic scenarios comprising large numbers of connected devices.;2020
Conversational agents (CAs)-frequently operationalized as chatbots-are computer systems that leverage natural language processing to engage in conversations with human users. CAs are often operationalized as chatbots which are used for many applications including technical support customer service and digital personal assistants. Despite their widespread use little research to date has investigated how improving the conversational skill of a CA impacts user perceptions of the agent. To elucidate this relationship this research uses Social Presence Theory to describe how conversational skill influences perceived social presence and ultimately anthropomorphism of a chatbot. We conducted a series of studies in which 450 participants interacted with CAs exhibiting varying levels of conversational skill. We show that people perceive a more skilled CA to be more socially present and anthropomorphic than a less skilled CA. This research advances the knowledge of computer-human interface in information systems as CA research to date has largely focused on the technical challenges rather than the behavioral questions of how users interact with CAs.;2020
Conversational agents are gaining huge popularity in industrial applications such as digital assistants chatbots and particularly systems for natural language understanding (NLU). However a major drawback is the unavailability of a common metric to evaluate the replies against human judgement for conversational agents. In this paper we develop a benchmark dataset with human annotations and diverse replies that can be used to develop such metric for conversational agents. The paper introduces a high-quality human annotated movie dialogue dataset HUMOD that is developed from the Cornell movie dialogues dataset. This new dataset comprises 28500 human responses from 9500 multi-turn dialogue history-reply pairs. Human responses include: (i) ratings of the dialogue reply in relevance to the dialogue history and (ii) unique dialogue replies for each dialogue history from the users. Such unique dialogue replies enable researchers in evaluating their models against six unique human responses for each given history. Detailed analysis on how dialogues are structured and human perception on dialogue score in comparison with existing models are also presented.;2020
Conversational interfaces are currently on the rise: more and more applications rely on a chat-like interaction pattern to increase their acceptability and to improve user experience. Also in the area of questionnaire design and administration interaction design is increasingly looked at as an important ingredient of a digital solution. For those reasons we designed and developed a conversational survey tool to administer questionnaires with a colloquial form through a chat-like Web interface. In this paper we present the evaluation results of our approach taking into account both the user point of view - by assessing user acceptance and preferences in terms of survey compilation experience - and the survey design perspective - by investigating the effectiveness of a conversational survey in comparison to a traditional questionnaire. We show that users clearly appreciate the conversational form and prefer it over a traditional approach and that from a data collection point of view the conversational method shows the same reliability and a higher response quality with respect to a traditional questionnaire.;2020
Conversational Recommender Systems (CoRSs) implement a paradigm that allows users to interact in natural language with the system for defining their preferences and discovering items that best fit their needs. CoRSs can be straightforwardly implemented as chatbots that nowadays are becoming more and more popular for several applications such as customer care health care and medical diagnoses. Chatbots implement an interaction based on natural language buttons or both. The implementation of a chatbot is a challenging task since it requires knowledge about natural language processing and human-computer interaction. A CoRS might be particularly useful in the music domain since music is generally enjoyed in contexts when a standard interface cannot be exploited (driving doing homeworks running). However there is no work in the literature that analytically compares different interaction modes for a conversational music recommender system. In this paper we focus on the design and implementation of a CoRS for the music domain. Our CoRS consists of different components. The system implements content-based recommendation critiquing and adaptive strategies as well as explanation facilities. The main innovative contribution is that the user can interact through different interaction modes: natural language buttons and mixed. Due to the lack of available datasets for testing CoRSs we carried out an in vivo experimental evaluation with the goal of investigating the impact of the different interaction modes on the recommendation accuracy and on the cost of interaction for the final user. The experiment involved 110 people and 54 completed the whole process. The analysis of the results shows that the best interaction mode is based on a mixed strategy that combines buttons and natural language. In addition the results allow to clearly understand which are the steps in the dialog that are particularly strenuous for the user.;2020
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown good performance in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification. Excellent hand-crafted CNN architectures incorporated the wisdom of human experts which is an important reason for CNNs success. However the design of architectures is a difficult problem which needs a lot of professional knowledge as well as computational resources. Moreover the manually designed architecture might be suboptimal because it is only one of the thousands of unobserved but objective existed paths. Considering that the success of deep learning is largely due to its automation of the feature engineering process how to design automatic architecture search methods to replace the hand-crafted ones is an interesting topic. In this article the application of neural architecture search (NAS) in the PolSAR area is explored for the first time. Different from the utilization of existing methods a PolSAR-tailored Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) method called PDAS is proposed in order to adapt NAS to the PolSAR classification. A PolSAR-tailored search space and an improved one-shot search strategy are equipped with the proposed method. By PDAS the architecture (corresponds to the hyperparameter but not the topology) parameters can be optimized with high efficiency by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The optimized architecture parameters should be transformed into corresponding architecture and retrained to achieve classification. In addition a complex-valued PDAS (CVPDAS) is developed to fit the data form of PolSAR images so as to improve the performance. Experiments on three benchmark data sets show that the architectures obtained by searching have better classification performance than hand-crafted ones.;2020
Critical for the early diagnosis of genetic disorders a Family Health History (FHx) can be collected in several ways including electronic FHx tools which aid easy editing and sharing by linking with other information management portals. The user acceptance of such systems is critical especially among older adults experiencing motor and cognitive issues. This study investigated two types of FHx interfaces standard and Virtual Conversational Agent (VCA) using 30 young (between 18 and 30) and 24 older participants (over 60). Workload usability and performance data were collected. Even though participants required less time to complete three of five tasks on the standard interface the VCA interface performed better in terms of subjective workload and usability. Additionally 67% of the older adults preferred the VCA interface since it provided context-based guidance during the data collection process. The results from this study have implications for the use of virtual assistants in FHx and other areas of data collection.;2020
Cultural competence - i.e. the capability to adapt verbal and non-verbal interaction to the user's cultural background - may be a key element for social robots to increase the user experience. However designing and implementing culturally competent social robots is a complex task given that advanced conversational skills are required. In this context Cloud services may be useful for helping robots in generating appropriate interaction patterns in a culture-aware manner. In this letter we present the design and the implementation of the CARESSES Cloud a set of robotic services aimed at endowing robots with cultural competence in verbal interaction. A preliminary evaluation of the Cloud services as a general dialoguing system for culture-aware social robots has been performed analyzing the feasibility of the architecture in terms of communication and data processing delays.;2020
Cultural heritage is an important resource that allows us to know and promote a territory. In this respect it is important to experiment with the enhancement of cultural heritage by adopting approaches that meet the dynamic needs of various types of users. The aim of this paper is to introduce a recommender system capable of developing adaptive tourist routes. In fact the proposed system suggests points of interest and related services according to both the profile of the tourist and contextual aspects. In particular the interaction of the user with the system occurs through a chatbot that allows to build a real dialog. In order to show the potential of the proposed approach a prototype was developed to support the user in building a customized tourist route related to some of the most important cultural sites in Campania (a region in Southern Italy): Herculaneum Paestum and Pompeii.

Currently online retailers evaluate whether chatbots-software programs that interact with users using natural languages-could improve their customers' satisfaction. In a retail context chatbots allow humans to pose shopping-related questions and receive answers in natural language without waiting for a salesperson or using other automated communication forms. However until now it has been unclear which customers accept this new communication form and which factors determine their acceptance. In this paper we contrast the well-known technology acceptance model (TAM) with the lesser known uses and gratifications (U&G) theory applying both approaches to measure the acceptance of the text-based Emma chatbot by its target segment. Emma was developed for the prepurchase phase of online fashion retailing and integrated into Facebook Messenger by the major German online retailer Zalando. Data were collected from 205 German Millennial respondents in a usability study. The results show that both utilitarian factors such as authenticity of conversation and perceived usefulness as well as hedonic factors such as perceived enjoyment positively influence the acceptance of Emma. However privacy concerns and the immaturity of the technology had a negative effect on usage intention and frequency. The predictive power of both models was similar showing little deviation but U&G gives alternative insights into the customers' motivation to use Emma compared to the TAM.;2020
Currently there are many types of conversational agents whose goal is to emulate human behavior. These agents offer more believable conversations when their responses come from a deliberative process that mimics individuals' character. Conversational agents are mainly used for response selection linguistics and context situated strategies. These approaches usually build rules to find answers in dialogues however this is not the best alternative when the communicative intentions are not literal and context dependent. Deliberative Agents can solve these issues and improve their selection process through the integration of preferences and personality in their cognitive process. Hence this work investigates how to drive the expression of dialogues of a Conversational Deliberative Agent (CDA) through personality and fuzzy outranking relations for this it proposes the characterization of context and corpus through speech acts theory and also a selection process based on fuzzy outranking relations to compare corpus phrases and context to choose the best response. The main contributions of this work are (1) the agent architecture that integrates preferences and personality of an individual in the response selection cognitive process (2) a characterization model of speech acting through criteria based on belief desires and intentions to define a more human behavior expression and (3) the use of fuzzy outranking relations to select phrases from a corpus to match dialogue intentions. An experimental design demonstrated the aptitude of the developed CDA to offer quality responses on a tutor application. Also the results showed the capacity of speech acts to handle contexts in dialogues.;2020
Cutting-edge visualization and interaction technologies are increasingly used in museum exhibitions providing novel ways to engage visitors and enhance their cultural experience. Existing applications are commonly built upon a single technology focusing on visualization motion or verbal interaction (e.g. high-resolution projections gesture interfaces chatbots). This aspect limits their potential since museums are highly heterogeneous in terms of visitors profiles and interests requiring multi-channel customizable interaction modalities. To this aim this work describes and evaluates an artificial intelligence powered interactive holographic stand aimed at describing Leonardo Da Vinci's art. This system provides the users with accurate 3D representations of Leonardo's machines which can be interactively manipulated through a touchless user interface. It is also able to dialog with the users in natural language about Leonardo's art while keeping the context of conversation and interactions. Furthermore the results of a large user study carried out during art and tech exhibitions are presented and discussed. The goal was to assess how users of different ages and interests perceive understand and explore cultural objects when holograms and artificial intelligence are used as instruments of knowledge and analysis.

Developing a dialogue response generation system is one of important topics in natural language processing but many obstacles are yet to be overcome before autogenerated dialogues with a human-like quality can become possible. A good evaluation method will help narrow the gap between machines and humans in dialogue generation. Unfortunately the existing automatic evaluation methods are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgments of response quality. Such methods are incapable of assessing whether a dialogue response generation system can produce high-quality knowledge-related and informative dialogues. In response to this challenge we design an information-oriented framework to simulate human subjective evaluation. Using this framework we implement a learning-based metric to evaluate the quality of a dialogue. An experimental validation demonstrates our proposed metric's effectiveness in dialogue selection and model evaluation on a Twitter dataset (in English) and a Weibo dataset (in Chinese). In addition the metric is more relevant than the existing methods of dialogue evaluation to human subjective judgment.;2020
Development of conversational systems is one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing and it is especially hard in the case of open-domain dialogue. The main factors that hinder progress in this area are lack of training data and difficulty of automatic evaluation. Thus to reliably evaluate the quality of such models one needs to resort to time-consuming and expensive human evaluation. We tackle these problems by organizing the Conversational Intelligence Challenge (ConvAI) - open competition of dialogue systems. Our goals are threefold: to work out a good design for human evaluation of open-domain dialogue to grow open-source code base for conversational systems and to harvest and publish new datasets. Over the course of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions we developed a framework for evaluation of chatbots in messaging platforms and used it to evaluate over 30 dialogue systems in two conversational tasks - discussion of short text snippets from Wikipedia and personalized small talk. These large-scale evaluation experiments were performed by recruiting volunteers as well as paid workers. As a result we succeeded in collecting a dataset of around 5000 long meaningful human-to-bot dialogues and got many insights into the organization of human evaluation. This dataset can be used to train an automatic evaluation model or to improve the quality of dialogue systans. Our analysis of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions shows that the future work in this area should be centered around the more active participation of volunteers in the assessment of dialogue systems. To achieve that we plan to make the evaluation setup more engaging.;2020
Dialogue is a very active area o f research currently both in developing new computational techniques for robust dialogue systems and in the active fielding of commercial conversational assistants such as Apple's Sin and Amazon's Alexa. This article argues that while current techniques can be used to design effective dialogue-based systems for very simple tasks they are unlikely to generalize to conversational interfaces that enhance human ability to solve complex tasks by interacting with artificial intelligence reasoning and modeling systems. We explore some of the challenges of tackling such complex tasks and describe a dialogue model designed to meet these challenges. We illustrate our approach with examples of several implemented systems that use this framework.;2020
Dialogue management plays a vital role in task-oriented dialogue systems which has become an active area of research in recent years. Despite the promising results brought from deep reinforcement learning most of the studies need to develop a manual user simulator additionally. To address the time-consuming development of simulator policy we propose a multi-agent dialogue model where an end-to-end dialogue manager and a user simulator are optimized simultaneously. Different from prior work we optimize the two-agents from scratch and apply the reward shaping technology based on adjacency pairs constraints in conversational analysis to speed up learning and to avoid the derivation from normal human-human conversation. In addition we generalize the one-to-one learning strategy to one-to-many learning strategy where a dialogue manager can be concurrently optimized with various user simulators to improve the performance of trained dialogue manager. The experimental results show that one-to-one agents trained with adjacency pairs constraints can converge faster and avoid derivation. In cross-model evaluation with human users involved the dialogue manager trained in one-to-many strategy achieves the best performance.;2020
Dialogue systems have achieved growing success in many areas thanks to the rapid advances of machine learning techniques. In the quest for generating more human-like conversations one of the major challenges is to learn to generate responses in a more empathetic manner. In this review article we focus on the literature of empathetic dialogue systems whose goal is to enhance the perception and expression of emotional states personal preference and knowledge. Accordingly we identify three key features that underpin such systems: emotion-awareness personality-awareness and knowledge-accessibility. The main goal of this review is to serve as a comprehensive guide to research and development on empathetic dialogue systems and to suggest future directions in this domain.;2020
Dialogue-based systems often consist of several components such as communication analysis dialogue management domain reasoning and language generation. In this paper we present Converness an ontology-driven rule-based framework to facilitate domain reasoning for conversational awareness in multimodal dialogue-based agents. Converness uses Web Ontology Language 2 (OWL 2) ontologies to capture and combine the conversational modalities of the domain for example deictic gestures and spoken utterances fuelling conversational topic understanding and interpretation using description logics and rules. At the same time defeasible rules are used to couple domain and user-centred knowledge to further assist the interaction with end users facilitating advanced conflict resolution and personalised context disambiguation. We illustrate the capabilities of the framework through its integration into a multimodal dialogue-based agent that serves as an intelligent interface between users (elderly caregivers and health experts) and an ambient assistive living platform in real home settings.;2020
Digital and agile companies widely use chatbots in the form of integrations into enterprise messengers such as Slack and Microsoft Teams. However there is a lack of empirical evidence about their action possibilities (i.e. affordances) for example to link social interactions with third-party systems and processes. Therefore we adopt a three-stage process. Grounded in a preliminary study and a qualitative study with 29 interviews from 17 organizations we inductively derive rich contextual insights of 14 affordances and constraints which serve as input for a Q-Methodology study that highlights five perceptional differences. We find that actualizing these affordances leads to higher-level affordances of chatbots that augment social information systems with affordances of traditional enterprise systems. Crossing the chasm between these so far detached systems contributes a novel perspective on how to balance novel digital with traditional systems flexibility and malleability with stability and control exploration with exploitation and agility with discipline.;2020
Digital Assistants (DA) such as Amazon Alexa Siri or Google Assistant are now gaining great diffusion since they allow users to execute a wide range of actions through messages in natural language. Even though DAs are able to complete tasks such as sending texts making phone calls or playing songs they do not yet implement recommendation facilities. In this paper we investigate the combination of Digital Assistants and Conversational Recommender Systems (CoRSs) by designing and implementing a framework named ConveRSE (Conversational Recommender System framEwork) for building chatbots that can recommend items from different domains and interact with the user through natural language. Since a CoRS architecture is generally composed of different elements we performed an in-vitro experiment with two synthetic datasets to investigate the impact that each component has on the CoRS in terms of recommendation accuracy. Additionally an in-vivo experiment was carried out to understand how natural language influences both the cost of interaction and recommendation accuracy of a CoRS. Experimental results have revealed the most critical components in a CoRS architecture especially in cold-start situations and the main issues of the natural-language-based interaction. All the dialogues have been collected in a public available dataset.;2020
Digital assistants engage with us with increasingly human-like conversations including the expression of human emotions with such utterances asI am sorry horizontal ellipsis  I hope you enjoy horizontal ellipsis  I am grateful horizontal ellipsis  or I regret that horizontal ellipsis . By 2021 digital assistants will outnumber humans. No one seems to stop to ask if creating more digital companions that appear increasingly human is really beneficial to the future of our species. In this essay we pose the question:How human should computer-based human-likeness appear?We rely on the philosophy of humanness and the theory of speech acts to consider the long-term consequences of living with digital creatures that express human-like feelings. We argue that feelings are the very substance of our humanness and therefore are best reserved forhumaninteraction.;2020
Digital health tools and technologies are transforming health care and making significant impacts on how health and care information are collected used and shared to achieve best outcomes. As most of the efforts are still focused on clinical settings the wealth of health information generated outside of clinical settings is not being fully tapped. This is especially true for children with medical complexity (CMC) and their families as they frequently spend significant hours providing hands-on medical care within the home setting and coordinating activities among multiple providers and other caregivers. In this paper a multidisciplinary team of stakeholders discusses the value of health information generated at home how technology can enhance care coordination and challenges of technology adoption from a patient-centered perspective. Voice interactive technology has been identified to have the potential to transform care coordination for CMC. This paper shares opinions on the promises limitations recommended approaches and challenges of adopting voice technology in health care especially for the targeted patient population of CMC.;2020
Digital records from chat transcripts to social media posts are being used to create chatbots that recreate the conversational style of deceased individuals. Some maintain that this is merely a new form of digital memorial while others argue that they pose a variety of moral hazards. To resolve this I turn to classical Chinese philosophy to make use of a debate over the ethics of funerals and mourning. This ancient argument includes much of interest for the contemporary issue at hand including the use of impersonators of the dead to help the bereaved to deal well with their grief. I connect this historical discussion with a modern trend in clinical psychology that reframes therapeutic interventions with bereaved individuals. The trend directs practitioners away from facilitating detachment and toward affirming continuing bonds. I conclude that these chatbots can offer an important source of support to mourners but also discuss parameters and features of social context that will be important to avoid the moral hazards identified by sceptics.;2020
Distributed intelligent systems (DIS) appear where natural intelligence agents (humans) and artificial intelligence agents (algorithms) interact exchanging data and decisions and learning how to evolve toward a better quality of solutions. The networked dynamics of distributed natural and artificial intelligence agents leads to emerging complexity different from the ones observed before. In this study we review and systematize different approaches in the distributed intelligence field including the quantum domain. A definition and mathematical model of DIS (as a new class of systems) and its components including a general model of DIS dynamics are introduced. In particular the suggested new model of DIS contains both natural (humans) and artificial (computer programs chatbots etc.) intelligence agents which take into account their interactions and communications. We present the case study of domain-oriented DIS based on different agents' classes and show that DIS dynamics shows complexity effects observed in other well-studied complex systems. We examine our model by means of the platform of personal self-adaptive educational assistants (avatars) especially designed in our University. Avatars interact with each other and with their owners. Our experiment allows finding an answer to the vital question: How quickly will DIS adapt to owners' preferences so that they are satisfied? We introduce and examine in detail learning time as a function of network topology. We have shown that DIS has an intrinsic source of complexity that needs to be addressed while developing predictable and trustworthy systems of natural and artificial intelligence agents. Remarkably our research and findings promoted the improvement of the educational process at our university in the presence of COVID-19 pandemic conditions.;2020
Due to the advance of indoor positioning technology it is now possible to trace mobile medical equipment (such as electrocardiography machines patient monitors and so on) being moved around a hospital ward. With the support of an object tracking system nurses can easily locate and find a device especially when they prepare for a shift change or a medical treatment. As nurses usually face high workloads it is highly desirable to provide nurses with a user-friendly search interface integrated into a popular mobile app that they use daily. For this DBOS a dialog-based object query system is proposed which simulates a real conversation with users via the Line messaging app's chatbot interface. A hybrid method that combines cosine similarity (CS) and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is used to determine user intent. The result is returned to the user through Line's interface. To evaluate the applicability of DBOS 70 search queries given by a head nurse were tested. DBOS was compared with CS TF-IDF and Facebook Wit.ai respectively. The experiment results show that DBOS outperforms the abovementioned methods and can achieve a 92.8% accuracy in identifying user intent.;2020
During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic cardiologists have attempted to minimize risks to their patients by using telehealth to provide continuing care. Rapid implementation of video consultations in outpatient clinics for patients with heart disease can be challenging. We employed a design thinking tool called a customer journey to explore challenges and opportunities when using video communication software in the cardiology department of a regional hospital. Interviews were conducted with 5 patients with implanted devices a nurse an information technology manager and two cardiologists. Three lessons were identified based on these challenges and opportunities. Attention should be given to the ease of use of the technology the meeting features and the establishment of the connection between the cardiologist and the patient. Further facilitating the role of an assistant (or virtual assistant) with the video consultation software who can manage the telehealth process may improve the success of video consultations. Employing design thinking to implement video consultations in cardiology and to further implement telehealth is crucial to build a resilient health care system that can address urgent needs beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.;2020
E-Learning has become more and more popular in recent years with the advance of new technologies. Using their mobile devices people can expand their knowledge anytime and anywhere. E-Learning also makes it possible for people to manage their learning progression freely and follow their own learning style. However studies show that E-Learning can cause the user to experience feelings of isolation and detachment due to the lack of human-like interactions in most E-Learning platforms. These feelings could reduce the user & x2019s motivation to learn. In this paper we explore and evaluate how well current chatbot technologies assist users & x2019 learning on E-Learning platforms and how these technologies could possibly reduce problems such as feelings of isolation and detachment. For evaluation we specifically designed a chatbot to be an E-Learning assistant. The NLP core of our chatbot is based on two different models: a retrieval-based model and a QANet model. We designed this two-model hybrid chatbot to be used alongside an E-Learning platform. The core response context of our chatbot is not only designed with course materials in mind but also everyday conversation and chitchat which make it feel more like a human companion. Experiment and questionnaire evaluation results show that chatbots could be helpful in learning and could potentially reduce E-Learning users & x2019 feelings of isolation and detachment. Our chatbot also performed better than the teacher counselling service in the E-Learning platform on which the chatbot is based.;2020
Embodied conversational agents may be used to engage users in adopting eHealth applications. The aim of this research is to investigate which design features establish a positive first impression of an agent in this context. A set of eight static agent images different in age gender and role were subjected to testing in an online questionnaire. Respondents (n = 155) selected their preferred design and rated the characteristics - friendliness expertise reliability involvement and authority - and the likeliness of following the agent's advice for all designs. In addition focus groups (n = 13) were conducted for detailed understandings supporting these impressions. Our results show that for both a general and elderly population (1) people seem to prefer images of young female agents over old male agents (2) the (a) age (b) gender and (c) role of the agent image affect the perception of the agent's characteristics and the likeliness of following the agent's advice and that (3) both the general and elderly population prefer an agent image that is similar in (a) age and (b) gender. A next step would be to investigate how the characteristics of the agent designs are perceived after interaction with the agent.;2020
Emotion detection is a hot topic nowadays for its potential application to intelligent systems in different fields such as neuromarketing dialogue systems friendly robotics vending platforms and amiable banking. Nevertheless the lack of a benchmarking standard makes it difficult to compare results produced by different methodologies which could help the research community improve existing approaches and design new ones. Besides there is the added problem of accurate dataset production. Most of the emotional speech databases and associated documentation are either privative or not publicly available. Therefore in this work two stress-elicited databases containing speech from male and female speakers were recruited and four classification methods are compared in order to detect and classify speech under stress. Results from each method are presented to show their quality performance besides the final scores attained in what is a novel approach to the field of study.;2020
Emotion intelligence plays an important role in building a successful human-machine dialogue system. However the extreme difficulty of capturing emotional information of social text as well as the weakness of generative models for learning emotional expression limits the performance of existing dialogue system. Combining dictionary matching and machine learning this paper proposes a generative model which fuses the word- and sentence-level emotions to model the dialogue text and learn emotional expression. The model first obtains the emotional embedding of each word through dictionary matching then concatenates the emotional word embedding with its traditional word embedding and the finally formed vector is taken as the input of the encoder. In order to control the emotional feature of the generated response our model employs a BernoulliNB-based classifier to extract the emotional feature of the post which is used as the attribute of the original text and subsequently adds it to the decoder. For further significantly improving the emotional expression of the response the model leverages a discriminator to constrain the latent variable which enables the latent variable to encode better the information of emotional feature of the post. With this model we can generate the dialogue text that is consistent with the original emotion. Experimental results on our Twitter dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the emotion accuracy and quality of generated texts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Empathy is a complex socio-emotional behavior that results from the interaction between affective and cognitive mechanisms. Equipping embodied conversational agents (ECAs) with empathic capacity can benefit from the integration and evaluation of these low and high level capabilities in a hierarchical manner. Following the theoretical background on empathic behavior in humans this paper presents a framework to equip ECAs with real time multi-modal empathic interaction capabilities. We present the implementation of this framework which includes basic dialogue capabilities as well as three levels of empathic behavior in a conversational scenario. Our approach is an inclusive stand on modeling levels of empathy and provides a baseline behavior for empathic interaction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2020
End-to-end neural-based dialogue systems can potentially generate tailored and coherent responses for user inputs. However most of existing systems produce universal and non-informative responses and they have not gone beyond chitchat yet. To tackle these problems 7th Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC7-Track2) was developed to focus on building a dialogue system that produces informational responses that are grounded on external knowledge. In this study we propose a Memory-augmented Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder called MHRED that grounded on both multi-turn dialogue context and external knowledge. Furthermore we apply a combination of multiple dialogue systems. Our final system is an ensemble that combines three modules: a generation-based module a retrieval-based module and a reranking module. First responses are generated by MHRED and retrieved from a pre-defined database focusing on informativeness. Next the reranking module sorts these candidates using several hand-crafted features and finally it selects a response with the highest score. Therefore this system can return diverse and meaningful responses from various perspectives. Experimental results show that our proposed MHRED outperforms strong baseline models and combining multiple dialogue systems significantly improves the automatic evaluation and human evaluations.

End-to-end task-oriented dialog systems have attracted vast amounts of attention in recent years mainly because of their ease of training. However such an end-to-end model requires a large number of labeled dialogs to train. Labeled dialogs are always difficult to obtain in real-world settings. We propose a domain adaptive end-to-end task-oriented dialog model that transfers knowledge in source domains to a target domain with limited training samples. Specifically we design a domain adaptive filter in the encoder-decoder model to reduce useless features in source domains and preserve common features. A domain adaptive amplifier is designed to enhance the target domain impact. We evaluate our method on both synthetic dialog and human-human dialog datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results.;2020
Entrainment is the tendency of interlocutors to become more similar to each other in their way of speaking. This phenomenon has been repeatedly documented and is associated with multiple social aspects of human-human conversations. However there is a dearth of research on the effects of spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) with implemented acoustic-prosodic (dis)entrainment policies. The goal of the present work is to provide further empirical evidence on how acoustic-prosodic (dis)entraining policies affect users. In particular this article fo-cuses on its effects on users' trust toward the SDSs. In the experiments reported here we analyze if and how different acoustic-prosodic (dis)entrainment policies affect users' perception of a system's ability. We collected data from 98 unique participants all native speakers of Argentine Spanish. Our results suggest that acoustic prosodic (dis)entrainment in spoken dialogue systems is effectively associated with the way users perceive the capabilities of such systems. Characterizing these effects remains a challenging task. Overall we observe a positive effect on trust of entrainment on intensity and a negative effect of entrainment on pitch. Estimated effect sizes are far from negligible.;2020
External keywords are crucial for response generation models to address the generic response problems in open-domain conversational systems. The occurrence of keywords in a response depends heavily on the order of the keywords as they are generated sequentially. Meanwhile the order of keywords also affects the semantics of a response. Previous keywords based methods mainly focus on the composite of keywords while the order of keywords has not been sufficiently discussed. In this work we propose an order-sensitive keywords based model to explore the influence of the order of keywords in open-domain response generation. It automatically inferences the most suitable order that is optimized to generate a natural and relevant response and subsequently generates the response using the ordered keywords as building blocks. We conducted experiments on a public Twitter dataset and the results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic and human evaluations.;2020
Eye typing is a hands-free method of human computer interaction which is especially useful for people with upper limb disabilities. Users select a desired key by gazing at it in an image of a keyboard for a fixed dwell time. There is a tradeoff in selecting the dwell time shorter dwell times lead to errors due to unintentional selections while longer dwell times lead to a slow input speed. We propose to speed up eye typing while maintaining low error by dynamically adjusting the dwell time for each letter based on the past input history. More likely letters are assigned shorter dwell times. Our method is based on a probabilistic generative model of gaze which enables us to assign dwell times using a principled model that requires only a few free parameters. We evaluate our model on both able-bodied subjects and subjects with a spinal cord injury (SCI). Compared to the standard dwell time method we find consistent increases in typing speed in both cases. e.g. 41.8% faster typing for able-bodied subjects on a transcription task and 49.5% faster typing for SCI subjects in a chatbot task. We observed more inter-subject variability for SCI subjects.;2020
Family health history (FHx) is one of the simplest and most cost-effective and efficient ways to collect health information that could help diagnose and treat genetic diseases at an early stage. This study evaluated the efficacy of collecting such family health histories through a virtual conversational agent (VCA) interface a new method for collecting this information. Standard and VCA interfaces for FHx collection were investigated with 50 participants recruited via email and word of mouth using a within-subject experimental design with the order of the interfaces randomized and counterbalanced. Interface workload usability preference and satisfaction were assessed using the NASA Task Load Index workload instrument the IBM Computer System Usability Questionnaire and a brief questionnaire derived from the Technology Acceptance Model. The researchers also recorded the number of errors and the total task completion time. It was found that the completion times for 2 of the 5 tasks were shorter for the VCA interface than for the standard one but the overall completion time was longer (17 min 44 s vs. 16 min 51 s p = .019). We also found the overall workload to be significantly lower (34.32 vs. 42.64 p = .003) for the VCA interface and usability metrics including overall satisfaction (5.62 vs. 4.72 p < .001) system usefulness (5.76 vs. 4.84 p = .001) information quality (5.43 vs. 4.62 p < .001) and interface quality (5.66 vs. 4.64 p < .001) to be significantly higher for this interface as well. Approximately 3 out of 4 participants preferred the VCA interface to the standard one. Although the overall time taken was slightly longer than with standard interface the VCA interface was rated significantly better across all other measures and was preferred by the participants. These findings demonstrate the advantages of an innovative VCA interface for collecting FHx validating the efficacy of using VCAs to collect complex patient-specific data in health care.;2020
Featured Application Core technology for intelligent virtual assistants. Abstract A conversation is based on internal knowledge that the participants already know or external knowledge that they have gained during the conversation. A chatbot that communicates with humans by using its internal and external knowledge is called a knowledge-grounded chatbot. Although previous studies on knowledge-grounded chatbots have achieved reasonable performance they may still generate unsuitable responses that are not associated with the given knowledge. To address this problem we propose a knowledge-grounded chatbot model that effectively reflects the dialogue context and given knowledge by using well-designed attention mechanisms. The proposed model uses three kinds of attention: Query-context attention query-knowledge attention and context-knowledge attention. In our experiments with the Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset the proposed model showed better performances than the state-of-the-art model in a variety of measures.;2020
Firms are deploying chatbots to automate customer service. However miscommunication is a frequent occurrence in human-chatbot interaction. This study investigates the relationship between miscommunication and adoption for customer service chatbots. Anthropomorphism is tested as an account for the relationship. Two experiments compare the perceived humanness and adoption scores for (a) an error-free chatbot (b) a chatbot seeking clarification regarding a consumer input and (c) a chatbot which fails to discern context. The results suggest that unresolved errors are sufficient to reduce anthropomorphism and adoption intent. However there is no perceptual difference between an error-free chatbot and one which seeks clarification. The ability to resolve miscommunication (clarification) appears as effective as avoiding it (error-free). Furthermore the higher a consumer's need for human interaction the stronger the anthropomorphism - adoption relationship. Thus anthropomorphic chatbots may satisfy the social desires of consumers high in need for human interaction.;2020
Following the outbreak of what would become the COVID-19 pandemic social distancing measures were quickly introduced across East Asia-including drastic shelter-in-place orders in some cities-drawing on experience with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) almost two decades ago. Smart City technologies and other digital tools were quickly deployed for infection control purposes ranging from conventional thermal scanning cameras to digital tracing in the surveillance of at-risk individuals. Chatbots endowed with artificial intelligence have also been deployed to shift part of healthcare provision away from hospitals and to support a number of programmes for self-management of chronic disease in the community. With the closure of schools and adults working from home digital technologies have also sustained many aspects of both professional and social life at a pace and scale not considered to be practicable before the outbreak. This paper considers how these new experiences with digital technologies in public health surveillance are spurring digitalization in East Asian societies beyond the conventional public health context. It also considers some of the concerns and challenges that are likely to arise with rapid digitalization particularly in healthcare.;2020
From past research it is well known that social exclusion has detrimental consequences for mental health. To deal with these adverse effects socially excluded individuals frequently turn to other humans for emotional support. While chatbots can elicit social and emotional responses on the part of the human interlocutor their effectiveness in the context of social exclusion has not been investigated. In the present study we examined whether an empathic chatbot can serve as a buffer against the adverse effects of social ostracism. After experiencing exclusion on social media participants were randomly assigned to either talk with an empathetic chatbot about it (e.g. I'm sorry that this happened to you) or a control condition where their responses were merely acknowledged (e.g. Thank you for your feedback). Replicating previous research results revealed that experiences of social exclusion dampened the mood of participants. Interacting with an empathetic chatbot however appeared to have a mitigating impact. In particular participants in the chatbot intervention condition reported higher mood than those in the control condition. Theoretical methodological and practical implications as well as directions for future research are discussed.;2020
Generating response with both coherence and diversity is a challenging task in generation-based chatbots. It is more difficult to improve the coherence and diversity of dialog generation at the same time in the response generation model. In this article we propose an improved method that improves the coherence and diversity of dialog generation by changing the model to use gamma sampling and adding attention mechanism to the knowledge-guided conditional variational autoencoder. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the coherence and diversity of knowledge-guided conditional variational autoencoder for response generation in generation-based chatbots at the same time.;2020
How authentic are inquiry calls made by simulated clients or 'mystery shoppers' to service organizations when compared to real callers? We analysed 48 simulated and 63 real inquiry calls to different veterinary practices in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The data were transcribed for conversation analysis as well as coded for a variety of call categories including reason for the call call outcome and turn design features. Analysis revealed systematic differences between real and simulated calls in terms of (1) reasons for the call call outcome and call duration and (2) how callers refer to their pets in service requests and follow-up questions about their animal. Our qualitative analyses were supported with statistical summaries and tests. The findings reveal the limitations of mystery shopper methodology for the assessment of service provision. We also discuss the implications of the findings for the use of simulated encounters and the development of conversational agents.;2020
Human-computer conversation is an active research topic in natural language processing. One of the representative methods to build conversation systems uses the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) model through neural networks. However with limited input information the Seq2seq model tends to generate meaningless and trivial responses. It can be greatly enhanced if more supplementary information is provided in the generation process. In this work we propose to utilize retrieved responses to boost the Seq2seq model for generating more informative replies. Our method called ReBoost incorporates retrieved results in the Seq2seq model by a hierarchical structure. The input message and retrieved results can influence the generation process jointly. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model is able to generate more informative responses in both automatic and human evaluations and outperforms the state-of-the-art response generation models.;2020
Human-machine addressee detection (H-M AD) is a modern paralinguistics and dialogue challenge that arises in multiparty conversations between several people and a spoken dialogue system (SDS) since the users may also talk to each other and even to themselves while interacting with the system. The SDS is supposed to determine whether it is being addressed or not. All existing studies on acoustic H-M AD were conducted on corpora designed in such a way that a human addressee and a machine played different dialogue roles. This peculiarity influences speakers' behaviour and increases vocal differences between human- and machine-directed utterances. In the present study we consider the Restaurant Booking Corpus (RBC) that consists of complexity-identical human- and machine-directed phone calls and allows us to eliminate most of the factors influencing speakers' behaviour implicitly. The only remaining factor is the speakers' explicit awareness of their interlocutor (technical system or human being). Although complexity-identical H-M AD is essentially more challenging than the classical one we managed to achieve significant improvements using data augmentation (unweighted average recall (UAR) = 0.628) over native listeners (UAR = 0.596) and a baseline classifier presented by the RBC developers (UAR = 0.539).;2020
Imagine walking into a department store to shop for various products. Based on the social heuristics related to expertise you would likely favor and trust the advice conveyed by a product specialist dedicated to his/her product base than by a generalist advisor who opines on all product categories. As per the computers are social actors theory this effect should also apply to people's interaction with embodied conversational agents simulating product advisors in a multi-product category e-commerce. This study evaluated the effects of specialist agent design using surfaces cues that were 1) agents' self-introduction as product specialists and 2) agents' assignment to dedicated product categories in a multi-product category e-commerce website. An experiment (n = 122) was conducted to compare the effects of the specialist agent design against the conventional generalist agent design where one agent advised on all product categories. Consistent with source credibility theory and multiple source effect theory the results demonstrated that specialist agent design increased the perceived agent's expertise message trustworthiness social presence website trust and purchase intention. Further mediation analyses revealed that perceived agent's expertise and message trustworthiness mediated the effects of specialist agent design on purchase intention thus affirming the source credibility model. As predicted by multiple source theory the implementation of multiple agents in the specialist agent design prompted a higher social presence which was found to be a mediating factor that led to higher perceived website trust ability and benevolence. Finally the effects of specialist agent design on purchase intentions were also mediated by perceived website trust ability and benevolence. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in this paper.;2020
In dialogue speakers produce and perceive acoustic/prosodic turn-taking cues which are fundamental for negotiating turn exchanges with their interlocutors. However little of the temporal dynamics and cross-linguistic validity of these cues is known. In this work we explore a set of acoustic/prosodic cues preceding three turn-ransition types (hold switch and backchannel) in three different languages (Slovak American English and Argentine Spanish). For this we use and refine a set of machine learning techniques that enable a finer-grained temporal analysis of such cues as well as a comparison of their relative explanatory power. Our results suggest that the three languages despite belonging to distinct linguistic families share the general usage of a handful of acoustic/prosodic features to signal turn transitions. We conclude that exploiting features such as speech rate final-word lengthening the pitch track over the final 200 ms the intensity track over the final 1000 ms and noise-to-harmonics ratio (a voice-quality feature) might prove useful for further improving the accuracy of the turn-taking modules found in modern spoken dialogue systems.;2020
IN MARCH 2011 the catastrophic accident known as The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster took place initiated by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The only nuclear accident to receive a Level-7 classification on the International Nuclear Event Scale since the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in 1986 the Fukushima event triggered global concerns and rumors regarding radiation leaks. Among the false rumors was an image which had been described as a map of radioactive discharge emanating into the Pacific Ocean as illustrated in the accompanying figure. In fact this figure depicting the wave height of the tsunami that followed still to this date circulates on social media with the inaccurate description. Social media is ideal for spreading rumors because it lacks censorship. Confirmation bias and filter-bubble effects further amplify the spread of unconfirmed information. Upon public outcry independent fact-checking organizations have emerged globally and many platforms are making efforts to fight against fake news. For example the state-run Factually website in Singapore has been known to clarify falsehoods since its inception in May 2012 which was followed recently by the implementation of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) in October 2019. In Taiwan the government officially created a feature on the website of the Executive Yuan (the executive branch of Taiwan's government) to identify erroneous reporting and combat the spread of fake news. Taiwan's Open Culture Foundation has also developed and introduced the well-known anti-fake fact-checking chatbot Cofacts in May 2018. The Indonesia government since 2018 has held weekly briefings on hoax news that same year the country revised its Criminal Code to permit the imprisonment for up to six years of anyone spreading fake news. Governments in the Asia and Oceania region including South Korea Singapore Japan Taiwan Philippines Cambodia Malaysia have enacted relevant laws to prevent fake news from spreading. Nonetheless fact-checking of fake news remains daunting and requires tremendous time and effort in terms of human investigation. Moreover it is prone to low efficiency and inadequate coverage due to the complexity of the topics being checked and is incapable of keeping up with the fast production and diffusion of falsehoods online. This article will review some of the latest techniques to automatically debunk fake news many of which were initiated in the Asia and Oceania region.;2020
In order to realize real-time marriage legal consultation automatically a marriage legal dialogue system based on the parallel C4.5 decision tree was designed in this paper. Firstly the legal consultation problem is transformed into a classification task. Secondly a legal consultation classification prediction model based on the parallel C4.5 decision tree algorithm was trained with MapReduce by collected data. Finally a model based on the SVM algorithm which has a strategy that was designed to provide automatic interaction for users was designed to extract attribute value from the user's input. When a new user comes to consult an automatic legal dialogue is launched to respond to user intelligently. The proposed system works well in some real applications such as the divorce problem and the experimental results show that it is outperforming the SVM and NB algorithm and more applicable than the other two algorithms. Moreover the system can return consultation results with fewer questions asked to the user than some automatic legal consultation websites which improves the efficiency of consultation.;2020
In recent decades many researchers pay a lot of attention on generating informative responses in end-to-end neural dialogue systems. In order to output the responses with knowledge and fact many works leverage external knowledge to guide the process of response generation. However human dialogue is not a simple sequence to sequence task but a process heavily relying on their background knowledge about the topic. Thus the key of generating informative responses is leveraging the appropriate knowledge associated with current topic. This paper focus on addressing incorporating the appropriate knowledge in response generation. We adopt the reinforcement learning to select the most proper knowledge as the input information of the response generation part. Then we design an end-to-end dialogue model consisting of the knowledge decision part and the response generation part. The proposed model is able to effectively complete the knowledge driven dialogue task with specific topic. Our experiments clearly demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other baselines.;2020
In recent times Electronic Learning (E-Learning) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) are more popular among the current generation of learners. Coursera Edx Simplilearn Byjus and many other E-Learning service providers are available to deliver various courses. A recent study in online courses it has been found by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that an astronomical dropout rate of about 96 per cent was found for the last five years. Educational researchers are attempting to decrease the dropout rate of E-Learning courses using various methods. Human Computer Interface (HCI) researchers are attempting to use Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to increase the efficiency of the E-Learning. Beta waves (14-30 Hz) are generated when the learners are more alert. Neil Fleming & x2019s VARK (Visual Auditory Read and Write and Kinesthetic) questionnaires are used by many researchers to classify the learners. Carl Jung explored that Introverts and Extraverts are the personality traits among the humans. Soomin Kim's study shows that for gathering of quantitative data Chatbot may be a promising method. The proposed research work in this paper is to find out a correlation between Introvert and Extravert personality types and their learning styles. Initially modified VARK questionnaires are implemented as a Chatbot to classify individuals as Introverts or Extraverts. After the classifications by the Chatbot two minutes of visual and auditory contents are given to Introverts and Extraverts and learners' Beta brain waves are recorded and a dataset is created at an interval of one second. The dataset is validated using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms like Naive Bayes N48 and Canopy. The proposed method is found to improve the accuracy of classification of learners. Bio-Inspired learning style Brain Computing Interface (BIL-BCI) framework proposed in this paper is a recommendation system to increase the accuracy of the classification among the E-Learners.;2020
In recent years we have witnessed a surge in machine learning methods that provide machines with conversational abilities. Most notably neural-network-based systems have set the state of the art for difficult tasks such as speech recognition semantic understanding dialogue management language generation and speech synthesis. Still unlike for the ancient game of Go for instance we are far from achieving human-level performance in dialogue. The reasons for this are numerous. One property of human-human dialogue that stands out is the infinite number of possibilities of expressing oneself during the conversation even when the topic of the conversation is restricted. A typical solution to this problem was scaling-up the data. The most prominent mantra in speech and language technology has been There is no data like more data. However the researchers now are focused on building smarter algorithms - algorithms that can learn efficiently from just a few examples. This is an intrinsic property of human behavior: an average human sees during their lifetime a fraction of data that we nowadays present to machines. A human can even have an intuition about a solution before ever experiencing an example solution. The human-inspired ability to adapt may just be one of the keys in pushing dialogue systems toward human performance. This article reviews advancements in dialogue systems research with a focus on the adaptation methods for dialogue modeling and ventures to have a glance at the future of research on adaptable conversational machines.;2020
In recent years teaching machines to ask meaningful and coherent questions has attracted considerable attention in natural language processing. Question generation has found wide applications in areas such as education (testing knowledge) and chatbots (enhancing interaction). Following previous studies on conversational question generation we propose a pretrained encoder-decoder model that can incorporate the semantic information from both passage and hidden conversation representations. We adopt BERT as the encoder to combine external text and dialogue history and we design a multi-head attention-based decoder to incorporate the semantic information from both text and hidden dialogue representations into the decoding process thereby generating coherent questions. Experiments with conversational question generation and document-grounded dialogue response generation tasks indicate that the proposed model is superior to baseline models in terms of both standard metrics and human evaluations.;2020
In recent years we have witnessed a growing adoption of serious games in telerehabilitation by taking advantage of advanced multimedia technologies such as motion capture and virtual reality devices. Current serious game solutions for telerehabilitation suffer form lack of personalization and adaptiveness to patients' needs and performance. This paper introduces RehaBot a framework for adaptive generation of personalized serious games in the context of remote rehabilitation using 3D motion tracking and virtual reality environments. A personalized and versatile gaming platform with embedded virtual assistants called Rehab bots is created. Utilizing these rehab bots all workout session scenes will include a guide with various sets of motions to direct patients towards performing the prescribed exercises correctly. Furthermore the rehab bots employ a robust technique to adjust the workout difficulty level in real-time to match the patients' performance. This technique correlates and matches the patterns of the precalculated motions with patients' motions to produce a highly engaging gamified workout experience. Moreover multimodal insights are passed to the users pointing out the joints that did not perform as anticipated along with suggestions to improve the current performance. A clinical study was conducted on patients dealing with chronic neck pain to prove the usability and effectiveness of our adjunctive online physiotherapy solution. Ten participants used the serious gaming platform while four participants performed the traditional procedure with an active program for neck pain relief for two weeks (10 min 10 sessions/2 weeks). Feasibility and user experience measures were collected and the results of experiments show that patients found our game-based adaptive solution engaging and effective and most of them could achieve high accuracy in performing the personalized prescribed therapies.;2020
In the context of theVASelfCareproject we developed an application prototype of an intelligent anthropomorphic virtual assistant. Designed as a relational agent the virtual assistant has the role of supporting older people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) in medication adherence and lifestyle changes. Our paper has two goals: describing the essentials of this prototype and reporting on usability evaluation. We describe the general architecture of the prototype including the graphical component and focus on its main feature: the incorporation in the way the dialogue flows of Behavior Change Techniques identified through a theoretical framework theBehaviour Change Wheel. Usability was experimentally evaluated in field tests in a purposive sample of 20 participants (11 older adults with T2D and 9 experts). The Portuguese version of the System Usability Scale was employed supplemented with qualitative data from open questions diaries digital notes and telephone follow-ups. The aggregated mean SUS score was 7375 (SD 1331) which corresponds to a borderline rating of excellent. Textual data were content analyzed and will be prioritized to further improve usability.;2020
In the continuous development of the Internet the amount of information storage is getting larger and larger. People's standards for information demand are getting higher and higher. In the face of a large amount of data in the Internet fast and accurate data acquisition has become the most urgent demand at present. At the same time with the deepening of environmental awareness in all walks of life the contradiction between the shortcomings of traditional energy and the requirements of environmental protection becomes more and more obvious. New clean energy has many advantages such as cleanness high efficiency and renewability which has gradually become the main trend of environmental energy development. Therefore based on the development principle of green environmental protection economy environmental protection new energy can be combined with the design of intelligent robot so as to finally design a special clean and environmental protection robot. According to the principle of the construction of Q&A System it used octopus to collect environmental protection knowledge build library and use the Vector Space Model (VSM) for text similarity calculation. Raspberry Pi was used to develop hardware and ultimately a voice chatbot about environmental protection knowledge had been achieved. It can answer the problems of environmental protection knowledge and make environmental knowledge and environmental protection concept deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. It is a contribution to environmental causes.;2020
In the development of commercial promotion chatbot is known as one of significant skill by application of natural language processing (NLP). Conventional design methods are using bag-of-words model (BOW) alone based on Google database and other online corpus. For one thing in the bag-of-words model the vectors are Irrelevant to one another. Even though this method is friendly to discrete features it is not conducive to the machine to understand continuous statements due to the loss of the connection between words in the encoded word vector. For other thing existing methods are used to test in state-of-the-art online corpus but it is hard to apply in real applications such as telemarketing data. In this paper we propose an improved chatbot design way using hybrid bag-of-words model and skip-gram model based on the real telemarketing data. Specifically we first collect the real data in the telemarketing field and perform data cleaning and data classification on the constructed corpus. Second the word representation is adopted hybrid bag-of-words model and skip-gram model. The skip-gram model maps synonyms in the vicinity of vector space. The correlation between words is expressed so the amount of information contained in the word vector is increased making up for the shortcomings caused by using bag-of-words model alone. Third we use the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting method to improve the weight of key words then output the final word expression. At last the answer is produced using hybrid retrieval model and generate model. The retrieval model can accurately answer questions in the field. The generate model can supplement the question of answering the open domain in which the answer to the final reply is completed by long-short term memory (LSTM) training and prediction. Experimental results show which the hybrid word vector expression model can improve the accuracy of the response and the whole system can communicate with humans.;2020
In the past decade public institutions and private entities have launched large campaigns of digitization of cultural artefacts leading to the creation of massive digital collections like Europeana Europe's digital cultural library museum and archive. It offers public access to millions of digital objects from thousands of contributing heritage collections all across the European Union using a multilingual interface built upon the principles of the Semantic Web. However such large digital libraries suffer due to low accessibility for the general public and difficult search and navigation through their items. Intelligent conversational agents have the potential of facilitating user-friendly access to the vast amount of information in the Semantic Web by natural language interaction and by providing structured answers to the user's queries. More recently new technologies additionally fostered the development of intelligent conversational agents for a wide range of applications. Following this approach we propose a solution to improve the accessibility and search accuracy of digital cultural heritage resources from Europeana through a system which integrates artificial intelligence natural language technologies web services and APIs.

In the present study we developed a chatbot that helps teachers to deliver writing instructions. By working with the chatbot the post-secondary writers developed a thesis statement for their argumentative essay outlines and the chatbot helped the writers to refine their peer review feedback. We conducted a preliminary analysis of the effect of a chatbot on these writers' writing achievement. We also collected several student testimonials about their chatbot experiences. Several important pedagogical and research implications for chatbot-guided writing instructions and the use of learning technology have been addressed.;2020
In the spirit of dystopian science fiction this story imagines marketing in a near future. A reader might recognise that there is a relationship between aesthetic forms (stories) and the dramas that play out in society and so although this is fiction it is also about the critical concerns that are emerging in the use of corporate technologies. The story draws from theory that suggests our most intimate relationships are embedded in and create market structures and on theory that accounts for how technology (and especially AI) has significant impact on market practices. Core ideas also reference my previous and ongoing research on the imagination on marketplace relationships and on digital virtual consumption and from previous accounts of AI and market/political systems in speculative fictions. I invite the reader to reflect on the sorts of dominating human-technology-market relationships that may be with us soon and on the risk of perverse instantiations in commercial AI deployment. Overall the tone is critical but themes are also presented as ambiguous recognising the seductive quality of marketing technologies.;2020
In this article three kinds of user effect are considered namely specific anthropomorphic mannequin (SAM) head and personal digital assistants (PDA) hand (talk mode) PDA hand (data mode) and Dual hands (read mode) for the performance study of the compact LTE MIMO antenna. This is in continuation of the previously published work which has been investigated in the free space. However the designed antenna covers LTE700 (0.747-0.787 GHz) and WWAN (1.7-3.04 GHz) based on -6 dB reflection coefficient. Further the effect of users' body is investigated by placing the planar monopole antenna (PMA) on the top and the bottom portion of the mobile printed circuit board (PCB). The performances like S-parameters radiation performances diversity performances and channel capacity loss are studied and optimal location of PMA is assigned either top or bottom portion of mobile phone PCB based on the results obtained from the respective positions. Finally the specific absorption rate is estimated and found well below the standard limit of FCC that is less than 1.6 W/kg over 1 g tissue and European that is 2 W/kg over 10 g tissue. In present work it is observed that top positioned PMA provides optimal performances in the user proximity over PCB.;2020
In this article we present HealthAssistantBot an intelligent virtual assistant able to talk with patients in order to understand their symptomatology suggest doctors and monitor treatments and health parameters. In a simple way by exploiting a natural language-based interaction the system allows the user to create her health profile to describe her symptoms to search for doctors or to simply remember a treatment to follow. Specifically our methodology exploits machine learning techniques to process users symptoms and to automatically infer her diseases. Next the information obtained is used by our recommendation algorithm to identify the nearest doctor who can best treat the user& x2019s condition considering the community data. In the experimental session we evaluated our HealthAssistantBot with both an offline and online evaluation. In the first case we assessed the performance of our internal components while in the second one we carried out a study involving 102 subjects who interacted with the conversational agent in a daily use scenario. Results are encouraging and showed the effectiveness of the strategy in supporting the patients in taking care of their health.;2020
In this paper we introduce a game-based approach for Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) Skills assessment and provide preliminary evidence from a validation pilot study. To date educational assessments have focused more heavily on the concrete and accessible aspects of CPS with a diminished representation of the social aspects of CPS. We addressed this issue through the integration of our CPS construct into the game-based assessment Circuit Runner in which participants interact with a virtual agent to solve a series of challenges in a first-person maze environment (von Davier 2017). Circuit Runner provides an environment that allows for controlled interdependence between a user and a virtual agent that facilitates the demonstration of the broad range of cognitive and social skills required for effective CPS. Tasks are designed to incorporate telemetry-based (e.g. log file clickstream interaction-based) and item response data to provide a more comprehensive measure of CPS skills. Our study included 500 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk who completed Circuit Runner pre- and post-game surveys and a CPS situational judgment test (CPS-SJT). These elements in conjunction with the game-play allowed for an expanded exploration of CPS skills with different modalities and types of instruments. The findings support and extend efforts to provide a stronger theoretical and empirical foundation for insights regarding CPS as a skillset as well as the design of scalable game-based CPS assessments.;2020
In this series we explore technology-related themes and topics. This series aims to discuss and demystify what may be new areas for some readers and to consider their relevance for English language teachers.;2020
In this work we have enhanced the perception of a humanoid robot by integrating it with a social state estimation system. We present a user study of the humanoid Nao robot as a social mediator comprising two sets of experiments. In the first sets of experiments the participants rate their understanding of feedback messages delivered via the Nao robot. They also assess two modalities to deliver the feedback: audio only and audio combined with gestures. In almost all cases there is an improvement of 10% or more when audio and gesture modalities are combined to deliver feedback messages. For the second sets of experiments the sociofeedback system was integrated with the Nao robot. The participants engage in two-person scenario-based conversations while the Nao robot acts as a mediator. The sociofeedback system analyzes the conversations and provides feedback via Nao. Subsequently the participants assess the received sociofeedback with respect to various aspects including its content appropriateness and timing. Participants also evaluate their overall perception of Nao as social mediator via the Godspeed questionnaire. The results indicate that the social feedback system is able to detect the social scenario with 93.8% accuracy and that Nao can be effectively used to provide sociofeedback in discussions. The results of this paper pave the way to natural human-robot interactions for social mediators in multi-party dialog systems.;2020
In this work we present a model for the automatic generation of written dialogues through the use of grammatical inference. This model allows the automatic recognition of grammars from a set dialogues employed as a training set. The inferred grammars are then used to generate templates of responses within the dialogues. The final objective is to apply this model in a specific domain dialogue system that answers questions in Spanish with the use of a knowledge base. The experiments carried out have been performend using the DIHANA project corpus which contains dialogues written in Spanish about schedules and prices of a rail system.;2020
Innovations in the technologies are common and helpful for the visually impaired community. Visually impaired and blind individuals discover challenges in distinguishing barriers and obstacles. They hobble on the road that makes it hazardous. The reason for our responsibility is to offer solace to the visually vitiated individual by giving Hazy Glimpse Crook (HGC). It is a proposed answer for empowering the blind to recognize the world around them. With the assistance of a webcam the picture of an obstacle is taken. After the digital image processed a message will be created. From headphone's help a visually impaired individual can discover the thing present in front of him. Inside the 70 cm scope one ultrasonic sensor is utilized to recognize some other impediments around the client. While inside the scope of 80 cm another sensor is set at the base of the stick. With the help of cautioning messages it tells about puddles and all other obstacles. Additionally from GPS blind's location can be tracked down. As they feel safe by using a stick their average speed increases to twice. HGV (Hazy Glimpse Vision) application is our second part. In application talkback any object recognizing and location of visually impaired can find out. The overall accuracy of Our HGC and HGV is approx. 96.87% in terms of the time required for an image to process.;2020
Intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF) are important components in spoken language understanding (SLU) of a dialogue system. The most widely used method is pipeline manner which detects the user's intent at first then labels the slots. For the purpose of addressing error propagate some researchers combine these two tasks together by ID and SF joint model. However the joint models usually perform well only on one of these tasks due to the different values of the trade-off-parameter. We therefore propose an encoder-decoder model with a new tag scheme which unifies these two tasks into one sequence labeling task. In our model the process of slot filling can receive an intent information and the performance about multiple tags of a word has been improved. Moreover we show a length-variable attention which can selectively look at a subset of source sentence in the sequence labeling model. Experimental results on two datasets display that the proposed model with length-variable attention outperforms over other joint models. Besides our method will automatically find the balance between two tasks and achieve better overall performances. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2020
Interactions with embodied conversational agents can be enhanced using human-like co-speech gestures. Traditionally rule-based co-speech gesture mapping has been utilized for this purpose. However the creation of this mapping is laborious and often requires human experts. Moreover human-created mapping tends to be limited therefore prone to generate repeated gestures. In this article we present an approach to automate the generation of rule-based co-speech gesture mapping from publicly available large video data set without the intervention of human experts. At run-time word embedding is utilized for rule searching to get the semantic-aware meaningful and accurate rule. The evaluation indicated that our method achieved comparable performance with the manual map generated by human experts with a more variety of gestures activated. Moreover synergy effects were observed in users' perception of generated co-speech gestures when combined with the manual map.;2020
Interest and self-efficacy are crucial to academic success. This study addresses two gaps in our understanding of their development and support during university courses: how prior self-efficacy and interest plays a role in and how different classroom activities build toward the development of students' future interest and self-efficacy. In this study the interplay between ability-beliefs (self-efficacy/self-concept) and interest at three levels of specificity (Domain Course and Task) were tested across a Japanese university language course (n = 128). Within this test students' interest in two language practice tasks (i.e. Human and then Chatbot partners) were assessed and compared. Prior interest was a robust predictor of all future task/course interest. Only Human-Human task interest directly predicted future course self-efficacy but was mediated by course interest for future domain interest. For future interest Human practice partners are superior to AIs. Supporting prior domain and later course interest should be a focus for university educators.;2020
Internet-delivered intervention may be an acceptable alternative for the more than 90% of problem gamblers who are reluctant to seek face-to-face support. Thus we aimed to (1) develop a low-dropout unguided intervention named GAMBOT integrated with a messaging app and (2) investigate its effect. The present study was a randomised quadruple-blind controlled trial. We set pre-to-post change in the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) as the primary outcome and pre-to-post change in the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS) as a secondary outcome. Daily monitoring personalised feedback and private messages based on cognitive behavioural theory were offered to participants in the intervention group through a messaging app for 28 days (GAMBOT). Participants in the control group received biweekly messages only for assessments for 28 days (assessments only). A total of 197 problem gamblers were included in the primary analysis. We failed to demonstrate a significant between-group difference in the primary outcome (PGSI - 1.14 95% CI - 2.75 to 0.47p = 0.162) but in the secondary outcome (G-SAS - 3.14 95% CI - 0.24 to - 6.04p = 0.03). Only 6.7% of the participants dropped out during follow-up and 77% of the GAMBOT group participants (74/96) continued to participate in the intervention throughout the 28-day period. Integrating intervention into a chatbot feature on a frequently used messaging app shows promise in helping to overcome the high dropout rate of unguided internet-delivered interventions. More effective and sophisticated contents delivered by a chatbot should be sought to engage over 90% of problem gamblers who are reluctant to seek face-to-face support.;2020
Introduction: Although cigarettes and alcohol are frequently used together few studies have evaluated evidence of attentional bias to both smoking and alcohol cues. Attentional bias (AB) is defined as preferential attention to drug-specific cues and is most often studied in a laboratory with one cue type. AB may be an important mechanism associated with cigarette and alcohol co-use. In this study we evaluated AB to both smoking and alcohol cues in daily life using ambulatory assessment. Methods: Daily smokers (N = 21) who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol completed surveys and a dot probe task four times per day using a personal digital assistant over a period of 1 week. Results: Aggregated over subjects there was evidence of AB to smoking and AB to alcohol cues. When smoking AB was higher than the person-specific average alcohol AB was elevated and when alcohol AB was higher than the person-specific average smoking AB was elevated. AB was not significantly associated with craving for cigarettes or alcohol. Conclusions: It is feasible to assess AB for cigarette and alcohol cues using ambulatory assessment. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report a within-subject association between AB for two drug cues. The relationship between cigarette and alcohol use is likely dynamic and depends on context and exposure to substance-specific cues. Additionally a larger sample may be needed to evaluate relationships between AB and craving. Further research on possible cognitive mechanisms that increase the likelihood of co-use can inform targeted interventions.;2020
Introduction: Digital simulators are potential solutions to challenges facing surgical education. The authors sought to evaluate the reach and utilization of a freely-accessible craniofacial surgery digital educational simulator. More importantly we compare usage patterns between web-based and mobile-based platforms. Methods: A 3-way collaboration between academic non-profit (myFace New York NY) and biotechnology (Biodigital New York NY) stakeholders in 2015 produced the Craniofacial Interactive Virtual Assistant Pro (CIVA-Pro). CIVA-Pro is a freely-accessible craniofacial surgery digital educational simulator. In addition to the web-based platform a mobile-based platform was launched in 2017. Usage analytics were collected and analyzed. Results: Since its launch 751 registered users from 117 countries had accessed CIVA-Pro. The total number of sessions was 9531 including 7500 web and 2031 mobile sessions. The total screen time was 403.9 hours 290.3 for the web and 113.6 for the mobile platform. Comparison of the mean monthly screen time and number of monthly sessions between platforms since 2017 demonstrated a significantly higher mean monthly screen time (60.1 +/- 33.2 versus 29.4 +/- 16.5 hoursP = 0.002) and number of sessions (110.2 +/- 36.1 versus 58.1 +/- 31.9P < 0.0001) for the mobile-based platform. The mean screen time per session was comparable (P = 0.86). Conclusion: A freely available digital craniofacial surgery educational simulator designed for surgical trainees can achieve significant global reach. Significantly higher utilization of the mobile-based platform of the simulator as compared to the web-based platform reinforces the need to invest in user-friendly easily accessible and widely available digital educational resources by key stakeholders to ensure optimal plastic surgery trainee education.;2020
It has recently been pointed out that placement delivery arrays (PDAs) are equivalent to strong edge colorings of bipartite graphs. In this paper we consider various methods of combining two or more strong edge colorings of bipartite graphs to obtain new ones and therefore new PDAs. Combining PDAs in certain ways also gives a framework for obtaining PDAs with more robust and flexible parameters. We investigate how the parameters of certain strong edge colorings change after being combined with others and after comparing the parameters of the resulting PDAs with those of the initial ones find that subpacketization levels thusly can often be improved.;2020
Listening skills are critical for human communication. Social skills training (SST) performed by human trainers is a well-established method for obtaining appropriate skills in social interaction. Previous work automated the process of social skills training by developing a dialogue system that teaches speaking skills through interaction with a computer agent. Even though previous work that simulated social skills training considered speaking skills the SST framework incorporates other skills such as listening asking questions and expressing discomfort. In this paper we extend our automated social skills training by considering user listening skills during conversations with computer agents. We prepared two scenarios: Listening 1 and Listening 2 which respectively assume small talk and job training. A female agent spoke to the participants about a recent story and how to make a telephone call and the participants listened. We recorded the data of 27 Japanese graduate students who interacted with the agent. Two expert external raters assessed the participants' listening skills. We manually extracted features that might be related to the eye fixation and behavioral cues of the participants and confirmed that a simple linear regression with selected features correctly predicted listening skills with a correlation coefficient above 0.50 in both scenarios. The number of noddings and backchannels within the utterances contributes to the predictions because we found that just using these two features predicted listening skills with a correlation coefficient above 0.43. Since these two features are easier to understand for users we plan to integrate them into the framework of automated social skills training.;2020
Little is documented about levels of client satisfaction with maternal newborn and child health services at primary health care (PHC) facilities in Nigeria besides unsubstantiated anecdotes. This study examined different aspects of client satisfaction at primary healthcare level in Nigeria. Quantitative data were collected using personal digital assistants to capture responses from 1548 households in Bauchi and Cross River States. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize study results as frequency tables and percentages. Majority of the study respondents utilized government health facilities for treatment however some clients used private sector health facilities. Women newborns and under-fives were treated for a variety of illnesses and disease conditions. Treatment outcomes and levels of satisfaction did not appear to differ by cadre of healthcare provider. Respondents' level of satisfaction with healthcare services at primary healthcare level in Nigeria appear to reflect their modest quality of care expectations especially in poor PHC rural settings.;2020
L-tyrosine is an amino acid the concentration of which is found to be highly elevated in patients suffering from diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). The latter proves to be fatal when it turns out chronic and may lead to amputation. The conventional clinical diagnostic methods are costly and time consuming in which case the condition of patient(s) may deteriorate long before proper treatment commences. Herein we report the development of smart band-aid for real time monitoring ofL-tyrosine by employing enzymatic bio-sensor using alpha-MnO2/tyrosinase. The smart band-aid was further integrated with portable electronics capable of wireless data transmission to a personal digital assistant and its tyrosine sensing performance was evaluated. Anodic current was found to vary linearly with the concentrations ofL-tyrosine in the range of 5 nM-500 mu M. The developed sensor displayed a limit of detection and sensitivity of 0.71 nM and 0.67 mu A/nM/mm(2)respectively with a stability of 25 days. The developed sensor was validated using a commercial impedance analyzer. The impedance response was found to be consistent with the cyclic voltammogram obtained and demonstrated to be a linear function of tyrosine concentration. The developed sensing platform combines early diagnosis with connected health technologies thus fitting well into modern healthcare needs.;2020
Machine learning holds great promise for lowering product and service costs speeding up business processes and serving customers better. It is recognized as one of the most important application areas in this era of unprecedented technological development and its adoption is gaining momentum across almost all industries. In view of this we offer a brief discussion of categories of machine learning and then present three types of machine-learning usage at enterprises. We then discuss the trade-off between the accuracy and interpretability of machine-learning algorithms a crucial consideration in selecting the right algorithm for the task at hand. We next outline three cases of machine-learning development in financial services. Finally we discuss challenges all managers must confront in deploying machine-learning applications.

Metacognitive skill training may rest within any kind of social interaction that requires awareness of what an individual and others think in social educational and organizational settings alike. This work is an extensive study of multimodal application interaction (virtual agent spoken dialogue visual communication of progress) for metacognitive skill training via negotiation skill training scenarios. Human behaviour as effected by civic action and interpersonal and problem-solving skill training is investigated through interaction sessions with a virtual agent on multimodal multiparty negotiation. This work reports on the results of the user-system evaluation sessions involving 41 participants before and after interaction with the system integrating macro- (dialogue system performance) and micro- (metacognitive-related and individual- and community-level-related attitudes and skills) factors. Findings indicate significant and positive relationships between user and system evaluation questions after interaction with the dialogue system and between self-efficacy self-regulation individual readiness to change mastery goal orientation interpersonal and problem-solving skills and civic action before and after the interaction experience. Implications limitations and further research issues are discussed in light of context of the multimodal interaction and its effects on the human behaviour during metacognitive skill training.;2020
Mobile health is the medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices such as mobile phones patient monitoring devices personal digital assistants and other wireless devices. For example mobile apps (such as MASK-Air Allergy.Monitor Pollen and others) have proven useful in the management of patients with allergic rhinitis. These apps can be used in the context of broader clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for enhancing allergy-related decisions and actions with pertinent organized clinical knowledge and patient information to improve allergy care. A CDSS targeted to control rhinitis with drugs and other interventions guiding the patient in his/her self- and doctor-driven management is currently being produced and investigated by the MACVIA network. Another one called @IT-2020 is targeted to support etiologic diagnostics and allergen immunotherapy (AIT) prescriptions for patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Intensive investigation is necessary to better define the advantages and limitations of mobile-health technology in allergology and establish guidelines for their proper use in daily practice in the context of a rapidly evolving European regulatory environment.;2020
Multimodal dialogue system due to its many-fold applications has gained much attention to the researchers and developers in recent times. With the release of large-scale multimodal dialog dataset Saha et al. 2018 on the fashion domain it has been possible to investigate the dialogue systems having both textual and visual modalities. Response generation is an essential aspect of every dialogue system and making the responses diverse is an important problem. For any goal-oriented conversational agent the system's responses must be informative diverse and polite that may lead to better user experiences. In this paper we propose an end-to-end neural framework for generating varied responses in a multimodal dialogue setup capturing information from both the text and image. Multimodal encoder with co-attention between the text and image is used for focusing on the different modalities to obtain better contextual information. For effective information sharing across the modalities we combine the information of text and images using the BLOCK fusion technique that helps in learning an improved multimodal representation. We employ stochastic beam search with Gumble Top K-tricks to achieve diversified responses while preserving the content and politeness in the responses. Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs significantly better compared to the existing and baseline methods in terms of distinct metrics and thereby generates more diverse responses that are informative interesting and polite without any loss of information. Empirical evaluation also reveals that images while used along with the text improve the efficiency of the model in generating diversified responses.;2020
Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a critical component of spoken dialogue systems and it has a significant impact both on usability and perceived quality. Most existing NLG approaches in common use employ rules and heuristics and tend to generate rigid and stylised responses without the natural variation of human language. Moreover these limitations also add significantly to development costs and make the delivery of cross-domain cross-lingual dialogue systems especially complex and expensive. The first contribution of this paper is to present RNNLG a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based statistical natural language generator that can learn to generate utterances directly from dialogue act - utterance pairs without any predefined syntaxes or semantic alignments. The presentation includes a systematic comparison of the principal RNN-based NLG models available. The second contribution is to test the scalability of the proposed system by adapting models from one domain to another. We show that by pairing RNN-based NLG models with a proposed data counterfeiting method and a discriminative objective function a pretrained model can be quickly adapted to different domains with only a few examples. All of the findings presented are supported by both corpus-based and human evaluations. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.;2020
Natural language generation has become a fundamental task in dialogue systems. RNN-based natural response generation methods encode the dialogue context and decode it into a response. However they tend to generate dull and simple responses. In this article we propose a novel framework called KAWA-DRG (Knowledge-aware Attentive Wasserstein Adversarial Dialogue Response Generation) to model conversation-specific external knowledge and the importance variances of dialogue context in a unified adversarial encoder-decoder learning framework. In KAWA-DRG a co-attention mechanism attends to important parts within and among context utterances with word-utterance-level attention. Prior knowledge is integrated into the conditional Wasserstein auto-encoder for learning the latent variable space. The posterior and prior distribution of latent variables are generated and trained through adversarial learning. We evaluate our model on Switchboard DailyDialog In-Car Assistant and Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus. Experimental results show that KAWA-DRG outperforms the existing methods.;2020
Natural language provides an intuitive and effective interaction interface between human beings and robots. Currently multiple approaches are presented to address natural language visual grounding for human-robot interaction. However most of the existing approaches handle the ambiguity of natural language queries and achieve target objects grounding via dialogue systems which make the interactions cumbersome and time-consuming. In contrast we address interactive natural language grounding without auxiliary information. Specifically we first propose a referring expression comprehension network to ground natural referring expressions. The referring expression comprehension network excavates the visual semantics via a visual semantic-aware network and exploits the rich linguistic contexts in expressions by a language attention network. Furthermore we combine the referring expression comprehension network with scene graph parsing to achieve unrestricted and complicated natural language grounding. Finally we validate the performance of the referring expression comprehension network on three public datasets and we also evaluate the effectiveness of the interactive natural language grounding architecture by conducting extensive natural language query groundings in different household scenarios.;2020
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a vital component of dialogue systems and its ability to detect Out-of-Domain (OOD) inputs is critical in practical applications since the acceptance of the OOD input that is unsupported by the current system may lead to catastrophic failure. However most existing OOD detection methods rely heavily on manually labeled OOD samples and cannot take full advantage of unlabeled data. This limits the feasibility of these models in practical applications. In this paper we propose a novel model to generate high-quality pseudo OOD samples that are akin to IN-Domain (IND) input utterances and thereby improves the performance of OOD detection. To this end an autoencoder is trained to map an input utterance into a latent code. Moreover the codes of IND and OOD samples are trained to be indistinguishable by utilizing a generative adversarial network. To provide more supervision signals an auxiliary classifier is introduced to regularize the generated OOD samples to have indistinguishable intent labels. Experiments show that these pseudo OOD samples generated by our model can be used to effectively improve OOD detection in NLU. Besides we also demonstrate that the effectiveness of these pseudo OOD data can be further improved by efficiently utilizing unlabeled data.;2020
New technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) Augmented Reality (AR) Virtual Reality (VR) Mixed Reality (MR) virtual assistants chatbots. and robots which are typically powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are dramatically transforming the customer experience. In this paper we offer a fresh typology of new technologies powered by AI and propose a new framework for understanding the role of new technologies on the customer/shopper journey. Specifically we discuss the impact and implications of these technologies on each broad stage of the shopping journey (pre-transaction transaction and post-transaction) and advance a new conceptualization for managing these new AI technologies along customer experience dimensions to create experiential value. We discuss future research ideas emanating from our framework and outline interdisciplinary research avenues. (C) 2020 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

New technologies such as voice-based personal digital assistants (PDA) provide many benefits and new efficiencies but they also may have negative effects on socially vulnerable groups. There are a number of ways in which PDAs could be used that can create new ethical and legal issues. In this article we discuss the conceptual and practical challenges around PDAs and their impact on digital governance.;2020
New technology such as fully-automated interactive spoken dialogue systems (SDS) which allow learners to engage in multi-turn conversations with an automated agent could provide a means for second and foreign language learners (L2) to practice form-function-context mappings in oral interaction. In this study we investigated how learners interacted with an automated agent as they engaged in an SDS task that required them to make two requests. We examined the requests employed by 107 L2 learners exploring in particular the request strategies and modifications used. We first transcribed verbatim all audio-recorded dialogues. Then all turns were coded as to whether they contained a request or not. All turns that were identified as including requests were then coded for four categories adopted from Cross-cultural Speech Act Realization Patterns project: (1) Level of directness (2) Request strategy (3) External modifiers and (4) Internal modifiers. Direct requests were most frequently used and learners' preferred request strategies were want-statements and query preparatories. Additionally they employed more internal than external modifications - a finding that seems contrary to most interlanguage studies on request realization. Moreover we found distinct request realizations when comparing L1 Hungarian and L1 Japanese learners of English. We discuss the findings with regard to previous interlanguage studies on request realization the potential impact of an automated agent and ways automated spoken dialog systems might be used to implement individualized feedback to raise learners' pragmatic awareness.;2020
Objective The Pharma Collaboration for Transparent Medical Information (phactMI (TM)) benchmarking survey was conducted to evaluate the use of technology and websites associated with the medical information (MI) departments of 27 biopharmaceutical companies in the United States. Methods The e-survey was administered to phactMI (TM) members between December 2017 and February 2018 and included closed and open-ended questions with 7 distinct categories: existence of a MI website content type available following a search query website functions search engine optimization (SEO) website traffic internal communications/analytics and additional technology capabilities. Results Survey findings noted that 20 companies own a MI-specific website through which MI services are provided to healthcare providers (HCPs). When asked about the dissemination of MI content through varying formats survey results indicated Portable Document Format (PDF) to be the most common (18/27) followed by videos (8/27) presentations (5/27) infographics (3/27) and Hypertext Markup Language (3/27). Many companies have a responsive design website (19/25) webform (24/25) and a 1-800 number (22/25) for MI services. Few companies have a live chat (10/25) or a chatbot (1/25) and 9 of 25 said that content is searchable on Google (TM). Although website traffic varied among companies a significant driver of this appeared to be whether the site is indexed. Conclusion While most of the member companies have a MI website there is significant room for improvement in content formats available as part of a search. Traditional website features such as search functionality and webform are commonly available on websites however newer technologies such as chatbot and live chat are less featured. Across most member companies there is also a need for improvement in increasing website traffic Google (TM) indexing and SEO.;2020
Objective: To understand the therapeutic processes associated with the helpfulness of an online relational agent intervention Manage Your Life Online (MYLO). Methods: Fifteen participants experiencing a mental health related problem used Manage Your Life Online for 2 weeks. At follow-up the participants each identified two helpful and two unhelpful questions posed by Manage Your Life Online within a single intervention session. Qualitative interviews were conducted and analyzed using thematic and content analysis to gain insight into the process of therapy with Manage Your Life Online. Results: MYLO appeared acceptable to participants with a range of presenting problems. Questions enabling free expression increased awareness and new insights were key to a helpful intervention. The findings were consistent with the core processes of therapeutic change according to Perceptual Control Theory a unifying theory of psychological distress. Questions that elicited intense emotions were repetitive confusing or inappropriate were identified as unhelpful and were associated with disengagement or loss of faith in Manage Your Life Online. Conclusions: The findings provide insight into the likely core therapy processes experienced as helpful or hindering and outlines further ways to optimize acceptability of Manage Your Life Online.;2020
Objectives Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services are undergoing a digital transformation. This study explored the acceptability of three digital services (i) video consultations via Skype (ii) live webchats with a health advisor and (iii) artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled chatbots as potential platforms for SRH advice. Methods A pencil-and-paper 33-item survey was distributed in three clinics in Hampshire UK for patients attending SRH services. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the correlates of acceptability. Results In total 257 patients (57% women 50% aged <25 years) completed the survey. As the first point of contact 70% preferred face-to-face consultations 17% telephone consultation 10% webchats and 3% video consultations. Most would be willing to use video consultations (58%) and webchat facilities (73%) for ongoing care but only 40% found AI chatbots acceptable. Younger age (<25 years) (OR 2.43 95% CI 1.35 to 4.38) White ethnicity (OR 2.87 95% CI 1.30 to 6.34) past sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis (OR 2.05 95% CI 1.07 to 3.95) self-reported STI symptoms (OR 0.58 95% CI 0.34 to 0.97) smartphone ownership (OR 16.0 95% CI 3.64 to 70.5) and the preference for a SRH smartphone application (OR 1.95 95% CI 1.13 to 3.35) were associated with video consultations webchats or chatbots acceptability. Conclusions Although video consultations and webchat services appear acceptable there is currently little support for SRH chatbots. The findings demonstrate a preference for human interaction in SRH services. Policymakers and intervention developers need to ensure that digital transformation is not only cost-effective but also acceptable to users easily accessible and equitable to all populations using SRH services.;2020
Objectives: The objective was to understand how people respond to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening chatbots. Materials and Methods: We conducted an online experiment with 371 participants who viewed a COVID-19 screening session between a hotline agent (chatbot or human) and a user with mild or severe symptoms. Results: The primary factor driving user response to screening hotlines (human or chatbot) is perceptions of the agent's ability. When ability is the same users view chatbots no differently or more positively than human agents. The primary factor driving perceptions of ability is the user's trust in the hotline provider with a slight negative bias against chatbots' ability. Asian individuals perceived higher ability and benevolence than did White individuals. Conclusions: Ensuring that COVID-19 screening chatbots provide high-quality service is critical but not sufficient for widespread adoption. The key is to emphasize the chatbot's ability and assure users that it delivers the same quality as human agents.;2020
Objectives: Using Ecological Momentary Assessment we aimed to describe the time course of temptation episodes in alcohol-dependent outpatients in a real-life setting. We also examined whether affective and motivational variables were cross-sectionally and prospectively associated with temptation episodes. Additionally we tested whether outpatients who drank against treatment goals (i.e. lapsers) differed in craving affect and motivation from abstainers. Methods: Participants were 43 alcohol-dependent outpatients (13 female). Using personal digital assistants (PDAs) patients were signaled to complete three random assessments per day for 4 weeks. They were also instructed to complete a temptation assessment whenever they experienced the temptation to drink alcohol. Results: The number of temptation assessments declined over time and did not differ between lapsers and abstainers. Overall craving was generally higher in lapsers (n = 14) than abstainers (n = 27). In lapsers but not abstainers abstinence motivation was lower at temptation assessments vs. random assessments. Across all patients negative affect was prospectively associated with entry of temptation assessments later the same day. There were no significant effects for positive affect. Conclusions: In alcohol-dependent outpatients attempting to remain abstinent negative affect is cross-sectionally associated with entry of temptation assessments. There is more evidence that negative affect precipitates temptations than vice versa. Professionals should be watchful of outpatients who report generally high levels of craving and who report more negative affect and lower abstinence motivation when tempted.;2020
Once artificial intelligence (AI) is indistinguishable from human intelligence and robots are highly similar in appearance and behavior to humans there should be no reason to treat AI and robots differently from humans. However even perfect AI and robots may still be subject to a bias (referred to as speciesism in this article) which will disadvantage them and be a barrier to their commercial adoption as chatbots decision and recommendation systems and staff in retail and service settings. The author calls for future research that determines causes and psychological consequences of speciesism assesses the effect of speciesism on the adoption of new products and technologies and identifies ways to overcome it.;2020
One of the important criteria used in judging the performance of a chatbot is the ability to provide meaningful and informative responses that correspond with the context of a user's utterance. Nowadays the number of enterprises adopting and relying on task-oriented chatbots for profit is increasing. Dialog errors and inappropriate response to user queries by chatbots can result in huge cost implications. To achieve high performance recent AI chatbot models are increasingly adopting the Transformer positional encoding and the attention-based architecture. While the transformer performs optimally in sequential generative chatbot models recent studies has pointed out the occurrence of logical inconsistency and fuzzy error problems when the Transformer technique is adopted in retrieval-based chatbot models. Our investigation discovers that the encountered errors are caused by information losses. Therefore in this paper we address this problem by augmenting the Transformer-based retrieval chatbot architecture with a memory-based deep neural attention (mDNA) model by using an approach similar to late data fusion. The mDNA is a simple encoder-decoder neural architecture that comprises of bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) attention mechanism and a memory for information retention in the encoder. In our experiments we trained the model extensively on a large Ubuntu dialog corpus and the results from recall evaluation scores show that the mDNA augmentation approach slightly outperforms selected state-of-the-art retrieval chatbot models. The results from the mDNA augmentation approach are quite impressive.;2020
One of the main factors used to analyze the performance of microstrip patch antennas in Android-based mobile applications rather than licensing-based antenna design software due to its cost-effectiveness. It can be used to develop significant mobile applications to calculate the gain return loss and efficiency in different types of microstrip patch antenna with various input parameters. A literature review of various mobile applications and their development techniques is presented in this work. The main goal is that Performance Analysis of Microstrip Patches is to create a complete Android application that can calculate the parameters using the Non-Linear Vector Decomposed Neural Network (NVDN) method. Modern handheld devices such as smartphones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) have become more powerful in recent years.

Online Social Networks (OSNs) are the modern communication media at the peak of Internet technology that facilitate users' ability to connect with friends and celebrities and to disseminate breaking news and updates on real-life events. Connections and interactions among OSN users generate a massive amount of data containing a rich collection of knowledge that could be useful to various realworld data modeling and predictive analytics problems like open-source intelligence business intelligence event prediction and product recommendations. On the Web adversaries explore and target products and services for misuse and vulnerabilities and OSNs are no exception. Their large user base easy-to-use functionality and open nature further attract antisocial elements to these OSNs. In OSNs cybercrimes and illicit activities are generally committed using various forms of fake profiles such as clone profiles(1) sybil(2) and bots.;2020
Online users are increasingly exposed to chatbots as one form of AI-enabled media technologies employed for persuasive purposes e.g. making product/service recommendations. However the persuasive potential of chatbots has not yet been fully explored. Using an online experiment (N = 242) we investigate the extent to which communicating with a stand-alone chatbot influences affective and behavioral responses compared to interactive Web sites. Several underlying mechanisms are studied showing that enjoyment is the key mechanism explaining the positive effect of chatbots (vs. Web sites) on recommendation adherence and attitudes. Contrary to expectations perceived anthropomorphism seems not to be particularly relevant in this comparison.;2020
Open-domain generative dialogue systems have attracted considerable attention over the past few years. Currently how to automatically evaluate them is still a big challenge. As far as we know there are three kinds of automatic evaluations for open-domain generative dialogue systems: (1) Word-overlap-based metrics (2) Embedding-based metrics (3) Learning-based metrics. Due to the lack of systematic comparison it is not clear which kind of metrics is more effective. In this article we first measure systematically all kinds of metrics to check which kind is best. Extensive experiments demonstrate that learning-based metrics are the most effective evaluation metrics for open-domain generative dialogue systems. Moreover we observe that nearly all learning-based metrics depend on the negative sampling mechanism which obtains extremely unbalanced and low-quality samples to train a score model. To address this issue we propose a novel learning-based metric that significantly improves the correlation with human judgments by using augmented POsitive samples and valuable NEgative samples called PONE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PONE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based evaluation method. Besides we have publicly released the codes of our proposed metric and state-of-the-art baselines.(1);2020
Personal Agents (PAs) have longly been explored as assistants to support users in their daily activities. Surprisingly few works refer to the adoption of PAs in the healthcare domain where they can assist physicians' activities reducing medical errors. Although literature proposes different approaches for modelling and engineering PAs none of them discusses how they can be integrated withcognitive servicesin order to empower their reasoning capabilities. In this paper we present an integration model specifically devised for healthcare applications that enhances Belief-Desire-Intention agents reasoning with advanced cognitive capabilities. As a case study we adopt this integrated model in the critical care path of trauma resuscitation stepping forward to the vision of Smart Hospitals.;2020
Personal interviews are widely used to collect open-ended data in an array of settings many of which require solicitation of data that may be regarded as sensitive or threatening by interviewees. The high costs of employing human interviewers can be mitigated by utilizing computer-generated human-like interviewers at least in scripted interview conditions. However the effects of replacing humans with human-like interviewers on interviewees' level of actual disclosure has not been well-researched. This experiment compared disclosure of sensitive information obtained from personal interviews utilizing various interviewer modes. One-hundred and fifty-eight students from a southwestern university were randomly assigned to answer a series of open-ended questions in one of three different personal interview modes: 1) audio-only computer-assisted self-interview (i.e. ACASI) 2) human-like embodied conversational agent (i.e. ECA) or 3) a human interviewer. Disclosure was measured using both self-report and objective scores derived from trained judges. Disclosure levels were significantly higher in the faceless ACASI condition than in the combined virtual and human interviewer conditions both of which were embodied with a face. There was no significant difference between the ECA and human interviewer conditions. This suggests that the mere presence of a human face can inhibit disclosure.;2020
Placement delivery arrays for distributed computing (Comp-PDAs) have recently been proposed as a framework to construct universal computing schemes for MapReduce-like systems. In this work we extend this concept to systems with straggling nodes i.e. to systems where a subset of the nodes cannot accomplish the assigned map computations in due time. Unlike most previous works that focused on computing linear functions our results are universal and apply for arbitrary map and reduce functions. Our contributions are as follows. Firstly we show how to construct a universal coded computing scheme for MapReduce-like systems with straggling nodes from any given Comp-PDA. We also characterize the storage and communication loads of the resulting scheme in terms of the Comp-PDA parameters. Then we prove an information-theoretic converse bound on the storage-communication (SC) tradeoff achieved by universal computing schemes with straggling nodes. We show that the information-theoretic bound matches the performance achieved by the coded computing schemes with straggling nodes corresponding to the Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) PDAs i.e. to the Comp-PDAs describing Maddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme. Interestingly the MAN-PDAs are optimal for any number of straggling nodes. This implies that the map phase of optimal coded computing schemes does not need to be adapted to the number of stragglers in the system. We show that the points that lie exactly on the fundamental SC tradeoff cannot be achieved with Comp-PDAs that require smaller number of files than the MAN-PDAs. This is however possible for some of the points that lie close to the SC tradeoff. For these latter points the decrease in the requested number of files can be exponential in the number of nodes of the system. We also model the total execution time and numerically show that the active set size should be chosen to balance the duration of the map phase and the durations of the shuffle and reduce phases.;2020
Prevention of cybercrime is one of the missions of Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) aiming to protect and guarantee sovereignty in the cyberspace. In this regard online sex crimes are among the principal ones to prevent especially those where a child is abused. The paper at hand proposes C3-Sex a smart chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interact with suspects in order to profile their interest regarding online child sexual abuse. This solution is based on our Artificial Conversational Entity (ACE) that connects to different online chat services to start a conversation. The ACE is designed using generative and rule-based models in charge of generating the posts and replies that constitute the conversation from the chatbot side. The proposed solution also includes a module to analyze the conversations performed by the chatbot and calculate a set of 25 features that describes the suspect's behavior. After 50 days of experiments the chatbot generated a dataset with 7199 profiling vectors with the features associated to each suspect. Afterward we applied an unsupervised method to describe the results that differentiate three groups which we categorize as indifferent interested and pervert. Exhaustive analysis is conducted to validate the applicability and advantages of our solution.;2020
Privacy breaches are one of the biggest concerns on Online Social Networks (OSNs) especially with an introduction of automated attacks by socialbots which can automatically extract victims' private content by exploiting social behavior to befriend them. The key insight of this attack is that by intelligently sending friend requests to a small subset of users called the Critical Friending Set (CFS) such a bot can evade current defense mechanisms. We study the vulnerability of OSNs to socialbot attacks. Specifically we introduce a new optimization problem Min-Friending which identifies a minimum CFS to friend in order to obtain at least Q benefit which quantifies the amount of private information the bot obtains. The two main challenges of this problem are how to cope with incomplete knowledge of network topology and how to model users' responses to friend requests. In this paper we show that Min-Friending is inapproximable within a factor of (1 - o(1) lnQ and present an adaptive approximation algorithm using adaptive stochastic optimization. The key feature of our solution lies in the adaptive method where partial network topology is revealed after each successful friend request. Thus the decision of whom to send a friend request to next is made with the outcomes of past decisions taken into account. Traditional tools break down when attempting to place a bound on the performance of this technique with realistic user models. Therefore we additionally introduce a novel curvature-based technique to construct an approximation ratio of lnQ for a model of user behavior learned from empirical measurements on Facebook.;2020
Professional embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly present in society. Beyond these virtual agents' professional expertise they must have a social dimension to build long-term relationships with users. Interpersonal intimacy is at the core of the most gratifying social exchanges and we claim that it could constitute a remarkable means to reinforce the social dimension of ECAs. This paper presents an experimental study that compares the perception of intimacy in human and human-agent interactions. Are nature and social expressiveness critical factors for the perception of intimacy? To answer this question we created two corpora of videos showing a human or a virtual tourism information (TI) counselor using or not using intimate behaviors in the course of an interaction with a human tourist. Using the Virtual Intimacy Scale (VIS) designed in previous work we asked observers to judge the intimacy level of the TI counselor during the interaction. We demonstrate that intimate behaviors expressed by the virtual counselor and the human counselor are equally perceived by participants which supposes a common model of intimacy for human and human-agent dyads. Participants perceive the human counselor less intimate than the virtual counselor when having non intimate behaviors. We posit that humans and agents elicit different expectations regarding social abilities which directly affect their perceived level of intimacy. Our work raises questions regarding the expression of social behaviors and questions social representations.;2020
Purpose By adopting a social presence theory perspective this study aims investigate the influence of perceived usefulness of live chat services and of their unique human attributes on customer attitudes beliefs and behaviours in the context of online travel shopping. Design/methodology/approach Based on a cross-sectional survey research involving 8 travel provider websites and 631 travel consumers this work applies structural equation modelling to analyse the data. Findings The results illustrate that the perceived usefulness from the communication with a human live chat assistant positively influences customer attitudes and trust towards the website as well as increasing purchase intention. The findings further illustrate the role of the human social cues conveyed by live chat facilities namely human warmth human assurance human attentiveness and human customised content in positively moderating this effect. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to specific human attributes. Future research could investigate the role of other human characteristics as well as assess the ability of artificial intelligent powered chatbots in replicating the human elements outlined in this research. Originality/value The study provides a unique contribution to the travel literature by offering empirical insights and conceptual clarity into the usefulness of human operated live chat communication on travellers' attitudes trust towards the website and purchase intentions.;2020
Purpose Chatbots represent an innovative channel for retailers to meet young customers' needs anywhere and at any time. Being an emergent technology however it is important to investigate more thoroughly how users perceive it and which are the variables that enhance a positive attitude towards this technology. On this premise this study applies a social relationship perspective to the design of chatbots addressed to younger consumers. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a between-participants factorial design to investigate the effects of visual cues (avatar presence vs avatar absence) and interaction styles (social-oriented vs task-oriented) on social presence and how this in turn enhances millennials' perceived enjoyment trust and ultimately attitude towards the chatbot. A survey experiment was employed to conduct the study on data collected from 193 Italian millennials. Findings The results show that applying a social-oriented interaction style increases users' perception of social presence while an insignificant effect was found for avatar presence. The partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis further confirms the hypothesised model. Originality/value The adoption of new digital technologies such as chatbots is likely to have a far reaching effect on retailers consumers employees and society. For this reason a broad understanding of the phenomenon is needed. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to provide results from an experimental design in which both interaction style (social- vs task-oriented) and avatar (presence vs absence) of a chatbot are manipulated to directly explore social presence and its effect on trust perceived enjoyment and millennials' attitude towards a chatbot applied for retailing purposes.;2020
Purpose Developing a Dialogue/Virtual Agent (VA) that can handle complex tasks (need) of the user pertaining to multiple intents of a domain is challenging as it requires the agent to simultaneously deal with multiple subtasks. However majority of these end-to-end dialogue systems incorporate only user semantics as inputs in the learning process and ignore other useful user behavior and information. Sentiment of the user at the time of conversation plays an important role in securing maximum user gratification. So incorporating sentiment of the user during the policy learning becomes even more crucial more so when serving composite tasks of the user. Methodology As a first step towards enabling the development of sentiment aided VA for multi-intent conversations this paper proposes a new dataset annotated with its corresponding intents slot and sentiment (considering the entire dialogue history) labels namedSentiVA collected from open-sourced dialogue datasets. In order to integrate these multiple aspects a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) specificallyoptionsbased VA is proposed to learn strategies for managing multi-intent conversations. Along with task success based immediate rewards sentiment based immediate rewards are also incorporated in the hierarchical value functions to make the VA user adaptive. Findings Empirically the paper shows that task based and sentiment based immediate rewards cumulatively are required to ensure successful task completion and attain maximum user satisfaction in a multi-intent scenario instead of any of these rewards alone. Practical implications The eventual evaluators and consumers of dialogue systems are users. Thus to ensure a fulfilling conversational experience involving maximum user satisfaction requires VA to consider user sentiment at every time-step in its decision making policy. Originality This work is the first attempt in incorporating sentiment based rewards in the HRL framework.;2020
Purpose Elevating the human experience (HX) through research collaborations is the purpose of this article. ServCollab facilitates and supports service research collaborations that seek to reduce human suffering and improve human well-being. Design/methodology/approach To catalyze this initiative the authors introduce ServCollab's three human rights goals (serve enable and transform) standards of justice for serving humanity (distributive procedural and interactional justice) and research approaches for serving humanity (service design and community action research). Research implications ServCollab seeks to advance the service research field via large-scale service research projects that pursue theory building research and action. Service inclusion is the first focus of ServCollab and is illustrated through two projects (transformative refugee services and virtual assistants in social care). This paper seeks to encourage collaboration in more large-scale service research projects that elevate the HX. Practical implications ServCollab seeks to raise the aspirations of service researchers expand the skills of service research teams and build mutually collaborative service research approaches that transform human lives. Originality/value ServCollab is a unique organization within the burgeoning service research community. By collaborating with service researchers with service research centers with universities with nonprofit agencies and with foundations ServCollab will build research capacity to address large-scale human service system problems. ServCollab takes a broad perspective for serving humanity by focusing on the HX. Current business research focuses on the interactive roles of customer experience and employee experience. From the perspective of HX such role labels are insufficient concepts for the full spectrum of human life.;2020
Purpose Interactions are fundamental for successful relationships and stable cooperation in a business-to-business market. The main assumption in research on interactions so obvious that usually not stated by researchers is that they are set between humans. The development of artificial intelligence forces the re-examination of this assumption. This paper aims to conceptualize business virtual assistants (BVAs) a type of intelligent agent as either a boundary object or an actor within business interactions. Design/methodology/approach Reference is made to the literature on business interactions boundary objects and identity attribution to problematize the process of interpretation through which BVA obtains an identity. The ARA model and the model of interaction process is used to create a theoretical framework. Findings This paper contributes to the literature on business interactions and to the core of the IMP discussion in three aspects. The first provides a framework to understand the phenomenon of an artificial entity as an interlocutor in business interactions. While doing that a new type of entity BVA is introduced. The second contribution is the exploration and augmentation of the concept of a business actor. The third calls attention to BVA as a boundary object. These issues are seen as essential to move forward the discussion about the meaning of business interaction in the near future. Originality/value This paper conceptualizes the presence of a new entity - BVA - in the business landscape.;2020
Purpose of Review The purpose of this review is to contextualize the topic of patient engagement in orthopedic surgery. There will be a specific focus on patient engagement platforms and the impact on outcomes and orthopedic clinical workflows. Recent Findings In an attempt to engage patients and optimize the orthopedic perioperative surgical home patient engagement platforms have emerged in the form of portals mobile health applications and chatbots. Collectively these platforms have improved patient satisfaction scores and outcomes. Patient portals mobile health applications and chatbots can engage orthopedic patients and improve the effectiveness of the perioperative orthopedic surgical home. There are specific differences in these applications that should be noted and accounted for. When deciding to incorporate one of these systems into your practice it is paramount to identify what you are looking to improve upon within your health system and choose a platform accordingly.;2020
Purpose of Review We review applications of artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning (ML) in the field of HIV prevention. Recent Findings ML approaches have been used to identify potential candidates for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in healthcare settings in the USA and Denmark and in a population-based research setting in Eastern Africa. Although still in the proof-of-concept stage other applications include ML with smartphone-collected and social media data to promote real-time HIV risk reduction virtual reality tools to facilitate HIV serodisclosure and chatbots for HIV education. ML has also been used for causal inference in HIV prevention studies. ML has strong potential to improve delivery of PrEP with this approach moving from development to implementation. Development and evaluation of AI and ML strategies for HIV prevention may benefit from an implementation science approach including qualitative assessments with end users and should be developed and evaluated with attention to equity.;2020
Purpose The main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on firm performance notably by building on the business value of AI-based transformation projects. This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question making discussions interpretations and comparisons and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM AWS Cloudera Nvidia Conversica Universal Robots websites etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations and more specifically of the business value of such organizations' AI-enabled transformation projects required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps namely the conceptual phase the refinement and development phase and the assessment phase. Findings AI covers a wide range of technologies including machine translation chatbots and self-learning algorithms all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation information and transformation effects but also to detect predict and interact with humans. Thus the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations and more specifically its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes organizations can therefore enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest this study nurtures a scientific interest which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations and at the same time filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI and therefore improve organizations' performance the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company's business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data talent mix domain knowledge key decisions external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically this article through these case studies exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries.;2020
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the special issue theme by exploring customer response to automated relationship management tactics on social media channels. Design/methodology/approach A total of 17 in-depth interviews of young adults ranging from the age of 19 to 26 were conducted. From this customer journey maps were compiled incorporating socialbots as a valuable touch point along the service delivery cycle. Findings The research frames the socialbot as a valued customer service agent to young adults with some favouring this over telephone and email communication methods. Younger consumers respond positively to the quick resolution offered by the socialbot mechanism with most acknowledging that the bot is only able to manage simplified requests. Human-to-human customer relationship management is preferential when the query reaches critical mass. Research limitations/implications Socialbots on Facebook Messenger provided the research context for this study therefore other platforms and owned website bots should be considered in future studies. Practical implications This research identifies the younger generation as a key target market for the development of customer service-related bots. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first study to examine the socialbot as an automated touch point in the customer journey and contributes knowledge to the growing body of literature focussed on artificial intelligence in customer service. Moreover it provides valuable qualitative insights into how socialbots influence the customer experience and related outcome measures.;2020
Purpose This article reports the results from a panel discussion held at the 2019 European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS) on the use of technology-based autonomous agents in collaborative work. Design/methodology/approach The panelists (Drs Izak Benbasat Paul Benjamin Lowry Stefan Morana and Stefan Seidel) presented ideas related to affective and cognitive implications of using autonomous technology-based agents in terms of (1) emotional connection with these agents (2) decision-making and (3) knowledge and learning in settings with autonomous agents. These ideas provided the basis for a moderated panel discussion (the moderators were Drs Isabella Seeber and Lena Waizenegger) during which the initial position statements were elaborated on and additional issues were raised. Findings Through the discussion a set of additional issues were identified. These issues related to (1) the design of autonomous technology-based agents in terms of human-machine workplace configurations as well as transparency and explainability and (2) the unintended consequences of using autonomous technology-based agents in terms of de-evolution of social interaction prioritization of machine teammates psychological health and biased algorithms. Originality/value Key issues related to the affective and cognitive implications of using autonomous technology-based agents design issues and unintended consequences highlight key contemporary research challenges that allow researchers in this area to leverage compelling questions that can guide further research in this field.;2020
Purpose This study aims to investigate the customers' behavioral intention and actual usage (AUE) of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots for hospitality and tourism in India by extending the technology adoption model (TAM) with context-specific variables. Design/methodology/approach To understand the customers' behavioral intention and AUE of AI-powered chatbots for tourism the mixed-method design was used whereby qualitative and quantitative techniques were combined. A total of 36 senior managers and executives from the travel agencies were interviewed and the analysis of interview data was done using NVivo 8.0 software. A total of 1480 customers were surveyed and the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Findings As per the results the predictors of chatbot adoption intention (AIN) are perceived ease of use perceived usefulness perceived trust (PTR) perceived intelligence (PNT) and anthropomorphism (ANM). Technological anxiety (TXN) does not influence the chatbot AIN. Stickiness to traditional human travel agents negatively moderates the relation of AIN and AUE of chatbots in tourism and provides deeper insights into manager's commitment to providing travel planning services using AI-based chatbots. Practical implications This research presents unique practical insights to the practitioners managers and executives in the tourism industry system designers and developers of AI-based chatbot technologies to understand the antecedents of chatbot adoption by travelers. TXN is a vital concern for the customers so designers and developers should ensure that chatbots are easily accessible have a user-friendly interface be more human-like and communicate in various native languages with the customers. Originality/value This study contributes theoretically by extending the TAM to provide better explanatory power with human-robot interaction context-specific constructs - PTR PNT ANM and TXN - to examine the customers' chatbot AIN. This is the first step in the direction to empirically test and validate a theoretical model for chatbots' adoption and usage which is a disruptive technology in the hospitality and tourism sector in an emerging economy such as India.;2020
Purpose While customer experience (CE) is recognized as a critical determinant of business success both academics and managers are yet to find a means to gain a comprehensive understanding of CE cost-effectively. The authors argue that the application of relevant AI technology could help address this challenge. Employing interactively prompted narrative storytelling and the authors investigate the effectiveness of sentiment analysis (SA) on extracting valuable CE insights from primary qualitative data generated via chatbot interviews. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on a granular and semantically clear framework for studying CE feelings an artificial intelligence (AI) augmented chatbot was designed. The chatbot interviewed a crowdsourced sample of consumers about their recalled service experience feelings. By combining free-text and closed-ended questions the authors were able to compare extracted sentiment polarities against established measurement scales and empirically validate our novel approach. Findings The authors demonstrate that SA can effectively extract CE feelings from primary chatbot data. This findings also suggest that further enhancement in accuracy can be achieved via improvements in the interplay between the chatbot interviewer and SA extraction algorithms. Research limitations/implications The proposed customer-centric approach can help service companies to study and better understand CE feelings in a cost-effective and scalable manner. The AI-augmented chatbots can also help companies to foster immersive and engaging relationships with customers. This study focuses on feelings warranting further research on AI's value in studying other CE elements. Originality/value The unique inquisitive role of AI-infused chatbots in conducting interviews and analyzing data in realtime offers considerable potential for studying CE and other subjective constructs.;2020
Purpose: Preconception care is important for all women to improve infant and maternal health outcomes and may be especially important for adolescents and young adults. This study assesses the acceptance usability and use of an automated intervention to screen women on 108 preconception care risks and address them over the course of a year via a Web-based virtual animated health counselor and compares these measures for the adolescent and young adult users aged 18-25 years with those of users aged 26-34 years. We hypothesize that the younger cohort will have significantly greater use of and satisfaction with the online intervention. Methods: A randomized controlled trial involving a national sample of 528 women was conducted. We present a secondary data analysis on the system use and self-reported usability and satisfaction of the 79 women aged 18-25 years randomized to the intervention group compared with the 183 women aged 26-34 years in the intervention group. Participants were required to self-identify as female black or African American aged 18-34 years not pregnant and English-speaking and were recruited through a variety of advertisements and outreach activities. Results: Of the adolescent and young adult participants (aged 18-25 years) enrolled and randomized to the intervention 20.25% of participants accessed the system 0 times 29.11% 1-3 times and 50.63% >3 times over the course of a year. At the end of the year almost all (96.4%) indicated they had either acted on recommendations made by the agent or planned to. Most (75.0%) said they would recommend the system to someone they knew. There were no significant differences between the two age groups on intervention use or satisfaction. Conclusions: Web-based conversational agents are a viable medium for delivering longitudinal preconception care counseling to adolescents and young adults.

Quality of life (QoL) is an effective index of well-being including physical health aspect of social activity and mental state of individuals. A new approach that uses a deep-learning architecture to estimate the score of a user's QoL is presented. This system was built using a combination of a 3D convolutional neural network and a support vector machine for multimodal data. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation system three experiments were conducted. Before these experiments ten hours of audio and video data were collected from healthy participants during a natural-language conversation with a conversational agent we implemented. In the first experiment the QoL question-answer estimation experiment the accuracy of Physical functioning which is one of the eight scales that constitute QoL reached 84.0%. In the second experiment the QoL-score-regression experiment in which the scores of each scale were directly estimated the distribution of the difference between the actual score and the estimated results known as error was investigated. These results imply that the features necessary for QoL estimation can be extracted from audio and video data except for the Mental Health domain. One of the reasons why it was difficult to estimate the Mental Health scale may be that the learning framework could not extract an appropriate feature for estimation. Therefore we estimated Mental Health by focusing on eye movement. From the result it was proven that estimation is possible and the proposed system using multimodal data demonstrated its effectiveness for estimation for all eight scales that constitute QoL and for extracting high-dimensional information regarding the QoL of a human including their satisfaction level towards daily life and social activities. Finally suggestions and discussions regarding the plausible behavior of the estimation results were made from the viewpoint of human-agent interaction in the field of elderly welfare.

Question Answering (QA) systems aim at supplying precise answers to questions posed by users in a natural language form. They are used in a wide range of application areas from bio-medicine to tourism. Their underlying knowledge source can be structured data (e.g. RDF graphs and SQL databases) unstructured data in the form of plain text (e.g. textual excerpts from Wikipedia) or combinations of the above. In this paper we survey the recent work that has been done in the area of stateless QA systems with emphasis on methods that have been applied in RDF and Linked Data documents and mixtures of these. We identify the main challenges we categorize the existing approaches according to various aspects we review 21 recent systems and 23 evaluation and training datasets that are most commonly used in the literature categorized according to the type of the domain the underlying knowledge source the provided tasks and the associated evaluation metrics.;2020
Recent popular claims surrounding virtual assistants suggest that computers will soon be able to hear our emotions. Supporting this possibility promising work has harnessed big data and emergent technologies to automatically predict stable levels of one specific emotion happiness at the community (e.g. counties) and trait (i.e. people) levels. Furthermore research in affective science has shown that nonverbal vocal bursts (e.g. sighs gasps) and specific acoustic features (e.g. pitch energy) can differentiate between distinct emotions (e.g. anger happiness) and that machine-learning algorithms can detect these differences. Yet to our knowledge no work has tested whether computers can automatically detect normal everyday within-person fluctuations in one emotional state from acoustic analysis. To address this issue in the context of happy mood across 3 studies (total N = 20197) we asked participants to repeatedly report their state happy mood and to provide audio recordings-including both direct speech and ambient sounds-from which we extracted acoustic features. Using three different machine learning algorithms (neural networks random forests and support vector machines) and two sets of acoustic features we found that acoustic features yielded minimal predictive insight into happy mood above chance. Neither multilevel modeling analyses nor human coders provided additional insight into state happy mood. These findings suggest that it is not yet possible to automatically assess fluctuations in one emotional state (i.e. happy mood) from acoustic analysis pointing to a critical future direction for affective scientists interested in acoustic analysis of emotion and automated emotion detection.;2020
Recent technological advances introduced conversational agents into homes. Many researchers have investigated how people utilize and perceive them. However only a small number of studies have focused on how older adults interact with these agents. This study presents a 14-day user study of 19 participants who experienced a conversational agent in a real-life environment. We grouped them into two groups by age and compared their experiences. From a log study and semi-structured interviews we identified several differences between the two groups. Compared to younger adults older adults used the agent more. They used it primarily for listening to music and reported satisfaction with it. Younger adults mainly used utility skills like weather report checks and setting of alarms which streamlined their daily lives. Moreover older adults tended to view the agent as a companion while younger adults saw it as a tool. Based on these empirical findings we suggest that conversational agents should be designed with consideration of the different usage patterns and perceptions across age groups.;2020
Recent technological advances make it possible to create automated virtual interviewers called embodied conversational agents (ECAs). We study how an ECA compares to a human interviewer in three experiments. In experiment 1 we show that two theoretically motivated factors-making the ECA facially and vocally similar to the interviewee-result in the ECA performing similarly to or better than human interviewers for six antecedents of disclosure quality. In two additional experiments we show that employees are on average 21 to 32 percent more likely to disclose violating internal controls to an ECA than to a human even if the human interviewer has significant interviewing experience. These findings contribute to the ECA design literature by showing that similarity-enhancing features of ECAs increase the antecedents of disclosure. The findings also contribute to the accounting literature by demonstrating that ECA technology can increase the scope of interviewing in accounting without reducing interview quality.;2020
Recent times have seen increasing interest in conversational assistants (e.g. Amazon Alexa) designed to help users in their daily tasks. In military settings it is critical to design assistants that are simultaneously helpful and able to minimize the user's cognitive load. Here we show that embodiment plays a key role in achieving that goal. We present an experiment where participants engaged in an augmented reality version of the relatively well-known desert survival task. Participants were paired with a voice assistant an embodied assistant or no assistant. The assistants made suggestions verbally throughout the task whereas the embodied assistant further used gestures and emotion to communicate with the user. Our results indicate that both assistant conditions led to higher performance over the no assistant condition but the embodied assistant achieved this with less cognitive burden on the decision maker than the voice assistant which is a novel contribution. We discuss implications for the design of intelligent collaborative systems for the warfighter.;2020
Recently conversational agents effectively improve their understanding capabilities by neural networks. Such deep neural models however do not apply to most human languages due to the lack of annotated training data for various NLP tasks. In this paper we propose a multi-level cross-lingual transfer model with language shared and specific knowledge to improve the spoken language understanding of low-resource languages. Our method explicitly separates the model into the language-shared part and language-specific part to transfer cross-lingual knowledge and improve the monolingual slot tagging especially for low-resource languages. To refine the shared knowledge we add a language discriminator and employ adversarial training to reinforce information separation. Besides we adopt novel multi-level knowledge transfer in an incremental and progressive way to acquire multi-granularity shared knowledge rather than a single layer. To mitigate the discrepancies between the feature distributions of language specific and shared knowledge we propose the neural adapters to fuse knowledge automatically. Experiments show that our proposed model consistently outperforms monolingual baseline with a statistically significant margin up to 2.09 even higher improvement of 12.21 in the zero-shot setting.;2020
Recommender systems have been attracting much attention from both academia and industry because of their ability to capture user interests and generate personalized item recommendations. As the life pace in contemporary society speeds up traditional recommender systems are inevitably limited by their disconnected interaction styles and low adaptivity to users' evolving demands. Consequently conversational recommender systems emerge as a prospective research area where an intelligent dialogue agent is integrated with a recommender system. Conversational recommender systems possess the ability to accurately understand end-users' intent or request and generate human-like dialogue responses when performing recommendations. However existing conversational recommender systems only allow the systems to ask users for more preference information while users' further questions and concerns about the recommended items (e.g. enquiring the location of a recommended restaurant) can hardly be addressed. Though the recent task-oriented dialogue systems allow for two-way communications they are not easy to train because of their high dependence on human guidance in terms of user intent recognition and system response generation. Hence to enable two-way human-machine communications and tackle the challenges brought by manually crafted rules we propose Conversational Recommender System with Adversarial Learning (CRSAL) a novel end-to-end system to tackle the task of conversational recommendation. In CRSAL we innovatively design a fully statistical dialogue state tracker coupled with a neural policy agent to precisely capture each user's intent from limited dialogue data and generate conversational recommendation actions. We further develop an adversarial Actor-Critic reinforcement learning approach to adaptively refine the quality of generated system actions thus ensuring coherent human-like dialogue responses. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets fully demonstrate the superiority of CRSAL on conversational recommendation tasks.;2020
Regulations play an important role in assuring the quality of a building's construction and minimizing its adverse environmental impacts. Engineers and the like need to retrieve regulatory information to ensure a building conforms to specified standards. Despite the availability of search engines and digital databases that can be used to store regulations engineers for example are unable to retrieve information for domain-specific needs in a timely manner. As a consequence users often have to deal with the burden of browsing and filtering information which can be a time-consuming process. This research develops a robust end-to-end methodology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of retrieving queries pertaining to building regulations. The developed methodology integrates information retrieval with a deep learning model of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide precise and rapid answers to user's questions from a collection of building regulations. The methodology is evaluated and a prototype system to retrieve queries is developed. The paper's contribution is therefore twofold as it develops a: (1) methodology that combines NLP and deep learning to be able to address queries raised about the building regulations and (2) chatbot of question answering system which we refer to as QAS4CQAR. Our proposed methodology has powerful feature representation and learning capability and therefore can potentially be adopted to building regulations in other jurisdictions.;2020
Research on building dialogue systems that converse with humans naturally has recently attracted a lot of attention. Most work on this area assumes text-based conversation where the user message is modeled as a sequence of words in a vocabulary. Real-world human conversation in contrast involves other modalities such as voice facial expression and body language which can influence the conversation significantly in certain scenarios. In this work we explore the impact of incorporating the audio features of the user message into generative dialogue systems. Specifically we first design an auxiliary response retrieval task for audio representation learning. Then we use word-level modality fusion to incorporate the audio features as additional context to our main generative model. Experiments show that our audioaugmented model outperforms the audio-free counterpart on perplexity response diversity and human evaluation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2020
Research on collaborative learning has revealed that peer-collaboration explanation activities facilitate reflection and metacognition and that establishing common ground and successful coordination are keys to realizing effective knowledge-sharing in collaborative learning tasks. Studies on computer-supported collaborative learning have investigated how awareness tools can facilitate coordination within a group and how the use of external facilitation scripts can elicit elaborated knowledge during collaboration. However the separate and joint effects of these tools on the nature of the collaborative process and performance have rarely been investigated. This study investigates how two facilitation methods-coordination support via learner gaze-awareness feedback and metacognitive suggestion provision via a pedagogical conversational agent (PCA)-are able to enhance the learning process and learning gains. Eighty participants organized into dyads were enrolled in a 2 x 2 between-subject study. The first and second factors were the presence of real-time gaze feedback (no vs. visible gaze) and that of a suggestion-providing PCA (no vs. visible agent) respectively. Two evaluation methods were used: namely dialog analysis of the collaborative process and evaluation of learning gains. The real-time gaze feedback and PCA suggestions facilitated the coordination process while gaze was relatively more effective in improving the learning gains. Learners in the Gaze-feedback condition achieved superior learning gains upon receiving PCA suggestions. A successful coordination/high learning performance correlation was noted solely for learners receiving visible gaze feedback and PCA suggestions simultaneously (visible gaze/visible agent). This finding has the potential to yield improved collaborative processes and learning gains through integration of these two methods as well as contributing towards design principles for collaborative-learning support systems more generally.;2020
Research question: What are the effects of using a fertility education chatbot i.e. automatic conversation programme on knowledge intentions to improve preconception behaviour and anxiety? Design: A three-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted using an online social research panel. Participants included 927 women aged 20-34 years who were randomly allocated to one of three groups: a fertility education chatbot (intervention group) a document about fertility and preconception health (control group 1) or a document about an irrelevant topic (control group 2). Participants' scores on the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory their intentions to optimize preconception behaviours e.g. taking folic acid and the free-text feedback provided by chatbot users were assessed. Results: A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant fertility knowledge gains after the intervention in the intervention group (+9.1 points) and control group 1 (+14.9 points) but no significant change in control group 2 (+1.1 points). Post-test increases in the intentions to optimize behaviours were significantly higher in the intervention group than in control group 2 and were similar to those in control group 1. Post-test state anxiety scores were significantly lower in the intervention group than in control group 1 and control group 2. User feedbacks about the chatbot suggested technical limitations e.g. low comprehension of users' words and pros and cons of using the chatbot e.g. convenient versus coldness. Conclusions: Providing fertility education using a chatbot improved fertility knowledge and intentions to optimize preconception behaviour without increasing anxiety but the improvement in knowledge was small. Further technical development and exploration of personal affinity for technology is required.;2020
Safeguarding consumer privacy is a key challenge for the growth of e-commerce. The dramatic technological changes advanced by online platforms big data artificial intelligence virtual reality virtual assistants and blockchain technology are transforming the way we shop online. This paradigm shift in e-commerce has only intensified the perplexities of privacy issues. Corresponding to the growing concerns of privacy in practice research in this area has surged during the last two decades. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of consumer privacy research in business to consumer e-commerce and thereby understand what has been studied what is omitted and what potential research areas have emerged in the course of transformational technological changes. We conducted a systematic review of behavioral studies published on analyzing privacy concerns at the individual level during the last 20 years. We methodically analyzed the selected literature using the thematic analysis technique. The results revealed eight main themes. We present a taxonomy of consumer privacy concerns and a research agenda that could lead to a more cohesive and comprehensive understanding of privacy dynamics in e-commerce.;2020
Several domain-specific assistants in the form of chatbots have conquered many commercial and private areas. However there is still a limited level of systematic knowledge of the distinctive characteristics of design elements for chatbots to facilitate development adoption implementation and further research. To close this gap the paper outlines a taxonomy of design elements for chatbots with 17 dimensions organized into the perspectives intelligence interaction and context. The conceptually grounded design elements of the taxonomy are used to analyze 103 chatbots from 23 different application domains. Through a clustering-based approach five chatbot archetypes that currently exist for domain-specific chatbots are identified. The developed taxonomy provides a structure to differentiate and categorize domain-specific chatbots according to archetypal qualities that guide practitioners when taking design decisions. Moreover the taxonomy serves academics as a foundation for conducting further research on chatbot design while integrating scientific and practical knowledge.;2020
Since the discovery of the Coronavirus (nCOV-19) it has become a global pandemic. At the same time it has been a great challenge to hospitals or healthcare staff to manage the flow of the high number of cases. Especially in remote areas it is becoming more difficult to consult a medical specialist when the immediate hit of the epidemic has occurred. Thus it becomes obvious that if effectively designed and deployed chatbot can help patients living in remote areas by promoting preventive measures virus updates and reducing psychological damage caused by isolation and fear. This study presents the design of a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot for the purpose of diagnostic evaluation and recommending immediate measures when patients are exposed to nCOV-19. In addition presenting a virtual assistant can also measure the infection severity and connects with registered doctors when symptoms become serious.;2020
Smart devices are already present in all areas of knowledge: sometimes as the main role and sometimes as the supporting role. Regardless of their function smart devices communicate with other devices monitor and control everything in the physical world. In this way the Internet of Things (IoT) has been gaining ramifications. The one that is growing most in the area of health and that is becoming more and more popular is IoHT. Several treatments have been employed around the world based around IoHT including one for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is one of four existing neuromotor diseases without a cure to date. With the progression of the disease patients lose the strength of the body's voluntary muscles until total paralysis. Other consequences of the progression of the disease are the loss of autonomy in some aspects of life in addition to the loss of self-esteem. This work aims to develop a BCI system based on IoHT using a personal digital assistant brainwave sensor to assist patients with ALS in performing predefined tasks. To validate this tool as a complement to traditional medical treatment ten volunteers conducted tests on the proposed solution. Results were very promising.;2020
Socialbots are intelligent software that controls all behaviour of fake accounts in an online social network. Since they are armed with detection evasion techniques it is valuable to be able to determine the effectiveness of these techniques. In this study an analytical model is developed to estimate a lower bound for the cost of automatic establishment of a socialbot network. Moreover by considering fake accounts purchasing as an establishment strategy an upper bound is suggested for acceptable costs. These two boundaries are compared to decide on the economic feasibility of a socialbot network design strategy. To demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the model two case studies are investigated. They show that although designing a fully stealthy socialbot network is economically feasible the infiltration time would be unacceptable. Thus this ideal situation in which the establishment is fully stealthy performs in a tolerable time and satisfactory infiltration scale is impractical. A possible solution could be achieved by reducing the time and cost in exchange for less stealthy behaviour while the infiltration scale kept unchanged. Since the model presents a trade-off between stealthiness time and cost it is a useful tool facilitating the design of a possible strategy.;2020
Software robots tend to increasingly take over organizational processes. However little is known about principles of building and implementing as opposed to using robotic systems such as bots for process automation (RPA) and chatbots. Therefore based on an empirically illustrated theoretical conceptualization of routine automation and affordance actualization this paper develops a framework that guides how different types of software robots can be built and implemented through transforming a human-executed routine into a robot-automated routine by applying specific implementation guidelines.;2020
Speaker verification (SV) has recently attracted considerable research interest due to the growing popularity of virtual assistants. At the same time there is an increasing requirement for an SV system: it should be robust to short speech segments especially in noisy and reverberant environments. In this paper we consider one more important requirement for practical applications: the system should be robust to an audio stream containing long non-speech segments where a voice activity detection (VAD) is not applied. To meet these two requirements we introduce feature pyramid module (FPM)-based multi-scale aggregation (MSA) and self-adaptive soft VAD (SAS-VAD). We present the FPM-based MSA to deal with short speech segments in noisy and reverberant environments. Also we use the SAS-VAD to increase the robustness to long non-speech segments. To further improve the robustness to acoustic distortions (i.e. noise and reverberation) we apply a masking-based speech enhancement (SE) method. We combine SV VAD and SE models in a unified deep learning framework and jointly train the entire network in an end-to-end manner. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work combining these three models in a deep learning framework. We conduct experiments on Korean indoor (KID) and VoxCeleb datasets which are corrupted by noise and reverberation. The results show that the proposed method is effective for SV in the challenging conditions and performs better than the baseline i-vector and deep speaker embedding systems.;2020
Speech endpoint detection (EPD) benefits from the decoder state features (DSFs) of online automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. However the DSFs are obtained via the ASR decoding process which can become prohibitively expensive especially in limited-resource scenarios such as the embedded devices. To address this problem this paper proposes a language model (LM)-based end-of-utterance (EOU) predictor which is trained to determine the framewise probabilities of the EOU token conditioned on the previous word history obtained from the 1-best decoding hypothesis of the ASR system in an end-to-end manner without an actual decoding process in the test step. Further a novel end-to-end EPD strategy is presented to incorporate a phonetic embedding (PE)-based acoustic modeling knowledge and the proposed EOU predictor-based language modeling knowledge into an acoustic feature embedding (AFE)-based EPD approach within the recurrent neural networks (RNN)-based EPD framework. The proposed EPD algorithm is built upon the ensemble RNNs which are independently trained for the three parts which are the proposed LM-based EOU predictor AFE-based EPD and PE-based acoustic model (AM) in accordance with each target. The ensemble RNNs are concatenated at the level of the last hidden layers and then attached into the fully-connected deep neural networks (DNN)-based EPD classifier which is trained in accordance with the ultimate EPD target. Thereafter they are jointly retrained at the second step of the DNN training to yield the lower endpoint error. The proposed EPD framework was evaluated in terms of the endpoint accuracy and word error rate for the CHiME-3 and large-scale ASR tasks. The experimental results turn out that the proposed EPD algorithm efficiently outperforms the conventional EPD approaches.;2020
Spoken language understanding (SLU) in human machine conversational systems is the process of interpreting the semantic meaning conveyed by a user's spoken utterance. Traditional SLU approaches transform the word string transcribed by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system into a semantic label that determines the machine's subsequent response. However the robustness of SLU results can suffer in the context of a human-machine conversation-based language learning system due to the presence of ambient noise heavily accented pronunciation ungrammatical utterances etc. To address these issues this paper proposes an end-to-end (E2E) modeling approach for SLU and evaluates the semantic labeling performance of a bidirectional LSTM-RNN with input at three different levels: acoustic (filterbank features) phonetic (subphone posteriorgrams) and lexical (ASR hypotheses). Experimental results for spoken responses collected in a dialog application designed for English learners to practice job interviewing skills show that multi-level BLSTM-RNNs can utilize complementary information from the three different levels to improve the semantic labeling performance. An analysis of results on OOV utterances which can be common in a conversation-based dialog system also indicates that using subphone posteriorgrams outperforms ASR hypotheses and incorporating the lower-level features for semantic labeling can be advantageous to improving the final SLU performance.;2020
Surveying narrative applications of artificial intelligence in film games and interactive fiction this article imagines the future of artificial intelligence (AI) authorship and explores trends that seek to replace human authors with algorithmically generated narrative. While experimental works that draw on text generation and natural language processing have a rich history this article focuses on commercial applications of AI narrative and looks to future applications of this technology. Video games have incorporated AI and procedural generation for many years but more recently new applications of this technology have emerged in other media. Director Oscar Sharp and artist Ross Goodwin for example generated significant media buzz about two short films that they produced which were written by their AI screenwriter. It's No Game (2017) in particular offers an apt commentary on the possibility of replacing striking screenwriters with AI authors. Increasingly AI agents and virtual assistants like Siri Cortana Alexa and Google Assistant are incorporated into our daily lives. As concerns about their eavesdropping circulate in news media it is clear that these companions are learning a lot about us which raises concerns about how our data might be employed in the future. This article explores current applications of AI for storytelling and future directions of this technology to offer insight into issues that have and will continue to arise as AI storytelling advances.;2020
Teaching via natural language is an intuitive way for end users to add functionality to a virtual assistant enabling them to personalize their assistant with new commands without requiring the intervention of the system developer who cannot possibly anticipate all of an end user's needs. In this paper we introduce our Learning by Instruction Agent (LIA) the first virtual assistant for an email domain that is capable of learning how to perform new commands taught by end users in natural language. LIA grounds the semantics of each command in terms of primitive executable procedures. When a user provides LIA with a command that it does not understand it prompts the user to explain the command through a sequence of natural language steps. From this input LIA learns the meaning of the new command and how to generalize the command to novel situations. For example having been taught how to forward an email to Alice it can correctly understand forward this email to Bob. We show that users that were assigned to interact with LIA completed the task quicker than users assigned to interact with a non-learning agent. These results demonstrate the potential of natural language teaching to improve the capabilities of intelligent personal assistants. We annotated 4759 natural language statements with their associated computer readable execution commands (logical forms) to form a dataset (which we publicize in this paper). We present the performance of several different parser methods on this dataset.;2020
Technologies are becoming increasingly autonomous able to make decisions and complete tasks on behalf of consumers. Virtual assistants already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and implement recipes. In the future consumers will be able to delegate substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping systems. Where as the functional benefits of these systems are evident they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained human-machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing from research in marketing psychology and human-computer interaction to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers and suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey. The article finishes with implications for policy makers and a future research agenda for researchers examining autonomous technologies. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Technology has played an important role in responding to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic. The virus's blend of lethality and transmissibility have challenged officials and exposed critical limitations of the traditional public health apparatus. However throughout this pandemic technology has answered the call for a new form of public health that illustrates opportunities for enhanced agility scale and responsiveness. The authors share the Microsoft perspective and illustrate how technology has helped transform the public health landscape with new and refined capabilities - the efficacy and impact of which will be determined by history. Technologies like chatbot and virtualized patient care offer a mechanism to triage and distribute care at scale. Artificial intelligence and high-performance computing have accelerated research into understanding the virus and developing targeted therapeutics to treat infection and prevent transmission. New mobile contact tracing protocols that preserve patient privacy and civil liberties were developed in response to public concerns creating new opportunities for privacy-sensitive technologies that aid efforts to prevent and control outbreaks. While much progress is still needed the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted technology's importance to public health security and pandemic preparedness. Future multi-stakeholder collaborations including those with technology organizations are needed to facilitate progress in overcoming the current pandemic setting the stage for improved pandemic preparedness in the future. As lessons are assessed from the current pandemic public officials should consider technology's role and continue to seek opportunities to supplement and improve on traditional approaches.;2020
Text generation is a basic work of natural language processing which plays an important role in dialogue system and intelligent translation. As a kind of deep learning framework Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has been widely used in text generation. In combination with reinforcement learning GAN uses the output of discriminator as reward signal of reinforcement learning to guide generator training but the reward signal is a scalar and the guidance is weak. This paper proposes a text generation model named Feature-Guiding Generative Adversarial Networks (FGGAN). To solve the problem of insufficient feedback guidance from the discriminator network FGGAN uses a feature guidance module to extract text features from the discriminator network convert them into feature guidance vectors and feed them into the generator network for guidance. In addition sampling is required to complete the sequence before feeding it into the discriminator to get feedback signal in text generation. However the randomness and insufficiency of the sampling method lead to poor quality of generated text. This paper formulates text semantic rules to restrict the token of the next time step in the sequence generation process and remove semantically unreasonable tokens to improve the quality of generated text. Finally text generation experiments are performed on different datasets and the results verify the effectiveness and superiority of FGGAN.;2020
The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic route of information retrieval from a knowledge-based database (or domain knowledge) through a dialog system of natural language interaction. The application is about a comprehensive building at a university with classrooms laboratory rooms meeting rooms research rooms and offices and is to present related information the user asks for. First the domain knowledge is expressed with predicate expressions based on the ontology structure then the vocabulary is presented distributedly with word embedding enhanced with the domain knowledge queries from the user arc then converted into the intent (general) and slot elements (specific) with the help of trained recurrent neural network (RNN). The system works smoothly. The key point is integrating the two methods of knowledge-based and data-driven natural language processing into one system and the domain knowledge is in the central part which is incorporated into the word embedding to make it specifically fit the natural language in this application.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an anti-bullying activity that utilizes conversational virtual agents (called conversation-bots or chatbots) on students' attitudes toward bullying problems. An experimental pre- or posttest design with a three-group setting was used. Eighty-nine fifth-grade students were assigned to one of three groups: Conversation with a virtual agent of (a) bully's role (b) victim's role and (c) teacher's role. All agents are conversation-bots designed to support learner-computer interactions. The bully agent defends the notion that bullying behaviors are acceptable whereas the victim agent argues that bullying behavior cannot be tolerated. The teacher agent teaches students the types of bullying and its negative aspects. The participants completed an anti-bullying attitude test at pre- and posttest which included students' anti-bully intention pro-victim behavior and self-efficacy factors. The results show that students' attitudes toward bullying problems changed to more positive responses after the implementation that used the conversation-bot. In addition the results revealed that the agent's role had an impact on the students' attitudes toward the anti-bully factor. Implications and future research regarding the use of conversation-bots in education are discussed.;2020
The aim of this study was to test how two important types of social cues used by virtual assistants today can affect consumer concerns and persuasion. These two cues are modality (voice-based via smart speaker voice-based via a smartphone or text-based on a smartphone screen) and the adoption of a human name rather than no name. An online scenario-based experiment (n = 180) has shown that participants who were exposed to a voice-based recommendation via a smart speaker were the most concerned about security and found text-based recommendations on a screen to be the most persuasive. Participants who were exposed to a virtual assistant with a human name were less concerned about their autonomy and were more strongly persuaded than those exposed to an assistant without a human name.;2020
The application of natural language to improve students' interaction with information systems is demonstrated to be beneficial. In particular advances in cognitive computing enable a new way of interaction that accelerates insight from existing information sources thereby contributing to the process of learning. This work aims at researching the application of cognitive computing in blended learning environments. We propose a modular cognitive agent architecture for pedagogical question answering featuring social dialogue (small talk) improved for a specific knowledge domain. This system has been implemented as a personal agent to assist students in learning Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. Its implementation includes the training of machine learning models and natural language understanding algorithms in a human-like interface. The effectiveness of the system has been validated through an experiment.;2020
The aptitude to identify the emotional states of others and response to exposed emotions is an important aspect of human social intelligence. Robots are expected to be prevalent in society to assist humans in various tasks. Human-robot interaction (HRI) is of critical importance in the assistive robotics sector. Smart digital assistants and assistive robots fail quite often when a request is not well defined verbally. When the assistant fails to provide services as desired the person may exhibit an emotional response such as anger or frustration through expressions in their face and voice. It is critical that robots understand not only the language but also human psychology. A novel affection-based perception architecture for cooperative HRIs is studied in this paper where the agent is expected to recognize human emotional states thus encourages a natural bonding between the human and the robotic artifact. We propose a method to close the loop using measured emotions to grade HRIs. This metric will be used as a reward mechanism to adjust the assistant's behavior adaptively. Emotion levels from users are detected through vision and speech inputs processed by deep neural networks (NNs). Negative emotions exhibit a change in performance until the user is satisfied.;2020
The combination of machine learning with healthcare services is emerging. However when machine learning functions are executed on resource-constrained mobile consumer devices the computing overhead will increase and the user experience will deteriorate. In essence the existing approaches delegate such tasks to a central cloud data center. However data processing on remote cloud servers results in a long response latency. Therefore this article proposes a machine learning-based smart recipe recommendation system that uses a local mobile edge computing server. The proposed system delegates the machine learning and recipe search tasks to the mobile edge computing server thereby reducing the response latency for data processing and the computational burden placed on mobile user devices.;2020
The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges for the U.S. healthcare system due to the staggering mismatch between healthcare system capacity and patient demand. The healthcare industry has been a relatively slow adopter of digital innovation due to the conventional belief that humans need to be at the center of healthcare delivery tasks. However in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to carry out specific tasks such as pre-hospital triage and enable clinicians to deliver care at scale. Recognizing that the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild and do not require hospitalization Partners HealthCare (now Mass General Brigham) implemented a digitally-automated pre-hospital triage solution to direct patients to the appropriate care setting before they showed up at the emergency department and clinics which would otherwise consume resources expose other patients and staff to potential viral transmission and further exacerbate supply-and-demand mismatching. Although the use of AI has been well-established in other industries to optimize supply and demand matching the introduction of AI to perform tasks remotely that were traditionally performed in-person by clinical staff represents a significant milestone in healthcare operations strategy.;2020
The dialogue system has always been one of the important topics in the domain of artificial intelligence. So far most of the mature dialogue systems are task-oriented based while non-task-oriented dialogue systems still have a lot of room for improvement. We propose a data-driven non-task-oriented dialogue generator CERG based on neural networks. This model has the emotion recognition capability and can generate corresponding responses. The data set we adopt comes from the NTCIR-14 STC-3 CECG subtask which contains more than 1.7 million Chinese Weibo post-response pairs and 6 emotion categories. We try to concatenate the post and the response with the emotion then mask the response part of the input text character by character to emulate the encoder-decoder framework. We use the improved transformer blocks as the core to build the model and add regularization methods to alleviate the problems of overcorrection and exposure bias. We introduce the retrieval method to the inference process to improve the semantic relevance of generated responses. The results of the manual evaluation show that our proposed model can make different responses to different emotions to improve the human-computer interaction experience. This model can be applied to lots of domains such as automatic reply robots of social application.;2020
The end-to-end open-domain dialogue system is a challenging task since the existing neural models suffer from the issue of trivial responses. Employing background knowledge as a major solution has been proven to be effective to improve the responses quality. However less attention was paid to the selection of the appropriate knowledge in scenarios where the utterance subject drifts between two partners which could prohibit the model from learning to access knowledge correctly. In this paper we propose a novel Knowledge Augmented Dialogue Generation (KADG) model to facilitate both knowledge selection and incorporation in open-domain dialogue systems. The core components of KADG consist of Divergent Knowledge Selector (DKS) and Knowledge Aware Decoder (KAD). DKS performs a one-hop subject reasoning over knowledge by pre-optimizing each knowledge candidate with inferred drift clue. Drift clue implies the potential subjects association of the current conversation and is served to bridge the subject gap in the knowledge selection. Thereafter KAD makes full use of this selected knowledge to generate responses contextual coherently as well as knowledgeably. Comprehensive experiments on a newly released knowledge-grounded conversation dataset Wizard-of-Wikipedia have verified the superiority of our model than previous baselines and shown that our method can refer to the knowledge properly and generate diverse and informative responses.

The events that took place in the year 2020 have shown us that society is still fragile and that it is exposed to events that rapidly change the paradigms that govern it. This has been shown by a pandemic like Coronavirus disease 2019 this global emergency has changed the way people interact communicate study or work. In short the way in which society carries out all activities has changed. This includes education which has bet on the use of information and communication technologies to reach students. An example of the aforementioned is the use of learning management systems which have become ideal environments for resource management and the development of activities. This work proposes the integration of technologies such as artificial intelligence and data analysis with learning management systems in order to improve learning. This objective is outlined in a new normality that seeks robust educational models where certain activities are carried out in an online mode surrounded by technologies that allow students to have virtual assistants to guide them in their learning.;2020
The growing number of voice-controlled devices (VCDs) i.e. Google Home Amazon Alexa etc. has resulted in automation of home appliances smart gadgets and next generation vehicles etc. However VCDs and voice-activated services i.e. chatbots are vulnerable to audio replay attacks. Our vulnerability analysis of VCDs shows that these replays could be exploited in multi-hop scenarios to maliciously access the devices/nodes attached to the Internet of Things. To protect these VCDs and voice-activated services there is an urgent need to develop reliable and computationally efficient solutions to detect the replay attacks. This paper models replay attacks as a nonlinear process that introduces higher-order harmonic distortions. To detect these harmonic distortions we propose the acoustic ternary patterns-gammatone cepstral coefficient (ATP-GTCC) features that are capable of capturing distortions due to replay attacks. Error correcting output codes model is used to train a multi-class SVM classifier using the proposed ATP-GTCC feature space and tested for voice replay attack detection. Performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on ASVspoof 2019 dataset and our own created voice spoofing detection corpus (VSDC) consisting of bona-fide first-order replay (replayed once) and second-order replay (replayed twice) audio recordings. Experimental results signify that the proposed audio replay detection framework reliably detects both first and second-order replay attacks and can be used in resource constrained devices.;2020
The increasing capabilities of conversational agents (CAs) offer manifold opportunities to assist users in a variety of tasks. In an organizational context particularly their potential to simulate a human-like interaction via natural language currently attracts attention both at the customer interface as well as for internal purposes often in the form of chatbots. Emerging experimental studies on CAs look into the impact of anthropomorphic design elements so-called social cues on user perception. However while these studies provide valuable prescriptive knowledge of selected social cues they neglect the potential detrimental influence of the limited responsiveness of present-day conversational agents. In practice many CAs fail to continuously provide meaningful responses in a conversation due to the open nature of natural language interaction which negatively influences user perception and often led to CAs being discontinued in the past. Thus designing a CA that provides a human-like interaction experience while minimizing the risks associated with limited conversational capabilities represents a substantial design problem. This study addresses the aforementioned problem by proposing and evaluating a design for a CA that offers a human-like interaction experience while mitigating negative effects due to limited responsiveness. Through the presentation of the artifact and the synthesis of prescriptive knowledge in the form of a nascent design theory for anthropomorphic enterprise CAs this research adds to the growing knowledge base for designing human-like assistants and supports practitioners seeking to introduce them into their organizations.;2020
The increasing demand in air transportation is pushing the current air traffic management system to its limits in the airspace capacity and workload of air traffic controllers (ATCOs). ATCOs are in an urgent need of assistant tools to aid them in dealing with increased traffic specifically in resolving potential conflict. Because current automated conflict resolutions are not in conformance with the thinking or preferences of individual ATCOs consequently they are unlikely accepted by the ATCOs. In this work an artificial intelligence (AI) system is built as a digital assistant to support ATCOs in resolving potential conflicts. Our system consists of two core components: an intelligent interactive conflict solver (iCS) to acquire ATCOs' demonstrations and an AI agent. The AI agent is based on reinforcement learning to suggest conflict resolutions. It is observed that providing the AI agent with the human resolutions which are acquired and characterized by our intelligent interactive conflicts solver not only improves the agent's performance but also gives it the capability to suggest more humanlike resolutions. That could help to increase the ATCOs' acceptance rate of the agent's suggested resolutions. Our system could be further developed as personalized digital assistants of ATCOs to maintain their workloads manageable when they have to deal with sectors with increased traffic.;2020
The integration of digital voice assistants in nursing residences is becoming increasingly important to facilitate nursing productivity with documentation. A key idea behind this system is training natural language understanding (NLU) modules that enable the machine to classify the purpose of the user utterance (intent) and extract pieces of valuable information present in the utterance (entity). One of the main obstacles when creating robust NLU is the lack of sufficient labeled data which generally relies on human labeling. This process is cost-intensive and time-consuming particularly in the high-level nursing care domain which requires abstract knowledge. In this paper we propose an automatic dialogue labeling framework of NLU tasks specifically for nursing record systems. First we apply data augmentation techniques to create a collection of variant sample utterances. The individual evaluation result strongly shows a stratification rate with regard to both fluency and accuracy in utterances. We also investigate the possibility of applying deep generative models for our augmented dataset. The preliminary character-based model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) obtains an accuracy of 90% and generates various reasonable texts with BLEU scores of 0.76. Secondly we introduce an idea for intent and entity labeling by using feature embeddings and semantic similarity-based clustering. We also empirically evaluate different embedding methods for learning good representations that are most suitable to use with our data and clustering tasks. Experimental results show that fastText embeddings produce strong performances both for intent labeling and on entity labeling which achieves an accuracy level of 0.79 and 0.78 f1-scores and 0.67 and 0.61 silhouette scores respectively.;2020
The natural interaction between human and robot is full of challenges but indispensable. In this article a human-robot interactive system is designed for humanoid robot SHFR-III. The system consists of three subsystems: multi-sensor positioning subsystem emotional interaction subsystem and dialogue subsystem. The multi-sensor positioning subsystem is designed to improve the positioning accuracy the emotional interaction subsystem uses bimodal emotional recognition model and fuzzy emotional decision-making model to realize the emotion recognition and expression feedback to the interactive objects and the dialogue subsystem with personal information can complete the response consistent with the default information and avoid conflicting responses .The experimental results show that the multi-sensor positioning subsystem has good environmental adaptability and positioning accuracy the emotional interaction subsystem can achieve human-like emotional feedback and the dialogue subsystem can achieve more natural logical and consistent responses.;2020
The nature of industrial manufacturing processes and the continuous need to adapt production systems to new demands require tools to support workers during transitions to new processes. At the early stage of transitions human error rate is often high and the impact in quality and production loss can be significant. Over the past years eXtended Reality (XR) technologies (such as virtual augmented immersive and mixed reality) have become a popular approach to enhance operators' capabilities in the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The purpose of this research is to explore the usability of dialogue-based XR enhancement to ease the cognitive burden associated with manufacturing tasks through the augmentation of linked multi-modal information available to support operators. The proposed Interactive XR architecture using the Spoken Dialogue Systems' modular and user-centred architecture as a basis was tested in two use case scenarios: the maintenance of a robotic gripper and as a shop-floor assistant for electric panel assembly. In both cases we have confirmed a high user acceptance rate with an efficient knowledge communication and distribution even for operators without prior experience or with cognitive impairments therefore demonstrating the suitability of the solution for assisting human workers in industrial manufacturing processes. The results endorse an initial validation of the Interactive XR architecture to achieve a multi-device and user-friendly experience to solve industrial processes which is flexible enough to encompass multiple tasks.;2020
The noetic end-to-end response selection challenge as one track in the 7th Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC7) aims to push the state of the art of utterance classification for real world goal-oriented dialog systems for which participants need to select the correct next utterances from a set of candidates for the multi-turn context. This paper presents our systems that are ranked top 1 on both datasets under this challenge one focused and small (Advising) and the other more diverse and large (Ubuntu). Previous state-of-the-art models use hierarchy-based (utterance-level and token-level) neural networks to explicitly model the interactions among different turns' utterances for context modeling. In this paper we investigate a sequential matching model based only on chain sequence for multi-turn response selection. Our results demonstrate that the potentials of sequential matching approaches have not yet been fully exploited in the past for multi-turn response selection. In addition to ranking top 1 in the challenge the proposed model outperforms all previous models including state-of-the-art hierarchy-based models on two large-scale public multi-turn response selection benchmark datasets.

The objective of this study was to examine the day-to-day associations between partner support pain catastrophizing and pain intensity in individuals with end-stage knee osteoarthritis. In this microlongitudinal cohort study participants (N = 124) with end-stage knee osteoarthritis completed baseline measures of trait pain catastrophizing and negative affect. Participants also provided daily diary assessments of partner support pain catastrophizing and pain intensity for a period of 7 days using a personal digital assistant. Multilevel analyses revealed that day-to-day fluctuations in pain catastrophizing were associated with pain intensity. Data from multilevel analyses indicated that the main effect of partner support was not significantly associated with pain intensity. Results also indicated the interactions between partner support and both trait and state pain catastrophizing were significant suggesting that both trait and state pain catastrophizing moderated the relationship between daily partner support and pain intensity. That is on days when participants experienced low levels of partner support high catastrophizers reported higher levels of pain intensity than low catastrophizers. In the presence of higher levels of partner support pain intensity did not differ between high and low catastrophizers. These results are consistent with the Communal Coping Model of pain catastrophizing and highlight the interpersonal context within which pain catastrophizing impacts pain outcomes. These findings also suggest that future interventions designed to specifically target the dynamic between pain catastrophizing and partner support may improve pain outcomes in individuals with end-stage knee OA.;2020
The performance of text-to-speech (TTS) systems heavily depends on spectrogram to waveform generation also known as the speech reconstruction phase. The time required for the same is known as synthesis delay. In this paper an approach to reduce speech synthesis delay has been proposed. It aims to enhance the TTS systems for real-time applications such as digital assistants mobile phones embedded devices etc. The proposed approach applies Fast Griffin Lim Algorithm (FGLA) instead Griffin Lim algorithm (GLA) as vocoder in the speech synthesis phase. GLA and FGLA are both iterative but the convergence rate of FGLA is faster than GLA. The proposed approach is tested on LJSpeech Blizzard and Tatoeba datasets and the results for FGLA are compared against GLA and neural Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based vocoder. The performance is evaluated based on synthesis delay and speech quality. A 36.58% reduction in speech synthesis delay has been observed. The quality of the output speech has improved which is advocated by higher Mean opinion scores (MOS) and faster convergence with FGLA as opposed to GLA.;2020
The popularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing rapidly all around the world-where in simple terms AI is a technology which mimics the behaviors commonly associated with human intelligence. Today various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance from agriculture to healthcare and security from space exploration to robotics and transport and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed repair urban infrastructure and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic air quality monitoring garbage collection and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature research developments trends and applications. In so doing it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers planners and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI.;2020
The purpose of this study was to explore customers' perceptions and behaviors when using chatbots in restaurant takeout orders. Built on the social presence theory this study conducted a lab experiment to examine and compare three ordering methods in quick-service and full-service restaurants. Results revealed that phone ordering and online ordering were both better than chatbot ordering in terms of satisfaction and behavioral outcomes. The phone ordering method elicited best social presence and cognitive attitudes while the online ordering method generated highest order amounts. Chatbot ordering is better suited for use in quick-service restaurants due to their simpler menus. In terms of order items chatbot method was used for simple menu items and core products phone method for specials and more complicated items while online method for more expensive items and add-ons. The findings offer new insight for restaurant practitioners into designing and adopting chatbots.;2020
The rise of increasingly more powerful chatbots offers a new way to collect information through conversational surveys where a chatbot asks open-ended questions interprets a user's free-text responses and probes answers whenever needed. To investigate the effectiveness and limitations of such a chatbot in conducting surveys we conducted a field study involving about 600 participants. In this study with mostly open-ended questions half of the participants took a typical online survey on Qualtrics and the other half interacted with an AI-powered chatbot to complete a conversational survey. Our detailed analysis of over 5200 free-text responses revealed that the chatbot drove a significantly higher level of participant engagement and elicited significantly better quality responses measured by Gricean Maxims in terms of their informativeness relevance specificity and clarity. Based on our results we discuss design implications for creating AI-powered chatbots to conduct effective surveys and beyond.;2020
The screening of healthcare workers for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) symptoms and exposures prior to every clinical shift is important for preventing nosocomial spread of infection but creates a major logistical challenge. To make the screening process simple and efficient University of California San Francisco Health designed and implemented a digital chatbot-based workflow. Within 1 week of forming a team we conducted a product development sprint and deployed the digital screening process. In the first 2 months of use over 270 000 digital screens have been conducted. This process has reduced wait times for employees entering our hospitals during shift changes allowed for physical distancing at hospital entrances prevented higher-risk individuals from coming to work and provided our healthcare leaders with robust real-time data for make staffing decisions.;2020
The study examined humorous interactions with intelligent personal assistants (IPAs including Google Assistant Amazon Alexa Microsoft Cortana Apple Siri) with the aim of classifying user utterances IPA responses and user reactions of system responses. Data from online diaries and paper questionnaires were collected and analyzed using content analysis method. The findings suggest that the most frequent types of utterances include questions that test system personality and opinions. Joke requests are also frequent and produce pre-programmed humor that users generally find funny. The initial classification of humorous utterances has been validated and expanded using published datasets of humorous utterances for the four investigated IPAs. The findings can be used for immediate improvements to IPA performance as well as long-term development of IPA personas.;2020
The task of dialogue generation has attracted increasing attention due to its diverse downstream applications such as question-answering systems and chatbots. Recently the deep neural network (DNN)-based dialogue generation models have achieved superior performance against conventional models utilizing statistical machine learning methods. However despite that an enormous number of state-of-the-art DNN-based models have been proposed there lacks detailed empirical comparative analysis for them on the open Chinese corpus. As a result relevant researchers and engineers might find it hard to get an intuitive understanding of the current research progress. To address this challenge we conducted an empirical study for state-of-the-art DNN-based dialogue generation models in various Chinese corpora. Specifically extensive experiments were performed on several well-known single-turn and multi-turn dialogue corpora including KdConv Weibo and Douban to evaluate a wide range of dialogue generation models that are based on the symmetrical architecture of Seq2Seq RNNSearch transformer generative adversarial nets and reinforcement learning respectively. Moreover we paid special attention to the prevalent pre-trained model for the quality of dialogue generation. Their performances were evaluated by four widely-used metrics in this area: BLEU pseudo distinct and rouge. Finally we report a case study to show example responses generated by these models separately.;2020
The terrible cost of injuries and sudden illnesses does have fatal consequences that exposes the limitations of the current prehospital processes in terms of time for emergency staff to arrive on scene and lack of first aid skills among the available incident witnesses. In this paper we aim at developing a smart pervasive chatbot for emergency case assistance based on cloud computing called SPeCECA that assists victims or incident witnesses to help avoiding deterioration of the subject's condition and maintaining his/her physical integrity until the aid arrives which could dramatically increase the victim's survivability chances. Therefore even a person with no first aid skills can help the victim to survive by performing first aid support as suggested by the virtual assistant. Furthermore thanks to its connectivity with the emergency medical service trusted person(s) and the access to social media SPeCECA has its own way of alarming the emergency case in parallel after having released the degree of the emergency situation's severity. The proposed method is a mobile pervasive healthcare service in the form of a connected mobile application as a virtual assistant for the benefit of anyone facing an emergency case. The proposed chatbot allows an online human-bot interaction that supports different scenarios for every single emergency case. The design of the system is introduced by its six interdependent components: information pre-processing component (IPPC) natural language processing component (NLPC) context component (CC) information post-processing component (IPoPC) response generator component (RGC) and alert message constructor component (AMCC).;2020
The United States (US) population is aging and an increasing number of older adults (aged 65 and older) will experience chronic health issues that can threaten quality of life. We investigated older adults' willingness to use six distinct emerging technologies which can allow older adults to better manage their health and maintain independence. Data were collected by using a large-scale cross-sectional online survey which we designed and administered using Qualtrics. The analytical sample (N = 1148) reflected the sociodemographic characteristics of the US older adult population (aged 65 and older) based on the 2010 Census. A series of nested binary logistic regression models were used to assess the willingness to use each type of emerging technology. Our descriptive findings indicated that 19% of participants were willing to use autonomous vehicles 24% were willing to use assistive robots 37% were willing to use Internet-connected home appliances 48% were willing to use Internet-connected cameras for home monitoring 29% were willing to use a smart home with a built-in personal digital assistant and 15% were willing to use virtual reality. Our binary logistic regression results revealed that health variables e.g. limitations with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and self-reported health status (SRHS) had statistically significant associations with willingness to use some emerging technologies such as assistive robots. Our study provides novel insights regarding US older adults' willingness to use a range of emerging technologies. The findings may help guide future interventions aimed at enhancing health and independence for older adults.;2020
The use of natural language processing (NLP) methods and their application to developing conversational systems for health diagnosis increases patients' access to medical knowledge. In this study a chatbot service was developed for the Covenant University Doctor (CUDoctor) telehealth system based on fuzzy logic rules and fuzzy inference. The service focuses on assessing the symptoms of tropical diseases in Nigeria. Telegram Bot Application Programming Interface (API) was used to create the interconnection between the chatbot and the system while Twilio API was used for interconnectivity between the system and a short messaging service (SMS) subscriber. The service uses the knowledge base consisting of known facts on diseases and symptoms acquired from medical ontologies. A fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) is used to effectively predict the disease based on the symptoms inputted. The inputs of the users are recognized by NLP and are forwarded to the CUDoctor for decision support. Finally a notification message displaying the end of the diagnosis process is sent to the user. The result is a medical diagnosis system which provides a personalized diagnosis utilizing self-input from users to effectively diagnose diseases. The usability of the developed system was evaluated using the system usability scale (SUS) yielding a mean SUS score of 80.4 which indicates the overall positive evaluation.;2020
The use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for dialogue policy optimization has been the new trend for dialogue management systems. Several methods have been proposed which are trained on dialogue data to provide optimal system response. However most of these approaches exhibit performance degradation in the presence of noise poor scalability to other domains as well as performance instabilities. To overcome these problems we propose a novel approach based on the incremental sample-efficient Least-Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) algorithm which is trained on compact fixed-size dialogue state encodings obtained from deep Variational Denoising Autoencoders (VDAE). The proposed scheme exhibits stable and noise-robust performance which significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art even in mismatched noise environments.;2020
The Web is a constantly evolving complex system with important implications for both marketers and consumers. In this paper we contend that over the next five to ten years society will see a shift in the nature of the Web as consumers firms and regulators become increasingly concerned about privacy. In particular we predict that as a result of this privacy-focus various information sharing and protection practices currently found on the Dark Web will be increasingly adapted in the overall Web and in the process firms will lose much of their ability to fuel a modern marketing machinery that relies on abundant rich and timely consumer data. In this type of controlled information-sharing environment we foresee the emersion of two distinct types of consumers: (1) those generally willing to share their information with marketers (Buffs) and (2) those who generally deny access to their personal information (Ghosts). We argue that one way marketers can navigate this new environment is by effectively designing and deploying conversational agents (CAs) often referred to as chatbots. In particular we propose that CAs may be used to understand and engage both types of consumers while providing personalization and serving both as a form of differentiation and as an important strategic asset for the firm-one capable of eliciting self-disclosure of otherwise private consumer information.;2020
The WebRTC protocol can provide live streaming of peer-to-peer connections via JavaScript (JS) application programming interface (API) calls to a web browser. However the protocol is restricted to a small number of peers because there is no simple way to mix real-time streams from multiple peers and then distribute the mixed stream to a large number of audiences. For example it is necessary to mix audio and video streams from peers in a conversation and broadcast the real-time mixed stream to more than 10k audiences who only watch the video. It is also necessary to blend synchronous content (e.g. logos music) to the live conversation stream. WebRTC does not currently provide a mechanism to easily support these cases. This paper proposes a method for the synchronized mixing of real-time audio/video streams from multiple peers while minimizing latency. This method enables the implementation of an online live conversation system that is able to mix live conversation streams from multiple peers and then rebroadcast the mixed stream to a large number of audiences.;2020
The wecoach is a web-application that builds the capacities of team leaders to improve working conditions that are positively related to the psychological health and well-being of their team members. The web-application works through an automated rule-based chat enhanced by machine learning. This so-called conversational agent guides the team leader through a systematic project cycle providing a mind map of work and health training materials self-assessments and online tools to conduct team surveys and workshops as well as self-evaluation of progress and effectiveness. In this paper we present the development process of this web-application which resulted in (1) a comprehensive intervention approach (2) the prototype and (3) the implementation of an evaluation design for a multi-level randomized controlled trial.;2020
There has been a lot of recent interest in the natural language processing (NLP) community in the computational processing of language varieties and dialects with the aim to improve the performance of applications such as machine translation speech recognition and dialogue systems. Here we attempt to survey this growing field of research with focus on computational methods for processing similar languages varieties and dialects. In particular we discuss the most important challenges when dealing with diatopic language variation and we present some of the available datasets the process of data collection and the most common data collection strategies used to compile datasets for similar languages varieties and dialects. We further present a number of studies on computational methods developed and/or adapted for preprocessing normalization part-of-speech tagging and parsing similar languages language varieties and dialects. Finally we discuss relevant applications such as language and dialect identification and machine translation for closely related languages language varieties and dialects.;2020
There is a great interest shown by academic researchers to continuously improve the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for natural answer generation (NAG) in chatbots. The Seq2Seq model shows a weakness whereby the model tends to generate answers that are generic meaningless and inconsistent with the questions. However a comprehensive literature review on the factors contributing to the weakness and potential solutions are still missing. Therefore this review article fills the gap by reviewing Seq2Seq based natural answer generation-based literature to identify those factors and proposed methods to address the weakness. This literature review identified several factors such as input question is not sufficient to determine a meaningful output usage of cross-entropy function as the loss function during training infrequent words in training data language model influence which generates answers not relevant to the question utilization of teacher forcing method during training which results in exposure bias long sentences and inability to consider dialogue history as the factors. Additionally this literature review also identified and reviewed the methods proposed to address the weakness such as utilizing additional embedding and encoders using different loss functions and training approaches as well as utilizing other mechanisms like copying source word(s) and paying attention to a certain portion of the input. For discussion these methods are categorized into four broad categories which are Structural Modifications Augmented Learning Beam Search and Complementary Mechanisms. Additionally the paper highlights unexplored areas in Seq2Seq modeling and proposes potential future works for natural answer generation.;2020
There is a resurgent interest in developing intelligent open-domain dialog systems due to the availability of large amounts of conversational data and the recent progress on neural approaches to conversational Al [33]. Unlike traditional task-oriented bots an open-domain dialog system aims to establish long-term connections with users by satisfying the human need for communication affection and social belonging. This article reviews the recent work on neural approaches that are devoted to addressing three challenges in developing such systems: semantics consistency and Interactiveness. Semantics requires a dialog system to not only understand the content of the dialog but also identify users' emotional and social needs during the conversation. Consistency requires the system to demonstrate a consistent personality to win users' trust and gain their long-term confidence. Interactiveness refers to the system's ability to generate interpersonal responses to achieve particular social goals such as entertainment and conforming. The studies we select to present in this survey are based on our unique views and are by no means complete. Nevertheless we hope that the discussion will inspire new research in developing more intelligent open-domain dialog systems.;2020
This article describes Daphne a virtual assistant for designing Earth observation distributed spacecraft missions. It is to the best of our knowledge the first virtual assistant for such application. The article provides a thorough description of Daphne including its question answering system and the main features we have implemented to help system engineers design distributed spacecraft missions. In addition the article describes a study performed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to assess the usefulness of Daphne in this use case. The study was conducted with N = 9 subjects from JPL who were asked to work on a mission design task with two versions of Daphne one that was fully featured implementing the cognitive assistance functions and one that only had the features one would find in a traditional design space exploration tool. After the task they filled out a standard user experience survey completed a test to assess how much they learned about the task and were asked a number of questions in a semi-structured exit interview. Results of the study suggest that Daphne can help improve performance during system design tasks compared to traditional tools while keeping the system usable. However the study also raises some concerns with respect to a potential reduction in human learning due to the use of the cognitive assistant. The article ends with a list of suggestions for future development of virtual assistants for space mission design.;2020
This article describes the development of Microsoft XiaoIce the most popular social chatbot in the world. XiaoIce is uniquely designed as an artifical intelligence companion with an emotional connection to satisfy the human need for communication affection and social belonging. We take into account both intelligent quotient and emotional quotient in system design cast human-machine social chat as decision-making over Markov Decision Processes and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement measured in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system architecture and key components including dialogue manager core chat skills and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically recognizes human feelings and states understands user intent and responds to user needs throughout long conversations. Since the release in 2014 XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with many of them. Analysis of large-scale online logs shows that XiaoIce has achieved an average CPS of 23 which is significantly higher than that of other chatbots and even human conversations.;2020
This article explores the impact of digital technologies including tele-health teleconsultations wireless devices and chatbots in pediatrics. Automated digital health with the Internet of things will allow better collection of real-world data for generation of real-world evidence to improve child health. Artificial intelligence with predictive analytics in turn will drive evidence-based decision-support systems and deliver personalized care to children. This technology creates building blocks for a learning child health and health care ecosystem.;2020
This article explores the institutional logics of intrapreneurial units or groups within organizations that are designated to foster organizational innovation. Drawing on interviews with news intrapreneurs developing chatbots in news media organizations this study shows that innovation can be stymied because of conflicting institutional logics. News intrapreneurs adopt a logic of experimentation audience orientation and efficiency-seeking but that approach clashes with a journalistic logic prioritizing news workflows formats and associated autonomy for newsworkers. These clashing logics limit the adoption and influence of chatbots. This study illustrates the shaping influence of competing institutional logics and their negotiation in the development deployment and success or failure of intrapreneurial activities within organizations. The lesson is not that the existence of competing logics is by default a defeating proposition for innovation. Rather this study advances scholarly understanding of the role of institutional logics in frustrating or facilitating technological adoption in organizations.;2020
This article explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots for creating positive change by supporting customers in the digital realm. Our study which focuses on the customer and his/her declarative psychological responses to an interaction with a virtual assistant will fill a gap in the digital marketing research where little attention has been paid to the impact of Error and Gender as well as the extent to which Social Presence and Perceived Competence mediate the relationships between Anthropomorphic design cues and Trust. We provide consistent evidence of the significant negative effect of erroneous conversational interfaces on several constructs considered in our conceptual model such as: perceived competence trust as well as positive consumer responses. We also provide support to previous research findings and confirm that people employ a biased thinking across gender and this categorization also influences their acceptance of chatbots taking social roles. The results of an empirical study demonstrated that highly anthropomorphized female chatbots that engage in social behaviors are significantly shaping positive consumer responses even in the error condition. Moreover female virtual assistants are much more commonly forgiven when committing errors compared to male chatbots.;2020
This article presents the framework Capability Sensitive Design (CSD) which consists of merging the design methodology Value Sensitive Design (VSD) with Martha Nussbaum's capability theory. CSD aims to normatively assess technology design in general and technology design for health and wellbeing in particular. Unique to CSD is its ability to account for human diversity and to counter (structural) injustices that manifest in technology design. The basic framework of CSD is demonstrated by applying it to the hypothetical design case of a therapy chatbot for mental health. By applying CSD to a design case the merits of this new framework over the standard VSD approach become apparent. Also the application demonstrates what a technology design would look like when attention is paid to capabilities right from the start of the design process.;2020
This article proposes a computer-based approach to effectively enhance second language learners' willingness to communicate in the target language. To do so we implemented a conversational agent embedding a dialogue management model based on two conversational strategies (i.e. communication strategies and affective backchannels) serving as scaffolds for enhancing learners' willingness to communicate in the target language. Here we report on differences observed among second language learners' preferences for both conversational strategies according to their initial level of willingness to communicate and on variations of their willingness with respect to such differences. Although we found that most students generally preferred a combination of both strategies learners' preferences and the effects of the support provided by these strategies varied according to their level of willingness to communicate. Learners with lower willingness to communicate tended to prefer affective backchannels whereas those with higher willingness to communicate seemed to favor communication strategies. These results were consistent with post-test results which showed that learners' expected willingness to communicate tended to be higher after interacting with systems embedding their preferred strategies. In sum these results are preliminary evidence of the meaningfulness of accounting for such learners' preferences in adaptively using and fading the strategies employed by conversational agents to motivate second language learners to communicate in the target language.;2020
This article proposes an approach to response generation using a Parallel Double Q-learning algorithm for dialog policy decision in a conversational system. First a new semantic representation of the user's input sentence is presented by using the CKIP parser to derive the semantic dependency sequence of the input sentence. Then a Gated Recurrent Unit-based Autoencoder is used to obtain the user's turn representation as well as context representation. A Parallel Double Q-learning algorithm with a Deep Neural Network (PD-DQN) combining two Double DQNs in parallel for the contextual and semantic information in the user's message respectively are proposed to determine the dialog act. Finally the user's input and the determined dialog act are fed to an attention-based Transformer model to generate the response template. With the generated response template the semantic slots are filled with their corresponding values to obtain the final sentence response. This article collects a multi-turn conversation database consisting of 4186 turns in the travel domain and 447 chitchat question-answer pairs as the evaluation corpus. Five-fold cross validation is employed for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach based on semantic dependency for intent detection increases the accuracy by 4.3%. For dialog policy decision the PD-DQN achieves 87.57% task success rate which is 13.9% higher than the baseline Double DQN (73.67%). Finally using the attention-based Transformer for response template generation obtains a Bleu score of 13.6 improved by 1.5 compared to the Sequence-to-Sequence model. In subjective evaluation both the dialog policy and sentence generation model achieve a higher appropriateness and grammatical correctness scores than the baseline system.;2020
This article proposes an utterance-to-utterance interactive matching network (U2U-IMN) for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots. Different from previous methods following context-to-response matching or utterance-to-response matching frameworks this model treats both contexts and responses as sequences of utterances when calculating the matching degrees between them. For a context-response pair the U2U-IMN model first encodes each utterance separately using recurrent and self-attention layers. Then a global and bidirectional interaction between the context and the response is conducted using the attention mechanism to collect the matching information between them. The distances between context and response utterances are employed as a prior component when calculating the attention weights. Finally sentence-level aggregation and context-response-level aggregation are executed in turn to obtain the feature vector for matching degree prediction. Experiments on four public datasets showed that our proposed method outperformed baseline methods on all metrics achieving a new state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating compatibility across domains for multi-turn response selection.;2020
This paper describes a solution for the Noetic End-to-End Response Selection challenge - one of the tasks of the 7th Dialog System Technology Challenge. The goal of the task is to select the most appropriate continuation of a dialogue from a given set of responses. We approach this problem by building an ensemble of supervised neural network based classifiers and unsupervised similarity models. The dialogue continuation is selected according to a score that aggregates the rankings of candidate responses determined by the models in the ensemble. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

This paper discusses how a microlevel linguistic analysis using interactional sociolinguistics as an umbrella framework and drawing on analytical concepts from politeness theory and conversation analysis can be used to advise chatbot designers on the interactional features contributing to problematic human user engagement as part of a consultancy project. Existing research using a microlevel linguistic analysis has analysed human user:bot interactions using natural language. This research has identified a central role for language which promotes sociability between the machine and users in the alignment of their goals and practices. However there is no research currently which discusses how a microlevel linguistic analysis can help identify how the discursive construction of alignment and affiliation within prompt:response chatbots supports social presence and trust. This paper addresses this gap through an analysis of a database of prompt:response chatbot interactions which identified problematic sequences involving misalignment and disaffiliation undermining human users' trust and sense of social presence within the interaction. It also reports on how the consultancy project suggested changes to the programming of the chatbot which have potential to lead to improved user engagement and satisfaction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper introduces an approach to automatic domain modeling for human-robot interaction. The proposed approach is symbolic and intended for semantically unconstrained task-oriented human-robot interaction domains. At the specification level it is cognitively inspired addressing selected cognitive mechanisms of the human memory system (e.g. integration semantic categorization associative learning etc.) that are relevant for natural language human-robot interaction. We discuss a corpus-based validation of the introduced approach and report on its particular implementation within the conversational agent integrated with a human-like robot.;2020
This paper introduces our systems built for Track 2 of Dialog System Technology Challenge 7 (DSTC7). This challenge track aimed to evaluate the response generation methods using fully data-driven conversation models in a knowledge-grounded setting where textual facts were provided as the knowledge for each context-response pair. The sequence-to-sequence models have achieved impressive results in machine translation and have also been widely used for end-to-end generative conversation modelling. However they tended to output dull and repeated responses in previous studies. Our work aims to promote the diversity of end-to-end conversation response generation by adopting a two-stage pipeline. 1) Create multiple responses for an input context together with its textual facts. At this stage two different models are designed i.e. a variational generative (VariGen) model and a retrieval-based (Retrieval) model. 2) Rank and return the most relevant response by training a topic coherence discrimination (TCD) model for calculating ranking scores. In our experiments we demonstrated the effectiveness of the response ranking strategy and the external textual knowledge for generating better responses. According to the official evaluation results our Retrieval and VariGen systems ranked first and second respectively among all participant systems on Entropy metrics which measured the objective diversity of generated responses. Besides the VariGen system ranked second on NIST and METEOR metrics which measured the objective quality of generated responses. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2020
This paper presents a study about communicability of conversational interfaces (namely chatbots) under a semiotic perspective. A chatbot is a software system that allows you to simulate real conversations between devices and users by means of a conversational interface (CI). After introducing the chatbot concept focusing on its advantages and issues we will present two domains of use in which chatbot interfaces can be effective: healthcare and smart home. For carrying out simple tasks such as finding information or triggering operations users need an easy-to-use and to an easy-to-learn system to communicate with. To face this conversational interfaces represent the latest trend in the field of digital design. For studying the communicability aspects of a CI we carried out a user test to compare traditional and chatbot interfaces. This paper aims at evaluating the benefits at the communicability level of a chatbot in comparison to traditional GUI for incrementing the effectiveness and efficacy of communication between users and the system specifically for users with poor attitude in using technologies. In details we evaluated the communicability of two prototypes that can be used to solve simple tasks in order to favour user inclusion including everyone with very little exposure to technologies.;2020
This paper presents an exploratory study on using conversational interfaces (CIs) to support physicians in conducting occupational health consultations. The CI was achieved through a web-based information dashboard with a chatbot assistant for providing real-time suggestions through text messages. Two system designs were developed: the first using a proactive chatbot the second using an on-demand type of interaction. The effectiveness of the proposed CI and the two types of chatbot designs were investigated in a field study consisted of eight healthcare consultations. Quantitative results showed that the CI was positively evaluated as a reliable tool to be used during medical consultations and that occupational health physicians were eager to use this technology in their work. The qualitative data analysis suggested that our design concept might improve the workflow during the consultation particularly with respect to the access to relevant information and structured decision-making processes using valuable references. The on-demand lightweight type of chatbot interaction was better perceived than the proactive one. Based on these findings we discuss implications for the future development of occupational health consultation based on CI and their potential contribution to computer-assisted data-driven healthcare.;2020
This paper presents DisBot the first Portuguese speaking chatbot that uses social media retrieved knowledge to support citizens and first-responders in disaster scenarios in order to improve community resilience and decision-making. It was developed and tested using Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) being progressively matured with field specialists through several design and development iterations. DisBot uses a state-of-the-art Dual Intent Entity Transformer (DIET) architecture to classify user intents and makes use of several dialogue policies for managing user conversations as well as storing relevant information to be used in further dialogue turns. To generate responses it uses real-world safety knowledge and infers a dynamic knowledge graph that is dynamically updated in real-time by a disaster-related knowledge extraction tool presented in previous works. Through its development iterations DisBot has been validated by field specialists who have considered it to be a valuable asset in disaster management.;2020
This paper presents HRIChat a framework for developing closed-domain chat dialogue systems. Being able to engage in chat dialogues has been found effective for improving communication between humans and dialogue systems. This paper focuses on closed-domain systems because they would be useful when combined with task-oriented dialogue systems in the same domain. HRIChat enables domain-dependent language understanding so that it can deal well with domain-specific utterances. In addition HRIChat makes it possible to integrate state transition network-based dialogue management and reaction-based dialogue management. FoodChatbot which is an application in the food and restaurant domain has been developed and evaluated through a user study. Its results suggest that reasonably good systems can be developed with HRIChat. This paper also reports lessons learned from the development and evaluation of FoodChatbot. (C) 2020 The Authors.

This paper provides detailed information about the seventh Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC7) and its three tracks aimed to explore the problem of building robust and accurate end-to-end dialog systems. In more detail DSTC7 focuses on developing and exploring end-to-end technologies for the following three pragmatic challenges: (1) sentence selection for multiple domains (2) generation of informational responses grounded in external knowledge and (3) audio visual scene-aware dialog to allow conversations with users about objects and events around them. This paper summarizes the overall setup and results of DSTC7 including detailed descriptions of the different tracks provided datasets and annotations overview of the submitted systems and their final results. For Track 1 LSTM-based models performed best across both datasets allowing teams to effectively handle task variants where no correct answer was present or when multiple paraphrases were included. For Track 2 RNN-based architectures augmented to incorporate facts by using two types of encoders: a dialog encoder and a fact encoder plus using attention mechanisms and a pointer-generator approach provided the best results. Finally for Track 3 the best model used Hierarchical Attention mechanisms to combine the text and vision information obtaining a 22% better result than the baseline LSTM system for the human rating score. More than 220 participants were registered and about 40 teams participated in the final challenge. 32 scientific papers reporting the systems submitted to DSTC7 and 3 general technical papers for dialog technologies were presented during the one-day wrap-up workshop at AAAI-19. During the workshop we reviewed the state-of-the-art systems shared novel approaches to the DSTC7 tasks and discussed the future directions for the challenge (DSTC8). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper sheds light on the role of digital platform labour in the development of today's artificial intelligence predicated on data-intensive machine learning algorithms. Focus is on the specific ways in which outsourcing of data tasks to myriad 'micro-workers' recruited and managed through specialized platforms powers virtual assistants self-driving vehicles and connected objects. Using qualitative data from multiple sources we show that micro-work performs a variety of functions between three poles that we label respectively 'artificial intelligence preparation' 'artificial intelligence verification' and 'artificial intelligence impersonation'. Because of the wide scope of application of micro-work it is a structural component of contemporary artificial intelligence production processes - not an ephemeral form of support that may vanish once the technology reaches maturity stage. Through the lens of micro-work we prefigure the policy implications of a future in which data technologies do not replace human workforce but imply its marginalization and precariousness.;2020
This paper(1) presents a study on understanding what the users say in chatbot systems: the situation where users input utterances bots would hopefully (1) detect intents and (2) recognize corresponding contexts implied by utterances. This helps bots better understand what users are saying and act upon a much wider range of actions. To this end we propose a framework which models the first task as a classification problem and the second one as a two-layer sequence labeling problem. The framework explores deep neural networks to automatically learn useful features at both character and word levels. We apply this framework to building a chatbot in a Vietnamese e-commerce domain to help retail brands better communicate with their customers. Experimental results on four newly-built datasets demonstrate that deep neural networks could be able to outperform strong conventional machine-learning methods. In detecting intents we achieve the best F-measure of 82.32%. In extracting contexts the proposed method yields promising F-measures ranging from 78% to 91% depending on specific types of contexts.;2020
This research aims to build a Mandarin named entity recognition (NER) module using transfer learning to facilitate damage information gathering and analysis in disaster management. The hybrid NER approach proposed in this research includes three modules: (1) data augmentation which constructs a concise data set for disaster management (2) reference model which utilizes the bidirectional long short-term memory-conditional random field framework to implement NER and (3) the augmented model built by integrating the first two modules via cross-domain transfer with disparate label sets. Through the combination of established rules and learned sentence patterns the hybrid approach performs well in NER tasks for disaster management and recognizes unfamiliar words successfully. This research applied the proposed NER module to disaster management. In the application we favorably handled the NER tasks of our related work and achieved our desired outcomes. Through proper transfer the results of this work can be extended to other fields and consequently bring valuable advantages in diverse applications.;2020
This study examined how artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots impact user experience. It collected survey data from 1064 consumers who used any chatbot service from the top 30 brands in the U.S. Results indicated that utilitarian (information) hedonic (entertainment) technology (media appeal) and social (social presence) gratifications obtained from chatbot use positively predicted users' satisfaction with chatbot services of their selected brand. In contrast perceived privacy risk associated with chatbot use reduced user satisfaction. Data also demonstrated that user satisfaction positively affected both the continued use intention of chatbot services and customer loyalty. Implications of this study are discussed.;2020
This study examines the persuasion mechanism in product recommendations made by a voice-based conversational agent and explores whether the personalized content reflecting the customer's preferences and the agent's social role of a friend rather than a secretary generate a more positive attitude toward the product in the context of voice shopping. With the framework of dual modes of information-processing models we hypothesized that the personalization of messages would be a central mute with a greater impact on attitude for products with high involvement. By contrast the social role of the conversational agent was expected to represent a peripheral route with a greater impact on products with low involvement. An experimental study was designed to test the effects of personalized content that reflected individual preferences for product attributes and a friend role of a voice agent with high and low product involvement. The results showed main effects of both personalization and the social role on building attitudes toward the product. Although no interaction effect for personalization and involvement was found there was a significant interaction effect for the social role and involvement. This study contributes to persuasion theory by extending it to the interaction with a conversational agent. For practitioners the study provides insights into the importance of the personalized content of recommendations and the need for consideration of an alternative social role in the design of voice shopping through a conversational agent.;2020
This study explores TV viewers' user experience (UX) of the conversational agent (CA) assisted interactions while watching TV. In the human-computer interaction field the user experience is primarily measured through performance and subjective self-reported data. But TV is an entertainment medium the user experience of TV viewers should be determined based on how much the TV viewers enjoyed and immersed rather than productivity or performance. It is also necessary to collect objective data as well as subjective self-report results of emotional experiences. Although the CA is becoming increasingly common in everyday life the user satisfaction is still not high. However this is mainly a result of evaluation in the performance aspect and few studies have been carried out on the overall user experience including emotional aspects. To comparatively analyze the user experience with the CA interface and remote control unit (RCU) interface we adopted physiological measurements for objective data as well as self-report questionnaires. Among the physiological measurement results skin conductance (SC) differed between CA and RCU interactions. SC was high at the beginning of the CA interaction but decreased over time. In RCU sessions SC maintained a constant value or rather increased. In the self-reporting results the ergonomic quality of the RCU was higher than that of the CA. However CA was evaluated more positively in terms of hedonic quality. CA had a greater effect on the overall attractiveness while having more emotional appeal. Additionally a partial correlation between objective data and self-report results could be observed. In sum subjective self-reports showed that CA provides a more positive TV UX with regard to emotional aspects. Physiological measurement results provide objective data for further understanding user experience by showing specific differences in cognitive involvement and emotional response changes during user interactions.;2020
This study investigates the public's initial trust in so-called artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots about to be introduced into use in the public sector. While the societal impacts of AI are widely speculated about empirical testing remains rare. To narrow this gap this study builds on theories of operators' trust in machines in industrial settings and proposes that initial public trust in chatbot responses depends on (i) the area of enquiry since expectations about a chatbot's performance vary with the topic and (ii) the purposes that governments communicate to the public for introducing the use of chatbots. Analyses based on an experimental online survey in Japan generated results indicating that if a government were to announce its intention to use AI chatbots to answer public enquiries the public's initial trust in their responses would be lower in the area of parental support than in the area of waste separation with a moderate effect size. Communicating purposes that would directly benefit citizens such as achieving uniformity in response quality and timeliness in responding would enhance public trust in chatbots. Although the effect sizes are small communicating these purposes might be still worthwhile as it would be an inexpensive measure for a government to take.;2020
This study was undertaken to analyze whether luxury fashion retail brands can adhere to their core essence of providing personalized care through e-services rather than through traditional face-to-face interactions particularly through Chatbot an emerging digital tool offering convenient personal and unique customer assistance. The authors use customer data to test a five-dimension model measuring Chatbot for customer perceptions of interaction entertainment trendiness customization and problem-solving. The study reveals that Chatbot e-service provides interactive and engaging brand/customer service encounters. Marketers and managers in the luxury context can adopt the instrument to measure whether e-service agents provide desired outcomes and to determine whether they should adopt Chatbot virtual assistance.;2020
This work is extended from our participation in the 7th Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC7) where we participated in the Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialogue System (AVSD) track. The AVSD track evaluates how dialogue systems understand video scenes and responds to users about the video visual and audio content. We propose a hierarchical attention approach on user queries video caption audio and visual features that contribute to improved evaluation results. We also apply a nonlinear feature fusion approach to combine the visual and audio features for better knowledge representation. Our proposed model shows superior performance in terms of both objective evaluation and human rating as compared to the baselines. In this extended work we also provide a more extensive review of the related work conduct additional experiments with word-level and context-level pretrained embeddings and investigate different qualitative aspects of the generated responses.

This work takes us through the literature on applications of genetic programming to problems of natural language processing. The purpose of natural language processing is to allow us to communicate with computers in natural language. Among the problems addressed in the area is for example the extraction of information which draws relevant data from unstructured texts written in natural language. There are also domains of application of particular relevance because of the difficulty in dealing with the corresponding documents such as opinion mining in social networks or because of the need for high precision in the information extracted such as the biomedical domain. There have been proposals to apply genetic programming techniques in several of these areas. This tour allows us to observe the potential-not yet fully exploited-of such applications. We also review some cases in which genetic programming can provide information that is absent from other approaches revealing its ability to provide easy to interpret results in form of programs or functions. Finally we identify some important challenges in the area.;2020
Through online tools virtual assistants and other technology governments increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to help the public understand and apply the law. The Internal Revenue Service for example encourages taxpayers to seek answers regarding various tax credits and deductions through its online Interactive Tax Assistant. The U.S. Army directs individuals with questions about enlistment to its virtual guide Sgt. Star. And the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services suggests that potential green card holders and citizens speak with its interactive chatbot Emma. Through such automated legal guidance the government seeks to provide advice to the public at a fraction of the cost of employing human beings to perform these same tasks. This Article offers one of the first critiques of these new systems of artificial intelligence. It shows that automated legal guidance currently relies upon the concept of simplexity whereby complex law is presented as though it is simple without actually engaging in simplification of the underlying law. While this approach offers potential gains in terms of efficiency and ease of use it also causes the government to present the law as simpler than it is leading to less precise advice and potentially inaccurate legal positions. Using the Interactive Tax Assistant as a case study the Article shows that the use of simplexity in automated legal guidance is more powerful and pervasive than in static publications because it is personalized non-qualified and instantaneous. Further it argues that understanding the costs as well as the benefits of current forms of automated legal guidance is essential to evaluating even more sophisticated but also more opaque automated systems that governments are likely to adopt in the future. With these considerations in mind the Article offers three recommendations to policymakers. First it argues that governments should prevent automated legal guidance from widening the gap between access to legal advice enjoyed by high-income and by low-income individuals. Second it argues that governments should introduce more robust oversight and review processes for automated legal guidance. Finally it argues that the government should allow individuals to avoid certain penalties and sanctions when they have taken actions or claimed legal positions in reliance upon automated legal guidance. Unless these steps are taken we believe that the costs of these automated legal guidance systems may soon come to outweigh their benefits.;2020
To advance multi-domain (cross-domain) dialogue modeling as well as alleviate the shortage of Chinese task-oriented datasets we propose CrossWOZ the first large-scale Chinese Cross-Domain Wizard-of-Oz task-oriented dataset. It contains 6K dialogue sessions and 102K utterances for 5 domains including hotel restaurant attraction metro and taxi. Moreover the corpus contains rich annotation of dialogue states and dialogue acts on both user and system sides. About 60% of the dialogues have cross-domain user goals that favor inter-domain dependency and encourage natural transition across domains in conversation. We also provide a user simulator and several benchmark models for pipelined task-oriented dialogue systems which will facilitate researchers to compare and evaluate their models on this corpus. The large size and rich annotation of CrossWOZ make it suitable to investigate a variety of tasks in cross-domain dialogue modeling such as dialogue state tracking policy learning user simulation etc.;2020
To be really effective conversational agents must integrate well with the characteristics of the humans with whom they interact. This exploratory study focuses on a method for integrating well-assessed methods from the field of social psychology in the design of task-oriented conversational agents in which the dialogue management module is developed through machine learning. In particular the aim is to achieve agents whose policies could take into account the psychological features of the human interactants to deliver personalized and more effective messages. The paper presents the psychological study performed and outlines the overall theoretical architecture of the software framework proposed. On the psychosocial side we first assessed the effectiveness of differently framed messages aimed to reducing red meat consumption taking the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the psychosocial model of reference. Turning to the machine learning field the resulting Structural Equation Model (SEM) was first translated into a probabilistic predictor using Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). In turn such DBN became the fundamental element of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) in a reinforcement learning setting. The possibility to elicit complete interaction policies was then studied by applying Neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (Neural MCTS) methods. The results thus obtained introduce the possibility to develop new multidisciplinary and integrated techniques for the development of automated dialogue managing systems.;2020
To combat the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) numerous governments have established phone hotlines to prescreen potential cases. These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers leading to wait times of hours or even an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly we showed that Symptoma's accuracy far exceeds that of simple yes-no questionnaires widely available online. In summary Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20000 other diseases. Furthermore Symptoma allows free text input furthered with disease-specific follow up questions in 36 languages. Combined these results and accessibility give Symptoma the potential to be a key tool in the global fight against COVID-19.;2020
To gain competitive advantages and sustainable service innovation hotels are considering artificial intelligence technologies (AI) including robots kiosks for service automation and chatbots. However due to the change of the service process and unfamiliar communication interface hotel customers may have difficulties in adopting the new change. In this paper we tried to find out if the failure of AI-based services would affect customers' perception. For this we designed the experiment by separating AI (i.e. chatbot) services and self-service technology (SST i.e. pad) services and service failures and successful cases respectively. As a result SST showed more positive perceptions and revisit intention in the successful service situation. The service failure situation showed no differences between chatbot and SST. In addition novelty and the need for interaction characteristics of customers showed significant differences between groups in terms of service success and failure respectively. Additionally we explored negative word-of-mouth (WOM) to learn further effects by service failures and successes.;2020
To mitigate the ambiguity of spoken language understanding (SLU) of an utterance we propose contextual models that can consider the relevant context by using temporal and content-related information effectively. We first propose two axes: 'Awareness' and 'Attention Level'. Awareness includes three methods that consider the timing or content-similarity of context. The Attention Level includes three methods that consider speaker roles to calculate the importance of each historic utterance. By combining one method from each axis we build various contextual models. The proposed models are designed to use a dataset to automatically learn the importance of previous utterances in terms of time and content. We also propose various speaker information that would be helpful to improve SLU accuracy. The proposed models achieved state-of-the-art F1 scores in experiments on the Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) 4 and Loqui benchmark datasets. We applied in-depth analysis to verify that the proposed methods are effective to improve SLU accuracy. The analysis also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

To overcome novel challenges in complex domestic environments humanoid robots can learn from human teachers. We propose that the capability for social interaction should be a key factor in this teaching process and benefits both the subjective experience of the human user and the learning process itself. To support our hypothesis we present a Human-Robot Interaction study on human-assisted visuomotor learning with the robot NICO the Neuro-Inspired COmpanion a child-sized humanoid. NICO is a flexible social platform with sensing and manipulation abilities. We give a detailed description of NICO's design and a comprehensive overview of studies that use or evaluate NICO. To engage in social interaction NICO can express stylized facial expressions and utter speech via an Embodied Dialogue System. NICO is characterized in particular by combining these social interaction capabilities with the abilities for human-like object manipulation and crossmodal perception. In the presented study NICO acquires visuomotor grasping skills by interacting with its environment. In contrast to methods like motor babbling the learning process is in part supported by a human teacher. To begin the learning process an object is placed into NICO's hand and if this object is accidentally dropped the human assistant has to recover it. The study is conducted with 24 participants with little or no prior experience with robots. In therobot-guidedexperimental condition assistance is actively requested by NICO via the Embodied Dialogue System. In thehuman-guidedcondition instructions are given by a human experimenter while NICO remains silent. Evaluation using established questionnaires like Godspeed Mind Perception and Uncanny Valley Indices along with a structured interview and video analysis of the interaction show that the robot's active requests for assistance foster the participant's engagement and benefit the learning process. This result supports the hypothesis that the ability for social interaction is a key factor for companion robots that learn with the help of non-expert teachers as these robots become capable of communicating active requests or questions that are vital to their learning process. We also show how the design of NICO both enables and is driven by this approach.;2020
To prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to continue responding to healthcare needs hospitals are rapidly adopting telehealth and other digital health tools to deliver care remotely. Intelligent conversational agents and virtual assistants such as chatbots and voice assistants have been utilized to augment health service capacity to screen symptoms deliver healthcare information and reduce exposure. In this commentary we examined the state of voice assistants (e.g. Google Assistant Apple Siri Amazon Alexa) as an emerging tool for remote healthcare delivery service and discussed the readiness of the health system and technology providers to adapt voice assistants as an alternative healthcare delivery modality during a health crisis and pandemic.;2020
Today users can interact with popular virtual assistants such as Siri to accomplish their tasks on a digital environment. In these systems links between natural language requests and their concrete realizations are specified at the conception phase. A more adaptive approach would be to allow the user to provide natural language instructions or demonstrations when a task is unknown by the assistant. An adaptive solution should allow the virtual assistant to operate a much larger digital environment composed of multiple application domains and providers and better match user needs. We have previously developed robotic systems inspired by human language developmental studies that provide such a usage-based adaptive capacity. Here we extend this approach to human interaction with a virtual assistant that can first learn the mapping between verbal commands and basic action semantics of a specific domain. Then it can learn higher level mapping by combining previously learned procedural knowledge in interaction with the user. The flexibility of the system is demonstrated as the virtual assistant can learn actions in new domains (e-mail Wikipedia etc.) and then can learn how e-mail and Wikipedia basic procedures can be combined to form hybrid procedural knowledge.;2020
Today breast cancer survivability prediction becomes one of the challenging tasks among medical practitioners and researchers as it is the most frequent cancer-affecting females globally. In healthcare domain usually clinical data are high dimensional sparse and complex and sometimes there exists few amounts of time-to-event instances. Moreover building an accurate survival model from electronic health records is another herculean task. This study aimed to predict survivability of breast cancer patients by using data analytics model and development of Chatbot for providing recommendation to user. This research work addresses the aforementioned issues by providing a novel survival analysis framework by using data analytics model. First this approach provides a better understanding of breast cancer survivability in presence of missing data then establishing associates of patients that share similar properties by using K-means unsupervised learning algorithm. In addition a simple effective recommendation approach based on Artificial neural network (ANN) and Linear regression model is developed for breast cancer survival analysis. The obtained results showed that ANN has a greater effect on survival performance improvement in the case that have corpus of data because of stronger unsupervised feature learning.;2020
Today the knowledge base question answering (KB-QA) system is promising to achieve a large-scale high-quality reply in the e-commerce industry. However there exist two major challenges to efficiently support large-scale KB-QA systems. On the one hand it is difficult to serve tens of thousands of online stores (i.e. constrained by the tuning and deployment time) and it would perform poorly if the systems start without a sufficient number of chat records. On the other hand current KB-QA systems cannot be updated in an efficient way due to the high cost of knowledge base (KB) updating. In this article we propose an automatic learning scheme for KB-QA systems called ALKB-QA using a vector modeling method to address the preceding two main challenges. The ALKB-QA system provides online stores with basic KB templates that are suitable for many common occasions and this feature enables the ability to deploy chatbots for a large number of online stores in a short time. Then the KBs are further updated automatically to adapt to their own businesses (meet different specific needs) leading to increased reply accuracy. Our work has three main contributions. First the proposed ALKB-QA system has a good business model in the e-commerce industry (serving tens of thousands of online stores with low cost) breaking the scalability limitations of existing KB-QA systems. Second we assess the reply accuracy of the proposed ALKB-QA system using human evaluations and the results show that it outperforms human annotation-base approaches. Third we launched our ALKB-QA system as a real-world business application and it supports tens of thousands of online stores.;2020
Traditional teaching based on masterclasses or techniques where the student develops a passive role has proven to be inefficient methods in the learning process. The use of technology in universities helps to generate active learning where the student's interest improves making him the main actor in his education. However implementing an environment where active learning takes place requires a great deal of effort given the number of variables involved in this objective. To identify these variables it is necessary to analyze the data generated by the students in search of patterns that allow them to be classified according to their needs. Once these needs are identified it is possible to make decisions that contribute to the learning of each student for this the use of artificial intelligence is considered. These techniques emulate the processes of human thought using structures that contain knowledge and experience of human experts.;2020
Twitter is a popular microblogging platform which facilitates users to express views and thoughts on day-today events using short texts limited to a maximum of 280 characters. However it is generally targeted by socialbots for political astroturfing advertising spamming and other illicit activities due to its open and real-time information sharing and dissemination nature. In this paper we present a socialbots analysis-driven graph-based approach for identifying coordinated campaigns among Twitter users. To this end we first present statistical insights derived from the analysis of logged data of 98 socialbots which were injected in Twitter and associated with top-six Twitter using countries. In the analysis we study and present the impact of socialbots' profile features such as age and gender on infiltration. We also present a multi-attributed graph-based approach to model the profile attributes and interaction behavior of users as a similarity graph for identifying different groups of synchronized users involved in coordinated campaigns. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated using four different evaluation parameters over a real dataset containing socialbots' trapped user profiles. The evaluation of identified campaigns in the form of clusters reveals the traces of spammers botnets and other malicious users.;2020
Understanding the user & x2019s intention is an essential task for the spoken language understanding (SLU) module in the dialogue system which further illustrates vital information for managing and generating future action and response. In this paper we propose a triplet training framework based on the multiclass classification approach to conduct the training for the intention detection task. Precisely we utilize a Siamese neural network architecture with metric learning to construct a robust and discriminative utterance feature embedding model. We modified the RMCNN model and fine-tuned BERT model as Siamese encoders to train utterance triplets from different semantic aspects. The triplet loss can effectively distinguish the details of two input data by learning a mapping from sequence utterances to a compact Euclidean space. After generating the mapping the intention detection task can be easily implemented using standard techniques with pre-trained embeddings as feature vectors. Besides we use the fusion strategy to enhance utterance feature representation in the downstream of intention detection task. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets of intention detection task: Snips dataset ATIS dataset Facebook multilingual task-oriented datasets Daily Dialogue dataset and MRDA dataset. The results illustrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the recognition performance of these datasets and achieves new state-of-the-art results on single-turn task-oriented datasets (Snips dataset Facebook dataset) and a multi-turn dataset (Daily Dialogue dataset).;2020
User intent classification is a vital component of a question-answering system or a task-based dialogue system. In order to understand the goals of users' questions or discourses the system categorizes user text into a set of pre-defined user intent categories. User questions or discourses are usually short in length and lack sufficient context thus it is difficult to extract deep semantic information from these types of text and the accuracy of user intent classification may be affected. To better identify user intents this paper proposes a BERT-Cap hybrid neural network model with focal loss for user intent classification to capture user intents in dialogue. The model uses multiple transformer encoder blocks to encode user utterances and initializes encoder parameters with a pre-trained BERT. Then it extracts essential features using a capsule network with dynamic routing after utterances encoding. Experiment results on four publicly available datasets show that our model BERT-Cap achieves a F1 score of 0.967 and an accuracy of 0.967 outperforming a number of baseline methods indicating its effectiveness in user intent classification.;2020
Using the technology acceptance model and diffusion of innovations theory this study evaluated the intention of consumers to use chatbots on smartphones for shopping. Chatbot is a relatively new technology and is expected to dominate mobile commerce and shopping applications in future. Hence this study aimed to determine the association of perceived usefulness perceived ease of use perceived enjoyment price consciousness perceived risk trust and personal innovativeness with attitude and intention to use chatbots for shopping. Respondents were asked to fill a questionnaire after using a Facebook e-commerce chatbot that was specifically created for this study. In total 350 responses were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results indicated that attitude toward chatbots was considerably influenced by the variables perceived usefulness perceived ease of use perceived enjoyment price consciousness perceived risk and personal innovativeness. However intention to use was directly influenced only by trust personal innovativeness and attitude. Mediation analysis indicated that full mediation occurs through the attitude variable for most direct relationships. Moderation analysis by using age gender and prior experience with mobile shopping applications indicated considerable differences between the groups in terms of the strength of certain relationships and the mean responses between the variables.;2020
Verifying if two audio segments belong to the same speaker has been recently put forward as a flexible way to carry out speaker identification since it does not require to be re-trained when new speakers appear on the auditory scene. Although many of the current techniques have achieved high performances they require a considerably high amount of memory and a specific minimum length for their input audio segments. These requirements limit the applicability of these techniques in scenarios such as service robots internet of things and virtual assistants where computational resources are limited and the users tend to speak in short segments. In this work we propose a BLSTM-based model that reaches a level of performance comparable to the current state of the art when using short input audio segments while requiring a considerably less amount of memory. Further as far as we know a complete speaker identification system has not been reported using this verification paradigm. Thus we present a complete online speaker identifier based on a simple voting system that shows that the proposed BLSTM-based model achieves a similar performance at identifying speakers online compared to the current state of the art.

Virtual agents have demonstrated their ability to conduct clinical interviews. However the factors influencing patients' engagement with these agents have not yet been assessed. The objective of this study is to assess in outpatients the trust and acceptance of virtual agents performing medical interviews and to explore their influence on outpatients' engagement. In all 318 outpatients were enroled. The agent was perceived as trustworthy and well accepted by the patients confirming the good engagement of patients in the interaction. Older and less-educated patients accepted the virtual medical agent (VMA) more than younger and well-educated ones. Credibility of the agent appeared to main dimension enabling engaged and non-engaged outpatients to be classified. Our results show a high rate of engagement with the virtual agent that was mainly related to high trust and acceptance of the agent. These results open new paths for the future use of VMAs in medicine.;2020
Virtual assistants are involved in the daily activities of humans such as managing calendars making appointments and providing wake-up calls. They provide a conversational service to customers around-the-clock and make their daily life manageable. With this emerging trend many well-known companies launched their own virtual assistants that manage the daily routine activities of customers. In the healthcare sector virtual medical assistants also provide a list of relevant diseases linked to a specific symptom. Due to low accuracy and uncertainty these generated recommendations are untrusted and may lead to hypochondriasis. In this study we proposed a Medical Instructed Real-time Assistant (MIRA) that listens to the user's chief complaint and predicts a specific disease. Instead of informing about the medical condition the user is referred to a nearby appropriate medical specialist. We designed an architecture for MIRA that considers the limitations of existing virtual medical assistants such as weak authentication lack of understanding multiple intent statements about a specific medical condition and uncertain diagnosis recommendations. To implement the designed architecture we collected the chief complaints along with the dialogue corpora of real patients. Then we manually validated these data under the supervision of medical specialists. We then used these data for natural language understanding disease identification and appropriate response generation. For the prototype version of MIRA we considered the cases of glaucoma (eye disease) and diabetes (an autoimmune disease) only. The performance measure of MIRA was evaluated in terms of accuracy (89%) precision (90%) sensitivity (89.8%) specificity (94.9%) and F-measure (89.8%). The task completion was calculated using Cohen's Kappa (k=0.848) that categorizes MIRA as 'Almost Perfect'. Furthermore the voice-based authentication identifies the user effectively and prevent against masquerading attack. Simultaneously the user experience shows relatively good results in all aspects based on the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) benchmark data. The experimental results show that MIRA efficiently predicts a disease based on chief complaints and supports the user in decision making.;2020
Virtual patient software allows health professionals to practise their skills by interacting with tools simulating clinical scenarios. A natural language dialogue system can provide natural interaction for medical history-taking. However the large number of concepts and terms in the medical domain makes the creation of such a system a demanding task. We designed a dialogue system that stands out from current research by its ability to handle a wide variety of medical specialties and clinical cases. To address the task we designed a patient record model a knowledge model for the task and a termino-ontological model that hosts structured thesauri with linguistic terminological and ontological knowledge. We used a frame- and rule-based approach and terminology-rich resources to handle the medical dialogue. This work focuses on the termino-ontological model the challenges involved and how the system manages resources for the French language. We adopted a comprehensive approach to collect terms and ontological knowledge and dictionaries of affixes synonyms and derivational variants. Resources include domain lists containing over 161000 terms and dictionaries with over 959000 word/concept entries. We assessed our approach by having 71 participants (39 medical doctors and 32 non-medical evaluators) interact with the system and use 35 cases from 18 specialities. We conducted a quantitative evaluation of all components by analysing interaction logs (11834 turns). Natural language understanding achieved an F-measure of 95.8%. Dialogue management provided on average 74.3 (+/- 9.5)% of correct answers. We performed a qualitative evaluation by collecting 171 five-point Likert scale questionnaires. All evaluated aspects obtained mean scores above the Likert mid-scale point. We analysed the vocabulary coverage with regard to unseen cases: the system covered 97.8% of their terms. Evaluations showed that the system achieved high vocabulary coverage on unseen cases and was assessed as relevant for the task.;2020
Virtual tutors are a promising technology providing a rich interactive environment for children to learn in. However the question of how they should behave in order to enhance pupils' motivation remains unanswered. Using an embodied conversational agent platform we tested human-computer interactions with 22 children aged 9-11 years. Children performed several numeracy exercises set by two different virtual agents. One agent provided solely verbal feedback (unimodal) while the other one combined facial expressions based on real muscle contractions with its verbal feedback (bimodal). Children then completed a perceived social support questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative data were subjected to inferential statistical tests. Results showed that the overall duration of agent-pupil interactions varied children found the bimodal agent more empathic and produced significantly more correct answers. Moreover there was a positive correlation between accuracy and mean reaction times for correct answers with the bimodal agent. The lack of a correlation for the unimodal agent is discussed in the light of empathy and motivation in social cognition.;2020
Visual conversation is a dialog in which parties exchange visual information. The key novelty presented in this paper is an artificial intelligence-driven visual conversation automation method. We will present a state of the art Artificial Intelligence Snapchat Visual Conversation Agent (AISVCA). AISVCA uses our proposed artificial intelligence-driven visual conversation automation method to create received image caption and generate an appropriate reasonable visual response. These functionalities are achieved by using a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) and Latent Semantic Indexing method (LSI). CNN and LSTM are used to create image captions and LSI is used to assess the semantic similarity between captions generated from personalized image dataset and captions that are extracted from the received image content. We will show that AISVCA using the proposed method can generate a visual response that is basically indistinguishable from a human visual response. To evaluate the proposed approach we measured the accuracy of the proposed system and conducted a user study to test communication quality. In the user study we analyzed source credibility and interpersonal attraction of the AISVCA. The user study results showed that there are no significant differences in communication quality between a visual conversation with AISVCA and visual conversation with the human agent.;2020
Voice assistants embodied in smart speakers (e.g. Amazon Echo Google Home) enable voice-based interaction that does not necessarily rely on expertise with mobile or desktop computing. Hence these voice assistants offer new opportunities to different populations including individuals who are not interested or able to use traditional computing devices such as computers and smartphones. To understand how older adults who use technology infrequently perceive and use these voice assistants we conducted a 3-week field deployment of the Amazon Echo Dot in the homes of seven older adults. While some types of usage dropped over the 3-week period (e.g. playing music) we observed consistent usage for finding online information. Given that much of this information was health-related this finding emphasizes the need to revisit concerns about credibility of information with this new interaction medium. Although features to support memory (e.g. setting timers reminders) were initially perceived as useful the actual usage was unexpectedly low due to reliability concerns. We discuss how these findings apply to other user groups along with design implications and recommendations for future work on voice-user interfaces.;2020
We have developed an adaptation method which allows the customization of example-based dialog systems for individual users by applying plus and minus operations to the distributed representations obtained using the word2vec method. After retrieving user-related profile information from the Web named entity extraction is applied to the retrieval results. Words with a high term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) score are then adopted as user related words. Next we calculate the similarity between the distrubuted representations of selected user-related words and nouns in the existing example phrases using word2vec embedding. We then generate phrases adapted to the user by substituting user-related words for highly similar words in the original example phrases. Word2vec also has a special property which allows the arithmetic operations plus and minus to be applied to distributed word representations. By applying these operations to words used in the original phrases we are able to determine which user-related words can be used to replace the original words. The user-related words are then substituted to create customized example phrases. We evaluated the naturalness of the generated phrases and found that the system could generate natural phrases.;2020
We introduce a new semantics for a family of logics of explicit and implicit belief based on the concept of multi-agent belief base. Differently from standard semantics for epistemic logic in which the notions of possible world and doxastic/epistemic alternative are primitive in our semantics they are non-primitive but are computed from the concept of belief base. We provide complete axiomatizations and prove decidability for our logics via finite model arguments. Furthermore we provide polynomial embeddings of our logics into Fagin & Halpern's logic of general awareness and establish complexity results via the embeddings. We also present variants of the logics incorporating different forms of epistemic introspection for explicit and/or implicit belief and provide complexity results for some of these variants. Finally we present a number of dynamic extensions of the static framework by informative actions of both public and private type including public announcement belief base expansion and forgetting. We illustrate the application potential of the logical framework with the aid of a concrete example taken from the domain of conversational agents. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2020
We investigated how intelligent virtual assistants (IVA) including Amazon's Alexa Apple's Siri Google Assistant Microsoft's Cortana and Samsung's Bixby responded to addiction help-seeking queries. We recorded if IVAs provided a singular response and if so did they link users to treatment or treatment referral services. Only 4 of the 70 help-seeking queries presented to the five IVAs returned singular responses with the remainder prompting confusion (e.g. did I say something wrong?). When asked help me quit drugs Alexa responded with a definition for the word drugs. Help me quit horizontal ellipsis smoking or tobacco on Google Assistant returned Dr. QuitNow (a cessation app) while on Siri help me quit pot promoted a marijuana retailer. IVAs should be revised to promote free remote federally sponsored addiction services such as SAMSHA's 1-800-662-HELP helpline. This would benefit millions of IVA users now and more to come as IVAs displace existing information-seeking engines.;2020
We propose an end-to-end dialogue model based on a hierarchical encoder-decoder which employed a discrete latent variable to learn underlying dialogue intentions. The system is able to model the structure of utterances dominated by statistics of the language and the dependencies among utterances in dialogues without manual dialogue state design. We argue that the latent discrete variable interprets the intentions that guide machine responses generation. We also propose a model which can be refined autonomously with reinforcement learning due to that intention selection at each dialogue turn can be formulated as a sequential decision-making process. Our experiments show that exact MLE optimized model is much more robust than neural variational inference on dialogue success rate with limited BLEU sacrifice.;2020
We study the problem of policy adaptation for reinforcement-learning-based dialog management. Policy adaptation is a commonly used technique to alleviate the problem of data sparsity when training a goal-oriented dialog system for a new task (the target task) by using knowledge when learning policies in an existing task. The methods used by current works in dialog policy adaptation need much time and effort for adapting because they use reinforcement learning algorithms to train a new policy for the target task from scratch. In this paper we show that a dialog policy can be learned without training by reinforcement learning in the target task. In contrast to existing works our proposed method learns the relation in the form of probability distribution between the action sets of the source and the target tasks. Thus we can immediately derive a policy for the target task which significantly reduces the adaptation time. Our experiments show that the proposed method learns a new policy for the target task much more quickly. In addition the learned policy achieves higher performance than policies created by fine-tuning when the amount of available data on the target task is limited.;2020
When attempting to solve a problem humans call upon cognitive resources. These resources are limited and the degree of their utilisation is described as cognitive load. While the number of parameters to be taken into account and to be processed by modern-day knowledge workers increases their cognitive resources do not. Research shows that too high a load can increase stress and failure rates and decrease the work satisfaction and performance of employees. It is thus in the interest of organisations to reduce the cognitive load of their employees and keep it at a moderate level. One way to achieve this may be the application of virtual assistants (VAs) software programs that can be addressed via voice or text commands and respond to the users' input. This study uses a laboratory experiment with N = 91 participants comparing two groups in their ability to solve a task. One group was able to make use of a VA while the other could not. Besides task performance the cognitive load of the participants was measured. Results show that (a) cognitive load is negatively related to task performance (b) the group using the VA performed better at the task and (c) the group using the VA had a lower cognitive load. These findings show that VAs are a viable way to support employees and can increase their performance. It adds to the growing field of IS research on VAs by expanding the field for the concept of cognitive load.;2020
While there have been significant advances in detecting emotions in text in the field of utterance-level emotion recognition (ULER) there are still many problems to be solved. In this paper we address some challenges in ULER in dialog systems. (1) The same utterance can deliver different emotions when it is in different contexts. (2) Long-range contextual information is hard to effectively capture. (3) Unlike the traditional text classification problem for most datasets of this task they contain inadequate conversations or speech. (4) To better model the emotional interaction between speakers speaker information is necessary. To address the problems of (1) and (2) we propose a hierarchical transformer framework (apart from the description of other studies the transformer in this paper usually refers to the encoder part of the transformer) with a lower-level transformer to model the word-level input and an upper-level transformer to capture the context of utterance-level embeddings. For problem (3) we use bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) a pretrained language model as the lower-level transformer which is equivalent to introducing external data into the model and solves the problem of data shortage to some extent. For problem (4) we add speaker embeddings to the model for the first time which enables our model to capture the interaction between speakers. Experiments on three dialog emotion datasets Friends EmotionPush and EmoryNLP demonstrate that our proposed hierarchical transformer network models obtain competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the macro-averaged F1-score (macro-F1).;2020
Wind power generation is the clean energy source by which the pollution in the environment can be reduced to an extent and also it can be installed in and around the cities for electrical supply. The wind energy generated at the level of distributed generation also reduces the impact on the transmission system in terms of loss in the line and improves the efficiency of the power system. The increase in the level of penetration of wind power generation into an island power system network causing severe threat in the system in terms of protection and security. The decrease in system inertia by means of increasing in Renewable Energy Sources (RES) causes an impact on the stability of the system and further may lead to a blackout of the system. The protection and control of this system are becoming more complicated due to the penetration of RES into the system. So in order to solve these issues an intelligent control technique is implemented between the robust energy storage system and wind energy system. The Load Frequency Control (LFC) is required to emulate the virtual inertia into the island power system to stabilize the frequency variations and power variations. Furthermore a digital frequency relay is implemented to protect the system from large power fluctuations for longer duration and a security system is implemented for protecting the whole island system from cyber-attacks. To verify the effectiveness of controller as well as protection system robustness it is tested for different load disturbances and by increasing the penetration level of wind power the digital relay has been tested for large frequency variation in the system by using MATLAB/Simulink.;2020
With a growing demand for accurate ion beam analysis on a large number of samples it becomes an issue of how to ensure the quality standards and consistency over hundreds or thousands of samples. In this sense a virtual assistant that checks the data quality emitting certificates of quality is highly desired. Even the processing of a massive number of spectra is a problem regarding the consistency of the analysis. In this work we report the design and first results of a virtual layer under implementation in our laboratory. It consists of a series of systems running in the cloud that perform the mentioned tasks and serves as a virtual assistant for member staff and users. We aim to bring the concept of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence closer to the laboratory to support a new generation of instrumentation.;2020
With the advancement of interface technologies in smart devices voice-controlled assistants have quickly gained popularity. These assistants are designed to use voice commands to achieve a more human-friendly interaction. On these lines we propose a cloud-connected voice based home assistant in this paper. It accepts voice commands to control or monitor devices in a home. It can understand and schedule device operations based on time or sensor data through a simple voice based approach. To enhance its capability it is designed to identify the speakers. Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) in combination with other speech features are used as feature vector. We use Vector Quantization (VQ) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction of the feature vector followed by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for classification. The validation of the short speech speaker identification is carried out on a set of Indian speakers in an uncontrolled indoor environment. An accuracy greater than 92% is achieved for speech samples as small as 1 second. A database of more than 50 different commands per speaker is also created for validation of the proposed virtual assistant. IBM's Bluemix and Google's cloud service is used for speech to text conversion.;2020
With the advent of digital approaches to mental health modern artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in particular is being used in the development of prediction detection and treatment solutions for mental health care. In terms of treatment AI is being incorporated into digital interventions particularly web and smartphone apps to enhance user experience and optimise personalised mental health care. In terms of prediction and detection modern streams of abundant data mean that data-driven AI methods can be employed to develop prediction/detection models for mental health conditions. In particular an individual's 'digital exhaust' the data gathered from their numerous personal digital device and social media interactions can be mined for behavioural or mental health insights. Language long considered a window into the human mind can now be quantitatively harnessed as data with powerful computer-based natural language processing to also provide a method of inferring mental health. Furthermore natural language processing can also be used to develop conversational agents used for therapeutic intervention.;2020
With the advent of the 5G and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) era related technologies such as the Internet of Things big data analysis cloud applications and artificial intelligence have brought broad prospects to many application fields such as smart homes autonomous vehicles smart cities healthcare and smart campus. At present most university campus app is presented in the form of static web pages or app menus. This study mainly developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based emotionally aware campus virtual assistant. The main contributions of this research are: (1) This study introduces the Chinese Word Embedding to the robot dialogue system effectively improving dialogue tolerance and semantic interpretation. (2) The traditional method of emotion identification must first tokenize the Chinese sentence analyze the clauses and part of speech and capture the emotional keywords before being interpreted by the expert system. Different from the traditional method this study classifies the input directly through the convolutional neural network after the input sentence is converted into a spectrogram by Fourier Transform. (3) This study is presented in App mode which is easier to use and economical. (4) This system provides a simple voice response interface without the need for users to find information in complex web pages or app menus.;2020
With the development of deep learning the method of large-scale dialogue generation based on deep learning has received extensive attention. The current research has aimed to solve the problem of the quality of generated dialogue content but has failed to fully consider the emotional factors of generated dialogue content. In order to solve the problem of emotional response in the open domain dialogue system we proposed a dynamic emotional session generation model (DESG). On the basis of the Seq2Seq (sequence-to-sequence) framework the model abbreviation incorporates a dictionary-based attention mechanism that encourages the substitution of words in response with synonyms in emotion dictionaries. Meanwhile in order to improve the model internal emotion regulator and emotion classifier mechanisms are introduced in order to build a large-scale emotion-session generation model. Experimental results show that our DESG model can not only produce an appropriate output sequence in terms of content (related grammar) for a given post and emotion category but can also express the expected emotional response explicitly or implicitly.;2020
With the development of technology the importance of the research on speech emotion recognition and semantic analysis has increased. The research is primarily applied in companion robot technology products and medical purpose. In this research a communication system with speech emotion recognition is proposed. The system pre-process speech with sound data enhancing method in speech emotion recognition and transform the sound into spectrogram by MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient). Then GoogLeNet of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is applied to recognize the five emotions which are peace happy sad angry and fear and the top accuracy of recognition is 79.81%. When applying semantic analysis the training texts are divided into two categories positive and negative and the chatting conversations are conducted in the framework Seq2Seq of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). The systematic framework of this research has two parts the client and the server. The former one is developed on Android system to be used in Application and the latter one is established by Ubuntu Linux system and combined with the web server. With the bi-terminal framework system the users can record voice in APP one his/her cellphone and upload the voice file to the server. Then the voice undergoes speech emotion recognition by CNN and semantic analysis by RNN to function as a chatting machine that can respond positively or negatively based on the detected emotion and show the results on APP of the user's cell phone. The main contributions of this research are: 1) This study introduces the Chinese word vector to the robot dialogue system effectively improving dialogue tolerance and semantic interpretation 2) The traditional method of emotion identification must first tokenize the Chinese words analyze the clauses and part of speech and capture the emotional keywords before being interpreted by the expert system. Different from the traditional method this study classifies the input directly through the convolutional neural network after the input sentence is converted into a spectrogram by MFCC and 3) in addition to implementing the companion robot the user's emotional index can be collected for analysis by the back-end care organization. In addition compared with other commercial humanoid companion robots this study is presented in an App which is easier to use and economical.;2020
With the increasing pervasiveness of smart phones and smart devices dialogue systems are gaining ever growing attention from both academic and industry. These systems can be broadly classified into two categories one that is aimed at helping user to gain new knowledge and one that can chat with users without completing any specific tasks. Although dialogue systems are improving substantially the user experience of such systems are still unsatisfactory as there are no specific rules covering all possible situations of real human-machine dialogue resulting in breakdowns. There are two technical issues affecting the detection of dialogue breakdown in an open domain conversation: human resources to prepare and annotate a large chunk of conversation data and dialogue histories containing words that don't appear directly in training data. To tackle these issues we propose a novel encoding method for temporal utterances with memory attention based on end-to-end dialogue breakdown detection. Specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed to encode each word of all previous user and system utterances. Encoded vectors from LSTM (user and system utterances) along with system and user utterances from sentence embedding are then stored in memory wherein an attention mechanism is applied to select the most relevant piece of words from system and user utterances for breakdown detection. An evaluation of the proposed approach on a breakdown detection task (DBDC3) showed that the model for single-labeled breakdown detection outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in a classification task. In conclusion a more effective knowledge gain and management can be achieved by integration of our proposed breakdown detection into dialogue systems.;2020
With the rapid progress of the semantic web a huge amount of structured data has become available on the web in the form of knowledge bases (KBs). Making these data accessible and useful for end-users is one of the main objectives of chatbots over linked data. Building a chatbot over linked data raises different challenges including user queries understanding multiple knowledge base support and multilingual aspect. To address these challenges we first design and develop an architecture to provide an interactive user interface. Secondly we propose a machine learning approach based on intent classification and natural language understanding to understand user intents and generate SPARQL queries. We especially process a new social network dataset (i.e. myPersonality) and add it to the existing knowledge bases to extend the chatbot capabilities by understanding analytical queries. The system can be extended with a new domain on-demand flexible multiple knowledge base multilingual and allows intuitive creation and execution of different tasks for an extensive range of topics. Furthermore evaluation and application cases in the chatbot are provided to show how it facilitates interactive semantic data towards different real application scenarios and showcase the proposed approach for a knowledge graph and data-driven chatbot.;2020
With the success of new speech-based human-computer interfaces there is a great need for effective and friendly dialogue agents that can communicate with people naturally and continuously. However the lack of personality and consistency is one of critical problems in neural dialogue systems. In this paper we aim to generate consistent response with fixed profile and background information for building a realistic dialogue system. Based on the encoder-decoder model we propose a retrieval mechanism to deliver natural and fluent response with proper information from a profile database. Moreover in order to improve the efficiency of training the dataset related to profile information we adopt a method of pre-training and adjustment for general dataset and profile dataset. Our model is trained by social dialogue data from Weibo. According to both automatic and human evaluation metrics the proposed model significantly outperforms standard encoder-decoder model and other improved models on providing the correct profile and high-quality responses.;2020
Within the area of intelligent User Interfaces we propose what we call Sentient Embodied Conversational Agents (SECAs): virtual characters able to engage users in complex conversations and to incorporate sentient capabilities similar to the ones humans have. This paper introduces SECAs together with their architecture and a publicly available software library that facilitates their inclusion in applications -such as educational and elder-care- requiring proactive and sensitive agent behaviours. In fact we illustrate our proposal with a virtual tutor embedded in an educational application for children. The evaluation was performed in two stages: firstly we tested a version with basic textual processing capabilities and secondly we evaluated a SECA with Machine-Learning-enhanced user understanding capabilities. The results show a significant improvement in users' perception of the agent's understanding capability. Indeed the Response Error Rate decreased from 22.31% to 11.46% using ML techniques. Moreover 99.33% of the participants consider the global experience of talking with the virtual tutor with sentient capabilities to be satisfactory. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2020

Future research could investigate the effectiveness of this important health campaign.;2021
(1) Background: Follow-up management of workers' general health examination (WGHE) is important but it is not currently well done. Chatbot a type of digital healthcare tool is used in various medical fields but has never been developed for follow-up management of WGHE in Korea. (2) Methods: The database containing results and explanations related to WGHE was constructed. Then the channel which connects users with the database was created. A user survey regarding effectiveness was administered to 23 healthcare providers. Additionally interviews on applicability for occupational health services were conducted with six nurses in the agency of occupational health management. (3) Results: Chatbot was implemented on a small scale on the Amazon cloud service (AWS) EC2 using KaKaoTalk and Web Chat as user channels. Regarding the effectiveness 21 (91.30%) rated the need for chatbots as very high however 11 (47.83%) rated the usability as not high. Of the 23 participants 14 (60.87%) expressed overall satisfaction. Nurses appreciated the chatbot program as a method for resolving accessibility and as an aid for explaining examination results and follow-up management. (4) Conclusions: The effectiveness of WGHE and the applicability in the occupational health service of the chatbot program for follow-up management can be confirmed.;2021
6G-Enabled Internet of Things (IoT) is about to open a new era of Internet of Everything (IoE). It creates favorable conditions for new application services. The human-machine dialogue system one of the most important forms of human-machine interaction is expected to replace mobile applications in the future. This article proposes a dialogue generation scheme named background knowledge-aware dialogue generation model with pretrained encoders (BKADGPE). Dialogue generation which takes the context as input and response as output is a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) task. Instead of only generating the response based on the previous sequence of utterances background knowledge-aware dialogue generation is also relying on background knowledge documents. This is because people often communicate based on their background knowledge. This article divides it into two tasks: 1) a knowledge selection task and 2) a response generation task. One of the latest language pretraining models a lite bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (ALBERT) is applied as the encoder. In the knowledge selection task ALBERT adds the linear layer and softmax layer to predict the content-related knowledge span. In the response generation task the ALBERT after fine-tuning through the knowledge selection task adds the left-context-only transformer with a copy mechanism to incorporate background knowledge span into the generated response. Empirical studies on the HOLL-E dataset show that the result of BKADGPE is better than the related works.;2021
A challenge of large-scale oral communication assessments is to feasibly assess a broad construct that includes interactional competence. One possible approach in addressing this challenge is to use a spoken dialog system (SDS) with the computer acting as a peer to elicit a ratable speech sample. With this aim an SDS was built and four trained human raters assessed the discourse elicited from 40 test takers that completed a paired oral task with both a human and a computer partner. The test takers were evaluated based on the analytic operational oral communication rating scales which included interactional competence fluency pronunciation and grammar/vocabulary. Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that fluency pronunciation and grammar and vocabulary were scored similarly across the two conditions while interactional competence was scored substantially higher in the human partner condition. A g-study indicated that the computer partner was more reliable in assessing interactional competence and rater questionnaire and interview data suggested the computer provided a more standardized assessment. Conversely raters generally favored the human partner in part because of its perceived authenticity and naturalness.;2021
A chatbot is a useful tool for communicating with users to extract necessary information. An intelligent chatbot requires an effective knowledge base as materials to adequately organize the knowledge domain and process many kinds of inputted queries as natural text. Ontology technology is effective for use in learning technology systems. In this paper a model that uses ontology technology for relational knowledge to integrate a structure of scripts is presented. This integrated model called the Rela-Scripts model is used to organize the knowledge material of a chatbot to search for knowledge in education. Some problems in searching for knowledge by this chatbot are proposed and solved on the basis of the Rela-Scripts model. The proposed method is applied to build an intelligent chatbot for answering questions on contents of the Introduction to Programming course in a university. This chatbot acts as a tutor by communicating with students in Vietnamese and gives explanations that meet the requirements of students. Its instructions are useful for their self-learning to enhance their programming skills.;2021
A knowledge graph is a structured graph in which data obtained from multiple sources are standardized to acquire and integrate human knowledge. Research is being actively conducted to cover a wide variety of knowledge as it can be applied to applications that help humans. However existing researches are constructing knowledge graphs without the time information that knowledge implies. Knowledge stored without time information becomes outdated over time and in the future the possibility of knowledge being false or meaningful changes is excluded. As a result they can't reflect information that changes dynamically and they can't accept information that has newly emerged. To solve this problem this paper proposes Time-Aware PolarisX an automatically extended knowledge graph including time information. Time Aware PolarisX constructed a BERT model with a relation extractor and an ensemble NER model including a time tag with an entity extractor to extract knowledge consisting of subject relation and object from unstructured text. Through two application experiments it shows that the proposed system overcomes the limitations of existing systems that do not consider time information when applied to an application such as a chatbot. Also we verify that the accuracy of the extraction model is improved through a comparative experiment with the existing model.;2021
A large percentage of adults throughout the world have low reading skills. Computer technologies can potentially help these adults improve their literacy in addition to instructors at literacy centers. AutoTutor was designed to teach comprehension strategies by implementing conversational 'trialogues' in which two computer agents (tutor and peer) hold spoken interactions with the adult about words sentences and text in digital lessons. The agents model comprehension strategies ask questions and give feedback on adult answers. AutoTutor records in log files the adults' performance namely the time and accuracy of answering questions in the conversation. We assessed the value of AutoTutor in a study with 52 adult literacy students in the United States and Canada who interacted with AutoTutor as part of a 4-month intervention with human instructors. Performance in AutoTutor was tracked at four theoretical discourse levels (words explicit textbase conceptual situation model rhetorical structure) and also engagement with an objective psychometric measure of comprehension skill both before and after the intervention. The results showed that AutoTutor provides nuanced performance and engagement measures that predicted comprehension improvements and can be used to guide formative assessment for instructors.;2021
A LINE Bot System to diagnose rice diseases from actual paddy field images was developed and presented in this paper. It was easy-to-use and automatic system designed to help rice farmers improve the rice yield and quality. The targeted images were taken from the actual paddy environment without special sample preparation. We used a deep learning neural networks technique to detect rice diseases from the images. We developed an object detection model training and refinement process to improve the performance of our previous research on rice leave diseases detection. The process was based on analyzing the model's predictive results and could be repeatedly used to improve the quality of the database in the next training of the model. The deployment model for our LINE Bot system was created from the selected best performance technique in our previous paper YOLOv3 trained by refined training data set. The performance of the deployment model was measured on 5 target classes and found that the Average True Positive Point improved from 91.1% in the previous paper to 95.6% in this study. Therefore we used this deployment model for Rice Disease LINE Bot system. Our system worked automatically real-time to suggest primary diagnosis results to the users in the LINE group which included rice farmers and rice disease specialists. They could communicate freely via chat. In the real LINE Bot deployment the model's performance was measured by our own defined measurement Average True Positive Point and was found to be an average of 78.86%. The system was fast and took only 2-3 s for detection process in our system server.;2021
A personal intelligent agent (PIA) is a system that acts intelligently to assist a human using natural language. Examples include Siri and Alexa. These agents are powerful computer programs that operate autonomously and proactively learn and adapt to change react to the environment complete tasks within a favorable timeframe and communicate with the user using natural language to process commands and compose replies. PIAs are different from other systems previously explored in Information Systems (IS) due to their personalized intelligent and human-like behavior. Drawing on research in IS and Artificial Intelligence we build and test a model of user adoption of PIAs leveraging their uique characteristics. Analysis of data collected from an interactive lab-based study for new PIA users confirms that both perceived intelligence and anthropomorphism are significant antecedents of PIA adoption. Our findings contribute to the understanding of a quickly-changing and fast-growing set of technologies that extend users' capabilities and their sense of self .;2021
A psychiatric diagnosis involves the physician's ability to create an empathic interaction with the patient in order to accurately extract symptomatology (i.e. clinical manifestations). Virtual patients (VPs) can be used to train these skills but need to propose a structured and multimodal interaction situation in order to simulate a realistic psychiatric interview. In this study we present a simulated psychiatric interview with a virtual patient suffering from major depressive disorders. We suggested some design guidelines based on psychiatry theories and medicine education standards. We evaluated our VP with user testing with 35 4th year medical students and probed their opinion during debriefing interviews. All students showed good abilities to communicate empathetically with the VP and managed to extract symptomatology from VP's simulation. Students provided positive feedbacks regarding pedagogic usefulness realism and enjoyment in the interaction which suggests that our design guidelines are consistent and that such technologies are acceptable to medical students. To conclude this study is the first to simulate a realistic psychiatric interview and to measure both skills needed by future psychiatrists: symptomatology extraction and empathic communication. Results provide evidence for the use of VPs to complement existing tools and to train and evaluate healthcare professionals in the future.;2021
Advances in artificial intelligence algorithms and expansion of straightforward cloud-based platforms have enabled the adoption of conversational assistants by both medium and large companies to facilitate interaction between clients and employees. The interactions are possible through the use of ubiquitous devices (e.g. Amazon Echo Apple HomePod Google Nest) virtual assistants (e.g. Apple Siri Google Assistant Samsung Bixby or Microsoft Cortana) chat windows on the corporate website or social network applications (e.g. Facebook Messenger Telegram Slack WeChat). Creating a useful personalized conversational agent that is also robust and pop-ular is nonetheless challenging work. It requires picking the right algorithm framework and/or communication channel but perhaps more importantly con-sideration of the specific task user needs environment available training data budget and a thoughtful design. In this paper we will consider the elements necessary to create a conversational agent for different types of users environments and tasks. The elements will account for the limited amount of data available for specific tasks within a com-pany and for non-English languages. We are confident that we can provide a useful resource for the new practitioner developing an agent. We can point out novice problems/traps to avoid create consciousness that the development of the technology is achievable despite comprehensive and significant challenges and raise awareness about different ethical issues that may be associated with this technology. We have compiled our experience with deploying conversational sys-tems for daily use in multicultural multilingual and intergenerational settings. Additionally we will give insight on how to scale the proposed solutions.;2021
Advances in artificial intelligence provide new tools of digital assistance that retailers can use to support consumers while shopping. The aim of this research is to examine how consumers react as a function of assistants' appearance (human- vs. not human-like) and activation (automatic vs. human-initiated). We advance a model of sequential mediation whose empirical validation on 400 participants in two studies shows that nonanthropomorphic digital assistants lead to higher psychological reactance. In turn reactance affects perceived choice difficulty which positively reflects on choice certainty perceived performance and-ultimately-satisfaction. Thus although reactance might appear as a negative outcome it eventually leads to higher satisfaction. Furthermore initiation (system vs. user initiation) does not activate the chain of effects but significantly interacts with anthropomorphism so that individuals exhibit lower reactance when confronted with human-like digital assistants activated by the consumer. Overall reactance is highest for non-human like digital assistants that are computer-initiated.;2021
AI combined with NLP techniques has promoted the use of Virtual Assistants and have made people rely on them for many diverse uses. Conversational Agents are the most promising technique that assists computer users through their operation. An important challenge in developing Conversational Agents globally is transferring the groundbreaking expertise obtained in English to other languages. AI is making it possible to transfer this learning. There is a dire need to develop systems that understand secular languages. One such difficult language is Hindi which is the fourth most spoken language in the world. Semantic similarity is an important part of Natural Language Processing which involves applications such as ontology learning and information extraction for developing conversational agents. Most of the research is concentrated on English and other European languages. This paper presents a Corpus-based word semantic similarity measure for Hindi. An experiment involving the translation of the English benchmark dataset to Hindi is performed investigating the incorporation of the corpus with human and machine similarity ratings. A significant correlation to the human intuition and the algorithm ratings has been calculated for analyzing the accuracy of the proposed similarity measures. The method can be adapted in various applications of word semantic similarity or module for any other language.;2021
AI-chatbots as frontline agents promise innovative opportunities for shaping service offerings that benefit customers and retailers. Examining current practice through the lens of agency as defined by Social Cognitive Theory we present a 3-level classification of AI-chatbot design (anthropomorphic role appearance and interactivity) and examine how the combination of these three aspects of chatbot design impacts on the complementarities of agency. Recognizing current implementation challenges we advance that the complementarities of agency at each level are the lynchpin mechanism that translates AI-chatbot design into service relevant outcomes. We develop a research agenda focused on the emotion interface resolution of the proxy agency dilemma and development of collective agency to support the implementation of AI-chatbots as frontline service agents.;2021
AI-enabled virtual and robot therapy is increasingly being integrated into psychotherapeutic practice supporting a host of emotional cognitive and social processes in the therapeutic encounter. Given the speed of research and development trajectories of AI-enabled applications in psychotherapy and the practice of mental healthcare it is likely that therapeutic chatbots avatars and socially assistive devices will soon translate into clinical applications much more broadly. While AI applications offer many potential opportunities for psychotherapy they also raise important ethical social and clinical questions that have not yet been adequately considered for clinical practice. In this article we begin to address one of these considerations: the role of transference in the psychotherapeutic relationship. Drawing on Karen Barad's conceptual approach to theorizing human-non-human relations we show that the concept of transference is necessarily reconfigured within AI-human psychotherapeutic encounters. This has implications for understanding how AI-driven technologies introduce changes in the field of traditional psychotherapy and other forms of mental healthcare and how this may change clinical psychotherapeutic practice and AI development alike. As more AI-enabled apps and platforms for psychotherapy are developed it becomes necessary to re-think AI-human interaction as more nuanced and richer than a simple exchange of information between human and nonhuman actors alone.;2021
Aim: Describe virtual home assistant use and usefulness from the perspective of older adults and their support persons. Methods: This was a mixed-methods study with older adults and their support persons (n = 10 dyads). Virtual home assistant (VHA) equipment was installed in participants' homes and its use was documented for 60 days. Participants received protocol-guided telephone calls to address their VHA questions or problems. The type and frequency of VHA use were summarized with descriptive statistics. End-of-study interviews about VHA use were conducted with dyad participants. Qualitative content analyses were used to describe the interview findings about the dyad's perceptions of using the VHA how it was used any difficulties experienced and suggestions for future VHA uses. Results: Participant dyads reported positive VHA perceptions including the potential for VHAs to promote aging in place. Participants discussed the challenges learning the technology and replacing old habits with new ones. Participants offered recommendations for future VHA skills and for more education and training about using the VHA. Conclusions: The study findings suggest that VHAs may be useful for older adults as they age in place and offer reassurance for support persons.;2021
Alignment of communicative behaviour is an important feature of Human-Human interaction that directly affects the collaboration and the social connection of conversational partners. With the aim of improving the communicative abilities of a virtual agent and in particular its strategies related to (lexical) verbal alignment this article focuses on the alignment of linguistic productions of dialogue participants in task-oriented dialogues. We propose a new framework to quantify both the lexical alignment and the self-repetition behaviours of dialogue participants from dyadic dialogue transcripts. The framework involves easily computable measures based on repetition of lexical patterns automatically extracted via a sequential pattern mining approach. These measures allow the characterisation of the nature of these processes by addressing various informative aspects such as their variety complexity and strength. This framework is implemented in the freely available and open-source software dialign. Using these measures we present a contrastive study between Human-Human and Human-Agent dialogues on various corpora that reveals major differences in the lexical alignment and self-repetition behaviours. Lastly we address the challenge of integrating lexical alignment capabilities in artificial agents. To this end we describe guidelines and we discuss the integration of the proposed framework in a real-time dialogue system.;2021
Although emotional conversation generation has attracted widespread attention in recent years research works on the emotional interactional mechanism are still scarce which makes it difficult for existing emotional dialogue system to automatically determine a suitable emotion type for conversation generation. Such a response emotion planning task is often difficult due to the gap problem: we need to predict the emotional probability distribution of the upcoming responses which have not yet been generated. In this article we propose a novel method namely interactional emotion learning (IEL) which adopts an intuitive way to eliminate the gap problem: we design a variational learning network called potential response learning to learn the latent distribution of responses for given conversation in a semantic space. Then we predict an appropriate emotion for response generation based on both the dialogue context and the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments have been performed on three off-the-shelf conversation datasets and the experimental results show that the proposed variational learning network significantly boosts the prediction ability of our approach and our IEL method outperforms the state-of-the-art dialogue classification methods in the emotion planning task.;2021
An End-Of-Turn Detection Module (EOTD-M) is an essential component of automatic Spoken Dialogue Systems. The capability of correctly detecting whether a user?s utterance has ended or not improves the accuracy in interpreting the meaning of the message and decreases the latency in the answer. Usually in dialogue systems an EOTD-M is coupled with an Automatic Speech Recognition Module (ASR-M) to transmit complete utterances to the Natural Language Understanding unit. Mistakes in the ASR-M transcription can have a strong effect on the performance of the EOTD-M. The actual extent of this effect depends on the particular combination of ASR M transcription errors and the sentence featurization techniques implemented as part of the EOTD-M. In this paper we investigate this important relationship for an EOTD-M based on semantic information and particular characteristics of the speakers (speech profiles). We introduce an Automatic Speech Recognition Simulator (ASR-SIM) that models different types of semantic mistakes in the ASR-M transcription as well as different speech profiles. We use the simulator to evaluate the sensitivity to ASR-M mistakes of a Long Short-Term Memory network classifier trained in EOTD with different featurization techniques. Our experiments reveal the different ways in which the performance of the model is influenced by the ASR-M errors. We corroborate that not only is the ASR-SIM useful to estimate the performance of an EOTD-M in customized noisy scenarios but it can also be used to generate training datasets with the expected error rates of real working conditions which leads to better performance.;2021
An essential component of any dialogue system is understanding the language which is known as spoken language understanding (SLU). Dialogue act classification (DAC) intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF) are significant aspects of every dialogue system. In this paper we propose a deep learning-based multi-task model that can perform DAC ID and SF tasks together. We use a deep bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) as the frameworks in our multi-task model. We use attention on the LSTM/GRU output for DAC and ID. The attention outputs are fed to individual task-specific dense layers for DAC and ID. The output of LSTM/GRU is fed to softmax layer for slot filling as well. Experiments on three datasets i.e. ATIS TRAINS and FRAMES show that our proposed multi-task model performs better than the individual models as well as all the pipeline models. The experimental results prove that our attention-based multi-task model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for the SLU tasks. For DAC in relation to the individual model we achieve an improvement of more than 2% for all the datasets. Similarly for ID we get an improvement of 1% on the ATIS dataset while for TRAINS and FRAMES dataset there is a significant improvement of more than 3% compared to individual models. We also get a 0.8% enhancement for ATIS and a 4% enhancement for TRAINS and FRAMES dataset for SF with respect to individual models. Results obtained clearly show that our approach is better than existing methods. The validation of the obtained results is also demonstrated using statistical significance t tests.;2021
An important goal in open-domain dialogue research is to make chatbot generate emotional responses given a context. To achieve this some researchers have attempted to introduce affective information into neural dialogue models. However these neural dialogue models containing affective information still suf-fer from the problem of generating safe but meaningless responses such as I don't know which makes users lose interest in chatting quickly. Fortunately the latest research has proven that conditional vari-ational auto-encoder (CVAE) can solve this problem and enhance the responses' diversity. In this paper we combine affective knowledge into the CVAE-based model to generate diverse and affective responses. First we use an affective lexicon to understand each word's emotion in the input sentences and feed the affective vector with its embedding vector together into the CVAE-based model. Next we construct semantic and affective loss functions enabling the model to simultaneously learn the response's seman-tic and affective distributions. Additionally we formulate a ranking rule to help rank the candidate responses according to their syntax semantics and affection scores thereby enhancing the emotion and relevance while retaining the response's diversity. Finally we evaluate the proposed model on the DailyDialog dataset and Reddit dataset. The experimental results show that our model can generate more emotional diverse and context-relevant responses compared to the baselines. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2021
An increasing amount of data is now available from public and private sources. Furthermore the types formats and number of sources of data are also increasing. Techniques for extracting storing processing and analyzing such data have been developed in the last few years for managing this bewildering variety based on a structure called a knowledge graph. Industry has devoted a great deal of effort to the development of knowledge graphs and knowledge graphs are now critical to the functions of intelligent virtual assistants such as Siri Alexa and Google Assistant. The goal of the Ontology Summit 2020 was to understand not only what knowledge graphs are but also where they originated why they are so popular the current issues and their future prospects. The summit sessions examined many examples of knowledge graphs and surveyed the relevant standards that exist and are in development for knowledge graphs. The purpose of this Communique is to summarize our understanding from the Summit in order to foster research and development of knowledge graphs.;2021
Approaches for developing Dialogue Systems (DSs) are typically categorized into rule-based and data-driven. Data-driven DSs require a massive quantity of training data while rule-based DSs rely on a predefined set of rules and keywords that are to be detected in the user's utterances. The data-driven approaches show more promising results but owing to a lack of available training data for Arabic task-oriented DSs development of an Arabic task-oriented DS has typically been conducted using the rule-based approach. In this article we propose a hybrid rule-based and data-driven approach in a text-based flight booking DS capable of handling customer's utterances. The proposed DS was built through utilizing the Wit.ai natural language interface. The conversation flow was configured using the Wizard of Oz technique and the DS intents and entities were developed through the use of crowdsourcing training examples. The evaluation results show that the system developed was able to understand user utterances and to self-feed efficiently.;2021
Artificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming integrated in many aspects of human life. One particular AI comes in the form of conversational agents (CAs) such as Siri Alexa and chatbots used for customer service on websites and other information systems. It is widely accepted that humans treat systems as social actors. Leveraging this bias companies sometimes attempt to masquerade a CA as a human customer service representative. In addition to the ethical and legal questions around this practice the benefits and drawbacks of a CA pretending to be human are unclear due to a lack of study. While more human-like interactions can improve outcomes when users find out that the CA is not human they may have a negative reaction that may cause reputation harm in the company. In this research we use Expectation Violation Theory to explain what happens when users have high or low expectations of a conversation. We conducted an experiment with 175 participants where some participants were told they were interacting with a CA while others were told they were interacting with a human. We further divided the groups so that some participants interacted with a CA with low conversational capability while others interacted with a CA with high conversational capability. The results show that expectations formed by the user before the interaction change how the user evaluates the CA beyond the actual performance of the CA. These findings provide guidance to developers not just of conversational agents but also for other technologies where users may be uncertain of a system?s capabilities.;2021
Artificial Intelligence is revolutionising our communication practices and the ways in which we interact with each other. This revolution does not only impact how we communicate but it affects the nature of the partners with whom we communicate. Online discussion platforms now allow humans to communicate with artificial agents in the form of socialbots. Such agents have the potential to moderate online discussions and even manipulate and alter public opinions. In this paper we propose to study this phenomenon using a constructed large-scale agent platform. At the heart of the platform lies an artificial agent that can moderate online discussions using argumentative messages. We investigate the influence of the agent on the evolution of an online debate involving human participants. The agent will dynamically react to their messages by moderating supporting or attacking their stances. We conducted two experiments to evaluate the platform while looking at the effects of the conversational agent. The first experiment is a large-scale discussion with 1076 citizens from Afghanistan discussing urban policy-making in the city of Kabul. The goal of the experiment was to increase the citizen involvement in implementing Sustainable Development Goals. The second experiment is a small-scale debate between a group of 16 students about globalisation and taxation in Myanmar. In the first experiment we found that the agent improved the responsiveness of the participants and increased the number of identified ideas and issues. In the second experiment we found that the agent polarised the debate by reinforcing the initial stances of the participant.;2021
Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have been introduced in humanitarian operations in order to help with the significant challenges the sector is facing. This article focuses on chatbots which have been proposed as an efficient method to improve communication with and accountability to affected communities. Chatbots together with other humanitarian AI applications such as biometrics satellite imaging predictive modelling and data visualisations are often understood as part of the wider phenomenon of 'AI for social good'. The article develops a decolonial critique of humanitarianism and critical algorithm studies which focuses on the power asymmetries underpinning both humanitarianism and AI. The article asks whether chatbots as exemplars of 'AI for good' reproduce inequalities in the global context. Drawing on a mixed methods study that includes interviews with seven groups of stakeholders the analysis observes that humanitarian chatbots do not fulfil claims such as 'intelligence'. Yet AI applications still have powerful consequences. Apart from the risks associated with misinformation and data safeguarding chatbots reduce communication to its barest instrumental forms which creates disconnects between affected communities and aid agencies. This disconnect is compounded by the extraction of value from data and experimentation with untested technologies. By reflecting the values of their designers and by asserting Eurocentric values in their programmed interactions chatbots reproduce the coloniality of power. The article concludes that 'AI for good' is an 'enchantment of technology' that reworks the colonial legacies of humanitarianism whilst also occluding the power dynamics at play.;2021
Artificial intelligence (AI) digital assistants such as Amazon's Echo Alexa and Apple's Siri are becoming quite common in our homes. Today these voices typically come from a small speaker. But soon they will be replaced by devices that appear more human than robot. As a result our relationships with them will change. We will talk to them and share information including our secrets with them. Of course we will have to trust them with this information. But should we? If an AI is in the home and monitoring a person what should it do if someone is exhibiting signs of alcoholism depression or violence? Accordingly this Article postulates how changes in our personal relationship with AI could lead to changes in how privacy protections are viewed. First this Article examines nascent issues of AI assistants publicizing private activities and how these issues could evolve in the future. Next this Article outlines privacy law as it pertains to activity in the home. Finally this Article postulates how cultural expectations of privacy could erode in the future and offers suggestions on how to model laws that balance privacy with public safety.;2021
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in various industries. In this work we concentrate on what AI is capable of doing in manufacturing in the form of a chatbot. We designed a chatbot that helps users complete an assembly task that simulates those in manufacturing settings. In order to recreate this setting we have users assemble a Meccanoid robot through multiple stages with the help of an interactive dialogue system. Based on classifying users' intent the chatbot is able to provide answers or instructions to the user when the user encounters problems during the assembly process. Our goal is to improve our system so that it can capture users' needs by detecting their intent and therefore provide relevant and helpful information to the user. However in a multiple-step task we cannot rely on intent classification with user question utterance as the only input as user questions raised from different steps may share the same intent but require different responses. In this paper we proposed two methods to address this problem. One is that we capture not only textual features but also visual features through the YOLO-based Masker with CNN (YMC) model. Another is the usage of an Autoencoder to encode multi-modal features for user intent classification. By incorporating visual information we have significantly improved the chatbot's performance from the experiments conducted on different dataset.;2021
Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers such as health monitoring with wearable devices advice with recommender systems peace of mind with smart household products and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture (2) classification (3) delegation and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations' investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.;2021
Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots are changing the nature of service interfaces from being human-driven to technology-dominant. As a result customers are expected to resolve issues themselves before reaching out to customer service representatives ultimately becoming a central element of service production as co-creators of value. However AI-powered interactions can also fail potentially leading to anger confusion and customer dissatisfaction. We draw on the value co-creation literature to investigate the process of co-destruction in AI-powered service interactions. We adopt an exploratory approach based on in-depth interviews with 27 customers who have interacted with AI-powered chatbots in customer service settings. We find five antecedents of failed interactions between customers and chatbots: authenticity issues cognition challenges affective issues functionality issues and integration conflicts. We observe that although customers do accept part of the responsibility for co-destruction they largely attribute the problems they experience to resource misintegration by service providers. Our findings contribute a better understanding of value co-destruction in AI-powered service settings and provide a richer conceptualization of the link between customer resource loss attributions of resource loss and subsequent customer coping strategies. Our findings also offer service managers insights into how to avoid and mitigate value co-destruction in AI service settings.;2021
Artificial intelligence has reached deep into our lives though you might be hard pressed to point to obvious examples of it. Among countless other behind-the-scenes chores neural networks power our virtual assistants make online shopping recommendations recognize people in our snapshots scrutinize our banking transactions for evidence of fraud transcribe our voice messages and weed out hateful social-media postings. What these applications have in common is that they involve learning and operating in a constrained predictable environment. center dot But embedding AI more firmly into our endeavors and enterprises poses a great challenge. To get to the next level researchers are trying to fuse AI and robotics to create an intelligence that can make decisions and control a physical body in the messy unpredictable and unforgiving real world. It's a potentially revolutionary objective that has caught the attention of some of the most powerful tech-research organizations on the planet. I'd say that robotics as a field is probably 10 years behind where computer vision is says Raia Hadsell head of robotics at DeepMind Google's London-based AI partner. (Both companies are subsidiaries of Alphabet.) center dot Even for Google the challenges are daunting. Some are hard but straightforward: For most robotic applications it's difficult to gather the huge data sets that have driven progress in other areas of AI. But some problems are more profound and relate to long-standing conundrums in AI. Problems like how do you learn a new task without forgetting the old one? And how do you create an AI that can apply the skills it learns for a new task to the tasks it has mastered before?;2021
Artificial intelligence increasingly forms an essential context for the distribution of power within workplaces. Using the case study of an AI-enabled chatbot initially created by IBM and subsequently developed by an alt-labour network in the United States and a traditional union in Australia this article outlines several distinctive ways in which the chatbot increased union resources and capabilities. Once reconfigured to reflect an 'organising' rather than 'servicing' ethos the chatbot became an infrastructural resource that enabled otherwise marginal workers to receive basic information in a manner that reinforced union narratives of power and worker solidarity and workplaces to be mapped more efficiently. The chatbot did not act as a labour saving tool but stimulated wide-ranging learning by bringing implicit tensions between 'servicing' and 'organising' conceptions of knowledge power and expertise to the surface. Chatbots thus offer distinctive potential affordances to unions in enhancing their resources and capabilities as 'orchestrators' of worker power.;2021
Artificial intelligence(AI) systems that interact with humans such as chatbots and language translators have many useful applications. However care must be put in addressing some concerns such as the presence of bias possible abusive language and information leakage that could hamper public trust in them. In this article we focus on gender bias in online translators as recognized and rated by a third-party assessment who does not have access to the training data and we propose a visualization approach for such rating. We then conduct a survey of how users perceive bias in translators whether they appreciate the proposed bias rating visualization and how they may use it to reason about bias-accuracy trade-offs.;2021
Artificial intelligence-driven voice technology deployed on mobile phones and smart speakers has the potential to improve patient management and organizational workflow. Voice chatbots have been already implemented in health care-leveraging innovative telehealth solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. They allow for automatic acute care triaging and chronic disease management including remote monitoring preventive care patient intake and referral assistance. This paper focuses on the current clinical needs and applications of artificial intelligence-driven voice chatbots to drive operational effectiveness and improve patient experience and outcomes.;2021
As a representative technique in natural language processing (NLP) named entity recognition is used in many tasks such as dialogue systems machine translation and information extraction. In dialogue systems there is a common case for named entity recognition where a lot of entities are composed of numbers and are segmented to be located in different places. For example in multiple rounds of dialogue systems a phone number is likely to be divided into several parts because the phone number is usually long and is emphasized. In this paper the entity consisting of numbers is named as number entity. The discontinuous positions of number entities result from many reasons. We find two reasons from real-world dialogue systems. The first reason is the repetitive confirmation of different components of a number entity and the second reason is the interception of mood words. The extraction of number entities is quite useful in many tasks such as user information completion and service requests correction. However the existing entity extraction methods cannot extract entities consisting of discontinuous entity blocks. To address these problems in this paper we propose a comprehensive method for number entity recognition which is capable of extracting number entities in multiple rounds of dialogues systems. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the high performance of our method.;2021
As a virtual human is provided with more human-like characteristics will it elicit stronger social responses from people? Two experiments were conducted to address these questions. The first experiment investigated whether virtual humans can evoke a social facilitation response and how strong that response is when people are given different cognitive tasks that vary in difficulty. The second experiment investigated whether people apply politeness norms to virtual humans. Participants were tutored either by a human tutor or a virtual human tutor that varied in features and then evaluated the tutor's performance. Results indicate that virtual humans can produce social facilitation not only with facial appearance but also with voice. In addition performance in the presence of voice synced facial appearance seems to elicit stronger social facilitation than in the presence of voice only or face only. Similar findings were observed with the politeness norm experiment. Participants who evaluated their tutor directly reported the tutor's performance more favorably than participants who evaluated their tutor indirectly. This valence toward the voice synced facial appearance had no statistical difference compared to the valence toward the human tutor condition. The results suggest that designers of virtual humans should be mindful about the social nature of virtual humans.;2021
As conversational agents like Ski and Alexa gain in popularity and use conversation is becoming a more and more important mode of interaction for search. Conversational search shares some features with traditional search but differs in some important respects: conversational search systems are less likely to return ranked lists of results (a SERP) more likely to involve iterated interactions and more likely to feature longer well-formed user queries in the form of natural language questions. Because of these differences traditional methods for search evaluation (such as the Cranfield paradigm) do not translate easily to conversational search. In this work we propose a framework for offline evaluation of conversational search which includes a methodology for creating test collections with relevance judgments an evaluation measure based on a user interaction model and an approach to collecting user interaction data to train the model. The framework is based on the idea of subtopics often used to model novelty and diversity in search and recommendation and the user model is similar to the geometric browsing model introduced by RBP and used in ERR. As far as we know this is the first work to combine these ideas into a comprehensive framework for offline evaluation of conversational search.;2021
As COVID-19 hounds the world the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers institutions governments and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT) artificial intelligence (AI)-including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics-as well as Robotics and Blockchain are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19 offer opportunities for more holistic studies and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First four areas where IoT can contribute are discussed namely: 1) tracking and tracing 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT) 3) personal digital twins (PDTs) and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second the role and novel applications of AI are explained namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis 2) risk prediction 3) vaccine and drug development 4) research data set 5) early warnings and alerts 6) social control and fake news detection and 7) communication and chatbot. Third the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed including: 1) crowd surveillance 2) public announcements 3) screening and diagnosis and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) of which blockchain is a common example can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.;2021
As our understanding of the construct of oral communication (OC) has evolved so have the possibilities of computer technology undertaking the delivery of tests that measure this ability. It is paramount to understand to what extent such developments lead to accurate comprehensive and useful assessment of OC. In this paper we discuss five models of technology-delivered OC assessment that have appeared in the past three decades. We evaluate these models in terms of how well their respective methods aid in assessing OC. To achieve this aim we use a framework which takes into account a contemporary view of OC ability including the call for incorporating English as a lingua franca (ELF) considerations into English language assessment. The evaluation of the five models suggests strengths and weaknesses of each that should be considered when determining which is used for a particular purpose.;2021
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues the need for a better health care facility is highlighted more than ever. Besides physical health mental health conditions have become a significant concern. Unfortunately there are few opportunities for people to receive mental health care. There are inadequate facilities for seeking mental health support even in big cities let alone remote areas. This paper presents the structure and implementation procedures for a mental health support system combining technology and professionals. The system is a web platform where mental health seekers can register and use functionalities like NLP-based chatbot for personality assessment chatting with like-minded people and one-to-one video conferencing with a mental health professional. The video calling feature of the system has emotion detection capabilities using computer vision. The system also includes downloadable prescription facilities and a payment gateway for secure transactions. From a technological aspect the conversational NLP-based chatbot and computer vision-powered video calling are the system's most important features. The system has a documentation facility to analyze the mental health condition over time. The web platform is built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. MongoDB is used as the database of the platform. The NLP chatbot is built on a three-layered deep neural network model that is programmed in the Python language and uses the NLTK TensorFlow and Keras sequential API. Video conference is one of the most important features of the platform. To create the video calling feature Express.js Socket.io and Socket.io-client have been used. The emotion detection feature is implemented on video conferences using computer vision Haar Cascade and TensorFlow. All the implemented features are tested and work fine. The targeted users for the platform are teenagers youth and the middle-aged population. Mental health-seeking is still considered taboo in some societies today. Apart from basic established facilities this social dilemma of undergoing treatment for mental health is causing severe damage to individuals. A solution to this problem can be a remote platform for mental health support. With this goal in mind this system is designed to provide mental health support to people remotely from anywhere worldwide.;2021
As the COVID-19 pandemic has largely increased the utilization of telehealth mobile mental health technologies - such as smartphone apps vir-tual reality chatbots and social media - have also gained attention. These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry covering three areas. First we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care by detailing how smartphones social media artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for digital phenotyping and remote intervention. Second we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts covering their emerging efficacy in self-management of psychological well-being and early intervention along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long-term psychiatric conditions - including major depression anxiety bipolar and psychotic disorders and eating and substance use disorders - as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real-world implementation using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves the recipients of these innovations and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones artificial intelligence social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed and detail the key issues at the patient provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.;2021
As the dual task of question answering question generation (QG) is a significant and challenging task that aims to generate valid and fluent questions from a given paragraph. The QG task is of great significance to question answering systems conversational systems and machine reading comprehension systems. Recent sequence to sequence neural models have achieved outstanding performance in English and Chinese QG tasks. However the task of Tibetan QG is rarely mentioned. The key factor impeding its development is the lack of a public Tibetan QG dataset. Faced with this challenge the present paper first collects 425 articles from the Tibetan Wikipedia website and constructs 7234 question-answer pairs through crowdsourcing. Next we propose a Tibetan QG model based on the sequence to sequence framework to generate Tibetan questions from given paragraphs. Secondly in order to generate answer-aware questions we introduce an attention mechanism that can capture the key semantic information related to the answer. Meanwhile we adopt a copy mechanism to copy some words in the paragraph to avoid generating unknown or rare words in the question. Finally experiments show that our model achieves higher performance than baseline models. We also further explore the attention and copy mechanisms and prove their effectiveness through experiments.;2021
As with other businesses tourist companies are taking advantage of modern technologies. Chatbots are a recent technology that hotels travel agencies and airline companies are adopting. Despite this industry-wide implementation there is no evidence about the factors that explain why consumers are willing to interact with chatbots. This work proposes a model to explain chatbot usage intention. The model and its hypotheses were tested by structural equations with the PLS technique. The study was conducted on a sample of 476 individuals who had travelled on vacation in the previous 12 months. The study reveals that the intentions behind using chatbots are directly influenced by the following factors: the chatbots' expected performance the habit of using chatbots the hedonic component in using them the predisposition to using self-service technologies the social influences and the fact that the chatbot behaves like a human. The inconvenience and problems related to communicating with the chatbot were found to have a negative influence. Lastly the possibility that chatbots could replace jobs had a surprisingly positive influence and not a negative one.;2021
Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialog (AVSD) is a task to generate responses when chatting about a given video which is organized as a track of the 8th Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC8). There are two challenges in this task: 1) making effective interaction among different modalities 2) better understanding dialogues and generating informative responses. To tackle the challenges we propose a universal multimodal transformer and introduce the multi-task learning method to learn joint representations among different modalities as well as generate informative and fluent responses by leveraging the pre-trained language model. Our method extends the natural language generation pre-trained model to multimodal dialogue generation task which allows fine-tuning language models to capture information across both visual and textual modalities. Our system achieves the best performance in the objective evaluation in both DSTC7-AVSD and DSTC8-AVSD dataset and achieves an impressive 98.4% of the human performance based on human ratings in the DSTC8-AVSD challenge.;2021
Augmented Reality (AR) headsets extended with eye-tracking a promising input technology for its natural and implicit nature open a wide range of new interaction capabilities for everyday use. In this paper we present ARtention a design space for gaze interaction specifically tailored for in-situ AR information interfaces. It highlights three important dimensions to consider in the UI design of such gaze-enabled applications: transitions from reality to the virtual interface from single-to multi-layer content and from information consumption to selection tasks. Such transitional aspects bring previously isolated gaze interaction concepts together to form a unified AR space enabling more advanced application control seamlessly mediated by gaze. We describe these factors in detail. To illustrate how the design space can be used we present three prototype applications and report informal user feedback obtained from different scenarios: a conversational UI viewing a 3D visualization and browsing items for shopping. We conclude with design considerations derived from our development and evaluation of the prototypes. We expect these to be valuable for researchers and designers investigating the use of gaze input in AR systems and applications. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a life-long neurological disability and a cure has not yet been found. ASD begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person's life. Through early intervention many actions can be taken to improve the quality of life of children. Robots are one of the best choices for accompanying children with autism. However for most robots the dialogue system uses traditional techniques to produce responses. Robots cannot produce meaningful answers when the conversations have not been recorded in a database. The main contribution of our work is the incorporation of a conversation model into an actual robot system for supporting children with autism. We present the use a neural network model as the generative conversational agent which aimed at generating meaningful and coherent dialogue responses given the dialogue history. The proposed model shares an embedding layer between the encoding and decoding processes through adoption. The model is different from the canonical Seq2Seq model in which the encoder output is used only to set-up the initial state of the decoder to avoid favoring short and unconditional responses with high prior probability. In order to improve the sensitivity to context we changed the input method of the model to better adapt to the utterances of children with autism. We adopted transfer learning to make the proposed model learn the characteristics of dialogue with autistic children and to solve the problem of the insufficient corpus of dialogue. Experiments showed that the proposed method was superior to the canonical Seq2sSeq model and the GAN-based dialogue model in both automatic evaluation indicators and human evaluation including pushing the BLEU precision to 0.23 the greedy matching score to 0.69 the embedding average score to 0.82 the vector extrema score to 0.55 the skip-thought score to 0.65 the KL divergence score to 5.73 and the EMD score to 12.21.;2021
Autonomous and interactive healthcare applications exist for providing patients with customized services through user equipment (UE). For user interaction these applications take the form of chatbots or physical robots. A user's request/query is fed as input for fetching and delivering user services. Due to the wide range of connectivity and application services heavy data traffic can deteriorate the quality of application service. This paper proposes a relative traffic management scheme (RTMS) to address traffic issues in applications involving delicate healthcare data. The proposed scheme uses healthcare data flow and query processing to improve the responsiveness of autonomous robot-based services. Dilated traffic at any interconnecting edge is identified based on flow concentration for this purpose ant colony optimization (ACO) is used. The premature convergence issue in ACO is addressed by using a linear sigmoid function which identifies the converging points based on the query processing factor to reinitiate the application service discovery and responsive deliveries. This helps to reduce both outages in healthcare service provisioning and processing time. It additionally improves response with controlled processing complexity.;2021
Autonomous intelligent systems are starting to influence clinical practice as ways to both readily exploit experts' knowledge when contextual conditions demand so and harness the overwhelming amount of patient related data currently at clinicians' disposal. However these two approaches are rarely synergistically exploited and tend to be used without integration. In this paper we follow recent efforts reported in the literature regarding integration of BDI agency with machine learning based Cognitive Services by proposing an integration architecture and by validating such architecture in the complex domain of trauma management. In particular we show that augmentation of a BDI agent endowed with predefined plans encoding experts' knowledge with a Cognitive Service trained on past observed data can enhance trauma management by reducing over triage episodes.;2021
Background and Objective: This study describes the integration of a spoken dialogue system and nursing records on an Android smartphone application intending to help nurses reduce documentation time and improve the overall experience of a healthcare setting. The application also incorporates with collecting personal sensor data and activity labels for activity recognition. Methods: We developed a joint model based on a bidirectional long-short term memory and conditional random fields (Bi-LSTM-CRF) to identify user intention and extract record details from user utterances. Then we transformed unstructured data into record inputs on the smartphone application. Results: The joint model achieved the highest F1-score at 96.79%. Moreover we conducted an experiment to demonstrate the proposed model's capability and feasibility in recording in realistic settings. Our preliminary evaluation results indicate that when using the dialogue-based we could increase the percentage of documentation speed to 58.13% compared to the traditional keyboard-based. Conclusions: Based on our findings we highlight critical and promising future research directions regarding the design of the efficient spoken dialogue system and nursing records.

Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most promising areas in medicine with many possibilities for improving health and wellness. Already today diagnostic decision support systems may help patients to estimate the severity of their complaints. This fictional case study aimed to test the diagnostic potential of an AI algorithm for common sports injuries and pathologies. Methods Based on a literature review and clinical expert experience five fictional common cases of acute and subacute injuries or chronic sport-related pathologies were created: Concussion ankle sprain muscle pain chronic knee instability (after ACL rupture) and tennis elbow. The symptoms of these cases were entered into a freely available chatbot-guided AI app and its diagnoses were compared to the pre-defined injuries and pathologies. Results A mean of 25-36 questions were asked by the app per patient with optional explanations of certain questions or illustrative photos on demand. It was stressed that the symptom analysis would not replace a doctor's consultation. A 23-yr-old male patient case with a mild concussion was correctly diagnosed. An ankle sprain of a 27-yr-old female without ligament or bony lesions was also detected and an ER visit was suggested. Muscle pain in the thigh of a 19-yr-old male was correctly diagnosed. In the case of a 26-yr-old male with chronic ACL instability the algorithm did not sufficiently cover the chronic aspect of the pathology but the given recommendation of seeing a doctor would have helped the patient. Finally the condition of the chronic epicondylitis in a 41-yr-old male was correctly detected. Conclusions All chosen injuries and pathologies were either correctly diagnosed or at least tagged with the right advice of when it is urgent for seeking a medical specialist. However the quality of AI-based results could presumably depend on the data-driven experience of these programs as well as on the understanding of their users. Further studies should compare existing AI programs and their diagnostic accuracy for medical injuries and pathologies.;2021
Background Chatbots and virtual voice assistants are increasingly common in primary care without sufficient evidence for their feasibility and effectiveness. We aimed to assess how perceived stigma and severity of various health issues are associated with the acceptability for three sources of health information and consultation: an automated chatbot a General Practitioner (GP) or a combination of both. Methods Between May and June 2019 we conducted an online study advertised via Facebook for UK citizens. It was a factorial simulation experiment with three within-subject factors (perceived health issue stigma severity and consultation source) and six between-subject covariates. Acceptability rating for each consultation source was the dependant variable. A single mixed-model ANOVA was performed. Results Amongst 237 participants (65% aged over 45 years old 73% women) GP consultations were seen as most acceptable followed by GP-chatbot service. Chatbots were seen least acceptable as a consultation source for severe health issues while the acceptability was significantly higher for stigmatised health issues. No associations between participants' characteristics and acceptability were found. Conclusions Although healthcare professionals are perceived as the most desired sources of health information chatbots may be useful for sensitive health issues in which disclosure of personal information is challenging. However chatbots are less acceptable for health issues of higher severity and should not be recommended for use within that context. Policymakers and digital service designers need to recognise the limitations of health chatbots. Future research should establish a set of health topics most suitable for chatbot-led interventions and primary healthcare services.;2021
Background Family health history (FHx) is an effective tool for identifying patients at risk of hereditary cancer. Hereditary cancer clinical practice guidelines (CPG) contain criteria used to evaluate FHx and to make recommendations for genetic consultation. Comparing different CPGs used to evaluate a common set of FHx provides insight into how well the CPGs perform the extent of agreement across guidelines and how well they identify patients who should consider a cancer genetic consultation. Methods We compare the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Networks (NCCN) (2019) CPG criteria for FHx collected by a chatbot and evaluated by ontologies and web services in a previous study. Collected FHx met criteria from seven groups: Gene Mutation Breast and Ovarian Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) Colorectal and Endometrial Relative Meets Criteria ACMG Only Criteria and NCCN Testing. CPG Criteria were coded and matched across 12 ACMG sub-guidelines and 6 NCCN sub-guidelines for comparison purposes. Results The dataset contains 4915 records of which 2221 met either ACMG or NCCN criteria and 2694 did not. There was significant overlap-1179 probands met both ACMG and NCCN criteria. The greatest similarities were for Gene Mutation and Breast and Ovarian criteria and the greatest disparity existed among Colorectal and Endometrial criteria. Only 156 positive gene mutations were reported and of the 2694 probands who did not meet criteria 90.6% of them reported at least one cancer in their personal or family cancer history. Conclusion Hereditary cancer CPGs are useful for identifying patients at risk of developing cancer based on FHx. This comparison shows that with the aid of chatbots ontologies and web services CPGs can be more efficiently applied to identify patients at risk of hereditary cancer. Additionally this comparison examines similarities and differences between ACMG and NCCN and shows the importance of using both guidelines when evaluating hereditary cancer risk.;2021
Background Hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC) syndromes account for 10% of colorectal cancers but remain underdiagnosed. This feasibility project tested the utility of an artificial intelligence-based chatbot deployed to patients scheduled for colonoscopy to identify HCRC risk factors educate participants about HCRC and obtain consent to genetic testing as an extension of genetic counselling of appropriate subjects. Genetic counsellor (GC) and genetic counselling assistant (GCA) time spent per subject was also measured. Methods Patients scheduled for colonoscopy at Cleveland Clinic were invited via electronic medical record patient portal or letter prior to colonoscopy with a link to a chatbot administering the Colon Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (CCRAT) to screen for HCRC syndromes. Those with >= 1 positive response to a CCRAT question received chatbot-deployed genetic education and the option to receive genetic testing. An order for a 55-gene pan-cancer panel was placed for those consenting and the subject had blood drawn on the day of colonoscopy. Results were disclosed by a GC or GCA by telephone. Subject demographics progression through the chat responses to CCRAT personal and family history genetic test results and communication with the subject were recorded. Descriptive statistics and two-tailed unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test were used. Results 506/4254 (11.9%) initiated and 487 (96.2%) completed the chat with the chatbot. 215 (44.1%) answered 'yes' to >= 1 CCRAT question and all completed pretest education. 129/181 (71.3%) subjects who consented completed testing and 12 (9.3%) were found to have a germline pathogenic variant. Per subject the GC spent a mean of 14.3 (SD 7.3) and the GCA a mean of 19.2 (SD 9.8) minutes. Conclusion The use of a chatbot in this setting was a novel and feasible method with the potential of increasing genetic screening and testing in individuals at risk of HCRC syndromes.;2021
Background In recent years an increasing number of health chatbots has been published in app stores and described in research literature. Given the sensitive data they are processing and the care settings for which they are developed evaluation is essential to avoid harm to users. However evaluations of those systems are reported inconsistently and without using a standardized set of evaluation metrics. Missing standards in health chatbot evaluation prevent comparisons of systems and this may hamper acceptability since their reliability is unclear. Objectives The objective of this paper is to make an important step toward developing a health-specific chatbot evaluation framework by finding consensus on relevant metrics. Methods We used an adapted Delphi study design to verify and select potential metrics that we retrieved initially from a scoping review. We invited researchers health professionals and health informaticians to score each metric for inclusion in the final evaluation framework over three survey rounds. We distinguished metrics scored relevant with high moderate and low consensus. The initial set of metrics comprised 26 metrics (categorized as global metrics metrics related to response generation response understanding and aesthetics). Results Twenty-eight experts joined the first round and 22 (75%) persisted to the third round. Twenty-four metrics achieved high consensus and three metrics achieved moderate consensus. The core set for our framework comprises mainly global metrics (e.g. ease of use security content accuracy) metrics related to response generation (e.g. appropriateness of responses) and related to response understanding. Metrics on aesthetics (font type and size color) are less well agreed upon-only moderate or low consensus was achieved for those metrics. Conclusion The results indicate that experts largely agree on metrics and that the consensus set is broad. This implies that health chatbot evaluation must be multifaceted to ensure acceptability.;2021
Background Less than 2% of overweight children and adolescents in Switzerland can participate in multi-component behaviour changing interventions (BCI) due to costs and lack of time. Stress often hinders positive health outcomes in youth with obesity. Digital health interventions with fewer on-site visits promise health care access in remote regions however evidence for their effectiveness is scarce. Methods This randomized controlled not blinded trial (1:1) was conducted in a childhood obesity center in Switzerland. Forty-one youth aged 10-18 years with body mass index (BMI) > P.90 with risk factors or co-morbidities or BMI > P.97 were recruited. During 5.5 months the PathMate2 group (PM) received daily conversational agent counselling via mobile app combined with standardized counselling (4 on-site visits). Controls (CON) participated in a BCI (7 on-site visits). We compared the outcomes of both groups after 5.5 (T1) and 12 (T2) months. Primary outcome was reduction in BMI-SDS (BMI standard deviation score: BMI adjusted for age and sex). Secondary outcomes were changes in body fat and muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance analysis) waist-to-height ratio physical capacities (modified Dordel-Koch-Test) blood pressure and pulse. Additionally we hypothesized that less stressed children would lose more weight. Thus children performed biofeedback relaxation exercises while stress parameters (plasma cortisol stress questionnaires) were evaluated. Results At intervention start median BMI-SDS of all patients (18 PM 13 CON) was 2.61 (obesity > + 2SD). BMI-SDS decreased significantly in CON at T1 but not at T2 and did not decrease in PM during the study. Muscle mass strength and agility improved significantly in both groups at T2 only PM reduced significantly their body fat at T1 and T2. Average daily PM app usage rate was 71.5%. Cortisol serum levels decreased significantly after biofeedback but with no association between stress parameters and BMI-SDS. No side effects were observed. Conclusions Equally to BCI PathMate2 intervention resulted in significant and lasting improvements of physical capacities and body composition but not in sustained BMI-SDS decrease. This youth-appealing mobile health intervention provides an interesting approach for youth with obesity who have limited access to health care. Biofeedback reduces acute stress and could be an innovative adjunct to usual care.;2021
Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and multi-faceted endocrine disorder that affects 5-20% of women. Literature is limited regarding potentially differing PCOS phenotypes among women around the world. Objective To use Flo app technology to understand the multifaceted characteristics of PCOS across several countries and identify contributing risk factors to the development of this condition. Study design Flo is a widely used female health and wellbeing app with period tracking functionality that provides a globally representative and medically unbiased perspective on PCOS symptomatology. A chatbot dialog on PCOS was subsequently administered on the Flo application (app) to users from 142 countries (with at least 100 respondents) who have the app running in English during September-October 2019. Results For analyses we selected the five countries with the greatest number of respondents: US (n = 243238) UK (n = 68325) India (n = 40092) Philippines (n = 35131) and Australia (n = 29926). Bloating was the most frequently reported symptom among PCOS-positive women and appeared to be the main predictor of PCOS in our model (odds ratio 3 center dot 76 [95% CI 3 center dot 60-3 center dot 94] p < 0 center dot 0001). Additional top predictors of PCOS are high blood cholesterol and glucose levels. As BMI increased the percentage of women who reported a physician-confirmed PCOS diagnosis also increased. However women in India did not follow this trend. Conclusion Our findings are based on the largest known PCOS dataset and indicate that symptoms are more complex than previously understood. The most frequently reported symptoms (bloating facial hirsutism irregular cycles hyperpigmentation and baldness) are broader than those included in the Rotterdam criteria. Future work should reevaluate and refine the criteria utilized in PCOS diagnosis.;2021
Background Semantic textual similarity (STS) captures the degree of semantic similarity between texts. It plays an important role in many natural language processing applications such as text summarization question answering machine translation information retrieval dialog systems plagiarism detection and query ranking. STS has been widely studied in the general English domain. However there exists few resources for STS tasks in the clinical domain and in languages other than English such as Japanese. Objective The objective of this study is to capture semantic similarity between Japanese clinical texts (Japanese clinical STS) by creating a Japanese dataset that is publicly available. Materials We created two datasets for Japanese clinical STS: (1) Japanese case reports (CR dataset) and (2) Japanese electronic medical records (EMR dataset). The CR dataset was created from publicly available case reports extracted from the CiNii database. The EMR dataset was created from Japanese electronic medical records. Methods We used an approach based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to capture the semantic similarity between the clinical domain texts. BERT is a popular approach for transfer learning and has been proven to be effective in achieving high accuracy for small datasets. We implemented two Japanese pretrained BERT models: a general Japanese BERT and a clinical Japanese BERT. The general Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese Wikipedia texts while the clinical Japanese BERT is pretrained on Japanese clinical texts. Results The BERT models performed well in capturing semantic similarity in our datasets. The general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT and achieved a high correlation with human score (0.904 in the CR dataset and 0.875 in the EMR dataset). It was unexpected that the general Japanese BERT outperformed the clinical Japanese BERT on clinical domain dataset. This could be due to the fact that the general Japanese BERT is pretrained on a wide range of texts compared with the clinical Japanese BERT.;2021
Background. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities for demand management of sexual and reproductive health services. Conversational agents/chatbots are increasingly common although little is known about how this technology could aid services. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators for engagement with sexual health chatbots to advise service developers and related health professionals. Methods. In January-June 2020 we conducted face-to-face semi-structured and online interviews to explore views on sexual health chatbots. Participants were asked to interact with a chatbot offering advice on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and relevant services. Participants were UK-based and recruited via social media. Data were recorded transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results. Forty participants (aged 18-50 years 64% women 77% heterosexual 58% white) took part. Many thought chatbots could aid sex education providing useful information about STIs and sign-posting to sexual health services in a convenient anonymous and non-judgemental way. Some compared chatbots to health professionals or Internet search engines and perceived this technology as inferior offering constrained content and interactivity limiting disclosure of personal information trust and perceived accuracy of chatbot responses. Conclusions. Despite mixed attitudes towards chatbots this technology was seen as useful for anonymous sex education but less suitable for matters requiring empathy. Chatbots may increase access to clinical services but their effectiveness and safety need to be established. Future research should identify which chatbots designs and functions lead to optimal engagement with this innovation.;2021
Background: A voice assistant (VA) is inanimate audio-interfaced software augmented with artificial intelligence capable of 2-way dialogue and increasingly used to access health care advice. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common perinatal mood disorder with an annual estimated cost of $14.2 billion. Only a small percentage of PPD patients seek care due to lack of screening and insufficient knowledge of the disease and this is therefore a prime candidate for a VA-based digital health intervention. Objective: In order to understand the capability of VAs our aim was to assess VA responses to PPD questions in terms of accuracy verbal response and clinically appropriate advice given. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined four VAs (Apple Siri Amazon Alexa Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) installed on two mobile devices in early 2020. We posed 14 questions to each VA that were retrieved from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) patient-focused Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on PPD. We scored the VA responses according to accuracy of speech recognition presence of a verbal response and clinically appropriate advice in accordance with ACOG FAQ which were assessed by two board-certified physicians. Results: Accurate recognition of the query ranged from 79% to 100%. Verbal response ranged from 36% to 79%. If no verbal response was given queries were treated like a web search between 33% and 89% of the time. Clinically appropriate advice given by VA ranged from 14% to 29%. We compared the category proportions using the Fisher exact test. No single VA statistically outperformed other VAs in the three performance categories. Additional observations showed that two VAs (Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) included advertisements in their responses. Conclusions: While the best performing VA gave clinically appropriate advice to 29% of the PPD questions all four VAs taken together achieved 64% clinically appropriate advice. All four VAs performed well in accurately recognizing a PPD query but no VA achieved even a 30% threshold for providing clinically appropriate PPD information. Technology companies and clinical organizations should partner to improve guidance screen patients for mental health disorders and educate patients on potential treatment.;2021
Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots are increasingly being used in health care but most chatbots are designed for a specific population and evaluated in controlled settings. There is little research documenting how health consumers (eg patients and caregivers) use chatbots for self-diagnosis purposes in real-world scenarios. Objective: The aim of this research was to understand how health chatbots are used in a real-world context what issues and barriers exist in their usage and how the user experience of this novel technology can be improved. Methods: We employed a data-driven approach to analyze the system log of a widely deployed self-diagnosis chatbot in China. Our data set consisted of 47684 consultation sessions initiated by 16519 users over 6 months. The log data included a variety of information including users' nonidentifiable demographic information consultation details diagnostic reports and user feedback. We conducted both statistical analysis and content analysis on this heterogeneous data set. Results: The chatbot users spanned all age groups including middle-aged and older adults. Users consulted the chatbot on a wide range of medical conditions including those that often entail considerable privacy and social stigma issues. Furthermore we distilled 2 prominent issues in the use of the chatbot: (1) a considerable number of users dropped out in the middle of their consultation sessions and (2) some users pretended to have health concerns and used the chatbot for nontherapeutic purposes. Finally we identified a set of user concerns regarding the use of the chatbot including insufficient actionable information and perceived inaccurate diagnostic suggestions. Conclusions: Although health chatbots are considered to be convenient tools for enhancing patient-centered care there are issues and barriers impeding the optimal use of this novel technology. Designers and developers should employ user-centered approaches to address the issues and user concerns to achieve the best uptake and utilization. We conclude the paper by discussing several design implications including making the chatbots more informative easy-to-use and trustworthy as well as improving the onboarding experience to enhance user engagement.;2021
Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven symptom checkers are available to millions of users globally and are advocated as a tool to deliver health care more efficiently. To achieve the promoted benefits of a symptom checker laypeople must trust and subsequently follow its instructions. In AI explanations are seen as a tool to communicate the rationale behind black-box decisions to encourage trust and adoption. However the effectiveness of the types of explanations used in AI-driven symptom checkers has not yet been studied. Explanations can follow many forms including why-explanations and how-explanations. Social theories suggest that why-explanations are better at communicating knowledge and cultivating trust among laypeople. Objective: The aim of this study is to ascertain whether explanations provided by a symptom checker affect explanatory trust among laypeople and whether this trust is impacted by their existing knowledge of disease. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 750 healthy participants was conducted. The participants were shown a video of a chatbot simulation that resulted in the diagnosis of either a migraine or temporal arteritis chosen for their differing levels of epidemiological prevalence. These diagnoses were accompanied by one of four types of explanations. Each explanation type was selected either because of its current use in symptom checkers or because it was informed by theories of contrastive explanation. Exploratory factor analysis of participants' responses followed by comparison-of-means tests were used to evaluate group differences in trust. Results: Depending on the treatment group two or three variables were generated reflecting the prior knowledge and subsequent mental model that the participants held. When varying explanation type by disease migraine was found to be nonsignificant (P=.65) and temporal arteritis marginally significant (P=.09). Varying disease by explanation type resulted in statistical significance for input influence (P=.001) social proof (P=.049) and no explanation (P=.006) with counterfactual explanation (P=.053). The results suggest that trust in explanations is significantly affected by the disease being explained. When laypeople have existing knowledge of a disease explanations have little impact on trust. Where the need for information is greater different explanation types engender significantly different levels of trust. These results indicate that to be successful symptom checkers need to tailor explanations to each user's specific question and discount the diseases that they may also be aware of. Conclusions: System builders developing explanations for symptom-checking apps should consider the recipient's knowledge of a disease and tailor explanations to each user's specific need. Effort should be placed on generating explanations that are personalized to each user of a symptom checker to fully discount the diseases that they may be aware of and to close their information gap.;2021
Background: Attention deficit is a growing problem in adults and early diagnosis and treatment are needed. Previous studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. However many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time space and cost constraints. Recently in other mental illnesses mobile-based chatbots delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and treatment. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a short-term intervention specifically a mobile-based interactive chatbot application in alleviating attention deficit symptoms. Methods: This was a randomized non-blind parallel-group pilot study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty-six individuals with attention deficit aged 19-60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n = 23) and information-only control groups (n = 23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the chatbot application Todaki while the latter group was provided with a book on managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit depression and anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The post-intervention survey assessed the chatbot's usability acceptability and side effects. Results: The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.5 years) and 56.5 % (26/ 46) participants were female. Intention-to-treat analysis (chatbot n = 23 control n = 23) revealed a significant reduction of attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group which is represented by group-by-time interaction in Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV AttentionDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms (F = 4.39 p = .04) and ADHD symptoms total (F = 6.74 p = .01). Further the results of the paired t-test were significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1 h 15 min (SD 1 h 20 min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was used. According to the participants the empathic/friendly character and unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot respectively. Conclusions: This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the mobile-based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self-guided management for people with attention deficit which should be verified through the large scale randomized controlled trial.;2021
Background: Behavioral eHealth and mobile health interventions have been moderately successful in increasing physical activity although opportunities for further improvement remain to be discussed. Chatbots equipped with natural language processing can interact and engage with users and help continuously monitor physical activity by using data from wearable sensors and smartphones. However a limited number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of chatbot interventions on physical activity. Objective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility usability and effectiveness of a machine learning-based physical activity chatbot. Methods: A quasi-experimental design without a control group was conducted with outcomes evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks. Participants wore a Fitbit Flex 1 (Fitbit LLC) and connected to the chatbot via the Messenger app. The chatbot provided daily updates on the physical activity level for self-monitoring sent out daily motivational messages in relation to goal achievement and automatically adjusted the daily goals based on physical activity levels in the last 7 days. When requested by the participants the chatbot also provided sources of information on the benefits of physical activity sent general motivational messages and checked participants' activity history (ie the step counts/min that were achieved on any day). Information about usability and acceptability was self-reported. The main outcomes were daily step counts recorded by the Fitbit and self-reported physical activity. Results: Among 116 participants 95 (81.9%) were female 85 (73.3%) were in a relationship 101 (87.1%) were White and 82 (70.7%) were full-time workers. Their average age was 49.1 (SD 9.3) years with an average BMI of 32.5 (SD 8.0) kg/m2. Most experienced technical issues were due to an unexpected change in Facebook policy (93/113 82.3%). Most of the participants scored the usability of the chatbot (101/113 89.4%) and the Fitbit (99/113 87.6%) as at least OK. About one-third (40/113 35.4%) would continue to use the chatbot in the future and 53.1% (60/113) agreed that the chatbot helped them become more active. On average 6.7 (SD 7.0) messages/week were sent to the chatbot and 5.1 (SD 7.4) min/day were spent using the chatbot. At follow-up participants recorded more steps (increase of 627 95% CI 219-1035 steps/day) and total physical activity (increase of 154.2 min/week 3.58 times higher at follow-up 95% CI 2.28-5.63). Participants were also more likely to meet the physical activity guidelines (odds ratio 6.37 95% CI 3.31-12.27) at follow-up. Conclusions: The machine learning-based physical activity chatbot was able to significantly increase participants' physical activity and was moderately accepted by the participants. However the Facebook policy change undermined the chatbot functionality and indicated the need to use independent platforms for chatbot deployment to ensure successful delivery of this type of intervention.;2021
Background: Body image and eating disorders represent a significant public health concern however many affected individuals never access appropriate treatment. Conversational agents or chatbots reflect a unique opportunity to target those affected online by providing psychoeducation and coping skills thus filling the gap in service provision. Objective: A world-first body image chatbot called KIT was designed. The aim of this study was to assess preliminary acceptability and feasibility via the collection of qualitative feedback from young people and parents/carers regarding the content structure and design of the chatbot in accordance with an agile methodology strategy. The chatbot was developed in collaboration with Australia's national eating disorder support organization the Butterfly Foundation. Methods: A conversation decision tree was designed that offered psychoeducational information on body image and eating disorders as well as evidence-based coping strategies. A version of KIT was built as a research prototype to deliver these conversations. Six focus groups were conducted using online semistructured interviews to seek feedback on the KIT prototype. This included four groups of people seeking help for themselves (n=17 age 13-18 years) and two groups of parents/carers (n=8 age 46-57 years). Participants provided feedback on the cartoon chatbot character design as well as the content structure and design of the chatbot webchat. Results: Thematic analyses identified the following three main themes from the six focus groups: (1) chatbot character and design (2) content presentation and (3) flow. Overall the participants provided positive feedback regarding KIT with both young people and parents/carers generally providing similar reflections. The participants approved of KIT's character and engagement. Specific suggestions were made regarding the brevity and tone to increase KIT's interactivity. Conclusions: Focus groups provided overall positive qualitative feedback regarding the content structure and design of the body image chatbot. Incorporating the feedback of lived experience from both individuals and parents/carers allowed the refinement of KIT in the development phase as per an iterative agile methodology. Further research is required to evaluate KIT's efficacy.;2021
Background: Body image concerns are prevalent among Brazilian adolescents and can lead to poor psychological and physical health. Yet there is a scarcity of culturally-appropriate evidence-based interventions that have been evaluated and made widely available. Chatbot technology (i.e. software that mimics written or spoken human speech) offers an innovative method to increase the scalability of mental health interventions for adolescents. The present protocol outlines the co-creation and evaluation of a body image chatbot for Brazilian adolescents via a partnership between academics industry organisations and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Methods: A two-armed fully remote randomised controlled trial will evaluate the chatbot's effectiveness at improving body image and well-being. Adolescent girls and boys (N = 2800) aged 13-18 years recruited online will be randomly allocated (1:1) into either: 1) a body image chatbot or 2) an assessment-only control condition. Adolescents will engage with the chatbot over a 72-hour period on Facebook Messenger. Primary outcomes will assess the immediate and shortterm impact of the chatbot on state- and trait-based body image respectively. Secondary outcomes will include stateand trait-based affect trait self-efficacy and treatment adherence. Discussion: This research is the first to develop an evidence-informed body image chatbot for Brazilian adolescents with the proposed efficacy trial aiming to provide support for accessible scalable and cost-effective interventions that address disparities in body image prevalence and readily available resources.;2021
Background: Cancer genetic testing to assess an individual's cancer risk and to enable genomics-informed cancer treatment has grown exponentially in the past decade. Because of this continued growth and a shortage of health care workers there is a need for automated strategies that provide high-quality genetics services to patients to reduce the clinical demand for genetics providers. Conversational agents have shown promise in managing mental health pain and other chronic conditions and are increasingly being used in cancer genetic services. However research on how patients interact with these agents to satisfy their information needs is limited. Objective: Our primary aim is to assess user interactions with a conversational agent for pretest genetics education. Methods: We conducted a feasibility study of user interactions with a conversational agent who delivers pretest genetics education to primary care patients without cancer who are eligible for cancer genetic evaluation. The conversational agent provided scripted content similar to that delivered in a pretest genetic counseling visit for cancer genetic testing. Outside of a core set of information delivered to all patients users were able to navigate within the chat to request additional content in their areas of interest. An artificial intelligence-based preprogrammed library was also established to allow users to ask open-ended questions to the conversational agent. Transcripts of the interactions were recorded. Here we describe the information selected time spent to complete the chat and use of the open-ended question feature. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative measures and thematic analyses were used for qualitative responses. Results: We invited 103 patients to participate of which 88.3% (91/103) were offered access to the conversational agent 39% (36/91) started the chat and 32% (30/91) completed the chat. Most users who completed the chat indicated that they wanted to continue with genetic testing (21/30 70%) few were unsure (9/30 30%) and no patient declined to move forward with testing. Those who decided to test spent an average of 10 (SD 2.57) minutes on the chat selected an average of 1.87 (SD 1.2) additional pieces of information and generally did not ask open-ended questions. Those who were unsure spent 4 more minutes on average (mean 14.1 SD 7.41 P=.03) on the chat selected an average of 3.67 (SD 2.9) additional pieces of information and asked at least one open-ended question. Conclusions: The pretest chat provided enough information for most patients to decide on cancer genetic testing as indicated by the small number of open-ended questions. A subset of participants were still unsure about receiving genetic testing and may require additional education or interpersonal support before making a testing decision. Conversational agents have the potential to become a scalable alternative for pretest genetics education reducing the clinical demand on genetics providers.;2021
Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite evidence there is a high proportion of underdiagnosis. Online screening assessments are low-cost solutions to identify high-risk adults who may benefit from confirmatory screening (ie spirometry test). Little evidence exists to support whether high-risk adults seek advice after completing COPD screening assessments and from whom. The purpose of this study is to examine how the perceived quality of an online screening assessment influences high-risk adults to seek advice from a healthcare provider or other online resources. Methods: Adults without a prior COPD diagnosis (N = 199) completed an online survey that included a computer-tailored assessment programmed with the clinically validated COPD Population Screener (COPD-PS). Results: An elevated COPD risk score was associated with expectations to talk with a healthcare provider (P < 0.05) or go on the Internet (P < 0.05) to get advice controlling for statistically significant covariates. Positive perceptions about the quality of the risk score was associated with strengthened expectations to speak with a healthcare provider but only among high-risk adults (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Results of this study support the use of computer-tailored screening assessments as a scalable solution to encourage high-risk adults to learn more about COPD. Strengthened perceptions about the quality of an online COPD screening assessment increased the likelihood that high-risk adults will speak with their healthcare provider about the condition. Implications are discussed for leveraging telehealth solutions such as conversational agents (ie chatbots) to disseminate COPD screening assessments and alleviate its underdiagnosis.;2021
Background: Conversational agents (CAs) for chronic disease management are receiving increasing attention in academia and the industry. However long-term adherence to CAs is still a challenge and needs to be explored. Personalization of CAs has the potential to improve long-term adherence and with it user satisfaction task efficiency perceived benefits and intended behavior change. Research on personalized CAs has already addressed different aspects such as personalized recommendations and anthropomorphic cues. However detailed information on interaction styles between patients and CAs in the role of medical health care professionals is scant. Such interaction styles play essential roles for patient satisfaction treatment adherence and outcome as has been shown for physician-patient interactions. Currently it is not clear (1) whether chronically ill patients prefer a CA with a paternalistic informative interpretive or deliberative interaction style and (2) which factors influence these preferences. Objective: We aimed to investigate the preferences of chronically ill patients for CA-delivered interaction styles. Methods: We conducted two studies. The first study included a paper-based approach and explored the preferences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients for paternalistic informative interpretive and deliberative CA-delivered interaction styles. Based on these results a second study assessed the effects of the paternalistic and deliberative interaction styles on the relationship quality between the CA and patients via hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses in an online experiment with COPD patients. Patients' sociodemographic and disease-specific characteristics served as moderator variables. Results: Study 1 with 117 COPD patients revealed a preference for the deliberative (50/117) and informative (34/117) interaction styles across demographic characteristics. All patients who preferred the paternalistic style over the other interaction styles had more severe COPD (three patients Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease class 3 or 4). In Study 2 with 123 newly recruited COPD patients younger participants and participants with a less recent COPD diagnosis scored higher on interaction-related outcomes when interacting with a CA that delivered the deliberative interaction style (interaction between age and CA type: relationship quality: b=-0.77 95% CI -1.37 to -0.18 intention to continue interaction: b=-0.49 95% CI -0.97 to -0.01 working alliance attachment bond: b=-0.65 95% CI -1.26 to -0.04 working alliance goal agreement: b=-0.59 95% CI -1.18 to -0.01 interaction between recency of COPD diagnosis and CA type: working alliance goal agreement: b=0.57 95% CI 0.01 to 1.13). Conclusions: Our results indicate that age and a patient's personal disease experience inform which CA interaction style the patient should be paired with to achieve increased interaction-related outcomes with the CA. These results allow the design of personalized health care CAs with the goal to increase long-term adherence to health-promoting behavior.;2021
Background: Digital health agents - embodied conversational agents designed specifically for health interventions - provide a promising alternative or supplement to behavioral health services by reducing barriers to access to care. Objective: Our goals were to (1) develop an expressive speech-enabled digital health agent operating in a 3-dimensional virtual environment to deliver a brief behavioral health intervention over the internet to reduce alcohol use and to (2) understand its acceptability feasibility and utility with its end users. Methods: We developed an expressive speech-enabled digital health agent with facial expressions and body gestures operating in a 3-dimensional virtual office and able to deliver a brief behavioral health intervention over the internet to reduce alcohol use. We then asked 51 alcohol users to report on the digital health agent acceptability feasibility and utility. Results: The developed digital health agent uses speech recognition and a model of empathetic verbal and nonverbal behaviors to engage the user and its performance enabled it to successfully deliver a brief behavioral health intervention over the internet to reduce alcohol use. Descriptive statistics indicated that participants had overwhelmingly positive experiences with the digital health agent including engagement with the technology acceptance perceived utility and intent to use the technology. Illustrative qualitative quotes provided further insight about the potential reach and impact of digital health agents in behavioral health care. Conclusions: Web-delivered interventions delivered by expressive speech-enabled digital health agents may provide an exciting complement or alternative to traditional one-on-one treatment. They may be especially helpful for hard-to-reach communities with behavioral workforce shortages.;2021
Background: Digital therapeutics are evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by high-quality software programs for the treatment prevention or management of a medical disorder or disease. Many studies in the western population have shown the effectiveness of mobile app-based digital therapeutics for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However few studies have assessed similar outcomes in the South Asian population. Objective: This study aims to investigate the real-world effectiveness of the Wellthy CARE digital therapeutic for improving glycemic control among the South Asian population of Indian origin. Methods: We analyzed deidentified data from 102 patients with T2D from India enrolled in a 16-week structured self-management program delivered using the Wellthy CARE mobile app. Patients recorded their meals weight physical activity and blood sugar in the app and they received lessons on self-care behaviors (healthy eating being active monitoring medication adherence problem solving healthy coping and reducing risks) feedback provided by an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot and periodic interactions with certified diabetes educators via voice calls and chats. The primary outcome of the program was a change in glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)). Secondary outcomes included the difference between preintervention and postintervention fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels changes in BMI and weight at the completion of 16 weeks and the association between program engagement and the changes in HbA(1c) FBG and PPBG levels. Results: At the end of 16 weeks the average change in HbA(1c) was -0.49% (n=102 95% CI -0.73 to 0.25 P<.001). Of all the patients 63.7% (65/102) had improved HbA(1c) levels with a mean change of -1.16% (n=65 95% CI -1.40 to -0.92 P<.001). The mean preintervention and postintervention FBG levels were 145 mg/dL (n=51 95% CI 135-155) and 134 mg/dL (n=51 95% CI 122-146 P=.02) and PPBG levels were 188 mg/dL (n=51 95% CI 172-203) and 166 mg/dL (n=51 95% CI 153-180 P=.03) respectively. The mean changes in BMI and weight were -0.47 kg/m(2) (n=59 95% CI -0.22 to -0.71 P<.001) and -1.32 kg (n=59 95% CI -0.63 to -2.01 P<.001) respectively. There was a stepwise decrease in HbA(1c) FBG and PPBG levels as the program engagement increased. Patients in the highest tertile of program engagement had a significantly higher reduction in HbA(1c) (-0.84% vs -0.06% P=.02) FBG (-21.4 mg/dL vs -0.18 mg/dL P=.02) and PPBG levels (-22.03 mg/dL vs 2.35 mg/dL P=.002) than those in the lowest tertile. Conclusions: The use of the Wellthy CARE digital therapeutic for patients with T2D showed a significant reduction in the levels of HbA(1c) FBG and PPBG after 16 weeks. A higher level of participation showed improved glycemic control suggesting the potential of the Wellthy CARE platform for better management of the disease.;2021
Background: During the current COVID-19 pandemic alcohol and tobacco are the most available substances for managing stress and can induce a risk of addiction. KANOPEE is a smartphone application available to the general population using an embodied conversational agent (ECA) to screen for experiences of problems with alcohol/tobacco use and to provide follow-up tools for brief intervention. Objectives: This study aimed to determine if the smartphone KANOPEE application could identify people at risk for alcohol and/or tobacco use disorders in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic to assess adherence to a 7-day follow-up use diary and to evaluate trust and acceptance of the application. Methods: The conversational agent named Jeanne interviewed participants about perceived problems with the use of alcohol and tobacco since the pandemic and explored risk for tobacco and alcohol use disorder with the five-item Cigarette Dependence Scale (CDS-5) and Cut Down Annoyed Guilty Eye-opener  (CAGE) questionnaire and experience of craving for each substance. Descriptive univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to specify personalized associations with reporting a problem with alcohol/tobacco use descriptive analysis reported the experience with the intervention and acceptance and trust in the application. Results: From April 22 to October 26 2020 1588 French participants completed the KANOPEE interview and 318 answered the acceptance and trust scales. Forty-two percent of tobacco users and 27% of alcohol users reported problem use since the pandemic. Positive screening with CDS-5 and CAGE and craving were associated with reported problem use (p < 0.0001). Lockdown period influenced alcohol (p < 0.0005) but not tobacco use (p > 0.05). Eighty-eight percent of users reported that KANOPEE was easy to use and 82% found Jeanne to be trustworthy and credible. Conclusion: KANOPEE was able to screen for risk factors for substance use disorder (SUD) and was acceptable to users. Reporting craving and being at risk for SUD seem to be early markers to be identified. Alcohol problem use seems to be more reliant on contextual conditions such as confinement. This method is able to offer acceptable brief and early intervention with minimal delay for vulnerable people.;2021
Background: Effective treatments for various conditions such as obesity cardiac heart diseases or low back pain require not only personal on-site coaching sessions by health care experts but also a significant amount of home exercises. However nonadherence to home exercises is still a serious problem as it leads to increased costs due to prolonged treatments. Objective: To improve adherence to home exercises we propose implement and assess the novel coaching concept of hybrid ubiquitous coaching (HUC). In HUC health care experts are complemented by a conversational agent (CA) that delivers psychoeducation and personalized motivational messages via a smartphone as well as real-time exercise support monitoring and feedback in a hands-free augmented reality environment. Methods: We applied HUC to the field of physiotherapy and conducted 4 design-and-evaluate loops with an interdisciplinary team to assess how HUC is perceived by patients and physiotherapists and whether HUC leads to treatment adherence. A first version of HUC was evaluated by 35 physiotherapy patients in a lab setting to identify patients' perceptions of HUC. In addition 11 physiotherapists were interviewed about HUC and assessed whether the CA could help them build up a working alliance with their patients. A second version was then tested by 15 patients in a within-subject experiment to identify the ability of HUC to address adherence and to build a working alliance between the patient and the CA. Finally a 4-week n-of-1 trial was conducted with 1 patient to show one experience with HUC in depth and thereby potentially reveal real-world benefits and challenges. Results: Patients perceived HUC to be useful easy to use and enjoyable preferred it to state-of-the-art approaches and expressed their intentions to use it. Moreover patients built a working alliance with the CA. Physiotherapists saw a relative advantage of HUC compared to current approaches but initially did not see the potential in terms of a working alliance which changed after seeing the results of HUC in the field. Qualitative feedback from patients indicated that they enjoyed doing the exercise with an augmented reality based CA and understood better how to do the exercise correctly with HUC. Moreover physiotherapists highlighted that HUC would be helpful to use in the therapy process. The longitudinal field study resulted in an adherence rate of 92% (11/12 sessions 330/360 repetitions 33/36 sets) and a substantial increase in exercise accuracy during the 4 weeks. Conclusions: The overall positive assessments from both patients and health care experts suggest that HUC is a promising tool to be applied in various disorders with a relevant set of home exercises. Future research however must implement a variety of exercises and test HUC with patients suffering from different disorders.;2021
Background: Heart failure (HF) is associated with high mortality rates and high costs and self-care is crucial in the management of the condition. Telehealth can promote patients' self-care while providing frequent feedback to their health care providers about the patient's compliance and symptoms. A number of technologies have been considered in the literature to facilitate telehealth in patients with HF. An important factor in the adoption of these technologies is their ease of use. Conversational agent technologies using a voice interface can be a good option because they use speech recognition to communicate with patients. Objective: The aim of this paper is to study the engagement of patients with HF with voice interface technology. In particular we investigate which patient characteristics are linked to increased technology use. Methods: We used data from two separate HF patient groups that used different telehealth technologies over a 90-day period. Each group used a different type of voice interface however the scripts followed by the two technologies were identical. One technology was based on Amazon's Alexa (Alexa+) and in the other technology patients used a tablet to interact with a visually animated and voice-enabled avatar (Avatar). Patient engagement was measured as the number of days on which the patients used the technology during the study period. We used multiple linear regression to model engagement with the technology based on patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and past technology use. Results: In both populations the patients were predominantly male and Black had an average age of 55 years and had HF for an average of 7 years. The only patient characteristic that was statistically different (P=.008) between the two populations was the number of medications they took to manage HF with a mean of 8.7 (SD 4.0) for Alexa+ and 5.8 (SD 3.4) for Avatar patients. The regression model on the combined population shows that older patients used the technology more frequently (an additional 1.19 days of use for each additional year of age P=.004). The number of medications to manage HF was negatively associated with use (-5.49 P=.005) and Black patients used the technology less frequently than other patients with similar characteristics (-15.96 P=.08). Conclusions: Older patients' higher engagement with telehealth is consistent with findings from previous studies confirming the acceptability of technology in this subset of patients with HF. However we also found that a higher number of HF medications which may be correlated with a higher disease burden is negatively associated with telehealth use. Finally the lower engagement of Black patients highlights the need for further study to identify the reasons behind this lower engagement including the possible role of social determinants of health and potentially create technologies that are better tailored for this population.;2021
Background: In recent years digital tools have become a viable means for patients to address their health and information needs. Governments and health care organizations are offering digital tools such as self-assessment tools symptom tracking tools or chatbots. Other sources of digital tools such as those offered through patient platforms are available on the internet free of charge. We define patient platforms as health-specific websites that offer tools to anyone with internet access to engage them in their health care process with peer networks to support their learning. Although numerous social media platforms engage users without up-front charges patient platforms are specific to health. As little is known about their business model there is a need to understand what else these platforms are trying to achieve beyond supporting patients so that patients can make informed decisions about the benefits and risks of using the digital tools they offer. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore what patient platforms are trying to achieve beyond supporting patients and how their digital tools can be used to generate income. Methods: Textual and visual data collected from a purposeful selection of 11 patient platforms from September 2013 to August 2014 were analyzed using framework analysis. Data were systematically and rigorously coded and categorized according to key issues and themes by following 5 steps . familiarizing identifying a thematic framework indexing charting and mapping and interpretation. We used open coding to identify additional concepts not captured in the initial thematic framework. This paper reports on emergent findings on the business models of the platforms and their income-generating processes. Results: Our analysis revealed that in addition to patients the platforms support other parties with interests in health and information exchanges. Patient platforms did not charge up-front fees but generated income from other sources such as advertising sponsorship marketing (eg sending information to users on behalf of sponsors or providing means for sponsors to reach patients directly) supporting other portals and providing research services. Conclusions: This study reports on the mechanisms by which some patient platforms generate income to support their operations gain profit or both. Although income-generating processes exist elsewhere on social media platforms in general they pose unique challenges in the health context because digital tools engage patients in health and information exchanges. This study highlights the need to minimize the potential for unintended consequences that can pose health risks to patients or can lead to increased health expenses. By understanding other interests that patient platforms support our findings point to important policy implications such as whether (and how) authorities might protect users from processes that may not always be in their best interests and can potentially incur costs to the health system.;2021
Background: Information and communication technologies are tools that are able to support cognitive functions monitor health and movements provide reminders to maintain residual memory abilities and promote social support especially among patients with dementia. Among these technologies embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are seen as screen-based entities designed to stimulate human face-to-face conversation skills allowing for natural human-machine interaction. Unfortunately the evidence that such agents deliver care benefits in supporting people affected by dementia and their caregivers has not yet been well studied. Therefore research in this area is essential for the entire scientific community. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the usability and acceptability of the virtual agent Anne by people living with dementia. The study is also designed to assess the ability of target users to use the system independently and receive valuable information from it. Methods: We conducted a 4-week trial that involved 20 older adults living with dementia and 14 family caregivers in home environment settings in Italy. This study used a mixed methods approach balancing quantitative and qualitative instruments to gather data from users. Telemetry data were also collected. Results: Older users were particularly engaged in providing significant responses and participating in system improvements. Some of them clearly discussed how technical problems related to speech recognition had a negative impact on the intention to use adaptiveness usefulness and trust. Moreover the usability of the system achieved an encouraging score and half of the sample recognized a role of the agent Anne. This study confirms that the quality of automatic speech recognition and synthesis is still a technical issue and has room for improvement whereas the touch screen modality is almost stable and positively used by patients with dementia. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the ability of target users to use the system independently in their home environment overall the involved participants shared good engagement with the system approaching the virtual agents as a companion able to support memory and enjoyment needs. Therefore this research provides data that sustain the use of ECAs as future eHealth systems that are able to address the basic and higher-level needs of people living with dementia. This specific field of research is novel and poorly discussed in the scientific community. This could be because of its novelty yet there is an urgent need to strengthen data research and innovation to accelerate the implementation of ECAs as a future method to offer nonpharmacological support to community-dwelling people with dementia.;2021
Background: It is encouraging to see a substantial increase in individuals surviving cancer. Even more so since most of them will have a positive effect on society by returning to work. However many cancer survivors have unmet needs especially when it comes to improving their quality of life (QoL). Only few survivors are able to meet all of the recommendations regarding well-being and there is a body of evidence that cancer survivors' needs often remain neglected from health policy and national cancer control plans. This increases the impact of inequalities in cancer care and adds a dangerous component to it. The inequalities affect the individual survivor their career along with their relatives and society as a whole. The current study will evaluate the impact of the use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence on the self-efficacy of participants following intervention supported by digital tools. The secondary endpoints include evaluation of the impact of patient trajectories (from retrospective data) and patient gathered health data on prediction and improved intervention against possible secondary disease or negative outcomes (e.g. late toxicities fatal events). Methods/design: The study is designed as a single-case experimental prospective study where each individual serves as its own control group with basal measurements obtained at the recruitment and subsequent measurements performed every 6 months during follow ups. The measurement will involve CASE-cancer Patient Activation Measure and System Usability Scale. The study will involve 160 survivors (80 survivors of Breast Cancer and 80 survivors of Colorectal Cancer) from four countries Belgium Latvia Slovenia and Spain. The intervention will be implemented via a digital tool (mHealthApplication) collecting objective biomarkers (vital signs) and subjective biomarkers (PROs) with the support of a (embodied) conversational agent. Additionally the Clinical Decision Support system (CDSS) including visualization of cohorts and trajectories will enable oncologists to personalize treatment for an efficient care plan and follow-up management. Discussion: We expect that cancer survivors will significantly increase their self-efficacy following the personalized intervention supported by the m-HealthApplication compared to control measurements at recruitment. We expect to observe improvement in healthy habits disease self-management and self-perceived QoL.;2021
Background: Loneliness is a growing public health issue that has been exacerbated in vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer agents are capable of delivering psychological therapies through the internet however there is limited research on their acceptability to date. Objective: The objectives of this study were to evaluate (1) the feasibility and acceptability of a remote loneliness and stress intervention with digital human delivery to at-risk adults and (2) the feasibility of the study methods in preparation for a randomized controlled trial. Methods: A parallel randomized pilot trial with a mixed design was conducted. Participants were adults aged 18 to 69 years with an underlying medical condition or aged 70 years or older with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of >24 (ie at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19). Participants took part from their place of residence (independent living retirement village 20 community dwelling 7 nursing home 3). Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention or waitlist control group that received the intervention 1 week later. The intervention involved completing cognitive behavioral and positive psychology exercises with a digital human facilitator on a website for at least 15 minutes per day over 1 week. The exercises targeted loneliness stress and psychological well-being. Feasibility was evaluated using dropout rates and behavioral observation data. Acceptability was evaluated from behavioral engagement data the Friendship Questionnaire (adapted) self-report items and qualitative questions. Psychological measures were administered to evaluate the feasibility of the trial methods and included the UCLA Loneliness Scale the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale a 1-item COVID-19 distress measure the Flourishing Scale and the Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences. Results: The study recruited 30 participants (15 per group). Participants were 22 older adults and 8 younger adults with a health condition. Six participants dropped out of the study. Thus the data of 24 participants were analyzed (intervention group 12 waitlist group 12). The digital human intervention and trial methods were generally found to be feasible and acceptable in younger and older adults living independently based on intervention completion and behavioral qualitative and some self-report data. The intervention and trial methods were less feasible to nursing home residents who required caregiver assistance. Acceptability could be improved with additional content tailoring to the population and changes to the digital human's design. Conclusions: Digital humans are a promising and novel technological solution for providing at-risk adults with access to remote psychological support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research should further examine design techniques to improve their acceptability in this application and investigate intervention effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial.;2021
Background: Misuse of substances is common can be serious and costly to society and often goes untreated due to barriers to accessing care. Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial intelligence-driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial Woebot alleviated depressive symptoms. Objective: This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility acceptability and preliminary efficacy. Methods: American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood craving and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures of substance use confidence cravings mood and pain. Results: The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0) and 75.2% (76/101) of the participants were female 78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants' W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 14.2) days 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101 86.1% reporting cravings in the app odds ratio 0.48 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101) with better retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment confidence to resist urges to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9 SD 21.4 P<.001) whereas past month substance use occasions (mean change -9.3 SD 14.1 P<.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change -1.3 SD 2.6 P<.001) 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change -1.2 SD 2.0 P<.001) Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1 SD 5.2 P=.005) Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change -2.3 SD 4.7 P=.001) and cravings scale (68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51 76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51 43%). Conclusions: W-SUDs was feasible to deliver engaging and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in substance use confidence cravings depression and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.;2021
Background: Musculoskeletal symptoms such as neck and shoulder pain/stiffness and low back pain are common health problems in the working population. They are the leading causes of presenteeism (employees being physically present at work but unable to be fully engaged). Recently digital interventions have begun to be used to manage health but their effectiveness has not yet been fully verified and adherence to such programs is always a problem. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the improvements in musculoskeletal symptoms in workers with neck/shoulder stiffness/pain and low back pain after the use of an exercise-based artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted interactive health promotion system that operates through a mobile messaging app (the AI-assisted health program). We expected that this program would support participants' adherence to exercises. Methods: We conducted a two-armed randomized controlled and unblinded trial in workers with either neck/shoulder stiffness/pain or low back pain or both. We recruited participants with these symptoms through email notifications. The intervention group received the AI-assisted health program in which the chatbot sent messages to users with the exercise instructions at a fixed time every day through the smartphone's chatting app (LINE) for 12 weeks. The program was fully automated. The control group continued with their usual care routines. We assessed the subjective severity of the neck and shoulder pain/stiffness and low back pain of the participants by using a scoring scale of 1 to 5 for both the intervention group and the control group at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention by using a web-based form. We used a logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) of the intervention group to achieve to reduce pain scores with those of the control group and the ORs of the subjective assessment of the improvement of the symptoms compared to the intervention and control groups which were performed using Stata software (version 16 StataCorp LLC). Results: We analyzed 48 participants in the intervention group and 46 participants in the control group. The adherence rate was 92% (44/48) during the intervention. The participants in the intervention group showed significant improvements in the severity of the neck/shoulder pain/stiffness and low back pain compared to those in the control group (OR 6.36 95% CI 2.57-15.73 P<.001). Based on the subjective assessment of the improvement of the pain/stiffness at 12 weeks 36 (75%) out of 48 participants in the intervention group and 3 (7%) out of 46 participants in the control group showed improvements (improved slightly improved) (OR 43.00 95% CI 11.25-164.28 P<.001). Conclusions: This study shows that the short exercises provided by the AI-assisted health program improved both neck/shoulder pain/stiffness and low back pain in 12 weeks. Further studies are needed to identify the elements contributing to the successful outcome of the AI-assisted health program.;2021
Background: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) constitute a burden on public health. These are best controlled through self-management practices such as self-information. Fostering patients' access to health-related information through efficient and accessible channels such as commercial voice assistants (VAs) may support the patients' ability to make health-related decisions and manage their chronic conditions. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the reliability of the most common VAs (ie Amazon Alexa Apple Siri and Google Assistant) in responding to questions about management of the main NCD. Methods: We generated health-related questions based on frequently asked questions from health organization government medical nonprofit and other recognized health-related websites about conditions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) lung cancer (LCA) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diabetes mellitus (DM) cardiovascular disease chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). We then validated them with practicing medical specialists selecting the 10 most frequent ones. Given the low average frequency of the AD-related questions we excluded such questions. This resulted in a pool of 60 questions. We submitted the selected questions to VAs in a 3x3x6 fractional factorial design experiment with 3 developers (ie Amazon Apple and Google) 3 modalities (ie voice only voice and display display only) and 6 diseases. We assessed the rate of error-free voice responses and classified the web sources based on previous research (ie expert commercial crowdsourced or not stated). Results: Google showed the highest total response rate followed by Amazon and Apple. Moreover although Amazon and Apple showed a comparable response rate in both voice-and-display and voice-only modalities Google showed a slightly higher response rate in voice only. The same pattern was observed for the rate of expert sources. When considering the response and expert source rate across diseases we observed that although Google remained comparable with a slight advantage for LCA and CKD both Amazon and Apple showed the highest response rate for LCA. However both Google and Apple showed most often expert sources for CVA while Amazon did so for DM. Conclusions: Google showed the highest response rate and the highest rate of expert sources leading to the conclusion that Google Assistant would be the most reliable tool in responding to questions about NCD management. However the rate of expert sources differed across diseases. We urge health organizations to collaborate with Google Amazon and Apple to allow their VAs to consistently provide reliable answers to health-related questions on NCD management across the different diseases.;2021
Background: Obesity and overweight are a serious health problem worldwide with multiple and connected causes. Simultaneously chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as a way to interact with users in mobile health apps. Objective: This study reports the user-centered design and feasibility study of a chatbot to collect linked data to support the study of individual and social overweight and obesity causes in populations. Methods: We first studied the users' needs and gathered users' graphical preferences through an open survey on 52 wireframes designed by 150 design students it also included questions about sociodemographics diet and activity habits the need for overweight and obesity apps and desired functionality. We also interviewed an expert panel. We then designed and developed a chatbot. Finally we conducted a pilot study to test feasibility. Results: We collected 452 answers to the survey and interviewed 4 specialists. Based on this research we developed a Telegram chatbot named Wakamola structured in six sections: personal diet physical activity social network user's status score and project information. We defined a user's status score as a normalized sum (0-100) of scores about diet (frequency of eating 50 foods) physical activity BMI and social network. We performed a pilot to evaluate the chatbot implementation among 85 healthy volunteers. Of 74 participants who completed all sections we found 8 underweight people (11%) 5 overweight people (7%) and no obesity cases. The mean BMI was 21.4 kg/m(2) (normal weight). The most consumed foods were olive oil milk and derivatives cereals vegetables and fruits. People walked 10 minutes on 5.8 days per week slept 7.02 hours per day and were sitting 30.57 hours per week. Moreover we were able to create a social network with 74 users 178 relations and 12 communities. Conclusions: The Telegram chatbot Wakamola is a feasible tool to collect data from a population about sociodemographics diet patterns physical activity BMI and specific diseases. Besides the chatbot allows the connection of users in a social network to study overweight and obesity causes from both individual and social perspectives.;2021
Background: Optional features of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems empower patients and caregivers to understand and manage diabetes in new ways. We examined associations between use of optional features demographics and glycemic outcomes. Methods: Retrospective cohort studies were performed with data from US-based users of the G6 CGM System (Dexcom Inc.). For all cohorts data included sensor glucose values (SGVs). In separate cohorts use of alert features (for hyperglycemia existing hypoglycemia and impending hypoglycemia) remote data sharing feature (Share) software for retrospective pattern analysis (CLARITY) virtual assistant feature that announces the current SGV and trend in response to a spoken request were assessed. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize feature set utilization patterns and relate them to glycemic outcomes. Results: Most individual features were consistently adopted by high proportions of G6 users. Threshold SGVs chosen for activating hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia alerts varied with age and were higher among the youngest and oldest patients. Use of the Share feature was more common among young patients and those with type 1 diabetes. Individuals who used more of the alert and notification features had more favorable glycemic outcomes including time in range (TIR) than those who used fewer. More extensive engagement with CLARITY notifications was associated with higher TIR. Frequent use of the virtual assistant feature was associated with higher TIR and lower mean SGV. Conclusions: Optional features of the G6 CGM system are acceptable to and appear to benefit patients who use them. Different levels of engagement suggest that demographics and personal circumstances play a role in how patients and caregivers use CGM features to help manage diabetes.;2021
Background: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience abdominal pain altered bowel habits and defecation-related anxiety which can result in reduced productivity and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms of IBS and to improve HRQL but access to qualified therapists is limited. Smartphone-based digital therapeutic interventions have potential to increase access to guided CBT at scale but require careful study to assess their benefits and risks. Objective: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel app Zemedy as a mobile digital therapeutic that delivers a comprehensive CBT program to individuals with IBS. Methods: This was a crossover randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited online and randomly allocated to either immediate treatment (n=62) or waitlist control (n=59) groups. The Zemedy app consists of 8 modules focusing on psychoeducation relaxation training exercise the cognitive model of stress management applying CBT to IBS symptoms reducing avoidance through exposure therapy behavioral experiments and information about diet. Users interact with a chatbot that presents the information and encourages specific plans homework and exercises. The treatment was fully automated with no therapist involvement or communication. At baseline and after 8 weeks participants were asked to complete the battery of primary (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life [IBS-QOL] Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale [GSRS]) and secondary (Fear of Food Questionnaire [FFQ] Visceral Sensitivity Index [VSI] Gastrointestinal Cognition Questionnaire [GI-COG] Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS] and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) outcome measures. Waitlist controls were then offered the opportunity to crossover to treatment. All participants were assessed once more at 3 months posttreatment. Results: Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses at posttreatment revealed significant improvement for the immediate treatment group compared to the waitlist control group on both primary and secondary outcome measures. Gains were generally maintained at 3 months posttreatment. Scores on the GSRS IBS-QoL GI-COG VSI and FFQ all improved significantly more in the treatment group (F-1F-79=20.49 P<.001 Cohen d=1.01 F-1F-79=20.12 P<.001 d=1.25 F-1F-79=34.71 P<.001 d=1.47 F-1F-79=18.7 P<.001 d=1.07 and F-1F-79=12.13 P=.001 d=0.62 respectively). Depression improved significantly as measured by the PHQ-9 (F-1F-79=10.5 P=.002 d=1.07) and the DASS Depression (F-1F-79=6.03 P=.02 d=.83) and Stress (F-1F-79=4.47 P=.04 d=0.65) subscales in the completer analysis but not in the intention-to-treat analysis. The impact of treatment on HRQL was mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and visceral sensitivity. Conclusions: Despite its relatively benign physical profile IBS can be an extraordinarily debilitating condition. Zemedy is an effective modality to deliver CBT for individuals with IBS and could increase accessibility of this evidence-based treatment.;2021
Background: Prior studies have demonstrated the safety risks when patients and consumers use conversational assistants such as Apple's Sin and Amazon's Alexa for obtaining medical information. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate two approaches to reducing the likelihood that patients or consumers will act on the potentially harmful medical information they receive from conversational assistants. Methods: Participants were given medical problems to pose to conversational assistants that had been previously demonstrated to result in potentially harmful recommendations. Each conversational assistant's response was randomly varied to include either a correct or incorrect paraphrase of the query or a disclaimer message-or not-telling the participants that they should not act on the advice without first talking to a physician. The participants were then asked what actions they would take based on their interaction along with the likelihood of taking the action. The reported actions were recorded and analyzed and the participants were interviewed at the end of each interaction. Results: A total of 32 participants completed the study each interacting with 4 conversational assistants. The participants were on average aged 42.44 (SD 14.08) years 53% (17/32) were women and 66% (21/32) were college educated. Those participants who heard a correct paraphrase of their query were significantly more likely to state that they would follow the medical advice provided by the conversational assistant (chi(2)(1)=3.1 P=.04). Those participants who heard a disclaimer message were significantly more likely to say that they would contact a physician or health professional before acting on the medical advice received (chi(2)(1)=43.5 P=.001). Conclusions: Designers of conversational systems should consider incorporating both disclaimers and feedback on query understanding in response to user queries for medical advice. Unconstrained natural language input should not be used in systems designed specifically to provide medical advice.;2021
Background: Recent years have witnessed a constant increase in the number of people with chronic conditions requiring ongoing medical support in their everyday lives. However global health systems are not adequately equipped for this extraordinarily time-consuming and cost-intensive development. Here conversational agents (CAs) can offer easily scalable and ubiquitous support. Moreover different aspects of CAs have not yet been sufficiently investigated to fully exploit their potential. One such trait is the interaction style between patients and CAs. In human-to-human settings the interaction style is an imperative part of the interaction between patients and physicians. Patient-physician interaction is recognized as a critical success factor for patient satisfaction treatment adherence and subsequent treatment outcomes. However so far it remains effectively unknown how different interaction styles can be implemented into CA interactions and whether these styles are recognizable by users. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop an approach to reproducibly induce 2 specific interaction styles into CA-patient dialogs and subsequently test and validate them in a chronic health care context. Methods: On the basis of the Roter Interaction Analysis System and iterative evaluations by scientific experts and medical health care professionals we identified 10 communication components that characterize the 2 developed interaction styles: deliberative and paternalistic interaction styles. These communication components were used to develop 2 CA variations each representing one of the 2 interaction styles. We assessed them in a web-based between-subject experiment. The participants were asked to put themselves in the position of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These participants were randomly assigned to interact with one of the 2 CAs and subsequently asked to identify the respective interaction style. Chi-square test was used to assess the correct identification of the CA-patient interaction style. Results: A total of 88 individuals (42/88 48% female mean age 31.5 years SD 10.1 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and participated in the web-based experiment. The participants in both the paternalistic and deliberative conditions correctly identified the underlying interaction styles of the CAs in more than 80% of the assessments (X-1(8)8(2)=38.2 P<.001 phi coefficient r(phi)=0.68). The validation of the procedure was hence successful. Conclusions: We developed an approach that is tailored for a medical context to induce a paternalistic and deliberative interaction style into a written interaction between a patient and a CA. We successfully tested and validated the procedure in a web-based experiment involving 88 participants. Future research should implement and test this approach among actual patients with chronic diseases and compare the results in different medical conditions. This approach can further be used as a starting point to develop dynamic CAs that adapt their interaction styles to their users.;2021
Background: Recently artificial intelligence technologies and machine learning methods have offered attractive prospects to design and manage crisis response processes especially in suicide crisis management. In other domains most algorithms are based on big data to help diagnose and suggest rational treatment options in medicine. But data in psychiatry are related to behavior and clinical evaluation. They are more heterogeneous less objective and incomplete compared to other fields of medicine. Consequently the use of psychiatric clinical data may lead to less accurate and sometimes impossible-to-build algorithms and provide inefficient digital tools. In this case the Bayesian network (BN) might be helpful and accurate when constructed from expert knowledge. Medical Companion is a government-funded smartphone application based on repeated questions posed to the subject and algorithm-matched advice to prevent relapse of suicide attempts within several months. Objective: Our paper aims to present our development of a BN algorithm as a medical device in accordance with the American Psychiatric Association digital healthcare guidelines and to provide results from a preclinical phase. Methods: The experts are psychiatrists working in university hospitals who are experienced and trained in managing suicidal crises. As recommended when building a BN we divided the process into 2 tasks. Task 1 is structure determination representing the qualitative part of the BN. The factors were chosen for their known and demonstrated link with suicidal risk in the literature (clinical behavioral and psychometrics) and therapeutic accuracy (advice). Task 2 is parameter elicitation with the conditional probabilities corresponding to the quantitative part. The 4-step simulation (use case) process allowed us to ensure that the advice was adapted to the clinical states of patients and the context. Results: For task 1 in this formative part we defined clinical questions related to the mental state of the patients and we proposed specific factors related to the questions. Subsequently we suggested specific advice related to the patient's state. We obtained a structure for the BN with a graphical representation of causal relations between variables. For task 2 several runs of simulations confirmed the a priori model of experts regarding mental state refining the precision of our model. Moreover we noticed that the advice had the same distribution as the previous state and was clinically relevant. After 2 rounds of simulation the experts found the exact match. Conclusions: BN is an efficient methodology to build an algorithm for a digital assistant dedicated to suicidal crisis management. Digital psychiatry is an emerging field but it needs validation and testing before being used with patients. Similar to psychotropics any medical device requires a phase II (preclinical) trial. With this method we propose another step to respond to the American Psychiatric Association guidelines.;2021
Background: Retirement is recognized as a factor influencing the ageing process. Today virtual health coaching systems can play a pivotal role in supporting older adults' active and healthy ageing. This study wants to answer two research questions: (1) What are the user requirements of a virtual coach (VC) based on an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) for motivating older adults in transition to retirement to adopt a healthy lifestyle? (2) How could a VC address the active and healthy ageing dimensions even during COVID-19 times? Methods: Two-wave focus-groups with 60 end-users aged 55 and over and 27 follow-up telephone interviews were carried out in Austria Italy and the Netherlands in 2019-2020. Qualitative data were analysed by way of framework analysis. Results: End-users suggest the VC should motivate older workers and retirees to practice physical activity maintain social contacts and emotional well-being. The ECA should be reactive customizable expressive sympathetic not directive nor patronizing with a pleasant and motivating language. The COVID-19 outbreak increased the users' need for functions boosting community relationships and promoting emotional well-being. Conclusions: the VC can address the active and healthy ageing paradigm by increasing the chances of doing low-cost healthy activities at any time and in any place.;2021
Background: Software agents are computer-programs that conduct conversations with a human. The present study evaluates the feasibility of the software agent ?SISU? aiming to uplift psychological wellbeing. Methods: Within a one-group pretest-posttest trial N = 30 German-speaking participants were recruited. Assessments took place before (t1) during (t2) and after (t3) the intervention. The ability of SISU to guide participants through the intervention acceptability and negative effects were investigated. Data analyses are based on intention-to-treat principles. Linear mixed models will be used to investigate short-term changes over time in mood depression anxiety. Intervention: The intervention consists of two sessions. Each session comprises writing tasks on autobiographical negative life events and an Acceptance- and Commitment Therapy-based exercise respectively. Participants interact with the software agent on two consecutive days for about 30 min each. Results: All participants completed all sessions within two days. User experience was positive with all subscales of the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) M > 0.8. Participants experienced their writings as highly selfrelevant and personal. However 57% of the participants reported at least one negative effect attributed to the intervention. Results on linear mixed models indicate an increase in anxiety over time (? = 1.33 p = .001). Qualitative User Feedback revealed that the best thing about SISU was its innovativeness (13%) and anonymity (13%). As worst thing about SISU participants indicated that the conversational style of SISU often felt unnatural (73%). Conclusion: SISU successfully guided participants through the two-day intervention. Moreover SISU has the potential to enter the inner world of participants. However intervention contents have the potential to evoke negative effects in individuals. Expectable short-term symptom deterioration due to writing about negative autobiographical life events could not be prevented by acceptance and commitment therapy-based exercises. Hence results suggest a revision of intervention contents as well as of the conversational style of SISU. The good adherence rate indicates the useful and acceptable format of SISU as a mental health chatbot. Overall little is known about the effectiveness of software agents in the context of psychological wellbeing. Results of the present trial underline that the innovative technology bears the potential of SISU to act as therapeutic agent but should not be used with its current intervention content. Trial-registration: The Trial is registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Studies Register (DRKS): DRKS00014933 (date of registration: 20.06.2018).

Background: Successful management of chronic diseases requires a trustful collaboration between health care professionals patients and family members. Scalable conversational agents designed to assist health care professionals may play a significant role in supporting this collaboration in a scalable way by reaching out to the everyday lives of patients and their family members. However to date it remains unclear whether conversational agents in such a role would be accepted and whether they can support this multistakeholder collaboration. Objective: With asthma in children representing a relevant target of chronic disease management this study had the following objectives: (1) to describe the design of MAX a conversational agent-delivered asthma intervention that supports health care professionals targeting child-parent teams in their everyday lives and (2) to assess the (a) reach of MAX (b) conversational agent-patient working alliance (c) acceptance of MAX (d) intervention completion rate (e) cognitive and behavioral outcomes and (f) human effort and responsiveness of health care professionals in primary and secondary care settings. Methods: MAX was designed to increase cognitive skills (ie knowledge about asthma) and behavioral skills (ie inhalation technique) in 10-15-year-olds with asthma and enables support by a health professional and a family member. To this end three design goals guided the development: (1) to build a conversational agent-patient working alliance (2) to offer hybrid (humanand conversational agent-supported) ubiquitous coaching and (3) to provide an intervention with high experiential value. An interdisciplinary team of computer scientists asthma experts and young patients with their parents developed the intervention collaboratively. The conversational agent communicates with health care professionals via email with patients via a mobile chat app and with a family member via SMS text messaging. A single-arm feasibility study in primary and secondary care settings was performed to assess MAX. Results: Results indicated an overall positive evaluation of MAX with respect to its reach (49.5% 49/99 of recruited and eligible patient-family member teams participated) a strong patient-conversational agent working alliance and high acceptance by all relevant stakeholders. Moreover MAX led to improved cognitive and behavioral skills and an intervention completion rate of 75.5%. Family members supported the patients in 269 out of 275 (97.8%) coaching sessions. Most of the conversational turns (99.5%) were conducted between patients and the conversational agent as opposed to between patients and health care professionals thus indicating the scalability of MAX. In addition it took health care professionals less than 4 minutes to assess the inhalation technique and 3 days to deliver related feedback to the patients. Several suggestions for improvement were made. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that conversational agents designed as mediating social actors involving health care professionals patients and family members are not only accepted in such a team player role but also show potential to improve health-relevant outcomes in chronic disease management.;2021
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted access to treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) while alcohol and cannabis retail sales increased. During the pandemic we tested a tailored digital health solution Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDs) for reducing substance misuse. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial we compared W-SUDs for 8 weeks to a waitlist control. U.S. adults (N = 180) who screened positive for substance misuse (CAGE-AID>1) were enrolled June-August 2020. The pri-mary outcome was the change in past-month substance use occasions from baseline to end-of-treatment (EOT). Study retention was 84%. General linear models tested group differences in baseline-to-EOT change scores adjusting for baseline differences and attrition. Results: At baseline the sample (age M = 40 SD = 12 65% female 68% non-Hispanic white) averaged 30.2 (SD = 18.6) substance occasions in the past month. Most (77%) reported alcohol problems 28% cannabis and 45% multiple substances 46% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Treatment participants averaged 920 in-app text messages (SD = 892 Median = 701) 96% of completed lessons were rated positively and 88% would recommend W-SUDs. Relative to waitlist W-SUDs participants significantly reduced past-month substance use occasions (M = -9.1 SE = 2.0 vs. M = -3.3 SE = 1.8 p = .039). Secondary substance use and mood outcomes did not change significantly by group however reductions in substance use occasions correlated significantly with increased confidence and fewer substance use problems cravings depression and anxiety symptoms and pandemic-related mental health effects (p-value<.05). Conclusions: W-SUDs was associated with significant reductions in substance use occasions. Reduction in substance use occasions was associated with better outcomes including improved mental health. W-SUDs satisfaction was high.;2021
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has limited daily activities and even contact between patients and primary care providers. This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients'symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution. Objective: In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty this study aimed to construct a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone. Methods: We collected 118008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty) conducted data cleansing and finally constructed a pipeline of 51134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision recall F1-score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called Alpha to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection process the data with a deep learning model and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. Results: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance with an AUC of 0.964 and F-1-score of 0.768 followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors with an AUC of 0.965 and F-1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. Conclusions: With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner based on their symptoms thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers.;2021
Background: The current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is an emergency on a global scale with huge swathes of the population required to remain indoors for prolonged periods to tackle the virus. In this new context individuals' health-promoting routines are under greater strain contributing to poorer mental and physical health. Additionally individuals are required to keep up to date with latest health guidelines about the virus which may be confusing in an age of social-media disinformation and shifting guidelines. To tackle these factors we developed Elena+ a smartphone-based and conversational agent (CA) delivered pandemic lifestyle care intervention. Methods: Elena+ utilizes varied intervention components to deliver a psychoeducation-focused coaching program on the topics of: COVID-19 information physical activity mental health (anxiety loneliness mental resources) sleep and diet and nutrition. Over 43 subtopics a CA guides individuals through content and tracks progress over time such as changes in health outcome assessments per topic alongside user-set behavioral intentions and user-reported actual behaviors. Ratings of the usage experience social demographics and the user profile are also captured. Elena+ is available for public download on iOS and Android devices in English European Spanish and Latin American Spanish with future languages and launch countries planned and no limits on planned recruitment. Panel data methods will be used to track user progress over time in subsequent analyses. The Elena+ intervention is open-source under the Apache 2 license (MobileCoach software) and the Creative Commons 4.0 license CC BY-NC-SA (intervention logic and content) allowing future collaborations such as cultural adaptions integration of new sensor-related features or the development of new topics. Discussion: Digital health applications offer a low-cost and scalable route to meet challenges to public health. As Elena+ was developed by an international and interdisciplinary team in a short time frame to meet the COVID-19 pandemic empirical data are required to discern how effective such solutions can be in meeting real world emergent health crises. Additionally clustering Elena+ users based on characteristics and usage behaviors could help public health practitioners understand how population-level digital health interventions can reach at-risk and sub-populations.;2021
Background: The integration of technology-based interventions into health and care provision in our aging society is still a challenge especially in the care pathway for people with dementia. Objective: The study aims to: (1) identify which socio-demographic characteristics are independently associated with the use of the embodied conversational agent among subjects with dementia (2) uncover patient cluster profiles based on these characteristics and (3) discuss technology-based interventions challenges. Methods: A virtual agent was used for four weeks by 55 persons with dementia living in their home environment. Results: Participants evaluated the agent as easy-to-use and quickly learnable. They felt confident while using the system and expressed the willingness to use it frequently. Moreover 21/55 of the patients perceived the virtual agent as a friend and assistant who they could feel close to and who would remind them of important things. Conclusions: Technology-based interventions require a significant effort such as personalized features and patient-centered care pathways to be effective. Therefore this study enriches the open discussion on how such virtual agents must be evidence-based related and designed by multidisciplinary teams following patient-centered care as well as user-centered design approaches.;2021
Background: The use of chatbots may increase engagement with digital behavior change interventions in youth by providing human-like interaction. Following a Person-Based Approach (PBA) integrating user preferences in digital tool development is crucial for engagement whereas information on youth preferences for health chatbots is currently limited.Objective: The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of adolescents' expectations and preferences for health chatbots and describe the systematic development of a health promotion chatbot.Methods: Three studies in three different stages of PBA were conducted: (1) a qualitative focus group study (n = 36) (2) log data analysis during pretesting (n = 6) and (3) a mixed-method pilot testing (n = 73).Results: Confidentiality connection to youth culture and preferences when referring to other sources were important aspects for youth in chatbots. Youth also wanted a chatbot to provide small talk and broader support (e.g. technical support with the tool) rather than specifically in relation to health behaviors. Despite the meticulous approach of PBA user engagement with the developed chatbot was modest.Conclusion: This study highlights that conducting formative research at different stages is an added value and that adolescents have different chatbot preferences than adults. Further improvement to build an engaging chatbot for youth may stem from using living databases.;2021
Background: The use of digital health resources is growing quickly as they are easily accessible and permit self-evaluation. Yet research on consumer health informatics platforms is insufficient. Chatbots interactive conversational platforms based on artificial intelligence can facilitate access to specific information. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is burdensome and has a high threshold for consultation. Objectives: We aimed to identify the most important principles for the assembly of medical chatbots through the analysis of usage data. Methods: The HS Chatbot1 is a question-and-answer platform in the style of a chatbot. Usage data were collected over the course of a year. 254 responses were statistically analysed. Results: 239 users were alleged patients. 82.9% were looking for a tentative diagnosis. The users were on average 32.49 (+/- 11.33) years old and predominantly female (70.2%). The average number of clicks per visit on the website was 14.69 (+/- 8.83). Conclusions: A medical chatbot has to be customised to the specific subject whilst general principles have to be considered. High-quality information has to be available in just a few clicks. People concerned about HS are looking for a diagnosis online and often have not seen a doctor previously. Guidance towards appropriate care should be provided.;2021
Background: There are many types of neurosurgery devices their manipulation procedures are complex and it is difficult for growing nurses in operating room to use them proficiently. In clinical practice a set of detailed intuitive and flexible training methods are needed to improve the effectiveness of training for growing nurses in operating room. In this study a two-dimensional (2D) code video was used to train growing nurses in operating room to operate these devices aiming to improve their ability to do so in the clinical setting. Methods: Before training we created a video for every step of device manipulation decoded the videos generated a 2D code respectively and scanned the code to play on a personal digital assistant (PDA). In 2019 we enrolled 32 growing nurses at the N1 level (N1 refers to the lowest level of nurses) in the north and south divisions of our hospital. A total of 16 nurses from the south division were trained with traditional methods and 16 nurses from the north division were trained based on traditional training plus 2D code video selfteaching. The intervention period for both groups was 6 months. After the intervention the performance of the two groups was compared. Scores from the theoretical knowledge test operation ability evaluation and satisfaction of nurses from the training program were all compared between the two groups. Results: The knowledge test score (83.43 +/- 6.70 vs. 78.60 +/- 6.08 P=0.041) and the operation ability evaluation (84.7 +/- 6.84 vs. 80.93 +/- 6.59 P=0.025) of nurses from the north division were higher than those from the south division satisfaction of nurses from the north division was higher than that of nurses from the south division (97.52 +/- 3.31 vs. 93.40 +/- 5.96 P=0.022). There were also significant differences in the total scores of study ability between the two groups (97.87 +/- 12.37 vs. 90.07 +/- 12.99 P=0.021). Conclusions: The use of a 2D code video can improve nurses' ability to manipulate neurosurgery devices.;2021
Background: To motivate people to adopt medical chatbots the establishment of a specialized medical knowledge database that fits their personal interests is of great importance in developing a chatbot for perinatal care particularly with the help of health professionals. Objective: The objectives of this study are to develop and evaluate a user-friendly question-and-answer (Q&A) knowledge database-based chatbot (Dr. Joy) for perinatal women's and their partners' obstetric and mental health care by applying a text-mining technique and implementing contextual usability testing (UT) respectively thus determining whether this medical chatbot built on mobile instant messenger (KakaoTalk) can provide its male and female users with good user experience. Methods: Two men aged 38 and 40 years and 13 women aged 27 to 43 years in pregnancy preparation or different pregnancy stages were enrolled. All participants completed the 7-day-long UT during which they were given the daily tasks of asking Dr. Joy at least 3 questions at any time and place and then giving the chatbot either positive or negative feedback with emoji using at least one feature of the chatbot and finally sending a facilitator all screenshots for the history of the day's use via KakaoTalk before midnight. One day after the UT completion all participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire on the evaluation of usability perceived benefits and risks intention to seek and share health information on the chatbot and strengths and weaknesses of its use as well as demographic characteristics. Results: Despite the relatively higher score of ease of learning (EOL) the results of the Spearman correlation indicated that EOL was not significantly associated with usefulness (rho=0.26 P=.36) ease of use (rho=0.19 P=.51) satisfaction (rho=0.21 P=.46) or total usability scores (rho=0.32 P=.24). Unlike EOL all 3 subfactors and the total usability had significant positive associations with each other (all rho>0.80 P<.001). Furthermore perceived risks exhibited no significant negative associations with perceived benefits (rho=-0.29 P=.30) or intention to seek (SEE rho=-0.28 P=.32) or share (SHArho=-0.24 P=.40) health information on the chatbot via KakaoTalk whereas perceived benefits exhibited significant positive associations with both SEE and SHA. Perceived benefits were more strongly associated with SEE (rho=0.94 P<.001) than with SHA (rho=0.70 P=.004). Conclusions: This study provides the potential for the uptake of this newly developed Q&A knowledge database-based KakaoTalk chatbot for obstetric and mental health care. As Dr. Joy had quality contents with both utilitarian and hedonic value its male and female users could be encouraged to use medical chatbots in a convenient easy-to-use and enjoyable manner. To boost their continued usage intention for Dr. Joy its Q&A sets need to be periodically updated to satisfy user intent by monitoring both male and female user utterances.;2021
Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious disease. Negative perceptions and insufficient knowledge have made its eradication difficult. Recently mobile health care interventions such as an anti-TB chatbot developed by the research team have emerged in support of TB eradication programs. However before the anti-TB chatbot is deployed it is important to understand the factors that predict its acceptance by the population. Objective: This study aims to explore the acceptance of an anti-TB chatbot that provides information about the disease and its treatment to people vulnerable to TB in South Korea. Thus we are investigating the factors that predict technology acceptance through qualitative research based on the interviews of patients with TB and homeless facility personnel. We are then verifying the extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and predicting the factors associated with the acceptance of the chatbot. Methods: In study 1 we conducted interviews with potential chatbot users to extract the factors that predict user acceptance and constructed a conceptual framework based on the TAM. In total 16 interviews with patients with TB and one focus group interview with 10 experts on TB were conducted. In study 2 we conducted surveys of potential chatbot users to validate the extended TAM. Survey participants were recruited among late-stage patients in TB facilities and members of web-based communities sharing TB information. A total of 123 responses were collected. Results: The results indicate that perceived ease of use and social influence were significantly predictive of perceived usefulness (P=.04 and P<.001 respectively). Perceived usefulness was predictive of the attitude toward the chatbot (P<.001) whereas perceived ease of use (P=.88) was not. Behavioral intention was positively predicted by attitude toward the chatbot and facilitating conditions (P<.001 and P=.03 respectively). The research model explained 55.4% of the variance in the use of anti-TB chatbots. The moderating effect of TB history was found in the relationship between attitude toward the chatbot and behavioral intention (P=.01) and between facilitating conditions and behavioral intention (P=.02). Conclusions: This study can be used to inform future design of anti-TB chatbots and highlight the importance of services and the environment that empower people to use the technology.;2021
Background: Voice-controlled intelligent personal assistants (VIPAs) such as Amazon Echo and Google Home involve artificial intelligence-powered algorithms designed to simulate humans. Their hands-free interface and growing capabilities have a wide range of applications in health care covering off-clinic education health monitoring and communication. However conflicting factors such as patient safety and privacy concerns make it difficult to foresee the further development of VIPAs in health care. Objective: This study aimed to develop a plausible scenario for the further development of VIPAs in health care to support decision making regarding the procurement of VIPAs in health care organizations. Methods: We conducted a two-stage Delphi study with an internationally recruited panel consisting of voice assistant experts medical professionals and representatives of academia governmental health authorities and nonprofit health associations having expertise with voice technology. Twenty projections were formulated and evaluated by the panelists. Descriptive statistics were used to derive the desired scenario. Results: The panelists expect VIPAs to be able to provide solid medical advice based on patients' personal health information and to have human-like conversations. However in the short term voice assistants might neither provide frustration-free user experience nor outperform or replace humans in health care. With a high level of consensus the experts agreed with the potential of VIPAs to support elderly people and be widely used as anamnesis informational self-therapy and communication tools by patients and health care professionals. Although users' and governments' privacy concerns are not expected to decrease in the near future the panelists believe that strict regulations capable of preventing VIPAs from providing medical help services will not be imposed. Conclusions: According to the surveyed experts VIPAs will show notable technological development and gain more user trust in the near future resulting in widespread application in health care. However voice assistants are expected to solely support health care professionals in their daily operations and will not be able to outperform or replace medical staff.;2021
BackgroundAdvances in genetics and sequencing technologies are enabling the identification of more individuals with inherited cancer susceptibility who could benefit from tailored screening and prevention recommendations. While cancer family history information is used in primary care settings to identify unaffected patients who could benefit from a cancer genetics evaluation this information is underutilized. System-level population health management strategies are needed to assist health care systems in identifying patients who may benefit from genetic services. In addition because of the limited number of trained genetics specialists and increasing patient volume the development of innovative and sustainable approaches to delivering cancer genetic services is essential.MethodsWe are conducting a randomized controlled trial entitled Broadening the Reach Impact and Delivery of Genetic Services (BRIDGE) to address these needs. The trial is comparing uptake of genetic counseling uptake of genetic testing and patient adherence to management recommendations for automated patient-directed versus enhanced standard of care cancer genetics services delivery models. An algorithm-based system that utilizes structured cancer family history data available in the electronic health record (EHR) is used to identify unaffected patients who receive primary care at the study sites and meet current guidelines for cancer genetic testing. We are enrolling eligible patients at two healthcare systems (University of Utah Health and New York University Langone Health) through outreach to a randomly selected sample of 2780 eligible patients in the two sites with 1:1 randomization to the genetic services delivery arms within sites. Study outcomes are assessed through genetics clinic records EHR and two follow-up questionnaires at 4weeks and 12months after last genetic counseling contactpre-test genetic counseling.DiscussionBRIDGE is being conducted in two healthcare systems with different clinical structures and patient populations. Innovative aspects of the trial include a randomized comparison of a chatbot-based genetic services delivery model to standard of care as well as identification of at-risk individuals through a sustainable EHR-based system. The findings from the BRIDGE trial will advance the state of the science in identification of unaffected patients with inherited cancer susceptibility and delivery of genetic services to those patients.Trial registrationBRIDGE is registered as NCT03985852. The trial was registered on June 6 2019 at clinicaltrials.gov.;2021
BackgroundMothers of young children from low-income communities may be vulnerable to barriers associated with low physical activity. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between home environment factors and maternal physical activity among mothers of toddlers.MethodsMothers of toddlers (n=200) recruited from low-income communities simultaneously wore an ankle-placed accelerometer and were given a personal digital assistant for ecological momentary assessment. Mothers received randomly prompted questions about their current environment activity and social setting several times a day over eight consecutive days. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression models with random intercepts within-group and between-group relations between physical activity and environment factors were disaggregated.ResultsWithin-group relations included higher physical activity counts for specific mothers with television off versus on (95% CI=130.45 199.17) children absent versus present (95% CI=82.00 3.43) engaging with a child versus not (95% CI=52.66 127.63) and outside versus inside location (95% CI=277.74 392.67). Between-group relations included higher physical activity on average when other adults were absent versus present (95% CI=- 282.63 - 46.95). Recruitment site (urban vs. semi-urban) significantly moderated the within-group relation between being outside versus inside and activity count (beta=- 243.12 95% CI=- 358.74 - 127.47) and showed stronger relations among urban mothers (beta =440.33 95% CI=358.41 522.25) than semi-urban (beta =190.37 95% CI=109.64 271.11). Maternal body weight significantly moderated the within-group relation between being located outside versus inside the home and activity count (beta for interaction=- 188.67 95% CI=- 308.95 - 68.39) with a stronger relation among mothers with normal weight (beta =451.62 95% CI=345.51 557.73) than mothers with overweight/obesity (beta =271.95 95% CI=204.26 339.64).ConclusionsThis study highlights home environmental factors including screen time the presence of others (adults and children) and location (i.e. outside versus inside) that may relate to maternal physical activity behaviors. Understanding factors associated with physical activity could reduce physical activity disparities.Trial registry ClinicalTrials. NCT02615158 April 2006;2021
Based on the theoretical framework of agency effect this study examined the role of affect in influencing the effects of chatbot versus human brand representatives in the context of health marketing communication about HPV vaccines. We conducted a 2 (perceived agency: chatbot vs. human) x 3 (affect elicitation: embarrassment anger neutral) between-subject lab experiment with 142 participants who were randomly assigned to interact with either a perceived chatbot or a human representative. Key findings from self-reported and behavioral data highlight the complexity of consumer-chatbot communication. Specifically participants reported lower interaction satisfaction with the chatbot than with the human representative when anger was evoked. However participants were more likely to disclose concerns of HPV risks and provide more elaborate answers to the perceived human representative when embarrassment was elicited. Overall the chatbot performed comparably to the human representative in terms of perceived usefulness and influence over participants' compliance intention in all emotional contexts. The findings complement the Computers as Social Actors paradigm and offer strategic guidelines to capitalize on the relative advantages of chatbot versus human representatives.;2021
Because of technological advancement human face recognition has been commonly applied in various fields. There are some HCI-related applications such as camera-ready chatbot and companion robot require gathering more information from user's face. In this paper we developed a system called EAGR for emotion age and gender recognition which can perceive user's emotion age and gender based on the face detection. The EAGR system first applies normalized facial cropping (NFC) as a preprocessing method for training data before data augmentation then uses convolution neural network (CNN) as three training models for recognizing seven emotions (six basics plus one neutral emotion) four age groups and two genders. For better emotion recognition the NFC will extract facial features without hair retained. On the other hand the NFC will extract facial features with hair retained for better age and gender recognition. The experiments were conducted on these three training models of emotion age and gender recognitions. The recognition performance results from the testing dataset which has been normalized for tilted head by proposed binocular line angle correction (BLAC) showed that the optimal mean accuracy rates of real-time recognition for seven emotions four age groups and two genders were 82.4% 74.95% and 96.65% respectively. Furthermore the training time can be substantially reduced via NFC preprocessing. Therefore we believe that EAGR system is cost-effective in recognizing human emotions ages and genders. The EAGR system can be further applied in social applications to help HCI service provide more accurate feedback from pluralistic facial classifications.;2021
Beyond the common difficulties faced in task-oriented dialogue system medical dialogue has recently attracted increasing attention due to its huge application potential while posing more challenges in reasoning over medical domain knowledge and logic. Existing works resort to neural language models for dialogue embedding and neglect the explicit logical reasoning leading to poor explainable and generalization ability. In this work we propose an explainable Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning (HGR) model to unify the relational dialogue context understanding and entity-correlation reasoning into a heterogeneous graph structure. HGR encodes entity context according to the corresponding utterance and deduces next response after fusing the underlying medical knowledge with entity context by attentional graph propagation. To push forward the future research on expert-sensitive task-oriented dialogue system we first release a large-scale Medical Dialogue Consultant benchmark (MDG-C) with 16 Gastrointestinal diseases for evaluating consultant capability and a Medical Dialogue Diagnosis benchmark (MDG-D) with 6 diseases for measuring diagnosis capability of models respectively. Extensive experiments on both MDG-C and MDG-D benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our HGR over state-of-the-art knowledge grounded approaches in general fields of medical dialogue system.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are a type of assistive technology that uses the brain signals of users to establish a communication and control channel between them and an external device. BCI systems may be a suitable tool to restore communication skills in severely motor-disabled patients as BCI do not rely on muscular control. The loss of communication is one of the most negative consequences reported by such patients. This paper presents a BCI system focused on the control of four mainstream messaging applications running in a smartphone: WhatsApp Telegram e-mail and short message service (SMS). The control of the BCI is achieved through the well-known visual P300 row-column paradigm (RCP) allowing the user to select control commands as well as spelling characters. For the control of the smartphone the system sends synthesized voice commands that are interpreted by a virtual assistant running in the smartphone. Four tasks related to the four mentioned messaging services were tested with 15 healthy volunteers most of whom were able to accomplish the tasks which included sending free text e-mails to an address proposed by the subjects themselves. The online performance results obtained as well as the results of subjective questionnaires support the viability of the proposed system.;2021
Building an intelligent dialogue system with the ability to select a proper response according to a multi-turn context is challenging in three aspects: (1) the meaning of a context response pair is built upon language units from multiple granularities (e.g. words phrases and sub-sentences etc.) (2) local (e.g. a small window around a word) and long-range (e.g. words across the context and the response) dependencies may exist in dialogue data and (3) the relationship between the context and the response candidate lies in multiple relevant semantic clues or relatively implicit semantic clues in some real cases. However existing approaches usually encode the dialogue with mono-type representation and the interaction processes between the context and the response candidate are executed in a rather shallow manner which may lead to an inadequate understanding of dialogue content and hinder the recognition of the semantic relevance between the context and response. To tackle these challenges we propose a representation ([K])-interaction ([L])-matching framework that explores multiple types of deep interactive representations to build context-response matching models for response selection. Particularly we construct different types of representations for utterance response pairs and deepen them via alternate encoding and interaction. By this means the model can handle the relation of neighboring elements phrasal pattern and long-range dependencies during the representation and make a more accurate prediction through multiple layers of interactions between the context-response pair. Experiment results on three public benchmarks indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous conventional context-response matching models and achieve slightly better results than the BERT model for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based dialogue systems.;2021
Building Virtual Agents capable of carrying out complex queries of the user involving multiple intents of a domain is quite a challenge because it demands that the agent manages several subtasks simultaneously. This article presents a universal Deep Reinforcement Learning framework that can synthesize dialogue managers capable of working in a task-oriented dialogue system encompassing various intents pertaining to a domain. The conversation between agent and user is broken down into hierarchies to segregate subtasks pertinent to different intents. The concept of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning particularly options is used to learn policies in different hierarchies that operates in distinct time steps to fulfill the user query successfully. The dialogue manager comprises top-level intent meta-policy to select among subtasks or options and a low-level controller policy to pick primitive actions to communicate with the user to complete the subtask provided to it by the top-level policy in varying intents of a domain. The proposed dialogue management module has been trained in a way such that it can be reused for any language for which it has been developed with little to no supervision. The developed system has been demonstrated for Air Travel and Restaurant domain in English and Hindi languages. Empirical results determine the robustness and efficacy of the learned dialogue policy as it outperforms several baselines and a state-of-the-art system.;2021
Business psychologists study and assess relevant individual differences such as intelligence and personality in the context of work. Such studies have informed the development of artificial intelligence systems (AI) designed to measure individual differences. This has been capitalized on by companies who have developed AI-driven recruitment solutions that include aggregation of appropriate candidates (Hiretual) interviewing through a chatbot (Paradox) video interview assessment (MyInterview) and CV-analysis (Textio) as well as estimation of psychometric characteristics through image-(Traitify) and game-based assessments (HireVue) and video interviews (Cammio). However driven by concern that such high-impact technology must be used responsibly due to the potential for unfair hiring to result from the algorithms used by these tools there is an active effort towards proving mechanisms of governance for such automation. In this article we apply a systematic algorithm audit framework in the context of the ethically critical industry of algorithmic recruitment systems exploring how audit assessments on AI-driven systems can be used to assure that such systems are being responsibly deployed in a fair and well-governed manner. We outline sources of risk for the use of algorithmic hiring tools suggest the most appropriate opportunities for audits to take place recommend ways to measure bias in algorithms and discuss the transparency of algorithms.;2021
Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) be more effective than human instruction for the moral enhancement of people? The author argues that it only would be if the use of this technology were aimed at increasing the individual's capacity to reflectively decide for themselves rather than at directly influencing behaviour. To support this it is shown how a disregard for personal autonomy in particular invalidates the main proposals for applying new technologies both biomedical and AI-based to moral enhancement. As an alternative to these proposals this article proposes a virtual assistant that through dialogue neutrality and virtual reality technologies can teach users to make better moral decisions on their own. The author concludes that as long as certain precautions are taken in its design such an assistant could do this better than a human instructor adopting the same educational methodology.;2021
Chatbot development and adoption is a growing challenge in emerging markets which are characterised by a young population structure low-level internet penetration and a high degree of institutional adversity. The purpose of this study is to explore how consumers in emerging markets interact and engage with banking chatbots when conducting bank transactions. Based on qualitative research using semi-structured interviews with 36 Nigerian residents this study demonstrates that the four factors of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) can explain how emerging-market consumers interact and engage with banking chatbots. While age and technological experience are significant components in facilitating the use of chatbots perceived expertise responsiveness and security were found to be particularly important to users. This study delves into user experiences with conversational interfaces specifically focusing on emerging markets.;2021
Chatbot technologies have made our lives easier. To create a chatbot with high intelligence a significant amount of knowledge processing is required. However this can slow down the reaction time hence a mechanism to enable a quick response is needed. This paper proposes a cache mechanism to improve the response time of the chatbot service while the cache in CPU utilizes the locality of references within binary code executions our cache mechanism for chatbots uses the frequency and relevance information which potentially exists within the set of Q & A pairs. The proposed idea is to enable the broker in a multi-layered structure to analyze and store the keyword-wise relevance of the set of Q & A pairs from chatbots. In addition the cache mechanism accumulates the frequency of the input questions by monitoring the conversation history. When a cache miss occurs the broker selects a chatbot according to the frequency and relevance and then delivers the query to the selected chatbot to obtain a response for answer. This mechanism showed a significant increase in the cache hit ratio as well as an improvement in the average response time.;2021
Chatbots are a burgeoning opportunity for news media outlets to disseminate their content in a conversational way and create an engaging experience around it. Since chatbots are social and interactive technologies they might be effective tools to lower the threshold of engaging with news content containing opposing views. In an experiment we test this idea by investigating whether people are more likely to accept a news article containing conflicting views when it is delivered by a chatbot as compared with the same article on a news website. The results indicated that people agreed more to a counter-attitudinal news article when it was delivered by a news chatbot (compared with the website article). In addition users also perceived this chatbot article as more credible. The underlying process for this effect was that people attributed human-like characteristics to the chatbot on an implicit level (i.e. perceived mindless anthropomorphism). These results are discussed in the light of their potential contribution to an informed public discourse and a decrease in polarization in our society.;2021
Chatbots are artificial communication systems becoming increasingly popular and not all their security questions are clearly solved. People use chatbots for assistance in shopping bank communication meal delivery healthcare cars and many other actions. However it brings an additional security risk and creates serious security challenges which have to be handled. Understanding the underlying problems requires defining the crucial steps in the techniques used to design chatbots related to security. There are many factors increasing security threats and vulnerabilities. All of them are comprehensively studied and security practices to decrease security weaknesses are presented. Modern chatbots are no longer rule-based models but they employ modern natural language and machine learning techniques. Such techniques learn from a conversation which can contain personal information. The paper discusses circumstances under which such data can be used and how chatbots treat them. Many chatbots operate on a social/messaging platform which has their terms and conditions about data. The paper aims to present a comprehensive study of security aspects in communication with chatbots. The article could open a discussion and highlight the problems of data storage and usage obtained from the communication user-chatbot and propose some standards to protect the user.;2021
Chatbots are artificial intelligence tools that interact with people in different contexts. A chatbot can be useful to streamline daily processes serve customers 24 hours a day provide information about classes among other things. The appearance of new development technologies has made creating a chatbot an increasingly fast and straightforward process bringing this kind of applications to people who had never considered using them before. However this speed in development can lead to specific problems many of them caused by the lack of usability evaluations. Heuristic usability evaluations are user interface review processes carried out by experts and are an essential part of any assessment process. To date there are no heuristics to evaluate the usability of chatbots. Therefore this work proposes five usability heuristics in chatbots that come from the experience developing this type of applications as well as from a broad review of state of the art. The set of heuristics was tested using a case study with the help of five experts who evaluated an education-oriented chatbot. The results revealed that although the proposed heuristics need refinement they are an excellent first step in broadening the horizon of usability evaluations in chatbots.;2021
Chatbots are emerging as a promising platform for accessing and delivering healthcare services. The evidence is in the growing number of publicly available chatbots aiming at taking an active role in the provision of prevention diagnosis and treatment services. This article takes a closer look at how these emerging chatbots address design aspects relevant to healthcare service provision emphasizing the human-AI interaction aspects and the transparency in AI automation and decision making.;2021
Chatbots are increasingly becoming important gateways to digital services and information-taken up within domains such as customer service health education and work support. However there is only limited knowledge concerning the impact of chatbots at the individual group and societal level. Furthermore a number of challenges remain to be resolved before the potential of chatbots can be fully realized. In response chatbots have emerged as a substantial research area in recent years. To help advance knowledge in this emerging research area we propose a research agenda in the form of future directions and challenges to be addressed by chatbot research. This proposal consolidates years of discussions at the CONVERSATIONS workshop series on chatbot research. Following a deliberative research analysis process among the workshop participants we explore future directions within six topics of interest: (a) users and implications (b) user experience and design (c) frameworks and platforms (d) chatbots for collaboration (e) democratizing chatbots and (f) ethics and privacy. For each of these topics we provide a brief overview of the state of the art discuss key research challenges and suggest promising directions for future research. The six topics are detailed with a 5-year perspective in mind and are to be considered items of an interdisciplinary research agenda produced collaboratively by avid researchers in the field.;2021
Chatbots are increasingly engaged in retail settings although research shows that consumers typically prefer engaging with humans over chatbots. Past literature has argued that anthropomorphising chatbots can lead to more effective consumer interactions. The current work further enhances this literature by showing that chatbots can be given human qualities like warmth and competence to enhance positive consumer experiences. However we find that these exchanges are contingent on consumers' time orientation. We conduct one pre-test (N = 103) two laboratory experiments (N = 213 and 233) and a third study engaging live chatbot conversations (N = 77) to test the premises of our study. The findings show that present-oriented subjects prefer a warm versus competent chatbot conversation leading to favourable product decisions. Their counterparts future-oriented subjects prefer a competent vs. warm conversation. Brand perceptions further mediate these effects. The findings contribute to the literature on chatbot anthropomorphism and inform managerial decisions.;2021
Chatbots are programs that supply services to users via conversation in natural language acting as virtual assistants within social networks or web applications. Here we review the most representative chatbot development tools with a focus on technical and managerial aspects.;2021
Chatbots are software agents that are able to interact with humans in natural language. Their intuitive interaction paradigm is expected to significantly reshape the software landscape of tomorrow while already today chatbots are invading a multitude of scenarios and contexts. This article takes a developer's perspective identifies a set of architectural patterns that capture different chatbot integration scenarios and reviews state-of-the-art development aids.;2021
Chatbots are software applications to simulate a conversation with a person. The effectiveness of chatbots in facilitating the recruitment of study participants in research specifically among racial and ethnic minorities is unknown. The objective of this study is to compare a chatbot versus telephone-based recruitment in enrolling research participants from a predominantly minority patient population at an urban institution. We randomly allocated adults to receive either chatbot or telephone-based outreach regarding a study about vaccine hesitancy. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who provided consent to participate in the study. In 935 participants the proportion who answered contact attempts was significantly lower in the chatbot versus telephone group (absolute difference 21.8% 95% confidence interval [CI] 27.0% 16.5% P<0.001). The consent rate was also significantly lower in the chatbot group (absolute difference 3.4% 95% CI 5.7% 1.1% P=0.004). However among participants who answered a contact attempt the difference in consent rates was not significant. In conclusion the consent rate was lower with chatbot compared to telephone-based outreach. The difference in consent rates was due to a lower proportion of participants in the chatbot group who answered a contact attempt.;2021
Chatbots' growing popularity has brought new challenges to HCI having changed the patterns of human interactions with computers. The increasing need to approximate conversational interaction styles raises expectations for chatbots to present social behaviors that are habitual in human-human communication. In this survey we argue that chatbots should be enriched with social characteristics that cohere with users' expectations ultimately avoiding frustration and dissatisfaction. We bring together the literature on disembodied text-based chatbots to derive a conceptual model of social characteristics for chatbots. We analyzed 56 papers from various domains to understand how social characteristics can benefit human-chatbot interactions and identify the challenges and strategies to designing them. Additionally we discussed how characteristics may influence one another. Our results provide relevant opportunities to both researchers and designers to advance human-chatbot interactions.;2021
Chatbots have become popular in recent years as a means of supporting a company's external communication with customers but they are also increasingly being used for internal purposes especially to improve and accelerate workflows. Along these lines recent studies have suggested that chatbots can also be applied to other internal business practices such as innovation management. Nevertheless the use of chatbots for innovation management is still an under-researched topic and practical experiences are largely missing. We address this gap by identifying value propositions of chatbots to support a company's innovation management process. Furthermore we link the value propositions to particular process steps and success dimensions. To do so we perform a literature review and complement the findings with expert interviews. This study contributes to a better understanding of the benefits of chatbot usage for the innovation management process.;2021
Chatbots or conversational recommenders have gained increasing popularity as a new paradigm for Recommender Systems (RS). Prior work on RS showed that providing explanations can improve transparency and trust which are critical for the adoption of RS. Their interactive and engaging nature makes conversational recommenders a natural platform to not only provide recommendations but also justify the recommendations through explanations. The recent surge of interest inexplainable Al enables diverse styles of justification and also invites questions on how styles of justification impact user perception. In this article we explore the effect of why justifications and why not justifications on users' perceptions of explainability and trust. We developed and tested a movie-recommendation chatbot that provides users with different types of justifications for the recommended items. Our online experiment (n = 310) demonstrates that the why justifications (but not the why not justifications) have a significant impact on users' perception of the conversational recommender. Particularly why justifications increase users' perception of system transparency which impacts perceived control trusting beliefs and in turn influences users' willingness to depend on the system's advice. Finally we discuss the design implications for decision-assisting chatbots.;2021
Common ground processes can improve performance in communication tasks and understanding these processes will likely benefit human-computer dialogue interfaces. However there are multiple proposed theories with different implications for interface design. Fusaroli and Tylen achieved a direct comparison by designing two models: one based on alignment theory and the other based on complementarity theory that encapsulated interpersonal synergy and audience design. The current research used these models extending them to differentiate between interpersonal synergy and audience design. Few studies have tested multiple common ground models against tasks representative of envisioned human-computer interaction (HCI) applications. We report on four such tests which allowed examination of generalizability of findings. Results supported the complementarity models over the alignment model and were suggestive of the audience design variant of complementarity providing guidance for HCI design that differs from contemporary approaches.;2021
Common grounding is the process of creating and maintaining mutual understandings which is a critical aspect of sophisticated human communication. While various task settings have been proposed in existing literature they mostly focus on creating common ground under a static context and ignore the aspect of maintaining them overtime under dynamic context. In this work we propose a novel task setting to study the ability of both creating and maintaining common ground in dynamic environments. Based on our minimal task formulation we collected a large-scale dataset of 5617 dialogues to enable fine-grained evaluation and analysis of various dialogue systems. Through our dataset analyses we highlight novel challenges introduced in our setting such as the usage of complex spatio-temporal expressions to create and maintain common ground. Finally we conduct extensive experiments to assess the capabilities of our baseline dialogue system and discuss future prospects of our research.;2021
Communicating with customers through live chat interfaces has become an increasingly popular means to provide real-time customer service in many e-commerce settings. Today human chat service agents are frequently replaced by conversational software agents or chatbots which are systems designed to communicate with human users by means of natural language often based on artificial intelligence (AI). Though cost- and time-saving opportunities triggered a widespread implementation of AI-based chatbots they still frequently fail to meet customer expectations potentially resulting in users being less inclined to comply with requests made by the chatbot. Drawing on social response and commitment-consistency theory we empirically examine through a randomized online experiment how verbal anthropomorphic design cues and the foot-in-the-door technique affect user request compliance. Our results demonstrate that both anthropomorphism as well as the need to stay consistent significantly increase the likelihood that users comply with a chatbot's request for service feedback. Moreover the results show that social presence mediates the effect of anthropomorphic design cues on user compliance.;2021
Community-dwelling older adults have raised the scientific community's interest during the COVID-19 era as their chronic conditions might be aggravated by the consequences of confinement. Digital devices in this field to monitor cognitive impairment are an emerging reality of an innovative nature. However some groups may not have benefited from these developments as much as for example younger people. The aim of this manuscript is to carry out a review on the development of digital devices and specifically virtual assistants for the detection of cognitive impairment in older adults. After a screening process eight studies were found under the given criteria and this number was even smaller for those using virtual assistants. Given the opportunities offered by virtual assistants through techniques such as natural language processing it seems imperative to take advantage of this opportunity for groups such as older adults.;2021
Companies have repeatedly launched Artificial Intelligence (AI) products such as intelligent chatbots and robots with female names voices and bodies. Previous research posits that people intuitively favor female over male bots mainly because female bots are judged as warmer and more likely to experience emotions. We present five online studies including four preregistered with a total sample of over 3000 participants that go beyond this longstanding perception of femininity. Because warmth and experience (but not competence) are seen as fundamental qualities to be a full human but are lacking in machines we argue that people prefer female bots because they are perceived as more human than male bots. Using implicit subtle and blatant scales of humanness our results consistently show that women (Studies 1A and 1B) female bots (Studies 2 and 3) and female chatbots (Study 4) are perceived as more human than their male counterparts when compared with non-human entities (animals and machines). Study 4 investigates explicitly the acceptance of gendered algorithms operated by AI chatbots in a health context. We found that the female chatbot is preferred over the male chatbot because it is perceived as more human and more likely to consider our unique needs. These results highlight the ethical quandary faced by AI designers and policymakers: Women are said to be transformed into objects in AI but injecting women's humanity into AI objects makes these objects seem more human and acceptable.;2021
Consistently exhibited personalities are crucial elements of realistic engaging and behavior-rich conversational virtual agents. Both nonverbal and verbal cues help convey these agents' unseen psychological states contributing to our effective communication with them. We introduce a comprehensive framework to design conversational agents that express personality through non-verbal behaviors like body movement and facial expressions as well as verbal behaviors like dialogue selection and voice transformation. We use the OCEAN personality model which defines personality as a combination of five orthogonal factors of openness conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism. The framework combines existing personality expression methods with novel ones such as new algorithms to convey Laban Shape and Effort qualities. We perform Amazon Mechanical Turk studies to analyze how different communication modalities influence our perception of virtual agent personalities and compare their individual and combined effects on each personality dimension. The results indicate that our personality-basedmodifications are perceived as natural and each additional modality improves perception accuracy with the best performance achieved when all the modalities are present. We also report some correlations for the perception of conscientiousness with neuroticism and openness with extraversion.;2021
Consumers sometimes describe their experience of interacting with artificial intelligence-based human-like chatbots as creepy. This study investigates the antecedents of creepiness (i.e. the chatbot's usability privacy concerns and user variables such as technology anxiety and the need for human interaction) and its impact on consumer loyalty. Grounded in the technology paradox it deepens the understanding of creepiness in light of the theoretical underpinnings of the privacy paradox and privacy cynicism. Presented with the task of obtaining a car insurance quote 430 consumers participated in a simulation involving interaction with a chatbot followed by a questionnaire. The findings show that creepiness decreases loyalty and indirectly impacts it through trust and negative emotions. While usability reduces perceptions of creepiness privacy concerns raised by the interaction with the chatbot increase creepiness which is positively associated with consumer traits (i.e. technology anxiety and need for human interaction). The main contribution of the research lies in its focus on creepiness a concept under-researched in the marketing literature and which can be seen from the perspective of a coping mechanism for consumers' privacy concerns. This paper provides practical implications to orient managers in the design and implementation of chatbots as a promising touch point to build customer loyalty.;2021
Consumption of media and movies in particular is increasing and is influenced by a number of factors. One important and overlooked factor that affects the media consumption choices is the emotional state of the user and the decision making based on it. To include this factor in movie recommendation processes we propose a knowledge graph representing human emotions in the domain of movies. The knowledge graph has been built by extracting emotions out of pre-existing movie reviews using machine learning techniques. To show how the knowledge graph can be used a chatbot prototype has been developed. The chatbot's reasoning mechanism derives movie recommendations for the user by combining the user's emotions which have been extracted from chat messages with the knowledge graph. The developed approach for movie recommendations based on sentiment represented as a knowledge graph has been proven to be technically feasible however it requires more information about the emotions associated with the movies than currently available online.

Context. Asynchronous messaging is increasingly used to support human-machine interactions generally implemented through chatbots. Such virtual entities assist the users in activities of different kinds (e.g. work leisure and health-related) and are becoming ingrained into humans' habits due to factors including (i) the availability of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets (ii) the increasingly engaging nature of chatbot interactions (iii) the release of dedicated APIs from messaging platforms and (iv) increasingly complex AI-based mechanisms to power the bots' behaviors. Nevertheless most of the modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational rules) and one-fits-all approaches neglecting personalization data-stream privacy management multi-topic management/interconnection and multimodal interactions. Objective. This work addresses the challenges above through an agent-based framework for chatbot development named EREBOTS. Methods. The foundations of the framework are based on the implementation of (i) multi-front-end connectors and interfaces (i.e. Telegram dedicated App and web interface) (ii) enabling the configuration of multi-scenario behaviors (i.e. preventive physical conditioning smoking cessation and support for breast-cancer survivors) (iii) online learning (iv) personalized conversations and recommendations (i.e. mood boost anti-craving persuasion and balance-preserving physical exercises) and (v) responsive multi-device monitoring interface (i.e. doctor and admin). Results. EREBOTS has been tested in the context of physical balance preservation in social confinement times (due to the ongoing pandemic). Thirteen individuals characterized by diverse age gender and country distribution have actively participated in the experimentation reporting advancements in the physical balance and overall satisfaction of the interaction and exercises' variety they have been proposed.;2021
Controllable response generation is an attractive and valuable task to the success of conversational systems. However controlling both pattern and content of the response has not been well studied in existing models since they are mainly based on matching mechanisms. To tackle the problem we first design a pattern model to automatically learn and extract speech patterns from words. The pattern is then integrated into the encoder-decoder model to control the response pattern. Second a sentence sampling algorithm is built to directly insert or delete words in the generated response so that the content is controlled. In this two-stage framework the response could be explicitly controlled by the pattern and content without any human annotation of the post-response dataset. Experiments show the proposed framework achieves better performance in response controllability than the state-of-the-art.;2021
Conversation systems usually suffer from the challenge of knowledge management from multiple human experts. The current mechanism used in knowledge-based conversation system is always based on centralized servers which may be problematic in terms of transparency and security. Blockchain solutions are currently being proposed improve the security and efficiency in different domains. However there are various blockchain platforms with different characteristics and conver-sation system implemented using blockchain platform is not in place yet. In this paper we clearly identified the requirement analysis of knowledge-based conversation system and present a decision model for identify the best fitting blockchain platform for knowledge-based conversation system. In the proposed method multiple measurements including Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) are utilized to analyze and create consistent result together which can be used for the selection of blockchain platforms and improve the efficiency of the decision-making process.

Conversational agents (CAs) are natural language user interfaces that emulate human-to-human communication. Because of this emulation research on CAs is inseparably linked to questions about anthropomorphism-the attribution of human qualities including consciousness intentions and emotions to nonhuman agents. Past research has demonstrated that anthropomorphism affects human perception and behavior in human-computer interactions by for example increasing trust and connectedness or stimulating social response behaviors. Based on the psychological theory of anthropomorphism and related research on computer interface design we develop a theoretical framework for designing anthropomorphic CAs. We identify three groups of factors that stimulate anthropomorphism: technology design-related factors task-related factors and individual factors. Our findings from an online experiment support the derived framework but also reveal novel yet counterintuitive insights. In particular we demonstrate that not all combinations of anthropomorphic technology design cues increase perceived anthropomorphism. For example we find that using only nonverbal cues harms anthropomorphism however this effect becomes positive when nonverbal cues are complemented with verbal or human identity cues. We also find that CAs' disposition to complete computerlike versus humanlike tasks and individuals' disposition to anthropomorphize greatly affect perceived anthropomorphism. This work advances our understanding of anthropomorphism and contextualizes the theory of anthropomorphism within the IS discipline. We advise on the directions that research and practice should take to find the sweet spot for anthropomorphic CA design.;2021
Conversational agents (CAs) promise to create significant organisational value by transforming how organisations operate and serve customers. Yet the malleability of this technology poses challenges to both researchers and practitioners because of the wide range of strategic applications they can enable. Drawing on the lens of routine capability this study investigates strategic applications of CAs and their associated implementation enablers and challenges. Via an exploratory case study of eight organisations that have successfully implemented CAs this paper contributes to the literature on the value and implementation of conversational agents in particular and cognitive technologies in general by developing a typology of CA strategic applications and their implementation considerations. For practitioners the findings highlight the interplay between technology user and project management factors that need to be addressed to ensure the successful delivery of the value of CAs.;2021
Conversational artificial agents and artificially intelligent (AI) voice assistants are becoming increasingly popular. Digital virtual assistants such as Siri or conversational devices such as Amazon Echo or Google Home are permeating everyday life and are designed to be more and more humanlike in their speech. This study investigates the effect this can have on one's conformity with an AI assistant. In the 1950s Solomon Asch's already demonstrated the power and danger of conformity amongst people. In these classical experiments test persons were asked to answer relatively simple questions whilst others pretending to be participants tried to convince the test person to give wrong answers. These studies were later replicated with embodied robots but these physical robots are still rare. In light of our increasing reliance on AI assistants this study investigates to what extent an individual will conform to a disembodied virtual assistant. We also investigate if there is a difference between a group that interacts with an assistant that communicates through text one that has a robotic voice and one that has a humanlike voice. The assistant attempts to subtly influence participants' final responses in a general knowledge quiz and we measure how often participants change their answer after having been given advice. Results show that participants conformed significantly more often to the assistant with a human voice than the one that communicated through text.;2021
Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa Siri and Google Assistants are examples of Voice-based digital assistants (VBDA) that are ubiquitously occupying our living spaces. While they gather an enormous amount of personal information to provide bespoke user experience they also evoke serious privacy concerns regarding the collection use and storage of personal data of the consumers. The objective of this research is to examine the perception of the consumers towards the privacy concerns and in turn its influence on the adoption of VBDA. We extend the celebrated UTAUT2 model with perceived privacy concerns perceived privacy risk and perceived trust. With the assistance of survey data collected from tech-savvy respondents we show that trust in technology and the service provider plays an important role in the adoption of VBDA. In addition we notice that consumers showcase a trade-off between privacy risks and benefits associated with VBDA while adopting the VBDA such technologies reiterating their calculus behaviour. Contrary to the extant literature our results indicate that consumers? perceived privacy risk does not influence adoption intention directly. It is mediated through perceived privacy concerns and consumers? trust. Then we propose theoretical and managerial implications to conclude the paper.;2021
Conversational information retrieval is a relatively new and fast-developing research area but conversation itself has been well studied for decades. Researchers have analysed linguistic phenomena such as structure and semantics but also paralinguistic features such as tone body language and even the physiological states of interlocutors. We tend to treat computers as social agents-especially if they have some humanlike features in their design-and so work from human-to-human conversation is highly relevant to how we think about the design of human-to-computer applications. In this article we summarise some salient past work focusing on social norms structures and affect prosody and style. We examine social communication theories briefly as a review to see what we have learned about how humans interact with each other and how that might pertain to agents and robots. We also discuss some implications for research and design of conversational IR systems.;2021
Conversational interfaces are increasingly popular as a way of connecting people to information. With the increased generative capacity of corpus-based conversational agents comes the need to classify and filter out malevolent responses that are inappropriate in terms of content and dialogue acts. Previous studies on the topic of detecting and classifying inappropriate content are mostly focused on a specific category of malevolence or on single sentences instead of an entire dialogue. We make three contributions to advance research on the malevolent dialogue response detection and classification (MDRDC) task. First we define the task and present a hierarchical malevolent dialogue taxonomy. Second we create a labeled multiturn dialogue data set and formulate the MDRDC task as a hierarchical classification task. Last we apply state-of-the-art text classification methods to the MDRDC task and report on experiments aimed at assessing the performance of these approaches.;2021
Conversational interfaces have recently become a ubiquitous element in both the personal sphere by easing access to services and industrial environments by the automation of services improved customer support and its corresponding cost savings. However designing the dialog model used by these interfaces to decide system responses is still a hard-to-accomplish task for complex conversational interactions. This paper describes a data driven dialog management technique which provides flexibility to develop deploy and maintain this module. Various configurations for classification algorithms are assessed with two dialog corpora of different application domains size dimensionalities and set of possible system responses. The results of the evaluation show satisfactory accuracy and coherence rates in both tasks. As a proof of concept our proposal has also been integrated with DialogFlow a platform provided by Google to design conversational user interfaces. Our proposal has been assessed with a real use case proving that it can be deployed in conjunction with commercial platforms obtaining satisfactory results for the objective and subjective assessments completed.;2021
Conversational interfaces that interact with humans need to continuously establish maintain and repair common ground in task-oriented dialogues. Uncertainty repairs and acknowledgements are expressed in user behaviour in the continuous efforts of the conversational partners to maintain mutual understanding. Users change their behaviour when interacting with systems in different forms of embodiment which affects the abilities of these interfaces to observe users' recurrent social signals. Additionally humans are intellectually biased towards social activity when facing anthropomorphic agents or when presented with subtle social cues. Two studies are presented in this paper examining how humans interact in a referential communication task with wizarded interfaces in different forms of embodiment. In study 1 (N = 30) we test whether humans respond the same way to agents in different forms of embodiment and social behaviour. In study 2 (N = 44) we replicate the same task and agents but introduce conversational failures disrupting the process of grounding. Findings indicate that it is not always favourable for agents to be anthropomorphised or to communicate with non-verbal cues as human grounding behaviours change when embodiment and failures are manipulated.;2021
Conversational responses are non-trivial for artificial conversational agents. Artificial responses should not only be meaningful and plausible but should also (1) have an emotional context and (2) should be non-deterministic (i.e. vary given the same input). The two factors enumerated respectively above are involved and this is demonstrated such that previous studies have tackled them individually. This paper is the first to tackle them together. Specifically we present two models both based upon conditional variational autoencoders. The first model learns disentangled latent representations to generate conversational responses given a specific emotion. The other model explicitly learns different emotions using a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions. Experiments show that our proposed models can generate more plausible and diverse conversation responses in accordance with designated emotions compared to baseline approaches.;2021
Conversational systems have become an element of everyday life for billions of users who use speech-based interfaces to services engage with personal digital assistants on smartphones social media chatbots or smart speakers. One of the most complex tasks in the development of these systems is to design the dialogue model the logic that provided a user input selects the next answer. The dialogue model must also consider mechanisms to adapt the response of the system and the interaction style according to different groups and user profiles. Rule-based systems are difficult to adapt to phenomena that were not taken into consideration at design-time. However many of the systems that are commercially available are based on rules and so are the most widespread tools for the development of chatbots and speech interfaces. In this article we present a proposal to: (a) automatically generate the dialogue rules from a dialogue corpus through the use of evolving algorithms (b) adapt the rules according to the detected user intention. We have evaluated our proposal with several conversational systems of different application domains from which our approach provided an efficient way for adapting a set of dialogue rules considering user utterance clusters.;2021
Conversational systems now attract great attention due to their promising potential and commercial values. To build a conversational system with moderate intelligence is challenging and requires big (conversational) data as well as interdisciplinary techniques. Thanks to the prosperity of the Web the massive data available greatly facilitate data-driven methods such as deep learning for human-computer conversational systems. In general retrieval-based conversational systems apply various matching schema between query utterances and responses but the classic retrieval paradigm suffers from prominent weakness for conversations: the system finds similar responses given a particular query. For real human-to-human conversations on the contrary responses can be greatly different yet all are possibly appropriate. The observation reveals the diversity phenomenon in conversations. In this article we ascribe the lack of conversational diversity to the reason that the query utterances are statically modeled regardless of candidate responses through traditional methods. To this end we propose a dynamic representation learning strategy that models the query utterances and different response candidates in an interactive way. To be more specific we propose a Respond-with-Diversity model augmented by the memory module interacting with both the query utterances and multiple candidate responses. Hence we obtain dynamic representations for the input queries conditioned on different response candidates. We frame the model as an end-to-end learnable neural network. In the experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by achieving a good appropriateness score and much better diversity in retrieval-based conversations between humans and computers.;2021
Corporate meetings are a crucial part of business activities. While numerous academic papers investigated how to make the scheduling process of meetings faster or even automatic little work has been done yet to facilitate the retrospective reasoning about how time is spent on meetings. Traditional calendar applications do not allow users to extract actionable statistics although it has been shown that reflection-oriented design can increase the users' understanding of their habits and can thereby encourage a shift towards better practices. In this paper we present MineTime Insight a tool made of multiple coordinated views for the exploration of personal calendar data with the overarching goal of improving short and long-term scheduling decisions. Despite being focused on the working environment our work builds upon recent results in the field of Personal Visual Analytics as it targets users not necessarily expert in visualization and data analysis. We demonstrate the potential of MineTime Insight when applied to the agenda of an executive manager. Finally we discuss the results of an informal user study and a field study. Our results suggest that our visual representations are perceived as easy to understand and helpful towards a change in the scheduling habits.;2021
Co-speech gestures are a vital ingredient in making virtual agents more human-like and engaging. Automatically generated gestures based on speech-input often lack realistic and defined gesture form. We present a database-driven approach guaranteeing defined gesture form. We built a large corpus of over 23000 motion-captured co-speech gestures and select individual gestures based on expressive gesture characteristics that can be estimated from speech audio. The expressive parameters are gesture velocity and acceleration gesture size arm swivel and finger extension. Individual parameter-matched gestures are then combined into animated sequences. We evaluate our gesture generation system in two perceptual studies. The first study compares our method to the ground truth gestures as well as mismatched gestures. The second study compares our method to five current generative machine learning models. Our method outperformed mismatched gesture selection in the first study and showed competitive performance in the second.;2021
COVID-19 chatbots are widely used to screen for symptoms and disseminate information about the virus yet little is known about the population subgroups that interact with this technology and the specific features that are used. An analysis of 1000740 patients invited to use a COVID-19 chatbot 69451 (6.94%) of which agreed to participate shows differences in chatbot feature use by gender race and age. These results can inform future public health COVID-19 symptom screening and information dissemination strategies.;2021
Creating physical-computing systems especially selecting correct electronic components assembling the circuit and implementing the program can be challenging for novice users. In this paper we present FritzBot a data driven conversational agent supporting novice users on creating physical-computing systems through natural language interaction. FritzBot is built upon the structure of a BiLSTM-CRF (bi-directional Long Short-term Memory Network and Conditional Random Field) neural network as a plug-in for Fritzing. The neural network is trained on a lexical circuit-event database derived from 152 students' reports on their physical computing course projects. By processing the user's textual description on his/her physical-computing idea FritzBot can extract the causal relationships between the input and the output events identify the corresponding electronic components and generate the Arduino-based circuit and the code along with the step-by-step construction guidelines. Our user study shows that compared to the original Arduino software and the circuitautocompletion software available in the commercial market FritzBot significantly shortens the time spent reduces the perceived workload and enhances the satisfaction/joy for inexperienced users on designing and prototyping physical-computing systems.;2021
Crew time requirements for human space exploration missions is as critical as mass energy and volume requirements. However it has only been sporadically recorded in past analog and space missions for plant cultivation. In this retrospective study on crew time data collected in various analog facilities and on the Veggie hardware on ISS we propose a methodology for efficient categorizing and reporting of crew time in space plant growth systems. Crew time is difficult to capture in operational environments and this study intends to harmonize these efforts among different locations. This article also provides a current database for required crew time in several plant growth hardware and facilities on the ISS and on Earth. These data could serve mission planners as a baseline to establish standardized activities and extrapolate crew time needed to operate future plant growth units. Finally we discuss how crew time needed for plant cultivation will change in future exploration missions based on choices made for plant species watering systems level of automation and use of virtual assistants among others. Crew time will need to be accounted for as a decisive factor to design future space greenhouse modules.;2021
Cross-lingual dialogue systems are increasingly important in e-commerce and customer service due to the rapid progress of globalization. In real-world system deployment machine translation (MT) services are often used before and after the dialogue system to bridge different languages. However noises and errors introduced in the MT process will result in the dialogue system's low robustness making the system's performance far from satisfactory. In this article we propose a novel MT-oriented noise enhanced framework that exploits multi-granularityMTnoises and injects such noises into the dialogue system to improve the dialogue system's robustness. Specifically we first design a method to automatically construct multi-granularity MT-oriented noises and multi-granularity adversarial examples which contain abundant noise knowledge oriented to MT. Then we propose two strategies to incorporate the noise knowledge: (i) Utterance-level adversarial learning and (ii) Knowledge-level guided method. The former adopts adversarial learning to learn a perturbation-invariant encoder guiding the dialogue system to learn noise-independent hidden representations. The latter explicitly incorporates the multi-granularity noises which contain the noise tokens and their possible correct forms into the training and inference process thus improving the dialogue system's robustness. Experimental results on three dialoguemodels two dialogue datasets and two language pairs have shown that the proposed framework significantly improves the performance of the cross-lingual dialogue system.;2021
Cryptocurrencies are proliferating as instantiations of blockchain which is a transparent distributed ledger technology for validating transactions. Blockchain is thus said to embed trust in its technical design. Yet blockchain's technical promise of trust is not fulfilled when applied to the cryptocurrency ecosystem due to many social challenges stakeholders experience. By investigating a cryptocurrency chatbot (Brokerbot) that distributed information on cryptocurrency news and investments we explored social tensions of trust between stakeholders namely the bot's developers users and the bot itself. We found that trust in Brokerbot and in the cryptocurrency ecosystem are two conjoined but separate challenges that users and developers approached in different ways. We discuss the challenging dual-role of a Brokerbot as an object of trust as a chatbot while simultaneously being a mediator of trust in cryptocurrency which exposes the social-technical gap of trust. Lastly we elaborate on trust as a negotiated social process that people shape and are shaped by through emerging ecologies of interlinked technologies like blockchain and conversational interfaces.;2021
Current formal dialectical models postulate normative rules that enable discussants to conduct dialogical interactions without committing fallacies. Though the rules for conducting a dialogue are supposed to apply to interactions between actual arguers they are without exception theoretically motivated. This creates a gap between model and reality because dialogue participants typically leave important content-related elements implicit. Therefore analysts cannot readily relate normative rules to actual debates in ways that will be empirically confirmable. This paper details a new data-driven method for describing discussants' actual reply structures wherein corpus studies serve to acknowledge the complexity of natural argumentation (itself understood as a function of context). Rather than refer exclusively to propositional content as an indicator of arguing pro/contra a given claim the proposed approach to dialogue structure tracks the sequence of dialogical moves itself. This arguably improves the applicability of theoretical dialectical models to empirical data and thus advances the study of dialogue systems.;2021
Current language processing technologies allow the creation of conversational chatbot platforms. Even though artificial intelligence is still too immature to support satisfactory user experience in many mass market domains conversational interfaces have found their way into ad hoc applications such as call centres and online shopping assistants. However they have not been applied so far to social inclusion of elderly people who are particularly vulnerable to the digital divide. Many of them relieve their loneliness with traditional media such as TV and radio which are known to create a feeling of companionship. In this paper we present the EBER chatbot designed to reduce the digital gap for the elderly. EBER reads news in the background and adapts its responses to the user's mood. Its novelty lies in the concept of intelligent radio according to which instead of simplifying a digital information system to make it accessible to the elderly a traditional channel they find familiar -background news- is augmented with interactions via voice dialogues. We make it possible by combining Artificial Intelligence Modelling Language automatic Natural Language Generation and Sentiment Analysis. The system allows accessing digital content of interest by combining words extracted from user answers to chatbot questions with keywords extracted from the news items. This approach permits defining metrics of the abstraction capabilities of the users depending on a spatial representation of the word space. To prove the suitability of the proposed solution we present results of real experiments conducted with elderly people that provided valuable insights. Our approach was considered satisfactory during the tests and improved the information search capabilities of the participants.;2021
Current technological developments as well as widespread application of artificial intelligence will doubtlessly continue to impact how people live and work. In this research we explored synergies between human workers and AI in managerial tasks. We hypothesized that human-AI collaboration will increase productivity. In the paper several levels of proximity between AI and humans in a work setting are distinguished. The multi-stage study covering the exploratory phase in which we conducted a study of preferences using 10-item Likert scale was conducted with a sample of 366 respondents. The study focused on working with different types of AI. The second and third phase of the study in which we primarily used qualitative methods (scenario-based design combined with semi-structured interviews with six participants) focused on researching modes of collaboration between humans and virtual assistants. The study results generally confirmed our hypothesis about increased productivity due to enhanced human-AI collaboration proving that the future of AI in knowledge work needs to focus not on full automation but rather on collaborative approaches where humans and AI work closely together.;2021
Deep learning is providing very positive results in areas related to conversational interfaces such as speech recognition but its potential benefit for dialog management has still not been fully studied. In this paper we perform an assessment of different configurations for deep-learned dialog management with three dialog corpora from different application domains and varying in size dimensionality and possible system responses. Our results have allowed us to identify several aspects that can have an impact on accuracy including the approaches used for feature extraction input representation context considera-tion and the hyper-parameters of the deep neural networks employed.

Despite its significant effectiveness in adversarial training approaches to multidomain task-oriented dialogue systems adversarial inverse reinforcement learning of the dialogue policy frequently fails to balance the performance of the reward estimator and policy generator. During the optimization process the reward estimator frequently overwhelms the policy generator resulting in excessively uninformative gradients. We propose the variational reward estimator bottleneck (VRB) which is a novel and effective regularization strategy that aims to constrain unproductive information flows between inputs and the reward estimator. The VRB focuses on capturing discriminative features by exploiting information bottleneck on mutual information. Quantitative analysis on a multidomain task-oriented dialogue dataset demonstrates that the VRB significantly outperforms previous studies.;2021
Despite the growing number of brands that rely on chatbots to address customer service inquiries that once required human intervention academics and practitioners are only beginning to acknowledge the role of chatbots in brand-building activities. Chatbots can initiate online conversations thereby often serving as a consumer's first brand impression. However little is known about how managers can strategically tailor a chatbot's initial message to foster consumer-brand connections and ultimately engagement. Three studies demonstrate that when chatbots initiate a conversation using a warm (vs. competent) message brand engagement increases as assessed using both computerized text analysis and traditional scale measures. Brand-self distance mediates this effect such that a warm (vs. competent) initial chatbot message makes consumers feel closer to the brand. Further the authors identify brand affiliation as a theoretically relevant moderator. This research thus offers managers insight into how initial chatbot messages can attract and engage consumers.;2021
Despite the hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) the potential of AI in customer relationship manage-ment (CRM) remains underexplored in academia. A between-subjects experiment examined the effects of the type of relationship (virtual assistantship versus virtual friendship) consumers build with AI-enabled chatbots on brand personality perception parasocial interaction (PSI) and CRM. The main effects of the relationship type on brand personality perception appeared for competent brand personality but not for sincere brand personality. The consumer-chatbot relationship type had effects on CRM-related outcomes (behavioral intention satisfaction and trust) through competent brand personality. Consumers who interacted with a friend chatbot experienced stronger PSI with the chatbot and the relationship type had an influence on brand personality perception through PSI. This mediating effect of PSI was observed for both brand personalities -competence and sincerity. The moderating role of ideological views (technopians versus luddites) in explaining the effect of the relationship type on brand personality perception was detected for sincere brand personality. AI designers and marketers need to develop AI user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) along with marketing strategies that not only can appeal to technopians ready to adopt innovative AI customer representatives but also can ultimately help alle-viate luddites? AI anxiety in the emerging ?feeling economy? envisioned by Rust and Huang.;2021
Developing an intelligent chatbot has evolved in the last few years to become a trending topic in the area of computer science. However a chatbot often fails to understand the user's intent which can lead to the generation of inappropriate responses that cause dialogue breakdown and user dissatisfaction. Detecting the dialogue breakdown is essential to improve the performance of the chatbot and increase user satisfaction. Recent approaches have focused on modeling conversation breakdown using serveral approaches including supervised and unsupervised approaches. Unsupervised approach relay heavy datasets which make it challenging to apply it to the breakdown task. Another challenge facing predicting breakdown in conversation is the bias of human annotation for the dataset and the handling process for the breakdown. To tackle this challenge we have developed a supervised ensemble automated approach that measures Chatbot Quality of Service (CQoS) based on dialogue breakdown. The proposed approach is able to label the datasets based on sentiment considering the context of the conversion to predict the breakdown. In this paper we aim to detect the affect of sentiment change of each speaker in a conversation. Furthermore we use the supervised ensemble model to measure the CQoS based on breakdown. Then we handle this problem by using a hand-over mechanism that transfers the user to a live agent. Based on this idea we perform several experiments across several datasets and state-of-the-art models and we find that using sentiment as a trigger for breakdown outperforms human annotation. Overall we infer that knowledge acquired from the supervised ensemble model can indeed help to measure CQoS based on detecting the breakdown in conversation.;2021
Dialog state tracking (DST) which estimates dialog states given a dialog context is a core component in task-oriented dialog systems. Existing data-driven methods usually extract features automatically through deep learning. However most of these models have limitations. First compared with hand-crafted delexicalization features such features in deep learning approaches are not universal. However they are important for tracking unseen slot values. Second such models do not work well in situations where noisy labels are ubiquitous in datasets. To address these challenges we propose a robust dialog state tracker with contextual-feature augmentation. Contextual-feature augmentation is used to extract generalized features hence it is capable of solving the unseen slot value tracking problem. We apply a simple but effective deep learning paradigm to train our DST model with noisy labels. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art scores in terms of joint accuracy on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset. In addition we show its performance in tracking unseen slot values by simulating unseen domain dialog state tracking.;2021
Dialogue agent a derivative of intelligent agent in the field of computational linguistics is a computer program that is capable of generating responses and performing conversation in natural language. The field of computational linguistics is flourishing due to the intensive growth of dialogue agents the most potential one is providing voice controlled smart personal assistant service for handsets and homes. The agents are usable accessible but perform task-related short conversations. Non-goal-oriented dialogue agents are designed to imitate extended human-human conversations also called as chit-chat to provide the consumer with a satisfactory experience on the conversation quality. The design of such agents is primarily defined by a language model unlike goal-oriented dialogue agents that employees slot based or ontology-based frameworks hence most of the methods are data-driven. This paper surveys the current state of the art of non-goal-oriented dialogue systems specifically data-driven methods the most prevalent being deep learning. This paper aims at (a) providing an insight of recent methods and architectures proposed for building context and modeling response along with a comprehensive review of the state of the art (b) examine the type of data set and evaluation methods available (c) present the challenges and limitation that the recent models dataset and evaluation methods constitute.;2021
Dialogue systems have made massive promising progress contributed by deep learning techniques and have been widely applied in our life. However existing end-to-end neural models suffer from the problem of tending to generate uninformative and generic responses because they cannot ground dialogue context with background knowledge. In order to solve this problem many researchers begin to consider combining external knowledge in dialogue systems namely knowledge-enhanced dialogue systems. The challenges of knowledge-enhanced dialogue systems include how to select the appropriate knowledge from large-scale knowledge bases how to read and understand extracted knowledge and how to integrate knowledge into responses generation process. Combined with external knowledge dialogue systems can deeply understand the dialogue context and generate more informative and logical responses. This survey gives a comprehensive review of knowledge-enhanced dialogue systems summarizes research progress to solve these challenges and proposes some open issues and research directions.

Dialogue systems also known as conversational agents are computing systems that use algorithms for speech and language processing to engage in conversation with humans or other conversation-capable systems. A chatbot is a conversational agent that has as its primary goal to maximize the length of the conversation without any specific targeted task. When a chatbot is embellished with an artistic approach that is meant to evoke an emotional response then it is called a virtual being. On the other hand conversational agents that interact with the physical world require the use of specialized hardware to sense and process captured information. In this article we describe EdgeAvatar a system based on Edge Computing principles for the creation of virtual beings. The objective of the EdgeAvatar system is to provide a streamlined and modular framework for virtual being applications that are to be deployed in public settings. We also present two implementations that use EdgeAvatar and are inspired by historical figures to interact with visitors of the Venice Biennale 2019. EdgeAvatar can adapt to fit different approaches for AI powered conversations.;2021
Different people have different habits of describing their intents in conversations. Some people tend to deliberate their intents in several successive utterances i.e. they use several consistent messages for readability instead of a long sentence to express their question. This creates a predicament faced by the application of dialogue systems especially in real-world industry scenarios in which the dialogue system is unsure whether it should answer the query of user immediately or wait for further supplementary input. Motivated by such an interesting predicament we define a novel Wait-or-Answer task for dialogue systems. We shed light on a new research topic about how the dialogue system can be more intelligent to behave in this Wait-or-Answer quandary. Further we propose a predictive approach named Predict-then-Decide (PTD) to tackle this Wait-or-Answer task. More specifically we take advantage of a decision model to help the dialogue system decide whether to wait or answer. The decision of decision model is made with the assistance of two ancillary prediction models: a user prediction and an agent prediction. The user prediction model tries to predict what the user would supplement and uses its prediction to persuade the decision model that the user has some information to add so the dialogue system should wait. The agent prediction model tries to predict the answer of the dialogue system and convince the decision model that it is a superior choice to answer the query of user immediately since the input of user has come to an end. We conduct our experiments on two real-life scenarios and three public datasets. Experimental results on five datasets show our proposed PTD approach significantly outperforms the existing models in solving this Wait-or-Answer problem.;2021
Digital assistants (DA) perform routine tasks for users by interacting with the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and digital services. To do so such assistants rely heavily on personal data e.g. to provide personalized responses. This leads to privacy concerns for users and makes privacy features an important component of digital assistants. This study examines user preferences for three attributes of the design of privacy features in digital assistants namely (1) the amount of information on personal data that is shown to the user (2) explainability of the DA's decision and (3) the degree of gamification of the user interface (UI). In addition it estimates users' willingness to pay (WTP) for different versions of privacy features. The results for the full sample show that users prefer to understand the rationale behind the DA's decisions based on the personal information involved while being given information about the potential impacts of disclosing specific data. Further the results indicate that users prefer to interact with the DA's privacy features in a serious game. For this product users are willing to pay euro21.39 per month. In general a playful design of privacy features is strongly preferred as users are willing to pay 23.8% more compared to an option without any gamified elements. A detailed analysis identifies two customer clusters Best Agers and DA Advocates which differ mainly in their average age and willingness to pay. Further DA Advocates are mainly male and more privacy sensitive whereas Best Agers show a higher affinity for a playful design of privacy features.;2021
Digital Voice Assistants (DVAs) like Google Home provide automated news media and other content directly into the home. In this article we outline how Google Home's content delivery can support the wellbeing and independence of older people. We argue that automated media provided by DVAs enrols older people in a dialectic relationship with the automated content and feminised conversation they deliver uniquely performed within people's own everyday life circumstances. We demonstrate this by drawing on ethnographic insights generated during a trial of smart home technologies with older Australian households who are 'ageing in place' in regional New South Wales. For most participants the trial was their first encounter with DVAs and the modes of media and content delivery including for music news weather trivia jokes facts and images. While DVAs bring new experiences via content communication and companionship they are also subverted ignored or transformed as people improvise to make them 'fit' within their homes and lives. These dynamics underpin how DVAs automated content delivery and user's interactions can support people's sense of wellness and their independent daily practices at home.;2021
Domain adaptation has recently become a key problem in dialogue systems research. Deep learning while being the preferred technique for modeling such systems works best given massive training data. However in real-world scenarios such resources are rarely available for new domains and the ability to train with a few dialogue examples can be considered essential. Pre-training on large data sources and adapting to the target data has become the standard method for few-shot problems within the deep learning framework. In this paper we present GRTr a hybrid generative-retrieval model based on the large-scale general-purpose language model GPT[2] fine-tuned to the multi-domain MetaLWOz dataset. In addition to robust and diverse response generation provided by the GPT[2] our model is able to estimate generation confidence and is equipped with retrieval logic as a fallback for the cases when the estimate is low. GRTr is the winning entry at the fast domain adaptation task of DSTC-8 in human evaluation (>4% improvement over the 2nd place system). It also attains superior performance to a series of baselines on automated metrics on MetaLWOz and MultiWOZ a multi-domain dataset of goal-oriented dialogues. In this paper we also conduct a study of GRTr's performance in the setup of limited adaptation data evaluating the model's overall response prediction performance on MetaLWOz and goal-oriented performance on MultiWOZ.;2021
Drawing from evolutionary psychology of anthropomorphism and social phobia two between-subjects experiments examined the effects of different types of customer service chatbots. Experiment 1 supports the interaction effects between chatbots' anthropomorphism and con-sumers' social phobia on continuance use intention and willingness to recommend the chatbot. Consumers with high social phobia prefer anthropomorphic chatbots to less anthropomorphic chatbots. Experiment 2 confirms the moderating role of social phobia in determining the effects of consumer-chatbot personality matching (similarity attraction) vs. mismatching (complementarity attraction) on the outcome variables only for competent chatbots. For the consumer-chatbot personality mismatching condition developing competent chatbots for less conscientious con-sumers with high social phobia will help alleviate socially isolated consumers' social pain while developing too smart chatbots for less conscientious consumers with low social phobia can have detrimental effects. Evolutionary psychological mechanisms and managerial implications for chatbot developers and creative directors are explained.;2021
Due to recent DNN advancements many NLP problems can be effectively solved using transformer-based models and supervised data. Unfortunately such data is not available in some languages. This research is based on assumptions that (1) training data can be obtained by the machine translating it from another language (2) there are cross-lingual solutions that work without the training data in the target language. Consequently in this research we use the English dataset and solve the intent detection problem for five target languages (German French Lithuanian Latvian and Portuguese). When seeking the most accurate solutions we investigate BERT-based word and sentence transformers together with eager learning classifiers (CNN BERT fine-tuning FFNN) and lazy learning approach (Cosine similarity as the memory-based method). We offer and evaluate several strategies to overcome the data scarcity problem with machine translation cross-lingual models and a combination of the previous two. The experimental investigation revealed the robustness of sentence transformers under various cross-lingual conditions. The accuracy equal to similar to 0.842 is achieved with the English dataset with completely monolingual models is considered our top-line. However cross-lingual approaches demonstrate similar accuracy levels reaching similar to 0.831 similar to 0.829 similar to 0.853 similar to 0.831 and similar to 0.813 on German French Lithuanian Latvian and Portuguese languages.;2021
Due to the rapid increase in the development of Task-oriented dialogue systems the need for labelled dialogue corpus has become inevitable. For the Hindi language there is no such dialogue corpus yet available. As a first attempt we release a Hindi Dialogue Restaurant Search (HDRS) corpus and compare various state-of-the-art dialogue state tracking (DST) models on it. The corpus consists of 1.4 k human-to-human typed dialogues collected using Wizard-of-Oz paradigm. The paper starts with a brief description of the corpus by providing the details of features corpus collection process and statistical analysis then the performance of baseline NLU and DST models are investigated. Further we experimented two categories of state-of-the-art belief state trackers: (1) Non-contextual pre-trained word embedding based DST models (2) Contextual pre-trained BERT based DST models. All belief trackers follow a three-layered generic architecture. The category-1 models use the static domain ontology while category-2 models have the capability to handle the dynamic ontology. The DST models are compared on joint-goal and turn-request accuracy. Global encoder and Slot-ATtentive decoders (GSAT) outperforms all the models with 83.25% joint-goal accuracy followed by SUMBT.;2021
Each year more than 800000 persons die by suicide making it a leading cause of death worldwide. Recent innovations in information and communication technology may offer new opportunities in suicide prevention in individuals hereby potentially reducing this number. In our project we design digital indices based on both self-reports and passive mobile sensing and test their ability to predict suicidal ideation a major predictor for suicide and psychiatric hospital readmission in high-risk individuals: psychiatric patients after discharge who were admitted in the context of suicidal ideation or a suicidal attempt or expressed suicidal ideations during their intake. Specifically two smartphone applications -one for self-reports (SIMON-SELF) and one for passive mobile sensing (SIMON-SENSE)- are installed on participants' smartphones. SIMON-SELF uses a text-based chatbot called Simon to guide participants along the study protocol and to ask participants questions about suicidal ideation and relevant other psychological variables five times a day. These self-report data are collected for four consecutive weeks after study participants are discharged from the hospital. SIMON-SENSE collects behavioral variables -such as physical activity location and social connectedness- parallel to the first application. We aim to include 100 patients over 12 months to test whether (1) implementation of the digital protocol in such a high-risk population is feasible and (2) if suicidal ideation and psychiatric hospital readmission can be predicted using a combination of psychological indices and passive sensor information. To this end a predictive algorithm for suicidal ideation and psychiatric hospital readmission using various learning algorithms (e.g. random forest and support vector machines) and multilevel models will be constructed. Data collected on the basis of psychological theory and digital phenotyping may in the future and based on our results help reach vulnerable individuals early and provide links to just-in-time and cost-effective interventions or establish prompt mental health service contact. The current effort may thus lead to saving lives and significantly reduce economic impact by decreasing inpatient treatment and days lost to inability.;2021
Education is an area where innovation moves slowly. In this study we will propose a framework with a novel approach that will support the development of a multi-interactive chatbot's system for an educational area using AIML 2.0. The system will facilitate the students for their learning towards an outcome-based education domain. The proposed framework will be composed of a user module which consists of user and user interface chat agents module which will respond to the user query chatbot KB which will act as the brain for the chatbot system and socket system for establishing the communication link. Finally the proposed system will be evaluated using a confusion matrix. The multichatbot communication system will support text-based dialogues on a limited set of questions related to education. However the system will be implemented in java. The outcomes of this research will be useful for the education sector where these intelligent systems will help the students in schools universities and other training scenarios.;2021
Educational chatbots (ECs) are chatbots designed for pedagogical purposes and are viewed as an Internet of Things (IoT) interface that could revolutionize teaching and learning. These chatbots are strategized to provide personalized learning through the concept of a virtual assistant that replicates humanized conversation. Nevertheless in the education paradigm ECs are still novel with challenges in facilitating deploying designing and integrating it as an effective pedagogical tool across multiple fields and one such area is project-based learning. Therefore the present study investigates how integrating ECs to facilitate team-based projects for a design course could influence learning outcomes. Based on a mixed-method quasi-experimental approach ECs were found to improve learning performance and teamwork with a practical impact. Moreover it was found that ECs facilitated collaboration among team members that indirectly influenced their ability to perform as a team. Nevertheless affective-motivational learning outcomes such as perception of learning need for cognition motivation and creative self-efficacy were not influenced by ECs. Henceforth this study aims to add to the current body of knowledge on the design and development of EC by introducing a new collective design strategy and its pedagogical and practical implications.;2021
Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) could engage users in eHealth by building mutual understanding (i.e. rapport) via emotional expressions. We compared an ECA's emotions expressed in text with an ECA's emotions in facial expressions on users' perceptions of rapport. We used a 2 x 2 design combining a happy or neutral facial expression with a happy or neutral textual expression. Sixty-three participants (mean 48 +/- 22 years) had a dialogue with an ECA on healthy living and rated multiple rapport items. Results show that participants' perceived rapport for an ECA with a happy facial expression and neutral textual expression and an ECA with a neutral facial expression and happy textual expression was significantly higher than the neutral value of the rapport scale (P = 0.049 and P = 0.008 respectively). Furthermore results show no significant difference in overall rapport between the conditions (P = 0.062) but a happy textual expression for an ECA with a neutral facial expression shows higher ratings of the individual rapport items helpfulness (P = 0.019) and enjoyableness (P = 0.028). Future research should investigate users' rapport towards an ECA with different emotions in long-term interaction and how a user's age and personality and an ECA's animations affect rapport building. Optimizing rapport building between a user and an ECA could contribute to achieving long-term interaction with eHealth.;2021
Embodied conversational agents are often included in health behaviour change applications as intelligent virtual coaches. A major challenge in their development is tailoring coaching dialogues to user profiles. Agents should collect information about the user and consequently adapt the strategy that guides their interactions. Previous research discovered relations between users' motivation profiles and potential effective coaching strategies. In the current paper we describe an experiment with multiple agents that tests if users with certain motivation profiles prefer certain (tailored) strategies. Participants were classified into four motivation groups (Intrinsic Motivation External Regulation Dual Motivation A-motivation) following their responses to a questionnaire on motivation towards healthy living. Then two coaches suggested a positively and a negatively tailored strategy. Participants rated these and chose their favourite. Results (N = 108) show that the Dual Motivation group appreciated their positively tailored strategy more than their negatively tailored strategy while intrinsically motivated participants appreciated both strategies. Furthermore agents' likeability does not seem to influence strategy appreciation while there was an effect of participant's age and gender. We conclude that coaching strategies for dialogues with agents can be tailored to personal motivation to live healthy. Future research should focus on performing a long-term study in a real-life setting.;2021
Embodied Virtual Agents (EVAs) are used today as interfaces for social robots educational tutors game counterparts medical assistants as well as companions for the elderly and individuals with psychological or behavioral conditions. Forming a reliable and trustworthy interaction is critical to the success and acceptability of this new form of interaction. In this paper we report on a study investigating how trust is influenced by the cooperativeness of an EVA as well as an individuals prior experience with other agents. Participants answered two sets of multiple choice questions working with a different agent in each set. Two types of agent behaviors were possible: Cooperative and Uncooperative. In addition to participants achieving significantly higher performance and having higher trust for the cooperative agent we found that participants' trust for the cooperative agent was significantly higher if they interacted with an uncooperative agent in one of the sets compared to working with cooperative agents in both sets. Furthermore we found that participants may still decide to choose agent's suggested answer (which can be incorrect) over theirs even if they are fairly certain their own answer is the correct one. The results suggest that trust for an EVA is relative and it is dependent on user's history of interaction with different agents in addition to current agent's behavior. The findings provide insight into important considerations for creating trustworthy EVAs.;2021
Emotion recognition in conversations is an important step in various virtual chatbots which require opinion-based feedback like in social media threads online support and many more applications. Current emotion recognition in conversations models face issues like: (a) loss of contextual information in between two dialogues of a conversation (b) failure to give appropriate importance to significant tokens in each utterance (c) inability to pass on the emotional information from previous utterances. The proposed model of Advanced Contextual Feature Extraction (AdCOFE) addresses these issues by performing unique feature extraction using knowledge graphs sentiment lexicons and phrases of natural language at all levels (word and position embedding) of the utterances. Experiments on emotion recognition in conversations datasets show that AdCOFE is beneficial in capturing emotions in conversations.;2021
End-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems which provide a natural and informative way for human- computer interaction are gaining more and more attention. The main challenge of such dialogue systems is how to effectively incorporate external knowledge bases into the learning framework. However existing approaches usually overlook the natural graph structure information in the knowledge base and the relevant information between the knowledge base and the dialogue history which makes them deficient in handling the above challenge. Besides existing methods ignore the entity imbalance problem and treat different entities in system responses indiscriminately which limits the learning of hard target entities. To address the two challenges we propose Heterogeneous Relational Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Objective (HRGNN-AO) for end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems. In the method we explore effective heterogeneous relational graphs to jointly capture multi perspective graph structure information from the knowledge base and the dialogue history which ultimately facilitates the generation of informative responses. Moreover we design two components shared-private parameterization and hierarchical attention mechanism to solve the overfitting and confusion problems in the heterogeneous relational graph respectively. To handle the entity imbalance problem we propose an adaptive objective which dynamically adjusts the weights of different target entities during the training process. The experimental results show that HRGNN-AO is effective in generating informative responses and outperforms state-of-the-art dialogue systems on the SMD and extended Multi-WOZ 2.1 datasets.

Evolutionary optimization aims to tune the hyper-parameters during learning in a computationally fast manner. For optimization of multi-task problems evolution is done by creating a unified search space with a dimensionality that can include all the tasks. Multi-task evolution is achieved via selective imitation where two individuals with the same type of skill are encouraged to crossover. Due to the relatedness of the tasks the resulting offspring may have a skill for a different task. In this way we can simultaneously evolve a population where different individuals excel in different tasks. In this paper we consider a type of evolution called Genetic Programming (GP) where the population of genes have a tree-like structure and can be of different lengths and hence can naturally represent multiple tasks. We apply the model to multi-task neuroevolution that aims to determine the optimal hyper-parameters of a neural network such as number of nodes learning rate and number of training epochs using evolution. Here each gene is encoded with the hyper parameters for a single neural network. Previously optimization was done by enabling or disabling individual connections between neurons during evolution. This method is extremely slow and does not generalize well to new neural architectures such as Seq2Seq. To overcome this limitation we follow a modular approach where each sub-tree in a GP can be a sub-neural architecture that is preserved during crossover across multiple tasks. Lastly in order to leverage on the inter-task covariance for faster evolutionary search we project the features from both tasks to common space using fuzzy membership functions. The proposed model is used to determine the optimal topology of a feed-forward neural network for classification of emotions in physiological heart signals and also a Seq2seq chatbot that can converse with kindergarten children. We can outperform baselines by over 10% in accuracy.;2021
Existing multi-turn context-response matching methods mainly concentrate on obtaining multi-level and multi-dimension representations and better interactions between context utterances and response. However in real-place conversation scenarios whether a response candidate is suitable not only counts on the given dialogue context but also other backgrounds e.g. wording habits user-specific dialogue history content. To fill the gap between these up-to-date methods and the real-world applications we incorporate user-specific dialogue history into the response selection and propose a personalized hybrid matching network (PHMN). Our contributions are two-fold: (1) our model extracts personalized wording behaviors from user-specific dialogue history as extra matching information (2) we perform hybrid representation learning on context-response utterances and explicitly incorporate a customized attention mechanism to extract vital information from context-response interactions so as to improve the accuracy of matching. We evaluate our model on two large datasets with user identification i.e. personalized Ubuntu dialogue Corpus (P-Ubuntu) and personalized Weibo dataset (P-Weibo). Experimental results confirm that our method significantly outperforms several strong models by combining personalized attention wording behaviors and hybrid representation learning.;2021
Expressive text-to-speech (E-TTS) synthesis is important for enhancing user experience in communication with machines using the speech modality. However one of the challenges in E-TTS is the lack of a precise description of emotions. Previous categorical specifications may be insufficient for describing complex emotions. The dimensional specifications face the difficulty of ambiguity in annotation. This work advocates a new approach of describing emotive speech acoustics using spoken exemplars. We investigate methods to extract emotion descriptions from the input exemplar of emotive speech. The measures are combined to form two descriptors based on capsule network (CapNet) and residual error network (RENet). The first is designed to consider the spatial information in the input exemplary spectrogram and the latter is to capture the contrastive information between emotive acoustic expressions. Two different approaches are applied for conversion from the variable-length feature sequence to fixed-size description vector: (1) dynamic routing groups similar capsules to the output description and (2) recurrent neural network's hidden states store the temporal information for the description. The two descriptors are integrated to a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence architecture to obtain an end-to-end architecture that is optimized as a whole towards the same goal of generating correct emotive speech. Experimental results on a public audiobook dataset demonstrate that the two exemplar-based approaches achieve significant performance improvement over the baseline system in both emotion similarity and speech quality.;2021
Facility management platforms are widely used in the facility maintenance phase of the building life cycle. However a large amount of complex building information affects facility managers' efficiency and user experience in retrieving specific information on the facility management platform. Therefore this research aims to develop a conversation-based method to improve the efficiency and user experience of facility management information delivery. The proposed method contains four major modules: decision mechanism equipment dataset intent analysis and knowledge base. A chatbot prototype was developed based on the proposed method. The prototype was then validated through a feasibility test and field test at the Shulin Arts Comprehensive Administration Building in Taiwan. The results showed that the proposed method changes the traditional information delivery between users and the facility management platform. By integrating natural language processing (NLP) building information modelling (BIM) and ontological techniques the proposed method can increase the efficiency of FM information retrieval.;2021
Featured Application Automatic speech recognition chatbot voice-assisted control multimodal man-machine interaction systems. Speech recognition consists of converting input sound into a sequence of phonemes then finding text for the input using language models. Therefore phoneme classification performance is a critical factor for the successful implementation of a speech recognition system. However correctly distinguishing phonemes with similar characteristics is still a challenging problem even for state-of-the-art classification methods and the classification errors are hard to be recovered in the subsequent language processing steps. This paper proposes a hierarchical phoneme clustering method to exploit more suitable recognition models to different phonemes. The phonemes of the TIMIT database are carefully analyzed using a confusion matrix from a baseline speech recognition model. Using automatic phoneme clustering results a set of phoneme classification models optimized for the generated phoneme groups is constructed and integrated into a hierarchical phoneme classification method. According to the results of a number of phoneme classification experiments the proposed hierarchical phoneme group models improved performance over the baseline by 3% 2.1% 6.0% and 2.2% for fricative affricate stop and nasal sounds respectively. The average accuracy was 69.5% and 71.7% for the baseline and proposed hierarchical models showing a 2.2% overall improvement.;2021
Featured Application Increase vaccination motivation self-efficacy and vaccination behavioral intention by using Child Vaccination Chatbot. The decreased rate of children's vaccination has resulted in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccination hesitancy is being brought about by the uncertainty caused by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. With this study we aimed to assess the efficacy of a child vaccination chatbot based on changes in variables such as vaccination information motivation self-efficacy and vaccination behavioral intention. From 30 January to 15 February 2020 65 parents raising children <= 35 months old who were expected to be vaccinated within three months participated in the trial through online recruitment. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 34) or the control group (n = 31) and were followed up with over a period of 12 weeks. During this period both groups of participants were provided with vaccination schedule reminders. The experimental group were additionally provided with vaccination-related information and motivation boosters by a chatbot (real-time consultation messenger service) the control group was provided the same information by brochure. Comparing both groups the experimental group that used the chatbot scored higher on vaccination information motivation self-efficacy and vaccination behavioral intention than the control group. This suggests that the chatbot provided useful and timely information to parents increasing vaccination motivation self-efficacy and vaccination rates. This study provides evidence that chatbots are useful tools to encourage immunization through the provision of reminders and real-time consultation messenger services during the global health crisis and beyond.;2021
Featured Application Natural language dialogue macro-navigation for the visually impaired. The proposed technology can be applied to other professional fields such as medical consultation or legal services. Dialogue in natural language is the most important communication method for the visually impaired. Therefore the dialogue system is the main subsystem in the visually impaired navigation system. The purpose of the dialogue system is to understand the user's intention gradually establish context through multiple conversations and finally provide an accurate destination for the navigation system. We use the knowledge graph as the basis of reasoning in the dialogue system and then update the knowledge graph so that the system gradually conforms to the user's background. Based on the experience of using the knowledge graph in the navigation system of the visually impaired we expect that the same framework can be applied to more fields in order to improve the practicality of natural language dialogue in human-computer interaction.;2021
For conversational agents' speech either all possible sentences have to be prerecorded by voice actors or the required utterances can be synthesized. While synthesizing speech is more flexible and economic in production it also potentially reduces the perceived naturalness of the agents among others due to mistakes at various linguistic levels. In our article we are interested in the impact of adequate and inadequate prosody here particularly in terms of accent placement on the perceived naturalness and aliveness of the agents. We compare (1) inadequate prosody as generated by off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) engines with synthetic output (2) the same inadequate prosody imitated by trained human speakers and (3) adequate prosody produced by those speakers. The speech was presented either as audio-only or by embodied anthropomorphic agents to investigate the potential masking effect by a simultaneous visual representation of those virtual agents. To this end we conducted an online study with 40 participants listening to four different dialogues each presented in the three Speech levels and the two Embodiment levels. Results confirmed that adequate prosody in human speech is perceived as more natural (and the agents are perceived as more alive) than inadequate prosody in both human (2) and synthetic speech (1). Thus it is not sufficient to just use a human voice for an agents' speech to be perceived as natural-it is decisive whether the prosodic realisation is adequate or not. Furthermore and surprisingly we found no masking effect by speaker embodiment since neither a human voice with inadequate prosody nor a synthetic voice was judged as more natural when a virtual agent was visible compared to the audio-only condition. On the contrary the human voice was even judged as less alive when accompanied by a virtual agent. In sum our results emphasize on the one hand the importance of adequate prosody for perceived naturalness especially in terms of accents being placed on important words in the phrase while showing on the other hand that the embodiment of virtual agents plays a minor role in the naturalness ratings of voices.;2021
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is an important resource that helps accelerate the development of the country's economy add substantial funding to growth and facilitate technology transfer. Republic of Korea (ROK) is one of the world's developed countries with dynamic economy advanced science and technology. In recent years the Korean government has continuously formulated tax policies policies to support the business economy and import policies to support foreign businesses in Korea. The Pangyo Valley Creative Economy Valley is being groomed as a global startup hub in Asia. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in foreign countries are increasingly interested and eager to seek investment opportunities in the Korean market. Nonetheless for these companies language barriers and cultural and institutional differences make it more difficult and time-consuming to learn about the Korean market (such as investment trends laws visa policies taxes and business establishment issues in Korea etc.). In this study we explored the process of searching information and seeking investment opportunities and built a business consulting and support application in the first stages of starting a business in ROK to increase effectiveness and save time which is also an innovative business practice in Use-case ROK. We designed our Virtual Assistant system that can crawl and analyze data on foreign investments in ROK from open data resource websites (data.co.kr) and used analytic and aggregation techniques to explore trends in investments of foreign enterprises. We also researched the process of searching information and seeking investment opportunities for SMEs when investing in ROK government support policies laws and taxes as well as a number of other related issues. We built datasets and used Natural Language Processing (NLP) together with Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to build chatbot applications. Friendly framework for new developers to add and build up the dataset of AI Assistant is built by providing input intent data function input Entity data function input utterance data function as well as training and test function. In addition we built a web-app connected to the server to visualize all the results of research so that SMEs owners can easily use and look for information on investments. Based on the research results we can make recommendations to SMEs in keeping with the changing investment trends in ROK.;2021
Foreign language anxiety (FLA) has been a perennial concern in language learning as foreign language (FL) learners often communicate feelings of anxiety stress or nervousness. This study explored the role of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in speaking practice for FLA management of 48 undergraduate participants in an EFL class in Egypt. An eight-week quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design examined learner anxiety levels using a 33-item FLA questionnaire. Their oral proficiency was assessed via roleplaying using an interaction-enhanced public version of the IELTS speaking evaluation rubric. The results confirmed that FL learners experienced FLA pre- and post-intervention. The identified anxiety levels played a facilitative role in FL learning with several ensuing gains. The use of conversationally enhanced AI chatbots in interactive activities slightly intensified learners' FLA thus meriting further investigation of these objectives. Overall subject to further development AI chatbots are promising for significantly improving linguistic output gains however this study found that learners' speech-related anxieties were not reduced following the interactions with the chatbots. It is concluded that FLA plays an underexplored facilitative role in sharpening learner cognitive faculties and linguistic capacities. Moreover AI chatbots may be beneficial in advancing FL learning with significant potential in EFL contexts facilitating improved interaction and oral communication. These findings support the integration of AI technologies as effective tools in FL education providing flexible interactive and learner-centred learning. This study is expected to be of considerable interest to FL educators and learners.;2021
Forms of artificial intelligence (AI) such as chatbots that provide automated online counselling promise to revolutionise alcohol and other drug treatment. Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect chatbots for 'narrow AI' tasks (e.g. assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues we draw on the concept of technological 'affordances' and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n = 20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n = 8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a 'human' element which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor and they viewed this as constraining care. However clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks such as screening triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as 'more-than-human' care our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential 'addiction futures' and care trajectories that AI technologies offer focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy and the design of digital healthcare.;2021
From fact-checking chatbots to community-maintained misinformation databases Taiwan has emerged as a critical casestudy for citizen participation in politics online. Due to Taiwan's geopolitical history with China the recent 2020 Taiwanese Presidential Election brought fierce levels of online engagement led by citizens from both sides of the strait. In this article we study misinformation and digital participation on three platforms namely Line Twitter and Taiwan's Professional Technology Temple (PTT Taiwan's equivalent of Reddit). Each of these platforms presents a different facet of the elections. Results reveal that the greatest level of disagreement occurs in discussion about incumbent president Tsai. Chinese users demonstrate emergent coordination and selective discussion around topics like China Hong Kong and President Tsai whereas topics like Covid-19 are avoided. We discover an imbalance of the political presence of Tsai on Twitter which suggests partisan practices in disinformation regulation. The cases of Taiwan and China point toward a growing trend where regular citizens enabled by new media can both exacerbate and hinder the flow of misinformation. The study highlights an overlooked aspect of misinformation studies beyond the veracity of information itself that is the clash of ideologies practices and cultural history that matter to democratic ideals.;2021
Generating emotional responses plays an important role in human-computer conversational system. Adopting emotional information to the generation process improves user's satisfaction and makes the generated responses more human-like. Furthermore using fixed and unrelated emotion dictionary limits the overall performance of recent models. In order to generate and utilize the emotional words related to our datasets and sensitive to semantic importance we propose a dynamic emotion dictionary module to generate a proper emotional expression. Considering the response sometimes focuses on the certain words of the input text we also introduce dual-copying mechanism for taking advantages of not only emotion dictionary but also words appearing in the input text. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms strong alternatives in several metrics e.g. BLEU embedding similarity Rouge-L and the quality of human evaluation.

Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) has been successfully introduced to unconditional generating text to alleviate exposure bias. However the discriminator in this model only evaluates the entire sequence which causes feedback sparsity and mode collapse. To tackle these problems we propose a novel mechanism. The mechanism first segments the entire sequence into several subsequences. Then these subsequences together with the entire sequence are evaluated individually by the discriminator. Finally these feedback signals are all used to guide the learning of GAN. This mechanism learns the generation of both the entire sequence and the subsequences simultaneously. Learning to generate subsequences is easy and is helpful in generating an entire sequence. It is easy to improve the existing GAN-based models with this mechanism. Although Li et al. (2017) segments the generated responses in a conditional text generation task i.e. a dialogue system they conclude it is weaker than the Monte Carlo search. However for unconditional text generation we observe that adversarial learning on subsequences works well. We rebuild three previous models with our mechanism and the experimental results on two benchmark datasets show these models are improved greatly and outperform the state-of-the-art model.

Guided by the Conceptual Model of Implementation Research we explored the acceptability appropriateness and feasibility of: (1) automated screening approaches utilizing existing health data to identify those who require subsequent diagnostic evaluation for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and (2) family communication methods including chatbots and direct contact to communicate information about inherited risk for FH. Focus groups were conducted with 22 individuals with FH (2 groups) and 20 clinicians (3 groups). These were recorded transcribed and analyzed using deductive (coded to implementation outcomes) and inductive (themes based on focus group discussions) methods. All stakeholders described these initiatives as: (1) acceptable and appropriate to identify individuals with FH and communicate risk with at-risk relatives and (2) feasible to implement in current practice. Stakeholders cited current initiatives outside of FH (e.g. pneumonia protocols colon cancer and breast cancer screenings) that gave them confidence for successful implementation. Stakeholders described perceived obstacles such as nonfamiliarity with FH that could hinder implementation and potential solutions to improve systematic uptake of these initiatives. Automated health data screening chatbots and direct contact approaches may be useful for patients and clinicians to improve FH diagnosis and cascade screening.;2021
Health organizations have relied heavily on social distancing to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this research is to examine what factors can influence customers' evaluations of social distancing as well as how and when these evaluations drive their usage of chatbot services. Using structural equation modeling to analyze the experimental data from 200 U.S. consumers we found that when the service situation is utilitarian (hedonic) in nature customers' contamination fear influences their chatbot usage during service encounters through their social distancing attitudes (subjective norms) and then perceived usefulness of chatbots. Our findings provide meaningful theoretical contributions and practical implications.;2021
Health systems face major challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic with new information and challenges emerging daily and frequently changing guidelines. Online forward triage tools (OFTTs) provide useful information direct patients and free physician resources. We implemented an OFTT targeted at the current pandemic adapted the content and goals and assessed its effects. The OFTT was implemented on 2 March 2020 and modified regularly based on the revised testing criteria issued by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. After testing criteria liberalised a chatbot tool was set up on 9 April 2020 to assess urgency of testing referral to available testing sites and need for emergency care. In the first 40 days of the OFTT there were more than 17 300 visitors and 69.8% indicated they would have contacted the healthcare system if the online test had not been available. During the initial week of operation using the conservative testing strategy 9.1% of visitors received recommendations to be tested which increased to 36.0% of visitors after a change in testing criteria on 9 March 2020. Overall since the implementation of the tool 26.27% of all users of the site have been directed to obtain testing. The Chatbot tool has had approximately 50 consults/day. Setting up an OFTT should be considered as part of local strategies to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. It may ease the burden on the healthcare system reassure patients and inform authorities. To account for the dynamic development of the pandemic frequent adaptation of the tool is of great importance. Further research on clinical outcomes of OFTT is urgently needed.;2021
Healthcare innovations are increasingly becoming reliant on high variety and standards-compliant (e.g. HIPAA common data model) distributed data sets that enable predictive analytics. Consequently health information systems need to be developed using cooperation and distributed trust principles to allow protected data sharing between multiple domains or entities (e.g. health data service providers hospitals and research labs). In this paper we present a novel health information sharing system viz. HonestChain that uses Blockchain technology to allow organizations to have incentive-based and trustworthy cooperation to either access or provide protected healthcare records. More specifically we use a consortium Blockchain approach coupled with chatbot guided interfaces that allow data requesters to: (a) comply with data access standards and (b) allow them to gain reputation in a consortium. We also propose a reputation scheme for creation and sustenance of the consortium with peers using Requester Reputation and Provider Reputation metrics. We evaluate HonestChain using Hyperledger Composer in a realistic simulation testbed on a public cloud infrastructure. Our results show that our HonestChain performs better than the state-of-the-art requester reputation schemes for data request handling while choosing the most appropriate provider peers. We particularly show that HonestChain achieves a better tradeoff in metrics such as service time and request resubmission rate. Additionally we also demonstrate the scalability of our consortium platform in terms of the Blockchain transaction times.;2021
How students experience educational environments and the interconnections between their readiness task experiences and their long-term desire to reengage with course content are critical questions for educators. Research postgraduate students (n = 310) at a research-intensive university in Hong Kong engaging in a 24-h introductory teaching course participated in this study. Learner readiness for the course was assessed as prior Domain interest self-efficacy and knowledge. Subsequently students completed four formative assessments reported their on-task interest in seven strategically chosen tasks and end-of-course Course and Domain interest. Longitudinal-SEM tested interconnections between readiness components Task Course and Domain interest. Initial self-efficacy beliefs for teaching predicted early Task interest while Domain interest was a predictor of Task interest in explicitly practical task experiences. Strong interconnections between Task interest across the study were evident. Individual written and social discussion tasks presented strong contributions to future Course/Domain interest. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.;2021
Human relationships are influenced by the underlying emotions in their interactions. With the increasing use of social networks relationships from textual data can also be inferred from online interactions. Such interactions result in massive amount of textual data which is available in the form of text messages emails and social media posts. Identification and analysis of human relationships are useful for numerous applications ranging from cybersecurity to public health. In this paper we present a method called RIEA (Relationship Identification using Emotion Analysis) for identifying relationships between multiple intelligent agents by analyzing the conversation between them. The objective of our work is to combine concepts of cognitive psychology and natural language processing (NLP) to extract emotions and map them onto a set of relationships and analyze how relationships transform over time. We employ psychological models to label a large corpus of conversations and apply machine learning techniques to determine emotion-to-relationship mapping. We use four distinct association classes and four attachment styles using best-worst scaling method for classification. Combining the attachment and association styles given in research literature gives us the relationship combinations for our analysis. Additionally this work studies the most common changes of behaviors and emotions and the corresponding transformations in human relationships. Our results show that RIEA can correctly detect interpersonal relationships with an accuracy of 85%. The evaluation shows that RIEA can accurately identify interpersonal relationships from conversations and can be extended for identifying more complex relationships. This study also highlights the effect of changes in emotional behavior in the development of relationships over time.;2021
Humans and machines harmoniously collaborating and benefiting from each other is a long lasting dream for researchers in robotics and artificial intelligence. An important feature of efficient and rewarding cooperation is the ability to assume possible problematic situations and act in advance to prevent negative outcomes. This concept of assistance is known under the term proactivity. In this article we investigate the development and implementation of proactive dialogues for fostering a trustworthy human-computer relationship and providing adequate and timely assistance. Here we make several contributions. A formalisation of proactive dialogue in conversational assistants is provided. The formalisation forms a framework for integrating proactive dialogue in conversational applications. Additionally we present a study showing the relations between proactive dialogue actions and several aspects of the perceived trustworthiness of a system as well as effects on the user experience. The results of the experiments provide significant contributions to the line of proactive dialogue research. Particularly we provide insights on the effects of proactive dialogue on the human-computer trust relationship and dependencies between proactive dialogue and user specific and situational characteristics.;2021
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is known as the heart of various energy storage and conversation systems of renewable energy sources. Here we observe the cluster reactions of a light transition metal vanadium with water in a gas-phase flow tube reactor. While HER products of V-1 and V-2 were not observed the effective HER of water on neutral V-n (n >= 3) clusters reveals reasonable and size-dependent reactivity of the vanadium clusters. Superatomic features and reaction dynamics of V-10 V-13 and V-16 are highlighted. Among the three typical superatoms V-10 and V-16 exhibit an abnormal superatomic orbital energy level order 1S vertical bar 2S vertical bar 1P vertical bar 1D... where the energy-reduced 2S orbital helps to accommodate the geometric structure and hence reinforce the cluster stability. In comparison V-13 bears a less symmetrical structure and reacts readily with water allowing for recombination of a hydroxyl atom with an adsorbed hydrogen atom akin to a fishing-mode HER process. The joint experimental and theoretical study on neutral Vn clusters clarifies the availability of superatom chemistry for transition metals and appeals further development of cluster theory based on electronic cloud/orbital analysis instead of simply counting the valence electrons. Also we provide insights into the HER mechanism of metal clusters and propose a strategy to design new materials for portable fuel cells of hydrogen energy.;2021
Hypertension is a chronic condition that can lead to serious health problems. Patients with High Blood Pressure (HBP) are often asked to have their BP checked at home. The traditional at-home procedure has some drawbacks such as forgetting to check or write down the values errors in transcribing the numbers or the impossibility of immediately notifying medical staff of out-of-range BP values. To facilitate self-measurements by patients at home we devised TensioBot a Telegram based chatbot. The bot sends patients reminders to check their BP advice on good monitoring practices measurement tracking medical alerts and allows healthcare professionals to access up-to-date measurement information. TensioBot has been tested for two years in a randomized controlled trial with 112 patients (55 using the bot and 57 in the control group). We found that although the bot group showed similar results in terms of adherence to the BP checking schedule bot users scored better in terms of knowledge and skills on BP checking best practices. Participants rated the bot very positively perceived it as useful and easy to use and continued to use it after the intervention. Moreover all data being equal we describe some other benefits of using a chatbot for self-managed in-house BP control both for patients and healthcare professionals and systems.;2021
Importance: Healthy nutrition and appropriate supplementation during preconception have important implications for the health of the mother and newborn. The best way to deliver preconception care to address health risks related to nutrition is unknown. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial designed to study the impact of conversational agent technology in 13 domains of preconception care among 528 non-pregnant African American and Black women. This analysis is restricted to those 480 women who reported at least one of the ten risks related to nutrition and dietary supplement use. Interventions: An online conversational agent called Gabby assesses health risks and delivers 12 months of tailored dialogue for over 100 preconception health risks including ten nutrition and supplement risks using behavioral change techniques like shared decision making and motivational interviewing. The control group received a letter listing their preconception risks and encouraging them to talk to a health care provider. Results: After 6 months women using Gabby (a) reported progressing forward on the stage of change scale for on average 52.9% (SD 35.1%) of nutrition and supplement risks compared to 42.9% (SD 35.4) in the control group (IRR 1.22 95% CI 1.03-1.45 P = 0.019) and (b) reported achieving the action and maintenance stage of change for on average 52.8% (SD 37.1) of the nutrition and supplement risks compared to 42.8% (SD 37.9) in the control group (IRR 1.26 96% CI 1.08-1.48 P = 0.004). For subjects beginning the study at the contemplation stage of change intervention subjects reported progressing forward on the stage of change scale for 75.0% (SD 36.3%) of their health risks compared to 52.1% (SD 47.1%) in the control group (P = 0.006). Conclusion: The scalability of Gabby has the potential to improve women's nutritional health as an adjunct to clinical care or at the population health level. Further studies are needed to determine if improving nutrition and supplement risks can impact clinical outcomes including optimization ofweight.

Improving the well-being and quality of life of the elderly population is closely related to assisting them to effectively manage age-related conditions such as chronic illnesses and anxiety and to maintain their independence and self-sufficiency as much as possible. This paper presents the design architecture and implementation structure of an adaptive system for monitoring the health and well-being of the elderly. The system was designed following best practices of the Human-Centred Design approach involving representative end-users from the early stages.;2021
In an open-domain conversation system maintaining consistent persona is a key factor to earn trust from users and engage users in the conversation. Existing methods suffer from the issue that only sparse persona-relevant signals are available in the target responses leading to the generation of responses with inconsistent persona. To address the issue in this paper we propose two methods to augment persona learning signals for persona preservation. At the sentence level we develop a dual variational learning model based on the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (i.e. BERT) which enriches persona signals with relevant persona sentences in addition to target responses. Therefore both the encoder part and the latent variable can be guided to learn consistent persona features through back-propagation of losses which will drive response decoding towards consistent persona expression. At the word level we propose a persona-based calibration network which is used to amplify the influence of persona-relevant words in target responses. The experimental results show that our developed model outperforms the strong baseline algorithms by large margins and effectively promotes persona consistency in conversation generation.

In an open-domain dialogue system recognition and expression of emotions are the key factors for success. Most of the existing research related to Chinese dialogue systems aims at improving the quality of content but ignores the expression of human emotions. In this article we propose a Chinese emotional dialogue response generation algorithm based on reinforcement learning that can generate responses not only according to content but also according to emotion. In the proposed method a multi-emotion classification model is first used to add emotion labels to the corpus of post-response pairs. Then with the help of reinforcement learning the reward function is constructed based on two aspects namely emotion and content. Among the generated candidates the system selects the one with long-term success as the best reply. At the same time to avoid safe responses and diversify dialogue a diversity beam search algorithm is applied in the decoding process. The comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves satisfactory results according to both automatic and human evaluations.;2021
In aspect of the natural language processing field previous studies have generally analyzed sound signals and provided related responses. However in various conversation scenarios image information is still vital. Without the image information misunderstanding may occur and lead to wrong responses. In order to address this problem this study proposes a recurrent neural network (RNNs) based multi-sensor context-aware chatbot technology. The proposed chatbot model incorporates image information with sound signals and gives appropriate responses to the user. In order to improve the performance of the proposed model the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure is replaced by gated recurrent unit (GRU). Moreover a VGG16 model is also chosen for a feature extractor for the image information. The experimental results demonstrate that the integrative technology of sound and image information which are obtained by the image sensor and sound sensor in a companion robot is helpful for the chatbot model proposed in this study. The feasibility of the proposed technology was also confirmed in the experiment.;2021
In human-chatbot interaction users casually and regularly offend and abuse the chatbot they are interacting with. The current paper explores the relationship between chatbot humanlikeness on the one hand and sexual advances and verbal aggression by the user on the other hand. 283 conversations between the Cleverbot chatbot and its users were harvested and analysed. Our results showed higher counts of user verbal aggression and sexual comments towards Cleverbot when Cleverbot appeared more humanlike in its behaviour. Caution is warranted with the interpretation of the results however as no experimental manipulation was conducted and causality can thus not be inferred. Nonetheless the findings are relevant for both the research on the abuse of conversational agents and the development of efficient approaches to discourage or prevent verbal aggression by chatbot users.;2021
In March 2016 Microsoft launched Tay.AI a chatbot designed to experiment with conversational understanding through direct engagement with social media users. Marketed as the digital representation of an 18-24-year-old cis-gendered female Tay.ai was meant to be chatty personable friendly and innocuous. Hours into launch however the chatbot's mimetic programming structure was taken advantage of by organized groups of online social media users and Tay.ai began replying to queries with alt-right and neo-Nazi ideology. In this article I explore the role that Tay.ai's assigned gender and race played in influencing both Tay.ai's initial design and subsequently the program's monstrous evolution. This is achieved through three avenues of thought. First I situate Tay within the new public of Web 2.0 a space reliant on user participation and beholden to the neoliberal racialized and gendered architectures that produce it. I then consider Tay as an evolution of the chatbot arguing that Tay is emblematic of both race and gender as social technologies. Third I explore Tay's aberration from programmatic protocols in the context of the monstrous and the abject suggesting that digital nonhuman ambivalence to programming and encoded control presents a space of productive creativity.;2021
In multi-turn dialogue generation dialogue contexts have been shown to have an important influence on the reasoning of the next round of dialogue. A multi-turn dialogue between two people should be able to give a reasonable response according to the relevant context. However the widely used hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder model and the latest model that detecting the relevant contexts with self-attention are facing the same problem. Their given response doesn't match the identity of the current speaker which we call it role ambiguity. In this paper we propose a new model named RoRePo to tackle this problem by detecting the role information and relative position information. Firstly as a part of the decoder input we add a role embedding to identity different speakers. Secondly we incorporate self-attention mechanism with relative position representation to dialogue context understanding. Besides the design of our model architecture considers the influence of latent variables in generating more diverse responses. Experimental results of our evaluations on the DailyDialog and DSTC7 AVSD datasets show that our proposed model advances in multi-turn dialogue generation.;2021
In online social networks (OSNs) socialbots are responsible for various malicious activities and they are mainly programmed to imitate human-behavior to bypass the existing detection systems. The socialbots are generally successful in their malicious intent due to the existence of OSN users who follow them and thereby increase their reputation in the network. Analysis of the socialbot networks and their users is vital to comprehend the socialbot problem from target users' perspective. In this paper we present a machine learning-based approach for characterizing and detecting socialbot targets i.e. users who are susceptible to be trapped by the socialbots. We model OSN users based on their identity and behavior information representing the static and dynamic components of their personality. The proposed approach classifies socialbot targets into three categories viz. active reactive and inactive users. We evaluate the proposed approach using three classifiers over a dataset collected from a live socialbot injection experiment conducted on Twitter. We also present a comparative evaluation of the proposed approach with a state-of-the-art method and show that it performs significantly better. On feature ablation analysis we found that network structure and user intention and personality related dynamic features are most discriminative whereas static features show the least impact on the classification. Additionally following rate multimedia ratio and follower rate are most relevant to segregate different categories of the socialbot targets. We also perform a detailed topical and behavioral analysis of socialbot targets and found active users to be suspicious. Further joy and agreeableness are the most dominating personality traits among the three categories of the users.;2021
In order to improve the intelligence of the e-commerce online intelligent customer service system this paper proposes a deep rejection recognition algorithm based on the maximum interval squared hinge loss and combines the actual needs of the e-commerce online customer service system to build an intelligent customer service system with the support of the fuzzy control system. Moreover this article chooses to build a domain ontology library for structured storage of domain knowledge needed by customer service chatbots.

The experimental results show that the online intelligent customer service system constructed in this paper has certain practical effects.;2021
In recent years conversational agents (CAs) have become ubiquitous and are a presence in our daily routines. It seems that the technology has finally ripened to advance the use of CAs in various domains including commercial healthcare educational political industrial and personal domains. In this study the main areas in which CAs are successful are described along with the main technologies that enable the creation of CAs. Capable of conducting ongoing communication with humans CAs are encountered in natural-language processing deep learning and technologies that integrate emotional aspects. The technologies used for the evaluation of CAs and publicly available datasets are outlined. In addition several areas for future research are identified to address moral and security issues given the current state of CA-related technological developments. The uniqueness of our review is that an overview of the concepts and building blocks of CAs is provided and CAs are categorized according to their abilities and main application domains. In addition the primary tools and datasets that may be useful for the development and evaluation of CAs of different categories are described. Finally some thoughts and directions for future research are provided and domains that may benefit from conversational agents are introduced.;2021
In recent years gradual improvements in communication and connectivity technologies have enabled new technical possibilities for the adoption of chatbots across diverse sectors such as customer services trade and marketing. The chatbot is a platform that uses natural language processing a subset of artificial intelligence to find the right answer to all users' questions and solve their problems. Advanced chatbot architecture that is extensible scalable and supports different services for natural language understanding (NLU) and communication channels for interactions of users has been proposed. The paper describes overall chatbot architecture and provides corresponding metamodels as well as rules for mapping between the proposed and two commonly used NLU metamodels. The proposed architecture could be easily extended with new NLU services and communication channels. Finally two implementations of the proposed chatbot architecture are briefly demonstrated in the case study of ADA and COVID-19 Info Serbia.;2021
In recent years Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved phenomenal success in linguistic and semantic tasks like text classification machine translation cognitive dialogue systems information retrieval via Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). This feat is primarily attributed due to the seminal Transformer architecture leading to designs such as BERT GPT (I II III) etc. Although these large-size models have achieved unprecedented performances they come at high computational costs. Consequently some of the recent NLP architectures have utilized concepts of transfer learning pruning quantization and knowledge distillation to achieve moderate model sizes while keeping nearly similar performances as achieved by their predecessors. Additionally to mitigate the data size challenge raised by language models from a knowledge extraction perspective Knowledge Retrievers have been built to extricate explicit data documents from a large corpus of databases with greater efficiency and accuracy. Recent research has also focused on superior inference by providing efficient attention to longer input sequences. In this paper we summarize and examine the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) NLP models that have been employed for numerous NLP tasks for optimal performance and efficiency. We provide a detailed understanding and functioning of the different architectures a taxonomy of NLP designs comparative evaluations and future directions in NLP.;2021
In recent years task-oriented dialogue systems have received extensive attention from academia and industry. Training a dialogue agent through reinforcement learning is often costly because it requires many interactions with real users. Although the Deep Dyna-Q (DDQ) framework uses simulation experience to alleviate the cost of direct reinforcement learning it still suffers from challenges such as delayed rewards and policy degradation. This paper proposes an Emotion-Sensitive Deep Dyna-Q (ES-DDQ) model which: (1) presents an emotional world model that considers emotion-related cues to improve the ability of the traditional DDQ framework to model and simulate users and (2) designs two kinds of emotion related immediate rewards to mitigate the delayed reward problem. Experimental results show that our proposed approach effectively simulates users' behaviors and is superior to the state-of-the-art benchmarks. CO 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.;2021
In recent years various organizations such as companies and governments have been required to take measures for the mental health of their employees and the importance of self care for mental health by employees themselves has been increasing as well as being supported by administrators such as doctors and workplace managers. As a means of self-care of mental health that can be implemented by busy professionals during their workdays and daily lives the Digital-SAT method has been developed to implement the stress-care process of the SAT method a psychological counseling technique for resolving psychological stress problems in a self-guided manner using digital media. To realize the Digital-SAT method two issues need to be addressed: first to obtain the same emotional stress reduction effect as the SAT method and second to ensure the continuous implementation of the Digital-SAT method. Previous studies have shown that applications (apps) using virtual reality are effective in solving the former issue and an app using a chatbot can be effective in solving the latter. In this research an intervention study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of combined use of the two apps to encourage continuous use resulting in increased emotional stress reduction with the aim of making it feasible in actual work environments. An intervention of four weeks of app use was conducted with 70 nurses working in two hospitals where measures for mental health due to emotional labour and overwork were required. The emotional stress reduction effects of the intervention were evaluated using psychological scales and blood pressure levels and it was confirmed that combined use of apps was more effective than using them separately to practice the Digital-SAT method in an actual work environment.;2021
In recent years with the development of deep learning text-generation technology has undergone great changes and provided many kinds of services for human beings such as restaurant reservation and daily communication. The automatically generated text is becoming more and more fluent so researchers begin to consider more anthropomorphic text-generation technology that is the conditional text generation including emotional text generation personalized text generation and so on. Conditional Text Generation (CTG) has thus become a research hotspot. As a promising research field we find that much attention has been paid to exploring it. Therefore we aim to give a comprehensive review of the new research trends of CTG. We first summarize several key techniques and illustrate the technical evolution route in the field of neural text generation based on the concept model of CTG. We further make an investigation of existing CTG fields and propose several general learning models for CTG. Finally we discuss the open issues and promising research directions of CTG.;2021
In Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) the ability to detect out-of-domain (OOD) input dialog plays a very important role (e.g. voice assistance and chatbot systems). However most of the existing OOD detection methods rely heavily on manually labeled OOD data. Manual labeling of the OOD data for a dynamically changing and evolving area is time-consuming and not immediately possible. It limits the feasibility of these models in practical applications. So to solve this problem we are considering the scenario of having no OOD labeled data (i.e. zero-shot learning). To achieve this goal we have used the intent focused semantic parsing extracted with the help of Transformer-based techniques [e.g. BERT (Devlin et al. 2018)]. The two main components of the intent-focused semantic parsing are - (a) the sentence-level intents and (b) token-level intent classes which show the relation of slot tokens with intent classes. Finally we combine both information and use a One Class Neural Network (OC-NN) based zero-shot classifier. Our devised system has shown better results compared to the state-of-the-art on four publicly available datasets.;2021
In task-oriented dialogue systems the dialogue state tracker component (DST) is responsible for predicting the current state of the dialogue based on the dialogue history and the user utterance. Current DST approaches rely on a predefined domain ontology a fact that limits their effective usage for large scale conversational agents where the DST constantly needs to be interfaced with ever-increasing services and APIs. Focused towards overcoming this drawback we propose a domain-aware dialogue state tracker that is completely data-driven and it is modeled to predict for dynamic service schemas including zero-shot domains. Unlike approaches that propose separate models for prediction of intents requested slots slot status categorical slots and non-categorical slots we propose a single model in an end-to-end architecture. The proposed model utilizes domain and slot information to extract both domain and slot specific representations from a given dialogue and then uses such representations to predict the values of the corresponding slot in a given domain. Integrating this mechanism with pretrained language models our approach can effectively learn semantic relations and effectively perform transfer learning between domains or zero-shot tracking for domains not present in training.;2021
In the current era virtual environments and virtual characters have become popular. In the near future recognition of virtual facial expressions plays an important role in virtual assistants online video games security systems entertainment psychological study video conferencing virtual reality and online classes. The objective of this work is to recognize the facial emotions of virtual characters. Facial expression recognition (FER) from virtual characters is a difficult task due to its intra-class variation and inter-class similarity. The performances of existing FER systems are limited in this aspect. To address these challenges we designed and developed a multi-block deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) model to recognize the facial emotions from virtual stylized and human characters. In multi-block DCNN we defined four blocks with various computational elements to extract the discriminative features from facial images. To increase stability and to make better predictions two more models were proposed using ensemble learning which are bagging ensemble with SVM (DCNN-SVM) and the ensemble of three different classifiers with a voting technique (DCNN-VC). Image data augmentation was applied to expand the dataset to improve model performance and generalization. The accuracy of the proposed DCNN model was studied by tuning hyperparameters. Performances of the three proposed models were examined in contrast with pre-trained models such as VGGNet-19 ResNet50 with a voting technique for emotion recognition. The proposed models are evaluated and achieved the best accuracy when compared with other models on five publicly available facial emotion datasets that include UIBVFED FERG CK+ JAFFE and TFEID.;2021
In the current study we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz experiment using a smart speaker to investigate how smart speakers' task performance (success vs. failure) and pragmatic levels (high vs. low) alter users' linguistic behaviors during multiple turn-taking conversations. The linguistic behaviors analyzed in this study included the mean length of utterance give-up and topic development frequency. Furthermore we examined what kinds of pragmatic skills smart speakers need to sustain multiple turn-taking interactions. The results suggest that smart speakers' performance levels and pragmatic skills have different effects on linguistic behaviors. Task performance and the pragmatic levels of smart speaker did not change participants' utterance lengths. Giving up on conversations when tasks were not successfully completed occurred more frequently with smart speakers with low pragmatic capabilities. Topic development occurred more frequently when people interacted with smart speakers with high pragmatic capabilities or when tasks were accomplished. The notable requisite pragmatic skills for smart speakers included the abilities to specify and describe information react to indirect behavior and appreciate humor/ironic humor. The findings of this study may have implications for designing dialogue for artificial conversational agents in various conversational settings.;2021
In the era of Industry 4.0 manufacturing sites are becoming more sophisticated and connected with the aid of Information Technology (IT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) infrastructure. What makes a smart manufacturing enterprise as opposed to a traditional one is the ability to solve existing problems and predict issues to fix them before they occur while creating advantaged value. Dashboards assisting decision-makers in business markets can organize data from machines sensors and workers into a real-time visual representation. They provide a quick overview of how your entire business is operating and where you stand in relation to the key performance indicators for supporting the development toward more resource-efficient and sustainable processes. However if users need more information related to the indicators shown on the dashboard current approaches mainly rely on human effort to search and retrieve the information. The lack of interaction between the dashboard and users often results in inconvenient operations and limits the usage of the tool especially in the manufacturing industry. In this study an interaction design is developed to resolve the issue. The proposed dashboard is developed by a three-layer structure including data layer processing layer and presentation layer. A virtual assistant is introduced to play the role of a mediator between the dashboard and the user. It provides users with a natural language interface to communicate directly interacts with the dashboard on users' behalf and actively reminds relevant personnel to expedite data collection. Compared with the traditional human-machine interface the adoption of this lightweight and easy-to-use design can not only create a frictionless and intuitive experience but also ensure that data is displayed in a timely manner.;2021
In the Internet of Things era users are willing to personalize the joint behavior of their connected entities i.e. smart devices and online service by means of trigger-action rules such as IF the entrance Nest security camera detects a movement THEN blink the Philips Hue lamp in the kitchen:' Unfortunately the spread of new supported technologies makes the number of possible combinations between triggers and actions continuously growing thus motivating the need of assisting users in discovering new rules and functionality e.g. through recommendation techniques. To this end we present HeyTAP(2) a semantic Conversational Search and Recommendation (CSR) system able to suggest pertinent IF-THEN rules that can be easily deployed in different contexts starting from an abstract user's need. By exploiting a conversational agent the user can communicate her current personalization intention by specifying a set of functionality at a high level e.g. to decrease the temperature of a room when she left it. Stemming from this input HeyTAP(2) implements a semantic recommendation process that takes into account (a) the current user's intention (b) the connected entities owned by the user and (c) the user's long-term preferences revealed by her profile. If not satisfied with the suggestions then the user can converse with the system to provide further feedback i.e. a short-term preference thus allowing HeyTAP(2) to provide refined recommendations that better align with the original intention. We evaluate HeyTAP(2) by running different offline experiments with simulated users and real-world data. First we test the recommendation process in different configurations and we show that recommendation accuracy and similarity with target items increase as the interaction between the algorithm and the user proceeds. Then we compare HeyTAP(2) with other similar baseline recommender systems. Results are promising and demonstrate the effectiveness of HeyTAP(2) in recommending IF-THEN rules that satisfy the current personalization intention of the user.;2021
In the modern era the implementation of chatbot can be used in various fields of science. This research will focus on the application of sentence classification using the News Aggregator Dataset that is used to test the model against the categories determined to create the chatbot program. The results of the chatbot program trial by multimodal implementation applied four models (GRU Bi-GRU 1D CNN 1D CNN Transpose) with six variations of parameters to produce the best results from the entire trial. The best test results from this research for the chatbot program using the 1D CNN Transpose model are the best models with detailed characteristics in this research which produces an accuracy value of 0.9919. The test results on both types of chatbot are expected to produce sentence prediction results and precise and accurate detection results. The stages in making the program are explained in detail therefore it is hoped that program users can understand not only how to use the program by entering an input and receiving program output results that are explained in more detail in each sub-topic of this study.;2021
In the past decades the incidence rate of cancer has steadily risen. Although advances in early and accurate detection have increased cancer survival chances these patients must cope with physical and psychological sequelae. The lack of personalized support and assistance after discharge may lead to a rapid diminution of their physical abilities cognitive impairment and reduced quality of life. This paper proposes a personalized support system for cancer survivors based on a cohort and trajectory analysis (CTA) module integrated within an agent-based personalized chatbot named EREBOTS. The CTA module relies on survival estimation models machine learning and deep learning techniques. It provides clinicians with supporting evidence for choosing a personalized treatment while allowing patients to benefit from tailored suggestions adapted to their conditions and trajectories. The development of the CTA within the EREBOTS framework enables to effectively evaluate the significance of prognostic variables detect patient's high-risk markers and support treatment decisions.;2021
In the realm of smart services smart personal assistants (SPAs) have become a popular medium for value co-creation between service providers and users. The market success of SPAs is largely based on their innovative material properties such as natural language user interfaces machine learning-powered request handling and service provision and anthropomorphism. In different combinations these properties offer users entirely new ways to intuitively and interactively achieve their goals and thus co-create value with service providers. But how does the nature of the SPA shape value co-creation processes? In this paper we look through a functional affordances lens to theorize about the effects of different types of SPAs (i.e. with different combinations of material properties) on users' value co-creation processes. Specifically we collected SPAs from research and practice by reviewing scientific literature and web resources developed a taxonomy of SPAs' material properties and performed a cluster analysis to group SPAs of a similar nature. We then derived 2 general and 11 cluster-specific propositions on how different material properties of SPAs can yield different affordances for value co-creation. With our work we point out that smart services require researchers and practitioners to fundamentally rethink value co-creation as well as revise affordances theory to address the dynamic nature of smart technology as a service counterpart.;2021
In their traditional role digital assistants in technology-mediated services provide customers with information guidance and suggestions. However as the opportunities offered by technology and artificial intelligence increase digital assistants can also provide emotional support which refers to empathetic reassuring expressions for customers who have failed or succeeded in fulfilling a task. We show across four experiments that emotional support offered by a digital assistant increases customer satisfaction (Study 1 and 2) and persistence (Study 3 and 4) in using technology-mediated services. The increase in satisfaction occurs via the perceived warmth of the digital assistant and the increase in persistence via the serial mediation of perceived warmth and satisfaction. Further the results of a moderated serial mediation show that the effect on persistence only occurs when a digital (but not when a human) assistant provides emotional support in technology-mediated services. Finally the effect of emotional support on persistence occurs independently of the digital assistant's embodiment. Practitioners learn how to imbue technology-mediated services with a human touch inducing favorable customer outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2021
In this article we address the problem of answering complex information needs by conducting conversations with search engines in the sense that users can express their queries in natural language and directly receive the information they need from a short system response in a conversational manner. Recently there have been some attempts towards a similar goal e.g. studies on Conversational Agents (CAs) and Conversational Search (CS). However they either do not address complex information needs in search scenarios or they are limited to the development of conceptual frameworks and/or laboratory-based user studies. We pursue two goals in this article: (1) the creation of a suitable dataset the Search as a Conversation (SaaC) dataset for the development of pipelines for conversations with search engines and (2) the development of a state-of-the-art pipeline for conversations with search engines Conversations with Search Engines (CaSE) using this dataset. SaaC is built based on a multi-turn conversational search dataset where we further employ workers from a crowdsourcing platform to summarize each relevant passage into a short conversational response. CaSE enhances the state-of-the-art by introducing a supporting token identification module and a prior-aware pointer generator which enables us to generate more accurate responses. We carry out experiments to show that CaSE is able to outperform strong baselines. We also conduct extensive analyses on the SaaC dataset to show where there is room for further improvement beyond CaSE. Finally we release the SaaC dataset and the code for CaSE and all models used for comparison to facilitate future research on this topic.;2021
In this article we present MYRRORBar a personal digital assistant implementing a natural language interface that allows the users to: (i) access online services such as music video news and food recommendations in a personalized way by exploiting a strategy for implicit user modeling called holistic user profiling (ii) query their own user models to inspect the features encoded in their profiles and to increase their awareness of the personalization process. Basically the system allows the users to formulate natural language requests related to their information needs. Such needs are roughly classified in two groups: quantified self-related needs (e.g. Did I sleep enough? Am I extrovert?) and personalized access to online services (e.g. Play a song I like). The Intent recognition strategy implemented in the platform automatically identifies the intent expressed by the user and forwards the request to specific services and modules that generate an appropriate answer that fulfills the query. In the experimental evaluation we evaluated both qualitative (users' acceptance of the system usability) as well as quantitative (time required to complete basic tasks effectiveness of the personalization strategy) aspects of the system and the results showed that MYRRORBOT can improve the way people access online services and applications. This leads to a more effective interaction and paves the way for further development of our system.;2021
In this article we present the results of our experiments on sentiment and emotion recognition for English and Polish texts aiming to work in the context of a therapeutic chatbot. We created a dedicated dataset by adding samples of neutral texts to an existing English-language emotion-labeled corpus. Next using neural machine translation we developed a Polish version of the English database. A bilingual parallel corpus created in this way named CORTEX (CORpus of Translated Emotional teXts) labeled with three sentiment polarity classes and nine emotion classes was used for experiments on classification. We employed various classifiers: Naive Bayes Support Vector Machines fastText and BERT. The results obtained were satisfactory: we achieved the best scores for the BERT-based models which yielded accuracy of over 90% for sentiment (3-class) classification and almost 80% for emotion (9-class) classification. We compared the results for both languages and discussed the differences. Both the accuracy and the F1-scores for Polish turned out to be slightly inferior to those for English with the highest difference visible for BERT.;2021
In this paper various methodologies of acoustic and language models as well as labeling methods for automatic speech recognition for spoken dialogues in emergency call centers were investigated and comparatively analyzed. Because of the fact that dialogue speech in call centers has specific context and noisy emotional environments available speech recognition systems show poor performance. Therefore in order to accurately recognize dialogue speeches the main modules of speech recognition systems-language models and acoustic training methodologies-as well as symmetric data labeling approaches have been investigated and analyzed. To find an effective acoustic model for dialogue data different types of Gaussian Mixture Model/Hidden Markov Model (GMM/HMM) and Deep Neural Network/Hidden Markov Model (DNN/HMM) methodologies were trained and compared. Additionally effective language models for dialogue systems were defined based on extrinsic and intrinsic methods. Lastly our suggested data labeling approaches with spelling correction are compared with common labeling methods resulting in outperforming the other methods with a notable percentage. Based on the results of the experiments we determined that DNN/HMM for an acoustic model trigram with Kneser-Ney discounting for a language model and using spelling correction before training data for a labeling method are effective configurations for dialogue speech recognition in emergency call centers. It should be noted that this research was conducted with two different types of datasets collected from emergency calls: the Dialogue dataset (27 h) which encapsulates call agents' speech and the Summary dataset (53 h) which contains voiced summaries of those dialogues describing emergency cases. Even though the speech taken from the emergency call center is in the Azerbaijani language which belongs to the Turkic group of languages our approaches are not tightly connected to specific language features. Hence it is anticipated that suggested approaches can be applied to the other languages of the same group.;2021
In this paper we propose a probabilistic framework for solving the task of 'Visual Dialog'. Solving this task requires reasoning and understanding of visual modality language modality and common sense knowledge to answer. Various architectures have been proposed to solve this task by variants of multi -modal deep learning techniques that combine visual and language representations. However we believe that it is crucial to understand and analyze the sources of uncertainty for solving this task. Our approach allows for estimating uncertainty and also aids a diverse generation of answers. The proposed approach is obtained through a probabilistic representation module that provides us with representations for image question and conversation history a module that ensures that diverse latent representations for candidate answers are obtained given the probabilistic representations and an uncertainty representation module that chooses the appropriate answer that minimizes uncertainty. We thoroughly evaluate the model with a detailed ablation analysis comparison with state of the art and visualization of the uncertainty that aids in the understanding of the method. Using the proposed probabilistic framework we thus obtain an improved visual dialog system that is also more explainable. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2021
In this paper we propose Stacked DeBERT short for Stacked Denoising Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. This novel model improves robustness in incomplete data when compared to existing systems by designing a novel encoding scheme in BERT a powerful language representation model solely based on attention mechanisms. Incomplete data in natural language processing refer to text with missing or incorrect words and its presence can hinder the performance of current models that were not implemented to withstand such noises but must still perform well even under duress. This is due to the fact that current approaches are built for and trained with clean and complete data and thus are not able to extract features that can adequately represent incomplete data. Our proposed approach consists of obtaining intermediate input representations by applying an embedding layer to the input tokens followed by vanilla transformers. These intermediate features are given as input to novel denoising transformers which are responsible for obtaining richer input representations. The proposed approach takes advantage of stacks of multilayer perceptrons for the reconstruction of missing words' embeddings by extracting more abstract and meaningful hidden feature vectors and bidirectional transformers for improved embedding representation. We consider two datasets for training and evaluation: the Chatbot Natural Language Understanding Evaluation Corpus and Kaggle's Twitter Sentiment Corpus. Our model shows improved F1-scores and better robustness in informal/incorrect texts present in tweets and in texts with Speech-to-Text error in the sentiment and intent classification tasks.(1) (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we survey the methods and concepts developed for the evaluation of dialogue systems. Evaluation in and of itself is a crucial part during the development process. Often dialogue systems are evaluated by means of human evaluations and questionnaires. However this tends to be very cost- and time-intensive. Thus much work has been put into finding methods which allow a reduction in involvement of human labour. In this survey we present the main concepts and methods. For this we differentiate between the various classes of dialogue systems (task-oriented conversational and question-answering dialogue systems). We cover each class by introducing the main technologies developed for the dialogue systems and then present the evaluation methods regarding that class.;2021
In this study we attempt to specify the cognitive support behavior of a previously designed embodied conversational agent coach that provides learning support to low-literates. Three knowledge gaps are identified in the existing work: an incomplete specification of the behaviors that make up 'support' an incomplete specification of how this support can be personalized and unclear speech recognition rules. We use the socio-cognitive engineering method to update our foundation of knowledge with new online banking exercises low-level scaffolding and user modeling theory and speech recognition. We then refine the design of our coach agent by creating comprehensive cognitive support rules that adapt support based on learner needs (the 'Generalized' approach) and attune the coach's support delay to user performance in previous exercises (the 'Individualized' approach). A prototype is evaluated in a 3-week within- and between-subjects experiment. Results show that the specified cognitive support is effective: Learners complete all exercises interact meaningfully with the coach and improve their online banking self-efficacy. Counter to hypotheses the Individualized approach does not improve on the Generalized approach. Whether this indicates suboptimal operationalization or a deeper problem with the Individualized approach remains as future work.;2021
In this work we are focusing on a new and yet uncovered way for malicious apps to gain profit. They claim to be dating apps. However their sole purpose is to lure users into purchasing premium/VIP services to start conversations with other (likely fake female) accounts in the app. We call these apps as fraudulent dating apps. This paper performs a systematic study to understand the whole ecosystem of fraudulent dating apps. Specifically we have proposed a three-phase method to detect them and subsequently comprehend their characteristics via analyzing the existing account profiles. Our observation reveals that most of the accounts are not managed by real persons but by chatbots based on predefined conversation templates. We also analyze the business model of these apps and reveal that multiple parties are actually involved in the ecosystem including producers who develop apps publishers who publish apps to gain profit and the distribution network that is responsible for distributing apps to end users. Finally we analyze the impact of them to users (i.e. victims) and estimate the overall revenue. Our work is the first systematic study on fraudulent dating apps and the results demonstrate the urge for a solution to protect users.;2021
In this work we present an innovative and cost-effective approach to run ambulatory assessment (AA) studies on participants' smartphones via Telegram Messenger. Our approach works both for Android and iOS devices. The population of potential participants in a given country or region consists of all individuals who (a) are in possession of a smartphone (b) are willing to install Telegram Messenger and (c) live in an environment providing constant connection to the Internet. In our new approach to AA participants are asked to subscribe to a Telegram chatbot that provides them with links to brief surveys at specified points in time in their everyday lives via short notifications. We developed a user-friendly Python script that allows for the flexible editing of the chatbot's settings e.g. the number of surveys per day. All common survey software designed for mobile devices can be used to present surveys to participants. This means that data collection takes place exclusively via the selected survey software not via Telegram. With our approach AA studies can be carried out among iOS and Android users cost-effectively and reliably while data security is ensured. Initial data from a pilot study show that studies of this kind are feasible and the procedure is accepted by participants. Our Python script is licensed under General Public License (GPLv3) and therefore freely available and editable: https://github.com/Raze97/Telegram-Survey-Bot;2021
In this work we propose a multi-goal multi-agent learning (MGMA) framework for task-oriented dialogue generation which aims to retrieve accurate entities from knowledge base (KB) and generate human-like responses simultaneously. Specifically MGMA consists of a KB-oriented teacher agent for inquiring KB a context-oriented teacher agent for extracting dialogue patterns and a student agent that tries to not only retrieve accurate entities from KB but also generate human-like responses. A two-to-one teacher-student learning method is proposed to coordinate these three networks training the student network to integrate the expert knowledge from the two teacher networks and achieve comprehensive performance in task-oriented dialogue generation. In addition we also update the two teachers based on the output of the student network since the space of possible responses is large and the teachers should adapt to the conversation style of the student. In this way we can obtain more empathetic teachers with better performance. Moreover in order to build each task oriented dialogue system effectively we employ a dialogue memory network to dynamically filter the irrelevant dialogue history and memorize important newly coming information. Another KB memory network which shares the structural KB tuples throughout the whole conversation is adopted to dynamically extract KB information with a memory pointer at each utterance. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (i.e. CamRest In-Car Assistant and Multi-WOZ 2.1) demonstrate that MGMA significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both automatic and human evaluation.

Incorporating topic information can help response generation models to produce informative responses for chat-bots. Previous work only considers the individual semantic of each topic ignoring its specific dialog context which may result in inaccurate topic representation and hurt response coherence. Besides as an important feature of multi-turn conversation dynamic topic transitions have not been well-studied. We propose a Context-Controlled Topic-Aware neural response generation model i.e. CCTA which makes dialog context interact with the process of topic representing and transiting to achieve balanced improvements on response informativeness and contextual coherence. CCTA focuses on capturing the semantical relations within topics as well as their corresponding contextual information in conversation to produce context-dependent topic representations at the word-level and turn-level. Besides CCTA introduces a context controlled topic transition strategy utilizing contextual topics to yield relevant transition words. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark multi-turn conversation datasets validate the superiority of our proposal on generating coherent and informative responses against the state-ofthe-art baselines. We also find that topic transition modeling can work as an auxiliary learning task to boost the response generation.;2021
Information about a subjective user opinion towards an argument is crucial for argumentative systems in order to present appropriate content and adapt their behaviour to the individual user. However requesting explicit feedback regarding the discussed arguments is often impractical and can hinder the interaction. To address this issue we investigate the automatic recognition of user opinions towards arguments that are presented by means of a virtual avatar from social signals. We focus on two different user opinion categories (convincing and interesting) and two different types of social signals (facial expressions and eye movement). The recognition is addressed as a supervised learning problem and realized using the argument search evaluation data discussed in previous work. The overall performance is compared to a human annotation on a subset of the collected data. The results show that the machine learning performance is similar to human performance in both recognition tasks.;2021
Information systems such as task management applications and digital assistants can help people keep track of tasks of different types and different time durations ranging from a few minutes to days or weeks. Helping people better manage their tasks and their time are core capabilities of assistive technologies situated within a broader context of supporting more effective information access and use. Throughout the course of a day there are typically many short time periods of downtime (e.g. five minutes or less) available to individuals. Microtasks are simple tasks that can be tackled in such short amounts of time. Identifying microtasks in task lists could help people utilize these periods of low activity to make progress on their task backlog. We define actionable tasks as self-contained tasks that need to be completed or acted on. However not all to-do tasks are actionable. Many task lists are collections of miscellaneous items that can be completed at any time (e.g. books to read movies to watch) notes (e.g. names addresses) or the individual items are constituents in a list that is itself a task (e.g. a grocery list). In this article we introduce the novel challenge of microtask detection and we present machine-learned models for automatically determining which tasks are actionable and which of these actionable tasks aremicrotasks. Experiments show that our models can accurately identify actionable tasks accurately detect actionable microtasks and that we can combine these models to generate a solution that scales microtask detection to all tasks. We discuss our findings in detail along with their limitations. These findings have implications for the design of systems to help people make the most of their time.;2021
Initial research although limited demonstrates promise for the use of a voice-user interface via a digital assistant (i.e. Google Assistant) for English language learners seeking language skill development. However no research has sought to determine the adult English as a foreign language instructor response toward the application of such devices. This study addresses that gap by seeking to determine the pedagogical value of such an interactional modality by native-English speaking (NES) and non-native English speaking (NNES) instructors (n=12) enrolled in an MA(TESOL) program in Korea. Particular focus centers on the potential regarding the deployment of such a device with learners by these instructors and their receptiveness toward using such a device from within their educational contexts. An exploratory qualitative method employing a semi-structured interview technique was undertaken. A concept driven coding approach in data analysis was then employed to develop a framework of pedagogical prospects regarding digital assistant use built on aspects emerging from the concepts of comfortability comprehension usability enjoyability and worthwhileness. Results highlight that instructor perceptions regarding the potential use of voice-user interfaces in the classroom tend to align although some minor differences did emerge and that all are receptive to its use in a multitude of ways.;2021
Intelligent AI devices have become a common presence in the business landscape offering a wide range of services from the medical sector to the hospitality industry. From an organizational perspective AI devices have several advantages by performing certain tasks quicker and more accurately in comparison to humans while at the same time being more cost-efficient. However in order to maintain the high standards of a brand they have to be accepted by consumers and deliver socially adequate performance. Therefore it is important to determine the characteristics of AI devices which make them accepted and trusted by consumers. Based on the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Theory we have researched on the role of psychological anthropomorphic characteristics perceived empathy and interaction quality in the acceptance of AI devices in the service industry. The results show that anthropomorphic characteristics alone do not influence acceptance and trust towards AI devices. However both perceived empathy and interaction quality mediate the relation between anthropomorphic characteristics and acceptance. A human-like AI device has higher acceptance when it has the ability to show empathy and interaction in relation to the human consumer. This result reveals the importance of developing forms of strong intelligence and empathetic behaviour in service robots and AI devices.;2021
Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVA) such as Apple Siri Google Assistant are increasingly being used to assist users with performing different tasks. However their characteristics also raise user privacy concerns related to the provision of information to the IVA. Drawing upon the communication privacy management theory two experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of information sensitivity types of IVA (anthropomorphized versus objectified IVA) and the roles of IVA (servant versus partner) on privacy concerns and user willingness to disclose information to IVA. Study 1 showed that information sensitivity and anthropomorphism significantly impact user privacy concerns. Study 2 revealed that if highly sensitive information was required a partner IVA would trigger greater privacy concerns while in low sensitive information contexts it would evoke a more secure feeling than a servant IVA. Subsequent theoretical and managerial implications of these studies are discussed accordingly.;2021
Intent classification (IC) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) are arguably the two main components needed to build a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine which is a main component of conversational agents. The IC and NER components are closely intertwined and the entities are often connected to the underlying intent. Current research has primarily focused to model IC and NER as two separate units which results in error propagation and thus sub-optimal performance. In this paper we propose a simple yet effective novel framework for NLU where the parameters of the IC and the NER models are jointly trained in a consolidated parameter space. Text semantic representations are obtained from popular pre-trained contextual language models which are fine-tuned for our task and these parameters are propagated to other deep neural layers in our framework leading to a faithful unified modelling of the IC and NER parameters. The overall framework results in a faithful parameter sharing when the training is underway leading to a more coherent learning. Experiments on two public datasets ATIS and SNIPS show that our model outperforms other methods by a noticeable margin. On the SNIPS dataset we obtain a 1.42% improvement in NER in terms of the F1 score and 1% improvement in intent accuracy score. On ATIS we achieve 1.54% improvement in intent accuracy score. We also present qualitative results to showcase the effectiveness of our model.;2021
Intent detection and slot filling are important modules in task-oriented dialog systems. In order to make full use of the relationship between different modules and resource sharing solving the problem of a lack of semantics this paper proposes a multitasking learning intent-detection system based on the knowledge-base and slot-filling joint model. The approach has been used to share information and rich external utility between intent and slot modules in a three-part process. First this model obtains shared parameters and features between the two modules based on long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks. Second a knowledge base is introduced into the model to improve its performance. Finally a weighted-loss function is built to optimize the joint model. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on a benchmark Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) dataset and the Snips dataset. Our joint model achieves state-of-the-art results on the benchmark ATIS dataset with a 1.33% intent-detection accuracy improvement a 0.94% slot filling F value improvement and with 0.19% and 0.31% improvements respectively on the Snips dataset.;2021
Interacting with an embodied conversational agent (ECA) in a professional context addresses social considerations to satisfy customer-relationship. This paper presents an experimental study about the perception of virtual intimacy in human-ECA interactions. We explore how an ECA's multimodal communication affects our perception of virtual intimacy. To this end we developed a virtual Tourism Information counselor capable of exhibiting verbal and nonverbal intimate behaviors according to several modalities (voice chatbox both media) and we built a corpus of videos showing interactions between the agent and a human tourist. We interrogated observers about their perception of the agent's level of intimacy. Our results confirm the human ability to perceive intimacy in an ECA displaying multimodal behaviors although the contribution of nonverbal communication remains unclear. Our study suggests that using voice channel increases the perception of virtual intimacy and offers further evidence that human-inspired design of ECAs is needed. Finally we demonstrate that intimate cues do not disturb the comprehension of task-related information and are valuable for an attentional focus on the agent's animation. We discuss the concept of virtual intimacy in relation to interpersonal intimacy and we question its perception in terms of attentional mechanisms.;2021
Interactions between humans and machines that include artificial intelligence are increasingly common in nearly all areas of life. Meanwhile AI-products are increasingly endowed with emotional characteristics. That is they are designed and trained to elicit emotions in humans to recognize human emotions and sometimes to simulate emotions (EAI). The introduction of such systems in our lives is met with some criticism. There is a rather strong intuition that there is something wrong about getting attached to a machine about having certain emotions towards it and about getting involved in a kind of affective relationship with it. In this paper I want to tackle these worries by focusing on the last aspect: in what sense could it be problematic or even wrong to establish an emotional relationship with EAI-systems? I want to show that the justifications for the widespread intuition concerning the problems are not as strong as they seem at first sight. To do so I discuss three arguments: the argument from self-deception the argument from lack of mutuality and the argument from moral negligence.;2021
Internet of things conversational agents (IoT-CAs) are making human-computer interactions ubiquitous. In this study we experimentally examined the effects of IoT-CA use on face-to-face conversations between close partners. A total of 136 participants (68 close relationship dyads) participated in the experiment. We prepared an IoT chat environment and provided chat topics for each dyad. The dyads were randomly assigned into one of two IoT-CA use pattern groups (joint use: two persons using an IoT-CA together individual use: one person using an IoT-CA alone) and three interaction conditions (no IoT-CA use conversation content-relevant IoT-CA use conversation content-irrelevant IoT-CA use). The results showed that compared with no IoT-CA use IoT-CA use did not have negative effects on conversation experiences but produced feelings of greater closeness to the IoT-CA in the partners. Furthermore joint IoT-CA use in the content-relevant condition (IoT-CA made comments relevant to interpersonal interactions) helped increase interpersonal self-disclosure. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Internet of things conversational agents (IoT-CAs) are becoming integral parts of our homes and daily routines. IoT-CA use does not have negative effects on face-to-face conversation experience. People might be accustomed to technological device use in face-to-face conversations. Information transparency brought by voice interface might decrease negative effects of technology use on interpersonal conversations.;2021
Internet-of-Things has reshaped the way people interact with their surroundings and automatize the once manual actions. In a smart home controlling the Internet-connected lights is as simple as speaking to a nearby conversational assistant. However specifying interaction rules such as making the lamp turn on at specific times or when someone enters the space is not a straightforward task. The complexity of doing such increases as the number and variety of devices increases along with the number of household members. Thus managing such systems becomes a problem including finding out why something has happened. This issue lead to the birth of several low-code development solutions that allow users to define rules to their systems at the cost of discarding the easiness and accessibility of voice interaction. In this paper we extend the previous published work on Jarvis [1] a conversational interface to manage IoT systems that attempts to address these issues by allowing users to specify time-based rules use contextual awareness for more natural interactions provide event management and support causality queries. A proof-of-concept is presented detailing its architecture and natural language processing capabilities. A feasibility experiment was carried with mostly non-technical participants providing evidence that Jarvis is intuitive enough to be used by common end-users with participants showcasing an overall preference by conversational assistants over visual low-code solutions.;2021
Introduction Only a minority of people living with mental health problems are getting professional help. As digitalisation moves on the possibility of providing internet/mobile-based interventions (IMIs) arises. One type of IMIs are fully automated conversational software agents (chatbots). Software agents are computer programs that can hold conversations with a human by mimicking a human conversational style. Software agents could deliver low-threshold and cost-effective interventions aiming at promoting psychological well-being in a large number of individuals. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and acceptance of the brief software agent-based IMI SISU in comparison with a waitlist control group. Methods and analysis Within a two-group randomised controlled trial a total of 120 adult participants living with low well-being (Well-being Scale/WHO-5) will be recruited in Germany Austria and Switzerland. SISU is based on therapeutic writing and acceptance and commitment therapy-based principles. The brief intervention consists of three modules. Participants work through the intervention on 3 consecutive days. Assessment takes place before (t1) during (t2) and after (t3) the interaction with SISU as well as 4 weeks after randomisation (t4). Primary outcome is psychological well-being (WHO-5). Secondary outcomes are emotional well-being (Flourishing Scale) psychological flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II) quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life -8D) satisfaction with the intervention (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8) and side effects (Inventory for the assessment of negative effectsof psychotherapy). Examined mediators and moderators are sociodemographic variables personality (Big Five Inventory-10) emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire) alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20) centrality of events (Centrality of Events Scale) treatment expectancies (Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire) and technology alliance (Inventory of Technology Alliance-Online Therapy). Data analysis will be based on intention-to-treat principles. SISU guides participants through a 3-day intervention. Ethics and dissemination This trial has been approved by the ethics committee of the Ulm University (No. 448/18 18.02.2019). Results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences.;2021
Introduction: Clinicians rely on pharmacologic knowledge bases to answer medication questions and avoid potential adverse drug events. In late 2018 an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent Watson Assistant (WA) was made available to online subscribers to the pharmacologic knowledge base Micromedex (R). WA allows users to ask medication-related questions in natural language. This study evaluated search method-dependent differences in the frequency of information accessed by traditional methods (keyword search and heading navigation) vs conversational agent search. Materials and methods: We compared the proportion of information types accessed through the conversational agent to the proportion of analogous information types accessed by traditional methods during the first 6 months of 2020. Results: Addition of the conversational agent allowed early adopters to access 22 different information types contained in the 'quick answers' portion of the knowledge base. These information types were accessed 117550 times with WA during the study period compared to 33649651 times using traditional search methods. The distribution across information types differed by method employed (c(2) test P < .0001). Single drug/dosing FDA/non-FDA uses adverse effects and drug administration emerged as 4 of the top 5 information types accessed by either method. Intravenous compatibility was accessed more frequently using the conversational agent (7.7% vs. 0.6% for traditional methods) whereas dose adjustments were accessed more frequently via traditional methods (4.8% vs. 1.4% for WA). Conclusion: In a widely used pharmacologic knowledge base information accessed through conversational agents versus traditional methods differed. User-centered studies are needed to understand these differences.;2021
Introduction: In Onondaga County New York around half of all births to Black and Hispanic teenage girls are unintended. The Layla's Got You campaign consists of a chatbot and social media campaign designed to increase contraception knowledge among 16- to 25-year-old Black and Hispanic women in Onondaga County. Methods: The campaign was co-created with local women in the target audience and employed digital and grassroots community building strategies. Focus groups were conducted among 31 women during which participants selected the campaign's logo and chatbot name and created the tagline. Participants reviewed chatbot responses and designed Layla's appearance and features and Black/Hispanic women are featured in website and promotional photos. A community campaign manager pairs digital strategies with grassroots partnerships among a diverse group of stakeholders including social media influencers hair salons and health clinics. Results: Since implementation the chatbot has received 4390 messages related to contraception or sexual health. Across social media accounts the campaign has showed 2483683 impressions average daily reach of 1710 for Facebook and 943 for Instagram and 32816 total engagements across all platforms. Conclusion: Layla's Got You provides young women with a confidential place in which to find locally tailored and trustworthy information about contraception. By merging innovative technology-driven strategies participatory creation techniques and grassroots community building the initiative delivers impactful easily updated health information on a large scale. This strategy has promising implications for increasing knowledge and positive attitudes towards contraception among specific at-risk audiences.;2021
Introduction: The growing demand from patients with wounds from various causes has significantly challenged primary care nurses. A chatbot with duly validated evidence-based content can assist both nurses and patients in managing care. This work describes the development process of such a chatbot (BOTCURATIVO) that aims to help the treatment of wounds by non-specialists by giving guidelines about the recommended wound dressing procedures for each type of wound. Method: Methodological research was carried out in three phases. The first one corresponded to the validation of the script's content through a panel of enterostomal therapist nurses who evaluated the domains and items of the chatbot script. Data analysis was performed using the Content Validity Index by individual level and scale level (>= 0.80). To verify the agreement between the evaluators the Kappa test was used. In the second phase the chatbot was developed using GOOGLE'S DIALOGFLOW platform. Finally in the third phase the chatbot's usability was analyzed using the System Usability Scale (SUS) by 17 users 8 of them being patients with chronic wounds 5 caregivers of people with acute and chronic wounds and 4 nurses. Results: The established domains achieved excellent suitability relevance and representativeness criteria all above 90 % the content validity index per level of scale reached 0.97 and 0.82 by the methods of average and universal agreement respectively with excellent agreement between the evaluators (Kappa value: 0.83). The global usability score was 80.1. Conclusion: The script developed and incorporated into the chatbot prototype achieved a satisfactory level of content validity. The usability of the chatbot was considered good adding to the credibility of the device.;2021
Language abnormalities are a core symptom of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and could serve as a potential diagnostic marker. Natural language processing enables quantification of language connectedness which may be lower in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Here we investigated connectedness of spontaneous speech in schizophrenia-spectrum patients and controls and determine its accuracy in classification. Using a semistructured interview speech of 50 patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and 50 controls was recorded. Language connectedness in a semantic word2vec model was calculated using consecutive word similarity in moving windows of increasing sizes (2-20 words). Mean minimal and variance of similarity were calculated per window size and used in a random forest classifier to distinguish patients and healthy controls. Classification based on connectedness reached 85% cross-validated accuracy with 84% specificity and 86% sensitivity. Features that best discriminated patients from controls were variance of similarity at window sizes between 5 and 10. We show impaired connectedness in spontaneous speech of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders even in patients with low ratings of positive symptoms. Effects were most prominent at the level of sentence connectedness. The high sensitivity specificity and tolerability of this method show that language analysis is an accurate and feasible digital assistant in diagnosing schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.;2021
Linguistic intelligence and the ability to converse with human are important and indispensable parts of humanoid robots. One of the most challenging tasks in knowledge-grounded task-oriented dialog systems (KTDS) is the knowledge selection task which aims to find the proper knowledge snippets to respond to user dialog requests. In this paper we first propose domain adapted-BERT (DA-BERT) which employs pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) with domain adaptive training and dynamic masking probability for knowledge selection in KTDS. Domain adaptive training can minimize the domain gap between the general text data that BERT is pre-trained on and the dialog-knowledge joint data while dynamic masking probability enhances the training in an easy-to-hard manner. After knowledge selection the next task in KTDS is knowledge-grounded generation. To improve the performance in knowledge-grounded generation we propose GPT-PR to employ post-ranking on the generator's outputs. Post-ranking eliminates the possibility of generating hallucination response by a large portion during the sampling-based decoding process and thus can improve the quality of the generated response. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show that our proposed pre-training and post-ranking methods DA-BERT and GPT-PR respectively outperform the state-of-the-art models with large margins across all the evaluation metrics. Moreover in the experiments we also analyze the bad cases of DA-BERT and GPT-PR and do visualizations to facilitate further research in this direction.;2021
Low therapeutic adherence is a concern for health professionals as it decreases therapeutic efficiency while increasing costs especially in elderly populations. To increase therapeutic adherence in elderly populations the technology applied in the medical devices that are used must be adapted to improve usability. This paper outlines the rationale behind and methods applied to assess the usability of ACHO (Assistant on Care and Health Offline) a voice assistant that provides elderly patients with reminders of medical appointments to attend and when they need to take their medication. This work is a descriptive cross-sectional observational study and will include a three-phase (analysis testing and refinement) multidimensional usability analysis of an initial prototype in the setting of a user-driven Living Lab which enables the needs and characteristics of the end users to be identified and incorporated into the prototype with each iteration in which a multidisciplinary team of researchers and users will participate as co-creators. This methodology will allow us to develop a better prototype increasing usability and thus increasing therapeutic adherence.;2021
Machine learning and the Internet of things (IoT) play a significant role in digitizing the modern world. Deep learning in object detection leads to a sophisticated solution and Virtual assistant can be favorable for visual impairment. This paper reflects an architectural design of smart blind assistant using the mechanism of deep learning embedded with IoT. The proposed model introduces an intelligent cap using the raspberry Pi and camera module along with a deep learning paradigm. The proposed model presents a smart blind stick's structural design that utilizes a microcontroller with multiple sensors. The manuscript also provides a development process of virtual assistant that acts as a manager of complete integration. The model employs IoT and Bluetooth connectivity for instant data monitoring. The authorized person keeps watching on visual impairment using the IoT cloud server. To examine the proficiency of this anticipated model object detection using deep learning sensor data calculation and system usability (SUS) are enumerated and interpreted. The SUS score of this work is 86%. However the proposed system will be workable and handy in the daily activities of a blind person. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2021
Many attempts have been made to construct new domain-specific knowledge graphs using the existing knowledge base of various domains. However traditional dictionary-based or supervised knowledge graph building methods rely on predefined human-annotated resources of entities and their relationships. The cost of creating human-annotated resources is high in terms of both time and effort. This means that relying on human-annotated resources will not allow rapid adaptability in describing new knowledge when domain-specific information is added or updated very frequently such as with the recent coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic situation. Therefore in this study we propose an Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) system based on unsupervised learning without a pre-built dataset. The proposed method obtains knowledge from a vast amount of text documents about COVID-19 rather than a general knowledge base and add this to the existing knowledge graph. First we constructed a COVID-19 entity dictionary and then we scraped a large text dataset related to COVID-19. Next we constructed a COVID-19 perspective language model by fine-tuning the bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) pre-trained language model. Finally we defined a new COVID-19-specific knowledge base by extracting connecting words between COVID-19 entities using the BERT self-attention weight from COVID-19 sentences. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed Co-BERT model outperforms the original BERT in terms of mask prediction accuracy and metric for evaluation of translation with explicit ordering (METEOR) score.;2021
Many B2B firms have widely accepted AI-based chatbots to provide human-like service interaction at different customer touchpoints in recent years. One of the objectives behind introducing this technology is to provide an enhanced live channel Customer Experience (CX) all round the clock. Researchers have focused on delivering the CX by improvising the chatbot's internal algorithm giving limited attention to CX theories from management literature which leaves a gap. With the proposed paper we have investigated the influencing factors of AI-based chatbots from the lens of CX theories for B2B firms. In this paper a model for organizing CX has been proposed using the diffusion of innovation theory trust commitment theory information systems success model and Hoffman & Novak's flow model for the computer-mediated environment and verified using the social media data. The methodology used for this study is the social media analytics-based content analysis method (sentiment analysis hierarchical clustering topic modeling) for data preparation followed by lasso and ridge regression for model verification. The results suggest that CX in B2B enterprises using chatbots is influenced by these bots' overall system design customers' ability to use technology and customer trust towards brand and system.;2021
Many laboratories working in the field of drug discovery use the ZINC database to identify and then acquire commercially available chemicals. However finding the best deal for a given compound is often time-intensive and laborious as the process involves searching for all vendors selling the desired compound comparing prices and interacting with the preferred vendor. To streamline this process we have developed ZINC Express a web application that simplifies the online purchase of chemicals annotated in the ZINC database. For any compound with a known ZINC ID ZINC Express finds a list of vendors offering that compound and for each such vendor returns the available package quantities the price of each package and the price per milligram along with a link to that vendor. We expect that ZINC Express will be of use to both computational and experimental researchers. ZINC Express is freely accessible online at https://zincexpress.mml.unc.edu/.;2021
Many of the world's leading brands and increasingly government agencies are using intelligent agent technologies also known as chatbots to interact with consumers. However consumer satisfaction with chatbots is mixed. Consumers report frustration with chatbots arising from misunderstood questions irrelevant responses and poor integration with human service agents. This study examines whether human-computer interactions can be more personalized by matching consumer personality with congruent machine personality using language. Although the idea that personality is manifested through language and that people are more likely to be responsive to others with the same personality is well known there is a dearth of research that examines whether this is consistent for human-computer interactions. Based on a sample of over 57000 chatbot interactions this study demonstrates that consumer personality can be predicted during contextual interactions and that chatbots can be manipulated to 'assume a personality' using response language. Matching consumer personality with congruent chatbot personality had a positive impact on consumer engagement with chatbots and purchasing outcomes for interactions involving social gain.;2021
Many people are now engaged in remote conversations for a wide variety of scenes such as interviewing counseling and consulting but there is a limited number of skilled experts. We propose a novel framework of parallel conversations with semi-autonomous avatars where one operator collaborates with several remote robots or agents simultaneously. The autonomous dialogue system mostly manages the conversation but switches to the human operator when necessary. This framework circumvents the requirement for autonomous systems to be completely perfect. Instead we need to detect dialogue breakdown or disengagement. We present a prototype of this framework for attentive listening.;2021
Massive open online courses (MOOCs) allow students and instructors to discuss through messages posted on a forum. However the instructors should limit their interaction to the most critical tasks during MOOC delivery so teacher-led scaffolding activities such as forum-based support can be very limited even impossible in such environments. In addition students who try to clarify the concepts through such collaborative tools could not receive useful answers and the lack of interactivity may cause a permanent abandonment of the course. The purpose of this paper is to report the experimental findings obtained evaluating the performance of a text categorization tool capable of detecting the intent the subject area the domain topics the sentiment polarity and the level of confusion and urgency of a forum post so that the result may be exploited by instructors to carefully plan their interventions. The proposed approach is based on the application of attention-based hierarchical recurrent neural networks in which both a recurrent network for word encoding and an attention mechanism for word aggregation at sentence and document levels are used before classification. The integration of the developed classifier inside an existing tool for conversational agents based on the academically productive talk framework is also presented as well as the accuracy of the proposed method in the classification of forum posts.;2021
Massive open online courses (MOOCs) pose a challenge for instructors when trying to provide personalised support to learners due to large numbers of registered participants. Conversational agents can be of help to support learners when working with MOOCs. This article presents an adaptive learning module for JavaPAL a conversational agent that complements a MOOC on Java programming helping learners review the key concepts of the MOOC. This adaptive learning module adapts the difficulty of the questions provided to learners considering their level of knowledge using item response theory (IRT) and also provides recommendations of video fragments extracted from the MOOC for when learners fail questions. The adaptive learning module for JavaPAL has been evaluated showing good usability and learnability through the system usability scale (SUS) reasonably suitable video fragments recommendations for learners and useful visualisations generated as part of the IRT-based adaptation of questions for instructors to better understand what is happening in the course to design exams and to redesign the course content. Implications for practice or policy: A conversational agent that adapts the questions provided to learners using Item Response Theory (IRT) can be helpful for learners to review the concepts of a MOOC. A conversational agent that provides video fragments recommendations can be helpful for learners to improve their performance when answering questions from a MOOC. IRT-based visualisations of item characteristic curves and item information curves can be helpful to redesign the contents of a MOOC.;2021
Mental disorders are widespread in countries all over the world. Nevertheless there is a global shortage in human resources delivering mental health services. Leaving people with mental disorders untreated may increase suicide attempts and mortality. To address this matter of limited resources conversational agents have gained momentum in the last years. In this work we introduce SERMO a mobile application with integrated chatbot that implements methods from cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to support mentally ill people in regulating emotions and dealing with thoughts and feelings. SERMO asks the user on a daily basis on events that occurred and on emotions. It determines automatically the basic emotion of a user from the natural language input using natural language processing and a lexicon-based approach. Depending on the emotion an appropriate measurement such as activities or mindfulness exercises are suggested by SERMO. Additional functionalities are an emotion diary a list of pleasant activities mindfulness exercises and information on emotions and CBT in general. User experience was studied with 21 participants using the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). Findings show that efficiency perspicuity and attractiveness are considered as good. The scales describing hedonic quality (stimulation and novelty) i.e. fun of use show neutral evaluations.;2021
Moral education refers to the cultivation of ideals moral quality culture and discipline. One of its main tasks is to analyze students' problem behaviors and identify their underlying need deficiencies. Previous psychological research has focused on studying how distinct factors affect psychological needs and problem behaviors. However these findings have provided only scattered guidelines for identifying students' need deficiencies which are difficult for inexperienced teachers and parents to apply systematically. To address these issues we attempt to answer two key research questions in this work. First how do we define a theoretical framework so that the psychological research findings can be systematically applied to identify students' need deficiencies? Second can the latest AI technologies be employed to identify such need deficiencies automatically? To answer these research questions we first build a theoretical framework to summarize all the factors relevant to the students' problem behaviors and need deficiencies. After that we propose and develop a task-oriented dialogue system that can properly inquire about different aspects of students' information and automatically infer their need deficiencies. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the system's performance with real-life cases. The results show that the built dialogue system could effectively serve as a diagnostic tool to identify the students' need deficiencies.;2021
Multimodality in dialogue systems has opened up new frontiers for the creation of robust conversational agents. Any multimodal system aims at bridging the gap between language and vision by leveraging diverse and often complementary information from image audio and video as well as text. For every task-oriented dialog system different aspects of the product or service are crucial for satisfying the user's demands. Based upon the aspect the user decides upon selecting the product or service. The ability to generate responses with the specified aspects in a goal-oriented dialogue setup facilitates user satisfaction by fulfilling the user's goals. Therefore in our current work we propose the task of aspect controlled response generation in a multimodal task-oriented dialog system. We employ a multimodal hierarchical memory network for generating responses that utilize information from both text and images. As there was no readily available data for building such multimodal systems we create a Multi-Domain Multi-Modal Dialog (MDMMD++) dataset. The dataset comprises the conversations having both text and images belonging to the four different domains such as hotels restaurants electronics and furniture. Quantitative and qualitative analysis on the newly created MDMMD++ dataset shows that the proposed methodology outperforms the baseline models for the proposed task of aspect controlled response generation.;2021
Multi-turn response selection is a major task in building intelligent dialogue systems. Most existing works focus on modeling the semantic relationship between the utterances and the candidate response with neural networks like RNNs and various attention mechanisms. In this paper we study how to leverage the advantage of pre-trained language models (PTMs) to multi turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots. We propose a deep context modeling architecture (DCM) for multi-turn response selection by utilizing BERT as the context encoder. DCM is formulated as a four-module architecture namely contextual encoder utterance-to-response interaction features aggregation and response selection. Moreover in DCM we introduce the next utterance prediction as a pre-training scheme based on BERT aiming to adapt general BERT to accommodate the inherent context continuity underlying the multi-turn dialogue. Taking BERT as the backbone encoder we then investigate a variety of strategies to perform response selection with comprehensive comparisons. Empirical results on three public datasets from two different languages show that our proposed model outperforms existing promising models significantly pushing recall to 86.8% (+5.2% improvement over BERT) on Ubuntu Dialogue corpus recall to 68.5% (+6.4% improvement over BERT) on E-Commerce Dialogue corpus MAP and MRR to 61.6% and 64.9% respectively (+2.3% and 1.8% improvement over BERT) on Douban Conversation corpus achieving new state-of-the-art performance for multi-turn response selection.;2021
Natural Language Generation (NLG) plays a critical role in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs) aims at converting a meaning representation into natural language utterances. Recent deep learning-based generators have shown improving results irrespective of providing sufficient annotated data. Nevertheless how to build a generator that can effectively utilize as much of knowledge from a low-resource setting data is a crucial issue for NLG in SDSs. This paper presents a variational-based NLG framework to tackle the NLG problem of having limited annotated data in two scenarios domain adaptation and low-resource in-domain training data. Based on this framework we propose a novel adversarial domain adaptation NLG taclking the former issue while the latter issue is also handled by a second proposed dual variational model. We extensively conducted the experiments on four different domains in a variety of training scenarios in which the experimental results show that the proposed methods not only outperform previous methods when having sufficient training dataset but also show its ability to work acceptably well when there is a small amount of in-domain data or adapt quickly to a new domain with only a low-resource target domain data.

Navigation based task-oriented dialogue systems provide users with a natural way of communicating with maps and navigation software. Natural language understanding (NLU) is the first step for a task-oriented dialogue system. It extracts the important entities (slot tagging) from the user's utterance and determines the user's objective (intent determination). Word embeddings are the distributed representations of the input sentence and encompass the sentence's semantic and syntactic representations. We created the word embeddings using different methods like FastText ELMO BERT and XLNET and studied their effect on the natural language understanding output. Experiments are performed on the Roman Urdu navigation utterances dataset. The results show that for the intent determination task XLNET based word embeddings outperform other methods while for the task of slot tagging FastText and XLNET based word embeddings have much better accuracy in comparison to other approaches.;2021
New technologies tools and methodologies have been used in the Cultural Heritage (CH) scenarios to assist the visitor to enrich and enjoy his experiences during the visit. Intelligent information systems based upon machine learning approaches have been specifically designed for CH to enhance the quality of services in art exhibitions and events. In this work we show an innovative framework that can be specifically designed to help visitors during his/her visit by answering to their questions. We also describe a system architecture and a case study in a well-defined CH context.;2021
Nowadays chatbots is one of the fast rising artificial intelligence (AI) trend relates to the utilisation of applications that interact with users in a conversational format and mimic human conversation. Chatbots allow business to enhance customer experiences and fulfil expectations through real-time interactions in e-commerce environment. Therefore factors influence consumer's trust in chatbots is critical. This study demonstrates a chatbots trust model to empirically investigate consumer's perception by questionnaire from self-reported approach and by electroencephalography (EEG) from neuroscience approach. This study starts from integrating three key elements of chatbots in terms of machine communication quality aspect human-computer interaction (HCI) aspect and human use and gratification (U&G) aspects. Moreover this study chooses EEG instrument to explore the relationship between trust and purchase intention in chatbots condition. We collect 204 questionnaires and invite 30 respondents to participate the survey. The results indicated that credibility competence anthropomorphism social presence and informativness have influence on consumer's trust in chatbots in turn have effect on purchase intention. Moreover the findings show that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal gyrus are significantly associated with building a trust relationship by inferring chatbots to influence subsequent behaviour.;2021
Nowadays new technologies are taking place for enabling conversational interactions between users and bots. Creating conversational interfaces (CI) paves the way for new design challenges. Designers need to use appropriate design specifications for creating a logically sound dialogue endowed with proper visual cues in the case of chatbots that captures the entire user experience. To do it they need the help of domain experts. Experts in mobility environment energy e-health weather etc. are the only ones who well-know the specific domain in which the bot will act. Current tools used to design interactive flows of dialogue entail deep programming skills their users need to know. Starting from this consideration the paper proposes a design environment that offers experts the possibility to design a flow of dialogue without getting lost in technicalities. By using visual language the expert can specify intents actions entities and parameters at the base of the flow of dialogue on which the bot will be created. Then our engine automatically translates into a bot compliant with the Google DialogFlow technology. Finally the paper present a preliminary analysis of the system carried out to test its features and how these are reflected in its ease of use.;2021
Nowadays smartphone applications (apps) are literally used in all life aspects improving the quality of different services in addition to saving time and effort. However the majority of currently used apps in different universities around the world are limited in their features and not very popular among students who may suffer to get useful information using traditional guiding methods. However the importance of these apps is constantly increasing especially in times of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic during which people were forced to work from home and the human interaction was reduced to its minimal degree. In this paper we present a Student Interactive Assistant Android Application with Chatbot (SIAAA-C) which is basically a personal electronic guide that is used by students to get various and effective academic services. The app has a number of useful features including a campus map multiple types of notifications and most important an efficient built in chatbot that responds to both Arabic and English written queries and covers a wide range of academic topics ranging from basic to complex. Even more SIAAA-C was designed to have Arabic and English interfaces to be used in the University of Jordan (UoJ) which has one of the biggest campuses in the Arabic area with more than 40000 local and foreign students. Moreover SIAAA-C was practically tested in a real-life environment by a group of UoJ students who were selected from different faculties during the pandemic peak period and the feedbacks were very promising based on the outcomes of an evaluation survey that was answered by 102 students after a 1-month test period.;2021
Nowadays the application of location-aware devices such as global positioning system (GPS)-enabled mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) is increasing. Based on this a new demand for efficiently storing trajectory data has arisen. Trajectory compression reduces the storage space and cost the cost and time of data transmission by retaining critical trajectory points and effectively eliminating redundant data. Herein a novel trajectory compression method based on stay points (TCSP) is proposed. By using the road network data and the stay points of GPS trajectory data to compress the GPS trajectory data this method can greatly improve the ratio and accuracy of compression. Experimental results based on real data sets show that the compression rate of this method can stably reach 8.61% and the compression effect can be restored to the original trajectory route. Compared with the critical point algorithm and the Douglas-Peucker (DP) algorithm the TCSP method can reach a better compression effect and compression ratio.;2021
OBJECTIVE: To examine user uptake and experience with a clinical chathot that automates hereditary cancer risk triage by collecting personal and family cancer history in routine women's health care settings. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective observational study of patients who used a web-based chathot before routine care appointments to assess their risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer Lynch syndrome and adenomatous polyposis syndromes. Outcome measures included uptake and completion of the risk-assessment and educational section of the chathot interaction and identification of hereditary cancer risk as evaluated against National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. RESULTS: Of the 95166 patients invited 61070 (64.2%) engaged with the clinical chathot. The vast majority completed the cancer risk assessment (89.4%) and most completed the genetic testing education section (71.4%) indicating high acceptability among those who opted to engage. The mean duration of use was 15.4 minutes (SD 2 hours 56.2 minutes) when gaps of inactivity longer than 5 minutes were excluded. A personal history of cancer was reported by 19.1% (10849/56656) and a family history of cancer was reported by 66.7% (36469/54652) of patients who provided the relevant information. One in four patients (14850/54547) screened with the chatbot before routine care appointments met National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for genetic testing. Among those who were tested 5.6% (73/1313) had a disease-causing pathogenic variant. CONCLUSION: A chathot digital health tool can help identify patients at high risk for hereditary cancer syndromes before routine care appointments. This scalable intervention can effectively provide cancer risk assessment engage patients with educational information and facilitate a path toward preventive genetic testing.;2021
Objective To assess the quality and accuracy of online videos about the medical management of nephrolithiasis. Materials and Methods To evaluate trends in online interest we first examined the frequency of worldwide YouTube searches for 'kidney stones' from 2015 to 2020. We then queried YouTube with terms related to symptoms and treatment of kidney stones and analysed English-language videos with >5000 views. Quality was assessed using the validated DISCERN instrument. Evidence-based content analysis of video content and viewer comments was performed. Results Online searches for videos about kidney stones doubled between 2015 and 2019 (P < 0.001). We analysed 102 videos with a median (range) number of views of 46 539 (5024-3 631 322). The mean (sd)DISCERN score was 3.0 (1.4) out of 5 indicating 'moderate' quality scores were significantly higher for the 21 videos (21%) authored by academic hospitals (mean 3.7 vs 2.8P = 0.02). Inaccurate or non-evidence-based claims were identified in 23 videos (23%) none of the videos authored by academic institutions contained inaccurate claims. Videos with inaccurate statements had more than double the viewer engagement (viewer-generated comments 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' ratings) compared to videos without inaccuracies (P < 0.001). Among viewer comments 43 videos (43%) included comments with inaccurate or non-evidence-based claims and a large majority (82 videos 80%) had 'chatbot' recommendations. Conclusions Interest in YouTube videos about nephrolithiasis has doubled since 2015. While highly viewed videos vary widely in quality and accuracy videos produced by academic hospitals have significantly fewer inaccurate claims. Given the high prevalence of stone disease and poor-quality videos patients should be directed to evidence-based content online.;2021
Objective We examined the potential of conversational agents (CAs) to support older adults' self-care related to chronic illness in light of lessons learned from decades of pedagogical agent research which investigates the impact and efficacy of CAs for a wide range of learners. Background The role of CAs in education (i.e. pedagogical agents) has been long studied but their potential for supporting self-care has received less attention especially for older adults. Methods We reviewed work on pedagogical agents and considered how it informs the design of CAs for older adults. We propose a framework for designing CAs to support older adult self-care which organizes a review of work in this area and integration with the pedagogical agent literature. Results Our review of the pedagogical agent literature revealed an evolution from teaching machines to interactive social systems that influence student motivational as well as learning outcomes. To integrate this review with work on CAs and self-care we developed a framework that specifies how self-care goals evolve with stages of an illness communication goals that support self-care at each stage patient needs and requirements for CAs to support these needs. The review identified an agenda for future research on CA functions and features that help older adults accept need for self-care establish self-care and sustain self-care over time. Conclusions Integrating insights from the pedagogical agent literature with research on developing CAs for self-care defines an agenda for developing and evaluating CAs to help older adults manage illness.;2021
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of closed-loop management on nursing disruption risk. Methods: Using a quasi-experimental research method convenient sampling was used to extract 20 nurses working at our hospital as the research objects. The control group members were selected from January to March 2018 via the traditional method and the experimental group members were selected from April to June 2018 via the closed-loop management method. At three months before and after the implementation of the management model a self-designed quantitative test form and satisfaction questionnaire were used to analyze the frequency of nursing disruption events the accuracy rate of doctors' advice the average drug delivery time of the static distribution center the implementation rate of personal digital assistant (PDA) code scanning and the report rate of risk-outcome nursing disruption events. Results: After the implementation of the management model the frequency of nursing disruptions and average drug delivery time of the static distribution center were significantly lower than before and the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Moreover the accuracy rate of doctors' advice the implementation rate of PDA code scanning and the reporting rate of risk-outcome nursing disruption events were significantly higher than before and these differences were statistically significant as well (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The application of a closed-loop management model could significantly reduce the occurrence and optimize the outcomes of nursing disruption events and improve the work processes of medical care.;2021
Objective: To elucidate whether Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa provides evidence-based support as a supplement to provider-facilitated prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Using a conceptual content analysis approach a query of 40 questions relating to all phases of pregnancy was collected from Alexa by two independent investigators using two unique devices over a one-week period between May 20 2020 and May 27 2020. Alexa's responses were matched to the evidence-based content from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and reviewed by a Certified Nurse Midwife for completeness and currency. Results: Of the 40 questions asked of Alexa it was unable to answer 14 questions (35%). A total of 21 out of the 40 responses (52%) were not evidence-based and three COVID-specific questions (about 1%) were answered incorrectly or insufficiently. Four questions (10%) were answered accurately. Conclusion: Alexa was largely unable to provide evidence-based answers to commonly asked pregnancy questions and in many cases supplied inaccurate incomplete or completely unrelated answers that could further confuse health consumers. Practice Implications: Ensuring that mobile health (mhealth) tools such as Amazon Alexa are evidence-based and credible in answering common prenatal questions has important implications for this pandemic and future consumer needs.

Objective: To report the early experience using an automated chatbot (Chats) for patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and symptom self-management in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing radiation treatment (RT). Methods: Patients aged >= 18 years diagnosed with HNC who were scheduled to begin RT were given the option to use Chats from June 2018 to June 2019. Enrolled patients received chat notifications two days before weekly ontreatment visits and every 1-4 weeks after RT for an additional 4 months. After the first in-person follow-up visit participants completed an electronic usability and satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Of 95 patients who agreed to participate 84 were eligible for analysis. Participants were significantly younger than patients who declined participation (mean age 61.3 vs 68.3 years p-value < 0.001). Patient engagement with Chats was highest at 67% during the first month and declined over time (p-value = 0.004). Concordance between PRO and clinician-reported outcomes (CRO) was fair ranging from 0.10 to 0.43 (Cohen kappa statistics). The most commonly under-reported symptoms were salivary duct inflammation (53%) xerostomia (41%) and mucositis (37%). 89% (39 of 44) of patients who completed surveys found Chats easy to use and 61% reported that Chats helped with symptom self-management and reduced the need to call the care team. Conclusions: These early results suggest that an interactive chatbot is feasible and provides support for HNC patients during and after RT. Chats identified discordance between PRO and CRO. Further study is required to measure benefits of Chats in a larger population.;2021
Objective: To support informed decision-making about reanalysis of clinical genomic data for risk of preventable conditions ('additional findings') by developing a chatbot (electronic genetic resource 'eDNA'). Methods: Interactions in pre-test genetic counseling sessions (13.5 h) about additional findings were characterized using proponent thematic and semantic analyses of transcripts. We then wrote interfaces to draw supplementary data from external genetics applications. To create Edna this content was programmed using a chatbot framework which interacts with patients via speech-to-text. Results: Conditions terms explanations of concepts and key factors to consider in decision making were all encoded into chatbot conversations emulating counseling session flows. Patient agency can be enhanced by prompted consideration of the personal and familial implications of testing. Similarly health literacy can be broadened through explanation of genetic conditions and terminology. Novel aspects include sentiment analysis and collection of family history. Medical advice and the impact of existing genetic conditions were deemed inappropriate for inclusion. Conclusion: Edna's successful development represents a movement towards accessible acceptable and well-supported digital health processes for patients to make informed decisions for additional findings. Practice implications: Edna complements genetic counseling by collecting and providing genomic information before or after pre-test consultations. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Omni-channel marketing is an enhanced cross-channel business model involving shared data that allows enterprises to enhance and facilitate customer experience. Omni-channel opportunities shape retail business and shopper behaviours by coordinating data across all channel platforms while enabling their simultaneous use. Artificial intelligence (AI) has played an increasingly critical role in marketing analysis. With the proper training AI can predict consumer preferences and provide recommendations based on historical data to achieve precision marketing in e-commerce. At present however the existent chatbots on many product-ordering platforms lack AI refinement resulting in the need to ask customers multiple questions before generating a reliable suggestion yet an effective way to incorporate AI in an omni-channel platform has remained vague. Hence the aim of this study was to develop an omni-channel chatbot that incorporates iOS Android and web components. The chatbot was designed to achieve personalised service and precision marketing using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A shared kitchen case study demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method which is transferable to other consumer applications such as clothing selection or personalised services. The number of food offerings and the quality of image classifiers set the research limitations pointing toward the direction of future research.;2021
One important problem in MOOCs is the lack of personalized support from teachers. Conversational agents arise as one possible solution to assist MOOC learners and help them to study. For example conversational agents can help review key concepts of the MOOC by asking questions to the learners and providing examples. JavaPAL a voice-based conversational agent for supporting learners on a MOOC on programming with Java offered on edX. This paper evaluates JavaPAL from different perspectives. First the usability of JavaPAL is analyzed obtaining a score of 74.41 according to a System Usability Scale (SUS). Second learners' performance is compared when answering questions directly through JavaPAL and through the equivalent web interface on edX getting similar results in terms of performance. Finally interviews with JavaPAL users reveal that this conversational agent can be helpful as a complementary tool for the MOOC due to its portability and flexibility compared to accessing the MOOC contents through the web interface.;2021
One of the biggest challenges for EFL (English as Foreign Language) students to learn English is the lack of practicing environments. Although language researchers have attempted to conduct flipped classrooms to increase the practicing time in class EFL students generally have difficulties interacting with peers and teachers in English in class. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence ( AI) provides an opportunity to address this problem. With AI technologies computer systems in particular in the form of AI chatbots are able to identify the meanings of users' statements and make responses accordingly. In the research design AI-based chatbots were employed in the in-class and out-of-class activities for facilitating the students' speaking performance and interactions during the learning process in a university flipped English speaking classroom. The experimental results show that the mind map-guided AI chatbot approach (MM-AI) promoted the students' English speaking performances more than did the conventional AI chatbot approach (C-AI). Moreover the MMAI also promoted the students' learning performance and organized the interaction between the robots and humans more than the C-AI did. The findings could be a valuable reference for language educators and researchers who intend to conduct AI-supported flipped classrooms in language learning.;2021
Online healthcare consultation offers people a convenient way to consult doctors. In this paper we aim at building a generative dialog system for Chinese healthcare consultation. As the original Seq2seq architecture tends to suffer the issue of generating low-quality responses the multi-source Seq2seq architecture generating more informative responses is much more preferred in this task. The multi-source Seq2seq architecture takes advantage of retrieval techniques to obtain responses from the database and then takes these responses alongside the user-issued question as input. However some of the retrieved responses might be not much related to the user-issued question resulting in the generation of unsatisfying responses that are not correct in diagnosis or instead provide inappropriate advice on prevention or treatment. Therefore this paper proposes multi-source Seq2seq guided by knowledge (MSSGK) to handle this problem. MSSGK differs from the multi-source Seq2seq architecture in that domain knowledge including disease labels and topic labels about prevention and treatment is introduced into the response generation via a multi-task learning framework. To better exploit the domain knowledge we propose three attention mechanisms to provide more appropriate guidance for response generation. Experimental results on a dataset of real-world healthcare consultation show the effectiveness of the proposed method.;2021
Online Social Networks (OSNs) are witnessing sophisticated cyber threats that are generally conducted using fake or compromised profiles. Automated agents (aka socialbots) a category of sophisticated and modern threat entities are the native of the social media platforms and responsible for various modern weaponized information-related attacks such as astroturfing misinformation diffusion and spamming. Detecting socialbots is a challenging and vital task due to their deceiving character of imitating human behavior. To this end this paper presents an attention-aware deep neural network model DeepSBD for detecting socialbots on OSNs. The DeepSBD models users' behavior using profile temporal activity and content information. It jointly models OSN users' behavior using Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. It models profile temporal and activity information as sequences which are fed to a two-layers stacked BiLSTM whereas content information is fed to a deep CNN. We have evaluated DeepSBD over five real-world benchmark datasets and found that it performs significantly better in comparison to the state-of-the-arts and baseline methods. We have also analyzed the efficacy of DeepSBD at different ratios of socialbots and benign users and found that an imbalanced dataset moderately affects the classification accuracy. Finally we have analyzed the discrimination power of different behavioral components and it is found that both profile characteristics and content behavior are most impactful whereas diurnal temporal behavior is the least effective for detecting socialbots on OSNs.;2021
Open-domain dialog generation which is a crucial component of artificial intelligence is an essential and challenging problem. In this article we present a personalized dialog system which leverages the advantages of multitask learning and reinforcement learning for personalized dialogue generation (MRPDG). Specifically MRPDG consists of two subtasks: 1) an author profiling module that recognizes user characteristics from the input sentence (auxiliary task) and 2) a personalized dialog generation system that generates informative grammatical and coherent responses with reinforcement learning algorithms (primary task). Three kinds of rewards are proposed to generate high-quality conversations. We investigate the effectiveness of three widely used reinforcement learning methods [i.e. Q-learning policy gradient and actor-critic (AC) algorithm] in a personalized dialog generation system and demonstrate that the AC algorithm achieves the best results on the underlying framework. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model on two real-life data sets. Experimental results illustrate that MRPDG is able to produce high-quality personalized dialogs for users with different characteristics. Quantitatively the proposed model can achieve better performance than the compared methods across different evaluation metrics such as the human evaluation BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and perplexity.;2021
Organizations introduce virtual assistants (VAs) to support employees with work-related tasks. VAs can increase the success of teamwork and thus become an integral part of the daily work life. However the effect of VAs on virtual teams remains unclear. While social identity theory describes the identification of employees with team members and the continued existence of a group identity the concept of the extended self refers to the incorporation of possessions into one's sense of self. This raises the question of which approach applies to VAs as teammates. The article extends the IS literature by examining the impact of VAs on individuals and teams and updates the knowledge on social identity and the extended self by deploying VAs in a collaborative setting. Using a laboratory experiment with N = 50 two groups were compared in solving a task where one group was assisted by a VA while the other was supported by a person. Results highlight that employees who identify VAs as part of their extended self are more likely to identify with team members and vice versa. The two aspects are thus combined into the proposed construct of virtually extended identification explaining the relationships of collaboration with VAs. This study contributes to the understanding on the influence of the extended self and social identity on collaboration with VAs. Practitioners are able to assess how VAs improve collaboration and teamwork in mixed teams in organizations.;2021
Our everyday lives are increasingly pervaded by digital assistants and smart devices forming the Internet of Things (IoT). While user interfaces to directly monitor and control individual IoT devices are becoming more sophisticated and end-user friendly applications to connect standalone IoT devices and create more complex IoT processes for automating and assisting users with repetitive tasks still require a high level of technical expertise and programming knowledge. Related approaches for process modelling in IoT mostly suggest extensions to complex modelling languages require high levels of abstraction and technical knowledge and rely on unintuitive tools. We present a novel approach for end-user oriented-no-code-IoT process modelling using Mixed Reality (MR) technology: HoloFlows. Users are able to explore the IoT environment and model processes among sensors and actuators as first-class citizens by simply drawing virtual wires among physical IoT devices. MR technology hereby facilitates the understanding of the physical contexts and relations among the IoT devices and provides a new and more intuitive way of modelling IoT processes. The results of a user study comparing HoloFlows with classical modelling approaches show an increased user experience and decrease in required modelling knowledge and technical expertise to create IoT processes.;2021
Our field experiment extends prior work on college matriculation by testing the extent to which an artificially intelligent (AI) chatbot's outreach and support to college students (N = 4442) reduced summer melt and improved first-year college enrollment at a 4-year university. Specifically we investigate which students the intervention proves most effective for. We find that the AI chatbot increased overall success with navigating financial aid processes such that student take up of educational loans increased by four percentage points. This financial aid effect was concentrated among would-be first-generation college goers for whom loan acceptances increased by eight percentage points. In addition the outreach increased first-generation students' success with course registration and fall semester enrollment each by three percentage points. Our findings suggest that proactive chatbot outreach to students is likely to be most successful in reducing summer melt among those who may need the chatbot support the most.;2021
Overweight obesity and cardiometabolic diseases are major global health concerns. Lifestyle factors including diet have been acknowledged to play a key role in the solution of these health risks. However as shown by numerous studies and in clinical practice it is extremely challenging to quantify dietary behaviors as well as influencing them via dietary interventions. As shown by the limited success of 'one-size-fits-all' nutritional campaigns catered to an entire population or subpopulation the need for more personalized coaching approaches is evident. New technology-based innovations provide opportunities to further improve the accuracy of dietary assessment and develop approaches to coach individuals towards healthier dietary behaviors. Pride & Prejudice (P&P) is a unique multi-disciplinary consortium consisting of researchers in life nutrition ICT design behavioral and social sciences from all four Dutch Universities of Technology. P&P focuses on the development and integration of innovative technological techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning conversational agents behavior change theory and personalized coaching to improve current practices and establish lasting dietary behavior change.;2021
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and their use in the clinical workflow can improve cancer survivors' outcomes and quality of life. However there are several challenges regarding efficient collection of the patient-reported outcomes and their integration into the clinical workflow. Patient adherence and interoperability are recognized as main barriers. This work implements a cancer-related study which interconnects artificial intelligence (spoken language algorithms conversational intelligence) and natural sciences (embodied conversational agents) to create an omni-comprehensive system enabling symmetric computer-mediated interaction. Its goal is to collect patient information and integrate it into clinical routine as digital patient resources (the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). To further increase convenience and simplicity of the data collection a multimodal sensing network is delivered. In this paper we introduce the main components of the system including the mHealth application the Open Health Connect platform and algorithms to deliver speech enabled 3D embodied conversational agent to interact with the cancer survivors in five different languages. The system integrates cancer patients' reported information as patient gathered health data into their digital clinical record. The value and impact of the integration will be further evaluated in the clinical study.;2021
People occasionally interact with each other through conversation. In particular we communicate through dialogue and exchange emotions and information from it. Emotions are essential characteristics of natural language. Conversational artificial intelligence is an integral part of all the technologies that allow computers to communicate like humans. For a computer to interact like a human being it must understand the emotions inherent in the conversation and generate the appropriate responses. However existing dialogue systems focus only on improving the quality of understanding natural language or generating natural language excluding emotions. We propose a chatbot based on emotion which is an essential element in conversation. EP-Bot (an Empathetic PolarisX-based chatbot) is an empathetic chatbot that can better understand a person's utterance by utilizing PolarisX an auto growing knowledge graph. PolarisX extracts new relationship information and expands the knowledge graph automatically. It is helpful for computers to understand a person's common sense. The proposed EP-Bot extracts knowledge graph embedding using PolarisX and detects emotion and dialog act from the utterance. Then it generates the next utterance using the embeddings. EP-Bot could understand and create a conversation including the person's common sense emotion and intention. We verify the novelty and accuracy of EP-Bot through the experiments.;2021
People's personality influences their behaviors attitudes beliefs and feelings. Therefore many scientific studies already benefit from easy ways of measuring personality. By analyzing the written text of a person it is possible to derive Big Five personality traits. One approach to this is to apply the unsupervised learning algorithm Global Vectors Word Embedding (or Representation) abbreviated GloVe to English Twitter posts. The overall objective of our research is to show that this algorithm can also be applied to German Twitter posts. Therefore we built a framework for training and applying machine learning models for personality predictions. We tested if a working prediction model for English Twitter users can be adapted for German users. This could reduce efforts for collecting training data. We evaluated our models based on a personality survey with a sample of German users. The method of adapting an existing model does not perform as well as expected but helps prepare the framework for higher volumes of data. In the end the final model is based on the evaluation data which results in an acceptable performance. Via a web application (https://www.miping.de) anyone can easily retrieve personality scores for any public German Twitter user. Altogether it is shown that GloVe is suitable to predict personality based on German language. The published framework and source code allow for independent improvements to and easy application of the trained model. Now scientific studies and other applications e.g. chatbots could easily incorporate personality data.;2021
Persuasion aims at forming one's opinion and action via a series of persuasive messages containing persuader's strategies. Due to its potential application in persuasive dialogue systems the task of persuasive strategy recognition has gained much attention lately. Previous methods on user intent recognition in dialogue systems adopt recurrent neural network (RNN) or convolutional neural network (CNN) to model context in conversational history neglecting the tactic history and intra-speaker relation. In this paper we demonstrate the limitations of a Transformer-based approach coupled with Conditional Random Field (CRF) for the task of persuasive strategy recognition. In this model we leverage inter- and intraspeaker contextual semantic features as well as label dependencies to improve the recognition. Despite extensive hyper-parameter optimizations this architecture fails to outperform the baseline methods. We observe two negative results. Firstly CRF cannot capture persuasive label dependencies possibly as strategies in persuasive dialogues do not follow any strict grammar or rules as the cases in Named Entity Recognition (NER) or part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Secondly the Transformer encoder trained from scratch is less capable of capturing sequential information in persuasive dialogues than Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We attribute this to the reason that the vanilla Transformer encoder does not efficiently consider relative position information of sequence elements. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Polymer matrix composites with embedded ceramic nanoparticles receive not only enhanced scientific but also technological interest due to their improved thermo-mechanical electrical magnetic and other properties. This materials' category is undoubtedly a promising new class of engineering materials suitable for applications such as stationary power systems cellular phones wireless personal digital assistants and hybrid electric vehicles. Ceramic/polymer nanocomposites exhibit multifunctional performance since they are able to combine structural integrity and appropriate thermal response with tunable dielectric behaviour. In this study boron nitride/epoxy resin nanocomposites were synthesized and their dielectric and mechanical properties were studied via broadband dielectric spectroscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis respectively. The increase in dielectric permittivity is caused by the augmentation of the macromolecular mobility at low filler content the higher permittivity values of boron nitride relative to epoxy resin and by the induced electrical heterogeneity in nanocomposites. Storage modulus appears to be filler dependent and decreases with reducing the filler content. The morphological and structural characterization of the nanocomposites was conducted via scanning electron microscopy X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in order to ensure the successful development of the specimens and the fine dispersion of the nanoparticles.;2021
Poor adherence to prescribed drug treatments is one of the leading causes of illness and treatment failure which increases re-hospitalizations. In Mexico the factors that most contribute to the non-adherence problem are age polypharmacy and education. For instance elderly patients are prescribed with an average of seven medications after they are discharged from hospitals and 25% of them face problems managing medications at home. A strategy that older adults use for medication adherence is to link their medication regimens to daily activities. We propose a system based in machine learning for audio-based activity recognition using Hidden Markov Models over Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients. The system triggers an assistive conversational agent that adapts its interaction model to the context detected. We report on two studies that provide evidence of the feasibility of our approach to assist older adults to develop consistent medication behaviors by associating them to daily routines. We first conducted an observational study with two older adults to understand the role of daily activities to develop consistent medication behaviors. Afterwards we conducted an in situ assessment of the audio-based activity recognition system with the two study subjects. Our results showed that anchor activities with an audible manifestation were recognized with an accuracy of 79% for subject 1 and 97.6% for subject 2. Additionally we validated how the integration of conversational agents into the system may support the mental association among activities and medication regimens that older adults fail to realize when for instance their intention plans involve multiple behaviors associated to an activity. The deployment of the proposed approach requires only a smart speaker which increases its feasibility of adoption in Latin American and other developing countries.;2021
Previous multi-turn dialogue approaches based on global Knowledge Graphs (KGs) still suffer from generic uncontrollable and incoherent responses generation. Most of them neither consider the local topic-level semantic information of KGs nor effectively merge the information of long dialogue contexts and KGs into the dialogue generation. To tackle these issues we propose a Topic-level Knowledge aware Dialogue Generation model to capture context-aware topic-level knowledge information. Our method thus accounts for topic-coherence fluency and diversity of generated responses. Specifically we first decompose the given KG into a set of topic-level sub-graphs with each sub-graph capturing a semantic component of the input KG. Furthermore we design a Topic-level Sub-graphs Attention Network to calculate the comprehensive representation of both sub-graphs and previous turns of dialogue utterances which then decoded with the current turn into a response. By using sub-graphs our model is able to attend to different topical components of the KG and enhance the topic-coherence. We perform extensive experiments on two datasets of DuRecDial and KdConv to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing strong baselines. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2021
Previous research has highlighted age-related differences in social perception in particular emotional expression processing. To date such studies have largely focused on approaches that use static emotional stimuli that the participant has to identify passively without the possibility of any interaction. In this study we propose an interactive virtual environment to better address age-related variations in social and emotional perception. A group of 22 young (18-30 years) and 20 older (60-80 years) adults were engaged in a face-to-face conversation with an embodied conversational agent. Participants were invited to interact naturally with the agent and to identify his facial expression. Their gaze behaviour was captured by an eye-tracking device throughout the interaction. We also explored whether the Big Five personality traits (particularly extraversion) and anxiety modulated gaze during the social interaction. Findings suggested that age-related differences in gaze behaviour were only apparent when decoding social signals (i.e. listening to a partner's question identifying facial expressions) and not when communicating social information (i.e. when speaking). Furthermore higher extraversion levels consistently led to a shorter amount of time gazing towards the eyes whereas higher anxiety levels led to slight modulations of gaze only when participants were listening to questions. Face-to-face conversation with virtual agents can provide a more naturalistic framework for the assessment of online socio-emotional interaction in older adults which is not easily observable in classical offline paradigms. This study provides novel and important insights into the specific circumstances in which older adults may experience difficulties in social interactions.;2021
Professional embodied conversational agents (ECAs) deployed in the market are dedicated to satisfying the digital customer relationship. However ECAs still suffer from a lack of user adoption in particular because most of them have few social skills. Inspired by social presence theories and based on the ergonomic components of user experience (CUE) model (Mahlke and Lindgaard 2007) the paper focuses on one social skill i.e. virtual intimacy a 3-dimensional concept including honesty and genuineness positivity and mutual comprehension. Virtual intimacy may be a way to reinforce the social dimension of human-agent interactions and to provide a better user experience. We therefore propose an interactive experiment that incorporates natural interactions between real tourists and an autonomously intimate virtual counselor who is an expert in tourism and able to express intimacy-related behaviors in verbal and nonverbal communication. The paper studies the impact of the agent?s expression of intimacy-related behaviors on the perception of virtual intimacy social presence and the user experience. The results show that users adopt a social attitude toward the intimate counselor and although they do not significantly perceive virtual intimacy they clearly perceive the dimension of honesty and genuineness. Moreover the agent?s expression of intimacy only enhances copresence the first perceptive level of social presence. Except for user social status which is enhanced the user experience is also not significantly influenced by intimate expression. The study results further demonstrate that perceiving virtual intimacy is a good predictor of social presence and user experience especially user emotional reactions. Perceiving virtual intimacy influences user experience independently of social presence which thereby indicates that independent intimacy-related mechanisms such as emotional contagion may be involved. Mediation analyses also underline that perceiving virtual intimacy has a direct effect on user emotional reactions but this finding is not supported by the CUE model. The findings in this study provide new evidence that perceiving virtual intimacy in humanagent interaction elicits emotions in users and enhances user experience. In line with this we propose an outline for an ECA-adapted user experience model based on the CUE model.;2021
Proper response selection is a crucial challenge in retrieval-based chatbots. The state-of-the-art methods match a response with the word sequence of a context or match the response with each utterance in the context and then accumulate matching information. The former architecture could lose some important local matching information in utterance-response pairs and does not explicitly capture the relationships and dependencies among utterances. The latter architecture does not consider the important global matching information because there is no match between the response and the context at word level. Hence the above methods have a problem without considering the fact that matching a response with different levels of a context could match different information for multi-turn response selection. In this work we propose a hierarchical matching network to match a response with the word and utterance level of a context. At word level we concatenate the multi-turn context as a long word sequence and then adopt a text matching model to match the response with the word sequence which can capture important matching information at word level. At utterance level we employ the identical text matching model to match the response with each utterance in the context to capture important matching information for each utterance-response pair and then accumulate the matching information by a recurrent neural network to model the relationships of utterances. At last the hierarchical matching information is fused to get the final matching information. Experiments on two large-scale public multi-turn response selection datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models.;2021
Psycholinguistic research can inform the design of dialogue systems for fault diagnosis. When users provide ambiguous symptom descriptions dialogue systems can reformulate these descriptions to check the correctness of their interpretation. The present study investigated whether such reformulations should be performed by users or dialogue systems and how they should be phrased. In a Wizard-of-Oz study subjects described faults symptoms to a chatbot which subsequently asked for clarification. Experiment 1 compared the effects of requests for subjects to self-correct their descriptions and reformulations provided by the dialogue system in either common or technical terms. Experiment 2 combined reformulations in common and technical terms with each other and with pictures of fault symptoms. The results revealed that requests for self-correction increased solution times and verbal effort that common terms decreased solution times but led to errors when seemingly easy reformulations were incorrect and that technical terms did not mislead subjects into accepting them uncritically. Enrichments with pictures reduced the risk of accepting incorrect reformulations and were considered particularly helpful when combined with common terms. Lexical alignment with dialogue system reformulations was low but subjects adopted its technical terms most readily when no common terms were provided. Taken together the results suggest that combining reformulations in everyday language with visual information is most suitable to support grounding.;2021
Purpose - This study aims to investigates customer satisfaction from the use of bank chatbots and the effect of perceived trust in chatbots and banks' reputation on customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach - A survey is conducted in Turkey involving 240 customers who experienced banking transactions using a chatbot. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is used to investigate the relationships between the variables. The data were analyzed using SPSS 21 and SmartPLS programs. Findings - Perceived performance perceived trust and corporate reputation significantly affect customer satisfaction with chatbot use. Customer expectations and confirmation of customer expectations have no direct impact on customer satisfaction but customer expectations positively affect perceived performance. Customer expectations exert an indirect influence on customer satisfaction through perceived performance. Perceived performance has a positive impact on the confirmation of customer expectations but customer expectations do not significantly impact the confirmation of customer expectations. Research limitations/implications - This study relies on a limited number of participants. Moreover its sample is not representative of the target population due to the convenience sampling technique. Even if the results may not be generalized to the entire population of Turkey they reflect the reality of emerging markets with relatively high technology sensitivity and a young population. Practical implications - The results provide new insights regarding banking service delivery channels which may be of interest to professionals academics banks' top management product development teams design teams and customer satisfaction units. Social implications - This study is believed to help the community make their lives easier by providing them with knowledge and awareness about chatbots. Originality/value- This study extends expectations confirmation theory's predictions to chatbot use in banking.;2021
Purpose Brands are increasingly considering the use of chatbots to supplement or even replace humans in service interactions. Like humans chatbots can follow certain service scripts in their encounters which can subsequently determine the customer experience. Service scripts are verbal prescriptions that seek to standardize customer service interactions. However while the role of service scripts is well documented despite the increasing use of chatbots as a service mechanism less is known about the effect on consumers of different service scripts presented during chatbot service encounters. Design/methodology/approach An experimental scenario was developed to test the research hypotheses. Respondents were randomly allocated to scenarios representing a 2 (service interaction: human chatbot) x 2 (service script: education entertainment) design. A total of 262 US consumers constituted the final sample for the study. Findings The findings indicate that when employing an education script a significant positive effect occurs for human service agents (compared to chatbots) in terms of both satisfaction and purchase intention. These effects are fully mediated by emotion and rapport showing that the bonds developed through the close proximity to a human service agent elicit emotion and develop rapport which in turn influence service outcomes. However this result is present only when an educational script is used. Originality This paper contributes to the emerging service marketing literature on the use of digital services in particular chatbots in service interactions. We show that differences occur in key outcomes dependent on the type of service script employed (education or entertainment). For managers this study indicates that chatbot interactions can be tailored (in script delivered) in order to maximize emotion and rapport and subsequently consumer purchase intention and satisfaction.;2021
Purpose Chatbot users' communication experience with disembodied conversational agents was compared with instant messaging (IM) users' communication experience with human conversational agents. The purpose of this paper is to identify what affects users' intention to reuse and whether they perceive any difference between the two. Design/methodology/approach A conceptual model was developed based on computer-mediated communication (CMC) and interpersonal communication theories. Data were collected online from four different continents (North America Europe Asia and Australia). Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to examine the research model. Findings The findings mainly reveal that media richness and social presence positively influence trust and reuse intention through task attraction and social attraction IM users reported significantly higher scores in terms of communication experience perceived attractiveness of the conversational agent and trust than chatbot users users' trust in the conversational agents is mainly determined by perceived task attraction. Research limitations/implications Customers' evaluation of the communication environment is positively related to their perceived competence of the conversational agent which ultimately affect their intention to reuse chatbot/IM. The findings reveal determinants of chatbot/IM adoption which have rarely been mentioned by previous work. Practical implications Practitioners should note that consumers in general still prefer to interact with human conversational agents. Practitioners should contemplate how to combine chatbot and human resources effectively to deliver the best customer service. Originality/value This study goes beyond the Computer as Social Actor paradigm and Technology Acceptance Model to understand chatbot and IM adoption. It is among one of the first studies that compare chatbot and IM use experience in the tourism and hospitality literature.;2021
Purpose Drawing on the self-determination theory the assemblage theory and customer experience literature this paper aims to develop a framework to understand motivational customer experiences with chatbots. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a multimethod approach to examine the interaction between individuals and airlines' chatbots. Three components of self-determined interaction with the chatbot (competence autonomy and relatedness) and five components of the customer-chatbot experience (sensory intellectual affective behavioral and social) are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings The findings confirm the direct influence of self-determined interaction on customer experience and the direct effects of these two constructs on participants' attitudes toward and satisfaction with the chatbot. The model also supports the mediating roles of customer experience and attitude toward the chatbot. Practical implications This paper offers managers a broad understanding of individuals' interactions with chatbots through three elements: motivation to use chatbots experiential responses and individuals' valuation of whether the interactions have amplified (or limited) the outcomes obtained from the experience. Originality/value This paper contributes to the hospitality and tourism literature with a hybrid approach that reflects on current theoretical developments regarding human- and interaction-centric interpretations of customer experience with chatbots.;2021
Purpose During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic face-to-face teaching has been severely disrupted and limited for medical students internationally. This study explores the views of medical students and academic medical staff regarding the suitability and limitations of a bespoke chatbot tool to support medical education. Methods Five focus groups with a total of 16 participants were recruited using a convenience sample. The participants included medical students across all year groups and academic staff. The pre-determined focus group topic guide explored how chatbots can augment existing teaching practices. A thematic analysis was conducted using the transcripts to determine key themes. Results Thematic analysis identified five main themes: (1) chatbot use as a clinical simulation tool (2) chatbot use as a revision tool (3) differential usefulness by medical school year group (4) standardisation of education and assessment (5) challenges of use and implementation. Conclusions Both staff and students have clear benefits from using chatbots in medical education. However they documented possible limitations to their use. The creation of chatbots to support the medical curriculum should be further explored and urgently evaluated to assess their impact on medical students training both during and after the global pandemic.;2021
Purpose Existing virtual agents (VAs) present in dialogue systems are either information retrieval based or static goal-driven. However in real-world situations end-users might not have a known and fixed goal beforehand for the task i.e. they may upgrade/downgrade/update their goal components in real-time to maximize their utility values. Existing VAs are unable to handle such dynamic goal-oriented situations. Methodology Due to the absence of any related dialogue dataset where such choice deviations are present we have created a conversational dataset called Deviation adapted Virtual Agent(DevVA) with the manual annotation of its corresponding intents slots and sentiment labels. A Dynamic Goal Driven Dialogue Agent (DGDVA) has been developed by incorporating a Dynamic Goal Driven Module (GDM) on top of a deep reinforcement learning based dialogue manager. In the course of a conversation the user sentiment provides grounded feedback about agent behavior including goal serving action. User sentiment appears to be an appropriate indicator for goal discrepancy that guides the agent to complete the user's desired task with gratification. The negative sentiment expressed by the user about an aspect of the provided choice is treated as a discrepancy that is being resolved by the GDM depending upon the observed discrepancy and current dialogue state. The goal update capability and the VA's interactiveness trait enable end-users to accomplish their desired task satisfactorily. Findings The obtained experimental results illustrate that DGDVA can handle dynamic goals with maximum user satisfaction and a significantly higher success rate. The interaction drives the user to decide its final goal through the latent specification of possible choices and information retrieved and provided by the dialogue agent. Through the experimental results (qualitative and quantitative) we firmly conclude that the proposed sentiment-aware VA adapts users' dynamic behavior for its goal setting with substantial efficacy in terms of primary objective i.e. task success rate (0.88). Practical implications In real world it can be argued that many people do not have a predefined and fixed goal for tasks such as online shopping movie booking & restaurant booking etc. They tend to explore the available options first which are aligned with their minimum requirements and then decide one amongst them. The DGDVA provides maximum user satisfaction as it enables them to accomplish a dynamic goal that leads to additional utilities along with the essential ones. Originality To the best of our knowledge this is the first effort towards the development of A Dynamic Goal Adapted Task-Oriented Dialogue Agent that can serve user goals dynamically until the user is satisfied.;2021
Purpose People with visual impairment comprise the second high disability population in Hong Kong but only two existing information centers provide information services for visually impaired people which is inadequate. Therefore this study aims to provide a more in-depth understanding of the information services for visually impaired people in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach People with visual impairment comprise the second high disability population in Hong Kong but only two existing information centers provide information services for visually impaired people which is inadequate. Therefore this study aims to provide a more in-depth understanding of the information services for visually impaired people in Hong Kong. Findings IAC's main problems include limited collection inconsistent multiple digital platforms for user access limited service hours and limited promotion. Some technological suggestions were proposed which include: expanding its electronic and special collections establishing a one-stop digital platform AI-based chatbot for automated caring chats and reference services and extending its social network marketing. Originality/value Scant studies focus on the information services and management of special libraries for visually impaired people especially in East Asia. On the other hand there are limited case studies analyzing libraries with value-chain analysis.;2021
Purpose The purpose of this study is to describe the development and psychometric properties of a novel game- and video-based assessment of social attributes. Despite their increasing adaption little research is available on the suitability of games and video analytics for measuring noncognitive attributes in the selection context. Design/methodology/approach The authors describe three novel assessments and their psychometric properties in a sample of 1300 participants: a game-based adaptation of an Emotion Recognition Task a chatbot-based situational judgment test for emotion management and a video-based conscientiousness assessment. Findings The novel assessments show good to moderate convergent validity for Emotional Recognition (r = 0.42) Emotion Management (r = 0.39) and Conscientiousness (r = 0.21). The video-based assessment demonstrates preliminary predictive validity for self-reported work performance. Novel game-based assessments (GBAs) are perceived as better designed and more immersive than traditional questionnaires. Adverse impact analysis indicates small group differences by age gender and ethnicity. Research limitations/implications Predictive validity findings need to be replicated using objective measures of performance such as performance ratings by supervisors and extended to the GBAs. Adverse impact should be evaluated using a real-life applicant pool and extended to additional groups. Practical implications Evidence for the psychometric validity of novel assessment formats supports their adoption in selection and recruitment. Improved user experience and shortened assessment times open up new areas of application. Originality/value This study gives first insights into psychometric properties of video- and game-based assessments of social attributes.;2021
Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the role of consumption emotion in the digital food-ordering experience by comparing the performances of the three digital ordering methods in an experimental design. Design/methodology/approach A research model was developed based on the Feelings-as-Information (FaI) theory and the expectancy-disconfirmation theory. A 3 x 2 between-subjects lab experiment was conducted to compare the three digital ordering methods (online mobile or chatbot) in two different types of restaurants (quick-service or full-service). Findings The results indicate that the chatbot ordering method evoked more negative emotions and less positive emotions than the other two methods. The online ordering method worked the best for quick-service restaurants whereas the mobile ordering method was most suitable for full-service restaurants. Both positive and negative emotions (comfort and annoyance) significantly mediated the relationships between the ordering method and internal responses (satisfaction and behavioral intention). Only one negative emotion (anger) significantly mediated the relationship between the ordering method and order amount. Originality/value This is the first study that attempts to explore and compare consumers' emotional responses resulting from restaurant digital ordering experiences in the context of the three food-ordering methods. The use of the FaI theory strengthens the theoretical foundation of research on emotion in the hospitality field. This study also pioneers the application of chatbot technology in the restaurant industry.;2021
Purpose The rapid evolution in artificial intelligence (AI) has redefined the customer experience and created huge opportunities for companies to interact with customers using chatbots. This study explores the role of AI chatbots in influencing the online customer experience and customer satisfaction in e-retailing. Design/methodology/approach A research model based on the technology acceptance model and information system success model is proposed to describe the interrelationships among chatbot adoption online customer experience and customer satisfaction. Personality is a moderator in the model. The authors used a quantitative approach to collect 425 useable online questionnaires and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) and SmartPLS to analyze the measurement model and proposed hypotheses. Findings The usability of the chatbot had a positive influence on extrinsic values of customer experience whereas the responsiveness of the chatbot had a positive impact on intrinsic values of customer experience. Furthermore online customer experience had a positive relationship with customer satisfaction and personality influenced the relationship between the usability of the chatbot and extrinsic values of customer experience. Originality/value This research extends understanding of the online customer experience with chatbots in e-retailing and provides empirical evidence by showing that extrinsic and intrinsic values of online customer experience are enhanced by chatbot adoption.;2021
Purpose This study presents one of the earliest empirical investigations on how brand chatbots' anthropomorphic design and social presence communication strategies may improve consumer evaluation outcomes via the mediators of parasocial interaction and perceived dialogue. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a 2 (high vs. low social presence communication) by 2 (anthropomorphic vs. non-anthropomorphic bot profile) between-subject experimental design to evaluate how chatbots' high social presence communication and anthropomorphic profile design may enhance perceptions of parasocial interactions and dialogue with the chatbot which in turn drive user engagement interaction satisfaction and attitude toward the represented brand. Findings The influences of chatbots' high social presence communication on consumer engagement outcomes are mediated by perceived parasocial interaction and dialogue. Additionally chatbots' anthropomorphic profile design can boost the positive effects of social presence communication via the psychological mediators. Originality/value This study advances the interactive marketing literature by focusing on an emerging interactive technology chatbots. Additionally distinct from prior chatbot studies that focused on the utilitarian use of chatbots for online customer support this study not only examines which factors of chatbot communication and profile design may drive chatbot effectiveness but also examines the mechanism underlying the messaging and design effects on consumer engagement. The findings highlight the mediating role of interpersonal factors of parasocial interaction and perceived dialogue.;2021
Purpose To provide better services to customers especially immediate responses and 24/7 availability businesses are implementing text-based automated conversational agents i.e. chatbots on their social platforms and websites. Chatbots are required to not only provide customers with necessary consultancy and guidance but also communicate friendly and socially. Based on the cognitive fit theory this study attempts to examine the role of chatbot as a decision aid and how the match between information presentation in forms of decisional guidance and communication style and the shopping task influences consumers' perceived cognitive fit and decision performance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach A 2 x 2 x 2 between subject online experiment was conducted to identify which kind of decisional guidance (suggestive and informative guidance) and communication style (task-oriented vs social-oriented style) are the most appropriate for each type of shopping task (searching vs browsing task). Findings The findings show that when customers interact with chatbots they will perceive higher cognitive fit if the chatbots provide them with suggestive guidance and communicate in a friendly style especially when they perform a searching task. Originality/value This study is the first attempt to understand the role of chatbots as a decision aid to customers using the communicative language. This study also tries to explore the cognitive fit theory in a novel way and we propose the information presentation in forms of communicative language rather than matrices tables and graphs.;2021
Purpose: Chatbots have been widely adopted to create more positive customer experiences as customers now spend more time in digital environments. Despite the technological advancement and benefits of chatbots for customer service research on chatbot applications for Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is limited. The absence of research explaining the struggles faced by SMEs contributes to the gap of SMEs' chatbot adoption. This research determines the features and elements that fit with SMEs' characteristics and their customers with chatbots. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach is used to understand SMEs' needs. Study 1 uses interviews with SME business owners and its customers it aims to explore the features that should be provided by chatbots for SME by identifying combinations between chatbots' generic features and SMEs' customer characteristics. Study 2 tests features identified in Study 1 and surveys 315 SMEs customers to empirically test featured chatbots' influence to anthropomorphism perceived enjoyment perceived ease of use perceived usefulness and how they affect SMEs' customer intentions to use chatbots and their shopping intentions. Findings -: The findings suggest four combinations of chatbot features that match SME customer characteristics: responsive simple steps to trigger customer actions humanized conversations and personalized recommendations. An experimental survey was designed by creating a chatbot prototype based on these features. The results show that the featured chatbot prototype affects higher anthropomorphism perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness compared to the standard chatbot. We also find that perceived enjoyment and usefulness positively affect customer's intention to shop and intention to use the chatbot. While anthropomorphism only affect customer's shopping intention to SMEs. Originality: This paper contributes to the emerging service literature on the use of chatbots service interactions particularly for SMEs. This research provides robust explorations from the perspective of both SME owners and customers. For practice the research provides guidelines on how to design a chatbot for SMEs that meet customers' needs.;2021
Purpose: To evaluate the usability of chatbot design and how chatbots and search compare for information delivery and usability we ran two test cases. In the first we focused only on chatbot usability information delivery and design. In the second we compared chatbot responses to those provided by search engines to identify areas of similarities and differences in terms of accuracy functionality and usability. Method: Test Case 1 uses an exploratory method to analyze chatbot functionality. Test Case 2 uses content analysis of search responses and corresponding chatbot responses. Data from two major telecommunication companies' websites-Sprint and Verizon-was used for both. Results: In Test Case 1 we found that chatbots are generally more flexible and helpful when they provide information directly in the chat pane and allow free-form text entry in addition to several other related characteristics. This was critical to receiving the information we needed efficiently and accurately. Results of Test Case 2 show that chatbots provide less information than search results have longer wait times and rely less on algorithms to get responses and more on constant updating. Conclusion: Based on Test Case 1 we developed a heuristic that addresses usability information design and accessibility. In Test Case 2 we determined that search functionality is better than that of chatbots in terms of 1) speed of response 2) accuracy of responses 3) multiple formats for content delivery and 4) ease of use and accessibility.;2021
Query-based document summarization aims to extract or generate a summary of a document which directly answers or is relevant to the search query. It is an important technique that can be beneficial to a variety of applications such as search engines document-level machine reading comprehension and chatbots. Currently datasets designed for query-based summarization are short in numbers and existing datasets are also limited in both scale and quality. Moreover to the best of our knowledge there is no publicly available dataset for Chinese query-based document summarization. In this paper we present QBSUM a high-quality large-scale dataset consisting of 49000+ data samples for the task of Chinese query-based document summarization. We also propose multiple unsupervised and supervised solutions to the task and demonstrate their high-speed inference and superior performance via both offline experiments and online A/B tests. The QBSUM dataset is released in order to facilitate future advancement of this research field. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2021
Question-answering chatbots have tremendous potential to complement humans in various fields. They are implemented using either rule-based or machine learning-based systems. Unlike the former machine learning-based chatbots are more scalable. Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning is one of the most popular approaches in machine learning-based chatbots and has shown remarkable progress since its introduction in 2014. However chatbots based on Seq2Seq learning show a weakness in that it tends to generate answers that can be generic and inconsistent with the questions thereby becoming meaningless and therefore may lower the chatbot adoption rate. This weakness can be attributed to three issues: question encoder overfit answer generation overfit and language model influence. Several recent methods utilize multitask learning (MTL) to address this weakness. However the existing MTL models show very little improvement over single-task learning wherein they still generate generic and inconsistent answers. This paper presents a novel approach to MTL for the Seq2Seq learning model called SEQ2SEQ++ which comprises a multifunctional encoder an answer decoder an answer encoder and a ternary classifier. Additionally SEQ2SEQ++ utilizes a dynamic tasks loss weight mechanism for MTL loss calculation and a novel attention mechanism called the comprehensive attention mechanism. Experiments on NarrativeQA and SQuAD datasets were conducted to gauge the performance of the proposed model in comparison with two recently proposed models. The experimental results show that SEQ2SEQ++ yields noteworthy improvements over the two models on bilingual evaluation understudy word error rate and Distinct-2 metrics.;2021
Recently chatbot research for conversation has been actively conducted in the field of natural language processing. Among the dialogue systems a retrieval-based system has emerged as an important one. Because it showed better performance than the response generation models and it actually seemed applicable. The response selection task is used to develop a retrieval-based system. Thus we did research to improve the performance of retrieval-based dialogue systems for response selection. We used Google's bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) natural-language processor with the robustly optimized BERT pre-training model (RoBERTa) as the base model to improve performance. The Recall@N of our model was improved by 1.7-4.2% using two methods: First instead of using a simple feed-forward network at the end of the model we employed a randomly wired neural network that contained multiple wiring paths thus achieving better performance than that of feed-forward networks. The experimental results of this study demonstrated that feed-forward networks can be replaced by randomly wired neural networks. Second we calculated the correlation between dialog history (i.e. context) and the last utterance of the context reflecting this correlation as an attention network that yielded an answer prediction. Using first and second method achieved higher performance than using only the first method in dialog response selection tasks.;2021
Recently many efforts have been devoted to generating responses expressing a specific emotion or relating to a given topic in a controlled manner. However limited attention has been given to generating responses with a specified syntactic pattern which makes it possible to imitate someone's way of speaking in dialogue. To fulfill this goal we propose two models to generate syntax-aware responses: a gross-constraint and a specific-constraint model. The former controls the syntactic patterns of generated responses at sentence-level while the latter works at smaller language units such as words or phrases being capable of manipulating the syntactic structures of responses in a more subtle manner. The extensive experimental results on two different datasets show that both the two models not only can generate meaningful responses with a specific and coherent structure but also improve on the diversity of generated responses with similar gains in readability relevance and diversity as measured by human judges.;2021
Recently similar entity searching over knowledge graph (KG) has gained much attentions by researchers. However in rich-semantic KGs with multi-typed entities and relations also known as heterogeneous information network relevant entity search is considered as a challenging task due to the ambiguity as well as complexity of user's queries in realistic applications such as QA chatbot and KG-based information retrieval. In this paper we propose a novel approach called W-KG2Vec which enables to automatically learn the semantic representations of entities in KG by applying the meta-path. The proposed W-KG2Vec is a meta-path-specific model which supports to evaluate both semantic relations as well as the text-based similarity between entities. The combination of text- and structure-based embedding mechanism of W-KG2Vec is promising to achieve better representations of entities in given KGs for handling complex user's queries. To effectively learn the sequential textual representations of entities' descriptions we propose a combination of BERT pre-trained model with LTSM encoder called BERT-Text2Vec. Then the text-based similarity between entities is used to leverage our weighted meta-path-based random walk mechanism in W-KG2Vec model. Extensive experiences on real-world KGs (YAGO and Freebase) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model against recent state-of-the-art KG embedding baselines.;2021
Recommender systems are software applications that help users to find items of interest in situations of information overload. Current research often assumes a one-shot interaction paradigm where the users' preferences are estimated based on past observed behavior and where the presentation of a ranked list of suggestions is themain one-directional form of user interaction. Conversational recommender systems (CRS) take a different approach and support a richer set of interactions. These interactions can for example help to improve the preference elicitation process or allow the user to ask questions about the recommendations and to give feedback. The interest in CRS has significantly increased in the past few years. This development is mainly due to the significant progress in the area of natural language processing the emergence of new voice-controlled home assistants and the increased use of chatbot technology. With this article we provide a detailed survey of existing approaches to conversational recommendation. We categorize these approaches in various dimensions e.g. in terms of the supported user intents or the knowledge they use in the background. Moreover we discuss technological approaches review how CRS are evaluated and finally identify a number of gaps that deserve more research in the future.;2021
Relation extraction has been an active research interest in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The past works primarily focused on a corpus of formal text which is inherently non-dialogic. Recently the dialogue-based relation extraction task which detects relations among speaker-aware entities scattering in dialogues has been gradually arousing people's attention. Some sequence-based neural methods have been carried out to obtain the relevant information. However identifying cross-sentence relations remains unsolved especially in the context of a specific-domain dialogue system. In this paper we propose a Relational Attention Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (RAEGCN) which constructs the whole dialogue as a semantic interactive graph by emphasizing the speaker-related information and leveraging various inter-sentence dependencies. A dense connectivity mechanism is also introduced to empower the multi-hop relational reasoning across sentences which can capture both local and non local features simultaneously. Experiments show the significant superiority and robustness of our model on a real-world dataset DialogRE as compared with previous approaches. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.;2021
Reminiscence therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention that helps mitigate unstable psychological and emotional states in patients with Alzheimer's disease where past experiences are evoked through conversations between the patients and their caregivers stimulating autobiographical episodic memory. It is highly recommended that people with Alzheimer regularly receive this type of therapy. In this paper we describe the development of a conversational system that can be used as a tool to provide reminiscence therapy to people with Alzheimer's disease. The system has the ability to personalize the therapy according to the patients information related to their preferences life history and lifestyle. An evaluation conducted with eleven people related to patient care (caregiver = 9 geriatric doctor = 1 care center assistant = 1) shows that the system is capable of carrying out a reminiscence therapy according to the patient information in a successful manner.;2021
Repetitive practice is one of the most important factors in improving the performance of motor skills. This paper focuses on the analysis and classification of forearm gestures in the context of violin playing. We recorded five experts and three students performing eight traditional classical violin bow-strokes: martele staccato detache ricochet legato tremolo colle and col legno. To record inertial motion information we utilized the Myo sensor which reports a multidimensional time-series signal. We synchronized inertial motion recordings with audio data to extract the spatiotemporal dynamics of each gesture. Applying state-of-the-art deep neural networks we implemented and compared different architectures where convolutional neural networks (CNN) models demonstrated recognition rates of 97.147% 3DMultiHeaded_CNN models showed rates of 98.553% and rates of 99.234% were demonstrated by CNN_LSTM models. The collected data (quaternion of the bowing arm of a violinist) contained sufficient information to distinguish the bowing techniques studied and deep learning methods were capable of learning the movement patterns that distinguish these techniques. Each of the learning algorithms investigated (CNN 3DMultiHeaded_CNN and CNN_LSTM) produced high classification accuracies which supported the feasibility of training classifiers. The resulting classifiers may provide the foundation of a digital assistant to enhance musicians' time spent practicing alone providing real-time feedback on the accuracy and consistency of their musical gestures in performance.;2021
Retailers are increasingly using conversational AI (chatbots) for customer service due to the perceived benefits and reduced operational costs of this emerging technology. Yet our understanding of how consumers perceive interactions with chatbots and how these interactions may influence other consumer service programs remains limited. This paper investigates the differences in consumers' sentiments towards chatbots across retail sectors and the influence chatbots have on consumers' sentiments and expectations towards other service interactions with online human agents. Using a hybrid automated sentiment analysis approach we identify that (1) overall sentiment towards bots are less negative than sentiment towards online human agents (2) these sentiments differ across fashion and telecommunications sectors and finally (3) sentiments towards online human agents in both sectors become more negative after a retailer implements a chatbot.;2021
Scientists in disciplines such as neuroscience and bioinformatics are increasingly relying on science gateways for experimentation on voluminous data as well as analysis and visualization in multiple perspectives. Though current science gateways provide easy access to computing resources data sets and tools specific to the disciplines scientists often use slow and tedious manual efforts to perform knowledge discovery to accomplish their research/education tasks. Recommender systems can provide expert guidance and can help them to navigate and discover relevant publications tools data sets or even automate cloud resource configurations suitable for a given scientific task. To realize the potential of integration of recommenders in science gateways in order to spur research productivity we present a novel OnTimeRecommend recommender system. The OnTimeRecommend comprises of several integrated recommender modules implemented as microservices that can be augmented to a science gateway in the form of a recommender-as-a-service. The guidance for use of the recommender modules in a science gateway is aided by a chatbot plug-in viz. Vidura Advisor. To validate our OnTimeRecommend we integrate and show benefits for both novice and expert users in domain-specific knowledge discovery within two exemplar science gateways one in neuroscience (CyNeuro) and the other in bioinformatics (KBCommons).;2021
Self-determination is a universal right and a central concept in support processes for people with disabilities. Enabling a disabled person to make choices and to have a life plan not influenced by the entourage are major challenges. In this context the aims of the present study are: 1) To design and develop a digital assistant for the elaboration of a life plan that is easily usable by future users (adapted to the cognitive characteristics of people with Down Syndrome (DS) 2) Assess the impact of the use of this assistant on the life plan autonomy and quality of life of people with DS. The design process resulted in the development of a mock-up two prototypes and the final version. Each version has been evaluated (user scenarios to evaluate objective usability and SUS scale and QUEST 2.0 to assess subjective usability and user satisfaction) and improved taking into account the comments from the previous step (37 adults with DS in total). Results confirm the relevance of the improvements made between the different versions and provide a final version offering a high degree of usability. The second objective was to assess the ability of the assistant (final version) to improve the life plan and the autonomy of such people. Evaluations were carried out on 9 adults (5 using the assistant and 4 control subjects who used a computer-based word game during the same period) using questionnaires relating to the life plan autonomy and quality of life of the users. After one month of using the assistant a positive impact was observed (compared to the control group) on the richness of the life plan and on the person's autonomy using the Ryff psychological well-being scales.;2021
Self-service technology (SST) benefits e-commerce firms by increasing operational efficiency and reducing labor costs while it also challenges firms in that service resources could be misused and service failure could be difficult to recover. Prior studies investigate either the bright (value co-creation) or the dark (value codestruction) side of SST in ?isolation? while this study examines SST with both perspectives in one integrated model. Using emerging Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) as a framework and augmenting it with attribution theory from the psychology area we better depict the nature of value-co-creation and value co-destruction that emerge in the SST usage process from a customer?s perspective. Specifically we consider six different SST use contexts composed of three types of resource misuse and two kinds of SST service failure to illuminate in what contexts SST customers choose to co-create or co-destruct value with SST firms. Using a survey with 413 respondents and a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative) our results show that customers are more likely to continuously co-create value with firms when they think resources are misused by themselves when experiencing process failure and when using an in-process co-creation strategy. In contrast customers tend to continuously co-destruct value when they think resources are misused by firms when experiencing an outcomefailure context and when using an in-process co-destruction strategy. Our proposed framework enables ecommerce firms to immediately trigger essential service recovery whenever service co-destruction occurs. We also discuss how firms can utilize the latest technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) behavioral big data and Chatbot to promptly co-create values hence contributing to future SST and e-commerce design.;2021
Sexual violence is a severe and chronic occurrence around the world that has not been resolved. The stigmatized nature of sexual violence has forced victims and survivors to accept prejudiced accusations cultivated from discriminatory norms when they are never at fault nor responsible for such violations against their sexuality. LAW-U is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot that gives legal guidance to survivors of sexual violence by recommending the most relevant Supreme Court decisions to the survivors' situations. In Thai LAW-U'' - pronounced similarly to (sic)'' - means I will wait for you'' which signifies the chatbot's unconditional support to the user. 182 Thai Supreme Court cases of sexual violence relating to Sections 276 277 278 and 279 of the Criminal Code were used to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines for LAW-U. Legal experts then generated mock-up dialogs from Supreme Court decisions which became the conversations used to train LAW-U. The computation of the similarity scores and the calculation of percentages of common keywords and keywords' synonyms were completed to increase the model's accuracy. When applying the model to the hold-out testing dataset the accuracy was 88.89% for an exact match between the user's input and the Supreme Court case - this confirmed that LAW-U was ready for real-life application. LAW-U's unique design hopes to act as a precedent for other works at home and abroad to perpetuate awareness of sexual violence and eliminate any tolerance against these crimes by empowering sexual violence victims and survivors to reaffirm their inherent rights.;2021
Simulated consultations through virtual patients allow medical students to practice history-taking skills. Ideally applications should provide interactions in natural language and be multi-case multi-specialty. Nevertheless few systems handle or are tested on a large variety of cases. We present a virtual patient dialogue system in which a medical trainer types new cases and these are processed without human intervention. To develop it we designed a patient record model a knowledge model for the history-taking task and a termino-ontological model for term variation and out-of-vocabulary words. We evaluated whether this system provided quality dialogue across medical specialities (n = 18) and with unseen cases (n = 29) compared to the cases used for development (n = 6). Medical evaluators (students residents practitioners and researchers) conducted simulated history-taking with the system and assessed its performance through Likert-scale questionnaires. We analysed interaction logs and evaluated system correctness. The mean user evaluation score for the 29 unseen cases was 4.06 out of 5 (very good). The evaluation of correctness determined that on average 74.3% (sd = 9.5) of replies were correct 14.9% (sd = 6.3) incorrect and in 10.7% the system behaved cautiously by deferring a reply. In the user evaluation all aspects scored higher in the 29 unseen cases than in the 6 seen cases. Although such a multi-case system has its limits the evaluation showed that creating it is feasible that it performs adequately and that it is judged usable. We discuss some lessons learned and pivotal design choices affecting its performance and the end-users who are primarily medical students.;2021
Since the emergence of deep learning-based chatbots for knowledge services numerous research and development projects have been conducted in various industries. A high demand for chatbots has drastically increased the global market size however the limited functional scalability of open-domain chatbots is a challenge to their application to industries. Moreover as most chatbot frameworks employ English it is necessary to create chatbots customized for other languages. To address this problem this paper proposes KoRASA as a pipeline-optimization method which uses a deep learning-based open-source chatbot framework to understand the Korean language. KoRASA is a closed-domain chatbot that is applicable across a wide range of industries in Korea. KoRASA's operation consists of four stages: tokenization featurization intent classification and entity extraction. The accuracy and F1-score of KoRASA were measured based on datasets taken from common tasks carried out in most industrial fields. The algorithm for intent classification and entity extraction was optimized. The accuracy and F1-score were 98.2% and 98.4% for intent classification and 97.4% and 94.7% for entity extraction respectively. Furthermore these results are better than those achieved by existing models. Accordingly KoRASA can be applied to various industries including mobile services based on closed-domain chatbots using Korean robotic process automation (RPA) edge computing and Internet of Energy (IoE) services.;2021
Since the purchase of Siri by Apple and its release with the iPhone 4S in 2011 virtual assistants (VAs) have grown in number and popularity. The sophisticated natural language processing and speech recognition employed by VAs enables users to interact with them conversationally almost as they would with another human. To service user voice requests VAs transmit large amounts of data to their vendors these data are processed and stored in the Cloud. The potential data security and privacy issues involved in this process provided the motivation to examine the current state of the art in VA research. In this study we identify peer-reviewed literature that focuses on security and privacy concerns surrounding these assistants including current trends in addressing how voice assistants are vulnerable to malicious attacks and worries that the VA is recording without the user's knowledge or consent. The findings show that not only are these worries manifold but there is a gap in the current state of the art and no current literature reviews on the topic exist. This review sheds light on future research directions such as providing solutions to perform voice authentication without an external device and the compliance of VAs with privacy regulations.;2021
Slot filling is a crucial component in task-oriented dialog systems that is used to parse (user) utterances into semantic concepts called slots. An ontology is defined by the collection of slots and the values that each slot can take. The most widely used practice of treating slot filling as a sequence labeling task suffers from two main drawbacks. First the ontology is usually pre-defined and fixed and therefore is not able to detect new labels for unseen slots. Second the one-hot encoding of slot labels ignores the correlations between slots with similar semantics which makes it difficult to share knowledge learned across different domains. To address these problems we propose a new model called elastic conditional random field (eCRF) where each slot is represented by the embedding of its natural language description and modeled by a CRF layer. New slot values can be detected by eCRF whenever a language description is available for the slot. In our experiment we show that eCRFs outperform existing models in both in-domain and cross-domain tasks especially in predicting unseen slots and values.;2021
Smart home assistants which enable users to control home appliances and can be used for holding entertaining conversations have become an inseparable part of many people's homes. Recently there have been many attempts to allow end-users to teach a home assistant new commands responses and rules which can then be shared with a larger community. However allowing end-users to teach an agent new responses which are shared with a large community opens the gate to malicious users who can teach the agent inappropriate responses in order to promote their own business products or political views. In this paper we present a platform that enables users to collaboratively teach a smart home assistant (or chatbot) responses using natural language. We present a method of collectively detecting malicious users and using the commands taught by the malicious users to further mitigate activity of future malicious users. We ran an experiment with 192 subjects and show the effectiveness of our platform.;2021
Smart mirrors are devices that can display any kind of information and can interact with the user using touch and voice commands. Different kinds of smart mirrors exist: general purpose medical fashion and other task specific ones. General purpose smart mirrors are suitable for home environments but the exiting ones offer similar limited functionalities. In this paper we present a general-purpose smart mirror that integrates several functionalities standard and advanced to support users in their everyday life. Among the advanced functionalities are the capabilities of detecting a person's emotions the short- and long-term monitoring and analysis of the emotions a double authentication protocol to preserve the privacy and the integration of Alexa Skills to extend the applications of the smart mirrors. We exploit a deep learning technique to develop most of the smart functionalities. The effectiveness of the device is demonstrated by the performances of the implemented functionalities and the evaluation in terms of its usability with real users.;2021
Social connectedness is vital for developing group cohesion and strengthening belongingness. However with the accelerating pace of modern life people have fewer opportunities to participate in group-building activities. Furthermore owing to the teleworking and quarantine requirements necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic the social connectedness of group members may become weak. To address this issue in this study we used an android robot to conduct daily conversations and as an intermediary to increase intra-group connectedness. Specifically we constructed an android robot system for collecting and sharing recent member-related experiences. The system has a chatbot function based on BERT and a memory function with a neural-network-based dialog action analysismodel. We conducted a 3-day human-robot conversation experiment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. The results of a questionnaire-based evaluation and empirical analysis demonstrate that the proposed system can increase the familiarity and closeness of group members. This suggests that the proposed method is useful for enhancing social connectedness. Moreover it can improve the closeness of the user-robot relation as well as the performance of robots in conducting conversations with people.;2021
Social networks have become a major platform for people to disseminate information which can include negative rumors. In recent years rumors on social networks has caused grave problems and considerable damages. We attempted to create a method to verify information from numerous social media messages. We propose a general architecture that integrates machine learning and open data with a Chatbot and is based cloud computing (MLODCCC) which can assist users in evaluating information authenticity on social platforms. The proposed MLODCCC architecture consists of six integrated modules: cloud computing machine learning data preparation open data chatbot and intelligent social application modules. Food safety has garnered worldwide attention. Consequently we used the proposed MLODCCC architecture to develop a Food Safety Information Platform (FSIP) that provides a friendly hyperlink and chatbot interface on Facebook to identify credible food safety information. The performance and accuracy of three binary classification algorithms namely the decision tree logistic regression and support vector machine algorithms operating in different cloud computing environments were compared. The binary classification accuracy was 0.769 which indicates that the proposed approach accurately classifies using the developed FSIP.;2021
Social robots are coming to our homes and have already been used to help humans in a number of ways in geriatric care. This article aims to develop a framework that enables social robots to conduct regular clinical screening interviews in geriatric care such as cognitive evaluation falls' risk evaluation and pain rating. We develop a social robot with essential features to enable clinical screening interviews including a conversational interface face tracking an interaction handler attention management robot skills and cloud service management. Besides a general clinical screening interview management (GCSIM) model is proposed and implemented. The GCSIM enables social robots to handle various types of clinical questions and answers evaluate and score responses engage interviewees during conversations and generate reports on their well-being. These reports can be used to evaluate the progression of cognitive impairment risk of falls pain level and so on by caregivers or physicians. Such a clinical screening capability allows for early detection and treatment planning in geriatric care. The framework was developed and implemented on our 3-D-printed social robot. It was tested on 30 older adults with different ages achieved satisfying results and received their high confidence and trust in the use of this robot for human well-being assessment. Note to Practitioners-This article is motivated by the goal of using a social robot to perform geriatric well-being assessment through clinical screening interviews. In order to conduct clinical screening interviews the social robot needs the following essential features: having a verbal conversational interface adapting to different types of clinical screening interviews scoring and evaluating answers having nondirective listening responses and enabling directive listening responses. The proposed general clinical screening interview management (GCSIM) model demonstrates these capabilities on the social robot. The robot can give structured clinical screening interviews with different question-answer sheets. This will help advance assistive technologies for use by geriatric physicians nurses and social service professionals to keep older adults healthy safe and independent at home. Robots will become more and more essential in working alongside geriatric practitioners to help monitor older adults at home and to provide early detection and warning of cognitive/mental health problems falls' risk and so on. This early detection property can improve quality-of-care and help older adults remain living at home.;2021
Social robots conversational agents voice assistants and other embodied AI are increasingly a feature of everyday life. What connects these various types of intelligent agents is their ability to interact with people through voice. Voice is becoming an essential modality of embodiment communication and interaction between computer-based agents and end-users. This survey presents a meta-synthesis on agent voice in the design and experience of agents from a human-centered perspective: voice-based human-agent interaction (vHAI). Findings emphasize the social role of voice in HAI as well as circumscribe a relationship between agent voice and body corresponding to human models of social psychology and cognition. Additionally changes in perceptions of and reactions to agent voice over time reveals a generational shift coinciding with the commercial proliferation of mobile voice assistants. The main contributions of this work are a vHAI classification framework for voice across various agent forms contexts and user groups a critical analysis grounded in key theories and an identification of future directions for the oncoming wave of vocal machines.;2021
Speaker verification is a key technology in many services and applications like smartphones and intelligent digital assistants. These applications usually require users to transmit their recordings features or models from their voices over untrusted public networks which stored and processed them on cloud-based infrastructure. Furthermore the voice signal contains a great deal of the speaker's personal and private information which raises several privacy issues. Therefore it is necessary to develop speaker verification systems that protect the user's voice against such threats. Herein the cancellable biometric systems have been introduced as a privacy-preserving solution. A cancellable method for speaker verification systems is proposed using speaker i-vector embeddings. This method includes two stages: (i) i-vector binarisation and (ii) the protection of the binary i-vector with a shuffling scheme derived from a user-specific key. Privacy evaluation of this method according to the standards of biometric information protection (ISO/IEC 24745) shows that the proposed cancellable speaker verification system achieves the revocability unlinkability and irreversibility requirements. Moreover the cancellable system improves biometric performance compared with the unprotected system and makes it resistant to different attack scenarios. Additionally we demonstrate that this method can also operate to protect deep neural network speaker embeddings such as x-vectors.;2021
Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a crucial role in improving the quality of man-machine interfaces in various fields like distance learning medical science virtual assistants and automated customer services. A deep learning-based hierarchical approach is proposed for both unimodal and multimodal SER systems in this work. Of these the audio-based unimodal system proposes using a combination of 33 features which include prosody spectral and voice quality-based audio features. Further for the multimodal system both the above-mentioned audio features and additional textual features are used. Embeddings from Language Models v2 (ELMo v2) is implemented to extract word and character embeddings which helped to capture the context-dependent aspects of emotion in text. The proposed models' performances are evaluated on two audio-only unimodal datasets - SAVEE and RAVDESS and one audio-text multimodal dataset - IEMOCAP. The proposed hierarchical models offered SER accuracies of 81.2% 81.7% and 74.5% on the RAVDESS SAVEE and IEMOCAP datasets respectively. Further these results are also benchmarked against recently reported techniques and the reported performances are found to be superior. Therefore based on the presented investigations it is concluded that the application of a deep learning-based network in a hierarchical manner significantly improves SER over generic unimodal and multimodal systems.

Spoken language understanding (SLU) plays a central role in dialog systems and typically involves two tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Existing joint models improve the performance by introducing richer words intents and slots semantic features. However methods that model the explicit interactions between these features have not been further explored. In this paper we propose a novel joint model based on the position-aware multi-head masked attention mechanism which explicitly models the interaction between the word encoding feature and the intent-slot features thereby generating the context features that contribute to slot filling. In addition we adopt the multi-head attention mechanism to summarize the utterance-level semantic knowledge for intent detection. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results and improves the sentence-level semantic frame accuracy with 2.30% and 0.69% improvement relative to the previous best model on the SNIPS and ATIS datasets respectively.

Spoken language understanding (SLU) plays an indispensable role in the dialogue system. The traditional intention detection task is regarded as a classification problem where utterances are associated with predefined intents. However the various expressions of user's intents and constantly emerging novel intents make the annotating time-consuming and labor-intensive building massive obstacles for extending the model to new tasks. Identifying unexpected user intention and achieving the user's desire goal is a challenging task. Therefore we conduct zero-shot intention detection based on a transformation-based learning manner. In this paper we propose an intent-enhanced attentive capsule network (IE-BertCapsNet) further guides the aggregation process of the capsule network and generalizable useful features that can be adapted to emerging intentions. Coupling with the large margin cosine loss function the proposed model can identify discriminative features by forcing the whole network to minimize inter-class distance and minimize intra-class distance. Finally we leverage the IE-BertCapsNet's feature extraction ability and knowledge transferring capability to conduct zero-shot intent detection and generalized zero-shot intent detection. Extensive experiments on five benchmark task-oriented datasets in four languages demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve competitive performance that can better discriminate known intents and detect unknown intents.

Spoken language understanding (SLU) systems aim to understand users' utterance which is a key component of task-oriented dialogue systems. In this paper we focus on improving the contextual SLU. The contextual SLU systems mainly focus on how to effectively incorporate dialog context information (contextual information). The existing approaches all use the same contextual information to guide slot filling at all tokens which may inject the irrelevant information and result in ambiguity. To tackle this problem we propose a context-aware graph convolutional network (GCN) with an adaptive fusion layer for contextual SLU. The context-aware GCN is proposed to automatically aggregate the contextual information which frees our model from the manually designed heuristic aggregation function. Meanwhile an adaptive fusion layer is applied at each token to dynamically incorporate relevant contextual information which achieves a fine-grained contextual information transfer to guide the token-level slot filling. Experiments on the Simulated Dialog Dataset show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms other previous methods by a large margin (+3.67% on Sim-R +4.18% on Sim-M and +3.75% on Overall dataset). In addition we explore and analyze the pre-trained model (i.e. BERT) in our framework. We show that incorporating BERT brings a large improvement in low-resource setting.;2021
Static recommendation methods like collaborative filtering suffer from the inherent limitation of performing real-time personalization for cold-start users. Online recommendation e.g. multi-armed bandit approach addresses this limitation by interactively exploring user preference online and pursuing the exploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off. However existing bandit-based methods model recommendation actions homogeneously. Specifically they only consider the items as the arms being incapable of handling the item attributes which naturally provide interpretable information of user's current demands and can effectively filter out undesired items. In this work we consider the conversational recommendation for cold-start users where a system can both ask the attributes from and recommend items to a user interactively. This important scenario was studied in a recent work [54]. However it employs a hand-crafted function to decide when to ask attributes or make recommendations. Such separate modeling of attributes and items makes the effectiveness of the system highly rely on the choice of the hand-crafted function thus introducing fragility to the system. To address this limitation we seamlessly unify attributes and items in the same arm space and achieve their EE trade-offs automatically using the framework of Thompson Sampling. Our Conversational Thompson Sampling (ConTS) model holistically solves all questions in conversational recommendation by choosing the arm with the maximal reward to play. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that ConTS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods Conversational UCB (ConUCB) [54] and Estimation-Action-Reflection model [27] in both metrics of success rate and average number of conversation turns.;2021
Storybook reading accompanied by adult-guided conversation provides a stimulating context for children's language development. Conversational agents powered by artificial intelligence such as smart speakers are prevalent in children's homes and have the potential to engage children in storybook reading as language partners. However little research has explored the effectiveness of using conversational agents to support children's language development. This study examined how an automated conversational agent can read stories to children via a smart speaker while asking questions and providing contingent feedback. Using a randomized experiment among 90 children aged three to six years this study compared these children's story comprehension and verbal engagement in storybook reading with a conversational agent versus an adult. The conversational agent's guided conversation was found to be as supportive in improving children's story comprehension as that provided by an adult language partner. At the same time this study uncovered a number of differences in children's verbal engagement when interacting with a conversational agent versus with an adult. Specifically children who read with the conversational agent responded to questions with better intelligibility whereas those who read with an adult responded to questions with higher productivity lexical diversity and topical relevance. And the two groups responded to questions with a similar level of accuracy. In addition questions requiring high cognitive demand amplified the differences in of verbal engagement between the conversational agent and adult partner. The study offers important implications for developing and researching conversational agent systems to support children's language development.;2021
Stress is a prevalent issue amongst patients with chronic conditions. As eHealth interventions are gaining importance it becomes more relevant to invoke the possibilities from the eHealth technology itself to provide motivational acts during experiences of stress as to enhance adherence to the intervention. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA's) also known as 'robots on screen' can potentially provide a remedy. Within our eHealth experiment we applied a between-subjects design and experimentally studied the difference in appraisal of motivation and guidance. We deployed a functionally modest monologue-style ECA and compared them with textual guidance. This way we filtered out the considerable positive impact of interactive features that go along with dialogue-style ECA's. The study was carried out amongst eHealth users of which half were deliberately put in a stressful pre-condition. The rationale was two-sided first we hypothesized that it would induce a need for motivational support. Second it would provide a fair representation of eHealth users in real life. Furthermore we investigated hypothesized positive effects from a gender match between participant and ECA. The results demonstrated preferential ECA effects compared to text but only in the no stress conditions. Although our set-up controlled for user distraction by putting the facilitating ECA in a pane separate from the eHealth environment we suspect that the enduring visual presence of the ECA during task completion had still inhibited distressed users. Discussing this phenomenon our stance is that the hypothesis that ECA support is always superior to textual guidance is open for re-evaluation. Text may sometimes serve users equally well because it lacks human-like aspects that in stressful circumstances can become confrontational. We discuss the potential of ECA's to motivate but also elaborate on the caveats. Further implications for the ECA intervention adherence and eHealth study fields are discussed in relation to stress.;2021
Student life causes many sources of stress due to the requirements of managing schoolwork family friends health and wellbeing and future career planning. Some students are overwhelmed and lack resilience to overcome stress especially if they are inexperienced in managing setbacks fail to achieve expectations or lack skills to independently manage social skills recreation and study time. The long-term accumulation of stress has a negative impact on students' physical and mental health and may lead to a range of symptoms such as depression anxiety headache insomnia and eating disorders. Although most universities provide psychological counseling services there is often a shortage of professional psychologists which leads to students suffering from stress for longer than necessary without immediate assistance. The build-up of stress can lead to tragic consequences including abnormal reasoning anti-social behavior and suicide. There should never be a need for a student to wait more than a month to make an appointment for counseling services and every request for help should be immediately addressed and assessed. In this research we designed a unique test platform for an immersive virtual reality group chatbot counseling system so students can receive psychological help and stress management counseling anytime and anywhere. First the research used questionnaires to measure the stress levels and identifies how stress affects their lives. An immersive virtual reality chatbot was developed using professional psychological counseling knowledge that can provide answers during individual or group counseling sessions. Students can log in to the platform as avatars and ask the chatbot questions or interact with other students on the platform. This research provides college students with a new technology-based counseling environment designed to help relieve stress and learn new ways to improve student life quality from others. The platform provides a test base for future clinical trials to evaluate and improve the automated virtual reality chatbot counseling system.;2021
Successful collaboration between clinicians is particularly relevant regarding the quality of care process. In this context the utilization of hybrid intelligence such as conversational agents (CAs) is a reasonable approach for the coordination of diverse tasks. While there is a great deal of literature involving collaboration little effort has been made to integrate previous findings and evaluate research when applying CAs in hospitals. By conducting an extended and systematic literature review and semi-structured expert interviews we identified four major challenges and derived propositions where in-depth research is needed: 1) audience and interdependency 2) connectivity and embodiment 3) trust and transparency and 4) security privacy and ethics. The results are helpful for researchers as we discuss directions for future research on CAs for collaboration in a hospital setting enhancing team performance. Practitioners will be able to understand which difficulties must be considered before the actual application of CAs.;2021
Task-oriented dialogue systems typically rely on large amounts of high-quality training data or require complex handcrafted rules. However existing datasets are often limited in size considering the complexity of the dialogues. Additionally conventional training signal inference is not suitable for non-deterministic agent behavior namely considering multiple actions as valid in identical dialogue states. We propose the Conversation Graph (ConvGraph) a graph-based representation of dialogues that can be exploited for data augmentation multi-reference training and evaluation of non-deterministic agents. ConvGraph generates novel dialogue paths to augment data volume and diversity. Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation across three datasets shows that data augmentation and/or multi-reference training with ConvGraph can improve dialogue success rates by up to 6.4%.;2021
Technologies change users' existing social cultural and material practices by providing new opportunities for reflecting on and managing their lives. As technological advancements pervade our private and professional lives users are tempted to see them as 'magic bullets' that can help them become more organized and efficient. In this paper we introduce the term 'time hacking' to capture the various ways technologies mediate users' time perception and perspective. We will use the examples of virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa and the Quantified Self Movement to illustrate how people feel that they are capable of hacking time by using devices and programs. Imagining tools as neutral entities that help them better manage their lives in a world that seems increasingly sped up users are often blind to the multifarious ways these technologies and the companies that produce them shape what they attend to and how they make sense of information. The concept of time hacking helps us examine what narratives users construct and share about timesaving tools and how users' perception of and perspective about time changes in response to emerging technologies. Most importantly time hacking can help to explain the allure of timesaving technologies why users might be enthusiastic about taking them up and integrating them into their lives.;2021
Technology is giving rise to artificial erotic agents which we call erobots (eros + bot). Erobots such as virtual or augmented partners erotic chatbots and sex robots increasingly expose humans to the possibility of intimacy and sexuality with artificial agents. Their advent has sparked academic and public debates: some denounce their risks (e.g. promotion of harmful sociosexual norms) while others defend their potential benefits (e.g. health education and research applications). Yet the scientific study of human-machine erotic interaction is limited no comprehensive theoretical models have been proposed and the empirical literature remains scarce. The current research programs investigating erotic technologies tend to focus on the risks and benefits of erobots rather than providing solutions to resolve the former and enhance the latter. Moreover we feel that these programs underestimate how humans and machines unpredictably interact and co-evolve as well as the influence of sociocultural processes on technological development and meaning attribution. To comprehensively explore human-machine erotic interaction and co-evolution we argue that we need a new unified transdisciplinary field of research-grounded in sexuality and technology positive frameworks-focusing on human-erobot interaction and co-evolution as well as guiding the development of beneficial erotic machines. We call this field Erobotics. As a first contribution to this new discipline this article defines Erobotics and its related concepts proposes a model of human-erobot interaction and co-evolution and suggests a path to design beneficial erotic machines that could mitigate risks and enhance human well-being.;2021
Technology providers car manufacturers and public agencies all need to work together to undertake extensive testing of fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads before such AVs are allowed to freely travel in ways similar to human-driven vehicles. This raises the importance of understanding public perceptions regarding safety considerations when traveling alongside AVs. This study makes use of a national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center to identify the affective socio-demographic and technology-use attributes that affect an individual's perception of the safety of sharing the road with AVs (PSSRAV) and identifies measures and interventions that can be undertaken to improve PSSRAV. Additionally we evaluate individual preferences for AV regulations. Our results underscore the importance of the need for service providers and public agencies to be cognizant of the demographic and lifestyle/affective emotion considerations shaping AV safety perceptions and opinions about AV regulations. In particular there is a need not only to focus on technological and other infrastructure components of AV development but also to recognize the socio-technical considerations and human-related factors of the end-users. Our findings should be of substantial interest in the planning design deployment and introduction of AVs within a safe and minimally regulated public operating arena.;2021
Text classification is an important component of digital media such as natural language processing image labeling sentiment analysis spam filtering chatbots and translators. In this work effort was devoted to develop an in-memory processor for Bayesian text classification using memristive crossbar architecture in which memristive switches were employed to store information required for the classification of text. The efficacy of the proposed circuit was tested on two distinct datasets consisting of a total of 55575 texts. The circuit was found to be efficient to categorize the texts with an average accuracy of 91%. This work paves the way for hardware realization of cognitive systems using in-memory processors.;2021
Thanks to artificial intelligence chatbots have been applied to many consumer-facing applications especially to online travel agencies (OTAs). This study aims to identify five quality dimensions of chatbot services and investigate their effect on user confirmation which in turn leads to use continuance. In addition the moderating role of technology anxiety in the relationships between chatbot quality dimensions and post-use confirmation is examined. Survey data were gathered from 295 users of Chinese OTAs. Partial Least Square (PLS) was used to analyze measurement and structural models. Understandability reliability assurance and interactivity are positively associated with post-use confirmation and technology anxiety moderates the relationships between four chatbot quality dimensions and confirmation. Confirmation is positively associated with satisfaction which in turn influences use continuance intention. This study examines how chatbot services in OTAs are considered by users (human-like agents vs. technology-enabled services) by investigating the moderating role of technology anxiety.;2021
The ability of dialogue systems to express pre-specified style during conversations has a direct positive impact on their usability and user satisfaction. While it has attracted much research interest existing methods often generate stylistic responses at the cost of content quality. In this work we introduce a prototype-to-style (PS) framework to tackle the challenge of stylistic dialogue generation. The proposed framework first exploits an Information Retrieval (IR) system and extracts a response prototype from the retrieved response. A stylistic response generator then takes the response prototype and the desired style as input to produce a high-quality and stylistic response. To effectively train the proposed model and imitate the real testing environment we introduce a new style-aware learning objective and a denoising learning strategy. Results on three benchmark datasets (gender emotion and sentiment) from two languages demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing baselines both in terms of in-domain and cross-domain evaluations.;2021
The actions of intelligent agents such as chatbots recommender systems and virtual assistants are typically not fully transparent to the user. Consequently users take the risk that such agents act in ways opposed to the users' preferences or goals. It is often argued that people use trust as a cognitive shortcut to reduce the complexity of such interactions. Here we formalise this by using the methods of evolutionary game theory to study the viability of trust-based strategies in repeated games. These are reciprocal strategies that cooperate as long as the other player is observed to be cooperating. Unlike classic reciprocal strategies once mutual cooperation has been observed for a threshold number of rounds they stop checking their co-player's behaviour every round and instead only check it with some probability. By doing so they reduce the opportunity cost of verifying whether the action of their co-player was actually cooperative. We demonstrate that these trust-based strategies can outcompete strategies that are always conditional such as Tit-for-Tat when the opportunity cost is non-negligible. We argue that this cost is likely to be greater when the interaction is between people and intelligent agents because of the reduced transparency of the agent. Consequently we expect people to use trust-based strategies more frequently in interactions with intelligent agents. Our results provide new important insights into the design of mechanisms for facilitating interactions between humans and intelligent agents where trust is an essential factor. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in environments that involve high risk and high consequence decision-making is severely hampered by critical design issues. These issues include system transparency and brittleness where transparency relates to (i) the explainability of results and (ii) the ability of a user to inspect and verify system goals and constraints and brittleness (iii) the ability of a system to adapt to new user demands. Transparency is a particular concern for criminal intelligence analysis where there are significant ethical and trust issues that arise when algorithmic and system processes are not adequately understood by a user. This prevents adoption of potentially useful technologies in policing environments. In this article we present a novel approach to designing a conversational agent (CA) AI system for intelligence analysis that tackles these issues. We discuss the results and implications of three different studies a Cognitive Task Analysis to understand analyst thinking when retrieving information in an investigation Emergent Themes Analysis to understand the explanation needs of different system components and an interactive experiment with a prototype conversational agent. Our prototype conversational agent named Pan demonstrates transparency provision and mitigates brittleness by evolving new CA intentions. We encode interactions with the CA with human factors principles for situation recognition and use interactive visual analytics to support analyst reasoning. Our approach enables complex AI systems such as Pan to be used in sensitive environments and our research has broader application than the use case discussed.;2021
The aim of this paper is to contribute to the debate on ethics in AI focusing particularly on the social and ethical issues which emerge during human-conversational agent interaction. Those issues will be approached adopting both the perspective of the user and the one of the machine. In fact it is often stressed the need to include the ethical component within system's design which it is certainly necessary as will be discussed in the article. Nevertheless conversational agents are tools although they are capable of having a strong impact on the society thus the moral use of these social tools must be demanded to users as well. For this reason it will be proposed a new set of ethical guidelines called Mirror Ethics based on the alignment of both parties involved in the conversation to a shared moral baseline. The adoption of these shared values will lead to the creation of a new ethical equilibrium between users and conversational agents producing a social beneficial impact and increasing the level of trust within the human-machine interaction.;2021
The aim of this study is to investigate whether an interactive self-regulation scaffolding increases levels of online learners' self-regulated learning skills course participation and learning performance. The intervention utilizes a dialog approach with an intelligent conversational agent to scaffold learners' self-regulated learning. Fifty-six graduate students participated in this study over a semester and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) an experimental condition where a scaffold was provided through the conversational agent and (2) a control condition where the self-regulated learning information was given but any scaffolds were not provided. The results revealed that the scaffolded group showed higher self-regulated learning level gains than the control group. Additionally the relationships between self-regulated learning course participation and learning performance were investigated.;2021
The application of Internet-based interventions within stepped-care models raises the question of when patients should receive Internet-based treatment and when patients should receive face-to-face (FtF) treatment. To address this question the patient perception and effects of working mechanisms were evaluated after brief psychotherapy for insomnia applying a mixed-methods approach. Treatment was either delivered through a text-based chat or it was delivered FtF. Almost half of the patients who received the chat-based treatment indicated that chat-based communication was appropriate for them when dealing with sleep difficulties but that they would prefer FtF communication for more sensitive topics. Results from the therapists' evaluations of working mechanisms yielded that these working mechanisms were more strongly associated with treatment outcome in the FtF condition than they were in the chat-based condition. To understand and to interpret the results media richness theory may be a useful tool: More severely impaired patients and patients with more complex concerns may need more complex (richer) communication formats for treatment delivery. Such heuristics may help to better justify treatment recommendations and optimize media choice in Internet-based interventions e.g. by defining moments when human interaction is needed and moments when communication could be conducted by nonhuman chatbots.;2021
The cognitive approach to psychotherapy aims to change patients' maladaptive schemas that is overly negative views on themselves the world or the future. To obtain awareness of these views they record their thought processes in situations that caused pathogenic emotional responses. The schemas underlying such thought records have thus far been largely manually identified. Using recent advances in natural language processing we take this one step further by automatically extracting schemas from thought records. To this end we asked 320 healthy participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to each complete five thought records consisting of several utterances reflecting cognitive processes. Agreement between two raters on manually scoring the utterances with respect to how much they reflect each schema was substantial (Cohen's kappa = 0.79). Natural language processing software pretrained on all English Wikipedia articles from 2014 (GLoVE embeddings) was used to represent words and utterances which were then mapped to schemas using k-nearest neighbors algorithms support vector machines and recurrent neural networks. For the more frequently occurring schemas all algorithms were able to leverage linguistic patterns. For example the scores assigned to the Competence schema by the algorithms correlated with the manually assigned scores with Spearman correlations ranging between 0.64 and 0.76. For six of the nine schemas a set of recurrent neural networks trained separately for each of the schemas outperformed the other algorithms. We present our results here as a benchmark solution since we conducted this research to explore the possibility of automatically processing qualitative mental health data and did not aim to achieve optimal performance with any of the explored models. The dataset of 1600 thought records comprising 5747 utterances is published together with this article for researchers and machine learning enthusiasts to improve upon our outcomes. Based on our promising results we see further opportunities for using free-text input and subsequent natural language processing in other common therapeutic tools such as ecological momentary assessments automated case conceptualizations and more generally as an alternative to mental health scales.;2021
The complexity of the emotional presentation of users to Artificial Intelligence (AI) virtual assistants is mainly manifested in user motivation and social emotion but the current research lacks an effective conversion path from emotion to acceptance. This paper innovatively cuts from the perspective of trust establishes an AI virtual assistant acceptance model conducts an empirical study based on the survey data from 240 questionnaires and uses multilevel regression analysis and the bootstrap method to analyze the data. The results showed that functionality and social emotions had a significant effect on trust where perceived humanity showed an inverted U relationship on trust and trust mediated the relationship between both functionality and social emotions and acceptance. The findings explain the emotional complexity of users toward AI virtual assistants and extend the transformation path of technology acceptance from the trust perspective which has implications for the development and design of AI applications.</p>;2021
The consistency of a response to a given post at the semantic level and emotional level is essential for a dialogue system to deliver humanlike interactions. However this challenge is not well addressed in the literature since most of the approaches neglect the emotional information conveyed by a post while generating responses. This article addresses this problem and proposes a unified end-to-end neural architecture which is capable of simultaneously encoding the semantics and the emotions in a post and leveraging target information to generate more intelligent responses with appropriately expressed emotions. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both content coherence and emotion appropriateness.;2021
The COVID-19 pandemic has strained hospital resources and necessitated the need for predictive models to forecast patient care demands in order to allow for adequate staffing and resource allocation. Recently other studies have looked at associations between Google Trends data and the number of COVID-19 cases. Expanding on this approach we propose a vector error correction model (VECM) for the number of COVID-19 patients in a healthcare system (Census) that incorporates Google search term activity and healthcare chatbot scores. The VECM provided a good fit to Census and very good forecasting performance as assessed by hypothesis tests and mean absolute percentage prediction error. Although our study and model have limitations we have conducted a broad and insightful search for candidate Internet variables and employed rigorous statistical methods. We have demonstrated the VECM can potentially be a valuable component to a COVID-19 surveillance program in a healthcare system.;2021
The current incremental need for immediate responses (real-time) on many medical emergencies is necessity for an advanced society. In many cases people who are living in rural areas need a critical for their healthy commuting time to a Medical Center (Hospital). In addition human physicians have limited capability for offering their services to large number of emergencies or medical cases. Thus there is a need for the medical technologies to take the advantage of the advanced IT and Engineering for the design and development of Virtual Doctor Diagnoses Systems to facilitate such needs. This paper presents the components needed for the development of such an intelligent system called e-IATROS and its Virtual Doctor (VDr) dialogue systems. The e-IATROS system has the potential to simultaneously talk to a large number of human patients without humans to detect that they are talking to a computer based system. This is a necessary feature for convincing human patients to trust the machine and express their issues. To do so the e-IATROS has to use the voice of the actual human doctor for each human patient. Each VDr dialogue system mainly interacts with a patient extracting non-measurable and measurable symptoms to contribute to the generation of possible prognosis. The e-IATROS system is presented with its capabilities recognizing the patient emotion and learning through the process.;2021
The current research demonstrates how conversational robo advisors as opposed to static non-conversational robo advisors alter perceptions of trust the evaluation of a financial services firm and consumer financial decision making. We develop and empirically test a novel conceptualization of conversational robo advisors building on prior work in human-to-human communication and interpersonal psychology showing that conversational robo advisors cause greater levels of affective trust compared to non-conversational robo advisors and evoke a more benevolent evaluation of a financial services firm. We demonstrate that this increase in affective trust not only affects firm perception (in terms of benevolence attributions or a more positively-valenced onboarding experience) but has important implications for investor behavior such as greater recommendation acceptance and an increase in asset allocation toward conversational robo advisors. These findings have important implications for research on trust formation between humans and machines the effective design of conversational robo advisors and public policy in the digital economy.;2021
The establishment of the precision diagnosis and treatment system and the advent of the digital intelligence era have not only deepened people's understanding of liver cancer but also continuously improved the diagnosis and treatment methods of liver cancer. Cutting-edge computer technology represented by artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in the prediction screening diagnosis treatment and rehabilitation of liver cancer. The rise of AI has given new vitality to liver surgery as well as individualized treatment experience and greater healing opportunities for patients. We focus on summarizing the latest applications and developments of AI in liver cancer diagnosis and treatment from six aspects: virtual assistants medical imaging diagnosis adjuvant therapy risk and treatment response prediction drug development and testing and postoperative rehabilitation management. Especially in the two major aspects of medical imaging diagnosis and adjuvant therapy the development and achievements of AI are gratifying. Finally we put forward a view on the current challenges of AI in the precise diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer and how to promote its development and we have a prospect for the future development direction.;2021
The growing number of voice-enabled devices and applications consider automatic speaker verification (ASV) a fundamental component. However maximum outreach for ASV in critical domains e.g. financial services and health care is not possible unless we overcome security breaches caused by voice cloning algorithms and replayed audios. Therefore to overcome these vulnerabilities a secure ASV (SASV) system based on the novel sign modified acoustic local ternary pattern (sm-ALTP) features and asymmetric bagging-based classifier-ensemble with enhanced attack vector is presented. The proposed audio representation approach clusters the high and low frequency components in audio frames by normally distributing frequency components against a convex function. Then the neighborhood statistics are applied to capture the user specific vocal tract information. The proposed SASV system simultaneously verifies the bonafide speakers and detects the voice cloning attack cloning algorithm used to synthesize cloned audio (in the defined settings) and voice-replay attacks over the ASVspoof 2019 dataset. In addition the proposed method detects the voice replay and cloned voice replay attacks over the VSDC dataset. Both the voice cloning algorithm detection and cloned-replay attack detection are novel concepts introduced in this paper. The voice cloning algorithm detection module determines the voice cloning algorithm used to generate the fake audios. Whereas the cloned voice replay attack detection is performed to determine the SASV behavior when audio samples are simultaneously contemplated with cloning and replay artifacts.;2021
The growing popularity of digital assistants (from Microsoft's Clippy to Amazon's Alexa) is changing how consumers acquire information and make decisions. Often embodied in anthropomorphized forms digital assistants (DAs) are designed to serve consumers by suggesting relevant products to simplify purchasing decisions. In this work we aim to understand how consumers evaluate social relationships with different types of DAs and their subsequent effects on purchasing. Our findings show that consumers judge DAs as being more socially close both when DAs are anthropomorphized and when they provide higher-quality recommendations. Evidence from fMRI indicated that both recommendation quality and anthropomorphization fostered greater feelings of social closeness by recruiting similar brain mechanisms involved in mental simulation (i.e. inferior frontal gyms and cortical midline structures). Although anthropomorphized DAs were evaluated as more socially close they did not facilitate increased purchase interest suggesting that stimulation of neural reward networks is also necessary for driving greater purchasing.;2021
The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in business has proliferated in recent years. Businesses have started adopting various technology practices relevant to automation and AI and research investigating this phenomenon is becoming increasingly important. Taking this as a cue the present research investigates the effect of human-to-machine interaction and human-to-human interaction towards cognitive absorption and its subsequent effect on trust experience and continuation intention in the context of services. The study built a 3 x 3 factorial design with automated chatbots (machine interaction) and service executives (human interaction) used as a stimulus in the experiment. Data collected from 410 respondents were analyzed using structural equation modeling to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings indicated that human-to-machine interaction influences cognitive absorption more positively compared to human-to-human interactions. The study results also provide evidence for the role of the trust experience and technology continuation intention in a technology background rooted in human-machine interactions. The present study adds a valuable contribution to the existing literature relevant to human-to-machine interaction cognitive absorption trust experience and continuation intention. The study also provides valuable inputs to technology and marketing managers.;2021
The increased availability of chatbots has drawn attention and interest to the study of what answers they provide and how they provide them. Chatbots have become a common sight in museums but are limited to answering only simple and basic questions. Based on the observed potential of chatbots for history education in museums we investigate how chatbots impact history education and improve the overall experience according to their appearance and language style. For this we built three models designed by factors on embodiment and reflection and 60 sets of answer-questions designed for the National Museum of Korea. We conducted a study with a total of 34 participants and carried out a variety of analyses covering individual learning styles museum experience scales gaze data in-depth interviews and observations from researchers. We present various results and lessons regarding the effect of embodiment and reflection on the museum experience. Our findings show how people with different learning styles connect with chatbot models and how visitors' behavior in the museum changes depending on the chatbot model. Specifically the chatbot model equipped with embodiment and reflection shows its superiority in enhancing the museum experience in general.;2021
The increasing number of female breast cancer (FBC) incidences in the East predominated by Chinese language speakers has generated concerns over women's medicare. To minimize the mortality rate associated with FBC in the region governments and health experts are jointly encouraging women to undergo mammography screening at the earliest suspicion of FBC symptoms. However studies show that a huge number of women affected by FBC tend to delay medical consultation at its early stage as a result of factors such as complacency due to unawareness of FBC symptoms procrastination due to lifestyle and the feeling of embarrassment in discussing private matters especially with medical personnel of the opposite gender. To address these issues we propose a symptomatic assessment chatbot (SAC) based on artificial intelligence (AI) designed to prescreen women for FBC symptoms via a textual question-and-answer (Q&A) approach. The purpose of our chatbot is to assist women in engaging in communication regarding FBC symptoms so as to subsequently initiate formal medical consultations for early FBC diagnosis and treatment. We implemented the SAC systematically with some of the latest natural language processing (NLP) techniques suitable for Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and trained the model with real-world FBC Q&A data obtained from a major hospital in Taiwan. The results from our experiments showed that the SAC achieved very high accuracy in FBC assessment scoring in comparison to FBC patients' screening benchmark scores obtained from doctors.;2021
The multiturn dialogue system has been prevalently used in e-commerce websites and modern information systems which significantly improves the efficiency of problem solving and further promotes the service quality. In a multiturn dialogue system the problem of intention classification is a core task as the intention of a customer is the basis of subsequent problems handling. However traditional related methods are unsuitable for the classification of multiturn dialogues. Because traditional methods do not distinguish the importance of each sentence and concatenate all sentences in the text which is likely to generate a model with low prediction accuracy. In this paper we propose a method of multiturn dialogue classification based on key sentences mining. We design a keywords extraction algorithm mining key sentences from the dialogue text. We propose an algorithm finishing the computation of the weights of each sentence. According to the sentence weight and the sentence vector the dialogue text is transformed to a dialogue vector. The dialogue text is classified by a classifier and the input is the dialogue vector. We conducted sufficient experiments on a real-world dataset evaluating the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the related methods on a series of evaluation metrics.;2021
The Netflix popular reality series Too Hot to Handle (THTH) released during the coronavirus outbreak in 2019 requires all contestants to refrain from sexual activities of any kind in order to win a cash prize in the end. Mirroring the physical distancing mandate during the COVID-19 crisis the show offers an opportunity to discern a set of interrelated human and nonhuman entanglements in contemporary technoculture that the outbreak has brought into sharper relief. This essay probes into the conditions of possibility for the popularity of THTH by placing an analytical focus on the role of Lana a nonhuman sensor centrally featured in the show with a female voice typical of digital assistants. Lana a cone-shaped device from 'Factory China' is a surveillance robot embodying the operation of Netflix as part of the expanding regime of data colonialism which extracts personal data for profit. Her nonhuman identity is evocative of China as at once a manufacturing locale for the material gadgets that make up the global digital economy and an authoritarian state that has deepened its censorship and surveillance practices during the COVID-19 outbreak. Instructing the contestants to care for their entrepreneurial selves while encroaching upon their autonomy Lana invites us to rethink the common framing of China - a coveted market for Netflix - as the nonhuman Other of the liberal-democratic West. During a time when the nonhuman virus keeps humans apart while intensifying their reliance on nonhuman machines for communication Lana promotes a kind of intimacy without proximity characteristic of the global infrastructures of connection. A symptomatic reading of THTH which also conjures a vision of collectivity as a basis for surviving the pandemic thus allows us to recognize the entanglement of the human and the nonhuman and to imagine new paths toward global social justice.;2021
The NOESIS II challenge as the Track 2 in the Eighth Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC 8) is the extension of Track 1 in DSTC 7. Three new elements are incorporated into the extended track i.e. dialogue with multiple participants dialogue success and dialogue disentanglement. These are vital for the creation of a deployed task-oriented dialogue system. This track is divided into four subtasks the first two of which are evaluated in the form of response selection and the last two focus on dialogue analysis. This paper describes our methods developed for these four subtasks which all employ deep contextualized utterance representations to make models aware of contextual information and to keep the intrinsic property of multi-turn dialogue systems. In the released evaluation results of Track 2 in DSTC 8 our proposed methods ranked fourth in subtask 1 third in subtask 2 and first in subtask 3 and subtask 4 respectively. In addition to the challenge tasks we also compare our proposed methods with previous ones on public benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed methods outperform existing ones by large margins and achieve new state-of-the-art performances on multi-turn response selection and dialogue disentanglement.;2021
The objective of this article is to analyze the didactic functionality of a chatbot to improve the results of the students of the National University of Distance Education (UNED / Spain) in accessing the university in the subject of Spanish Language. For this a quasi-experimental experiment was designed and a quantitative methodology was used through pretest and posttest in a control and experimental group in which the effectiveness of two teaching models was compared one more traditional based on exercises written on paper and another based on interaction with a chatbot. Subsequently the perception of the experimental group in an academic forum about the educational use of the chatbot was analyzed through text mining with tests of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) pairwise distance matrix and bigrams. The quantitative results showed that the students in the experimental group substantially improved the results compared to the students with a more traditional methodology (experimental group / mean: 32.1346 / control group / mean: 28.4706). Punctuation correctness has been improved mainly in the usage of comma colon and periods in different syntactic patterns. Furthermore the perception of the students in the experimental group showed that they positively value chatbots in their teaching-learning process in three dimensions: greater support and companionship in the learning process as they perceive greater interactivity due to their conversational nature greater feedback and interaction compared to the more traditional methodology and lastly they especially value the ease of use and the possibility of interacting and learning anywhere and anytime.;2021
The perception of feeling lonely is an influential factor in determining quality of life among aging adults. As the US Census Bureau projects that the number of Americans ages 65 and older will double by 2060 reducing loneliness is imperative. Personal voice assistants (PVAs) such as Amazon's Echo offer the ease-of-use of voice control with a friendly helpful artificial intelligence. This study aimed to understand the influence of a PVA on loneliness reduction among adults of advanced ages i.e. 75+ and explore anthropomorphism as a potential underlying mechanism. Participants (N = 16) ages 75 or older used an Amazon Echo PVA for 8 weeks in an independent living facility in the Midwest. Surveys were used to collect information about perceived loneliness and PVA interaction data was recorded and analyzed. Participants consistently exceeded the required daily interactions. As hypothesized after the first 4 weeks of the intervention aging adults reported significantly lower loneliness (baseline mean = 2.22 SD = 0.42 week 4 mean = 1.99 SD = 0.45 Z = -2.45 and p = 0.01). Four dominant anthropomorphic themes emerged after thematic analysis of the entire 8 weeks' PVA interaction data (Cohen's Kappa = 0.92): (1) greetings (user-initiated friendly phrases) (2) comments/questions (user-initiated second-person pronoun) (3) polite interactions (user-initiated direct-name friendly requests) (4) reaction (user response to Alexa). Relational greetings predicted loneliness reductions in the first 4 weeks and baseline loneliness predicted relational greetings with the PVA during the entire 8 weeks suggesting that anthropomorphization of PVAs may play a role in mitigating loneliness in aging adults.;2021
The personal digital twin extends to individual persons a concept that originated in engineering to twin complex machines with a digital simulation containing a model of its functions to monitor its past and present behaviour and repair correct improve or otherwise ensure its optimal operation. Several independent trends in technological developments are seen to converge towards the elaboration of the digital replication of individual human data and life history notably in health industries. Among the main ones we consider the ubiquitous distribution of digital assistants the rapid progress of machine learning concurrent with the exponential growth of 'personal' Big Data and the incipient interest in developing lifelogs. The core hypothesis here is that among the psychological effects of the digital transformation the externalization of cognitive faculties such as memory planning and judgement the decision-making processes located within the human person are also emigrating to digital functions perhaps as a prelude to a later re-integration within the person via brain-computer interfaces. The paper concludes with ethical considerations about these ongoing developments. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards symbiotic autonomous systems'.;2021
The quality of scientific oral presentations is often poor owing to a number of factors including public speaking anxiety. We present DynamicDuo a system that uses an automated life-sized animated agent to help inexperienced scientists deliver their presentations in front of an audience. The design of the system was informed by an analysis of TED talks given by pairs of human presenters to identify the most common dual-presentation formats and transition behaviors used. We explore the usability and acceptability of DynamicDuo in both controlled laboratory-based studies and real-world environments and its ability to decrease public speaking anxiety and improve presentation quality. In a within-subjects study (N = 12) comparing co-presenting with DynamicDuo against solo-presenting with conventional presentation software we demonstrated that our system led to significant improvements in public speaking anxiety and speaking confidence for non-native English speakers. Judges who viewed videotapes of these presentations rated those with DynamicDuo significantly higher on speech quality and overall presentation quality for all presenters. We also explore the affordances of the virtual co-presenter through empirical evaluation of novel roles the agent can play in scientific presentations and novel ways it can interact with the speaker in front of the audience.;2021
The rapid growth of COVID-19 publications has driven clinical researchers and healthcare professionals in pursuit to reduce the knowledge gap on reliable information for effective pandemic solutions. The manual task of retrieving high-quality publications based on the evidence pyramid levels however presents a major bottleneck in researchers' workflows. In this paper we propose an evidence-based recommender system namely KnowCOVID-19 that utilizes an edge computing service to integrate recommender modules for data analytics using end-user thin-clients. The edge computing service features chatbot-based web interface that handles a given COVID-19 publication dataset using two recommender system modules: (i) evidence-based filtering that observes domain specific topics across the literature and classifies the filtered information according to a clinical category and (ii) social filtering that allows diverse experts with similar objectives to collaborate via a social plane to jointly find answers to critical clinical questions to fight the pandemic. We compare the Domain-specific Topic Model (DSTM) used in our evidence-based filtering with state-of-the-art models considering the CORD-19 dataset (a COVID-19 publication archive) and show improved generalization effectiveness as well as knowledge pattern query effectiveness. In addition we conduct a comparison study between a manual literature review process and the KnowCOVID-19 augmented process and evaluate the benefits of our information retrieval techniques over important queries provided by COVID-19 clinical experts.;2021
The rapidly evolving science about the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created unprecedented health information needs and dramatic changes in policies globally. We describe a platform Watson Assistant (WA) which has been used to develop conversational agents to deliver COVID-19 related information. We characterized the diverse use cases and implementations during the early pandemic and measured adoption through a number of users messages sent and conversational turns (ie pairs of interactions between users and agents). Thirty-seven institutions in 9 countries deployed COVID-19 conversational agents with WA between March 30 and August 10 2020 including 24 governmental agencies 7 employers 5 provider organizations and 1 health plan. Over 6.8 million messages were delivered through the platform. The mean number of conversational turns per session ranged between 1.9 and 3.5. Our experience demonstrates that conversational technologies can be rapidly deployed for pandemic response and are adopted globally by a wide range of users.;2021
The recent advent of neural approaches for developing each dialog component in task-oriented dialog systems has remarkably improved yet optimizing the overall system performance remains a challenge. Besides previous research on modeling complicated multi-domain goal-oriented dialogs in end-to-end fashion has been limited. In this paper we present an effective multi-domain end-to-end trainable neural dialog system SUMBT+LaRL that incorporates two previous strong models and facilitates them to be fully differentiable. Specifically the SUMBT+ estimates user-acts as well as dialog belief states and the LaRL models latent system action spaces and generates responses given the estimated contexts. We emphasize that the training framework of three steps significantly and stably increase dialog success rates: separately pretraining the SUMBT+ and LaRL fine-tuning the entire system and then reinforcement learning of dialog policy. We also introduce new reward criteria of reinforcement learning for dialog policy training. Then we discuss experimental results depending on the reward criteria and different dialog evaluation methods. Consequently our model achieved the new state-of-the-art success rate of 85.4% on corpus-based evaluation and a comparable success rate of 81.40% on simulator-based evaluation provided by the DSTC8 challenge. To our best knowledge our work is the first comprehensive study of a modularized E2E multi-domain dialog system that learning from each component to the entire dialog policy for task success.;2021
The restaurant technology market is rapidly evolving and is transforming the restaurant business as a significant sector of tourism and hospitality. Enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) mobile apps kiosks and chatbots revolutionize the guest experience and robots automate restaurant operations. Despite the increasing interest the use of AI and robotics in restaurants is still in its early stage and restaurant managers are seeking guidance to leverage these technologies for service excellence. In this high-contact service sector emotional skills need to be balanced with the possible automation potentials. The present research analyzes the current state of AI and robotics in the restaurant sector and proposes a systematic identification of process innovation potentials. For this purpose a market analysis of the European AI and robotics market for restaurant operations is conducted which yields a first knowledge base for future research and conceptual work. Besides detailed empirical data a reference process is developed for leveraging new technologies for process innovation.;2021
The rise in the use of virtual assistants such as Siri Google Assistant or Alexa among different sectors of society is facilitating access to information and services that were previously inconceivable due to the existing digital divide due to age. This situation allows especially the elderly to perform tasks much more easily and to access applications and services that could be a challenge for them with other digital user interfaces. With this in mind the EMERITI project aims to improve the lives of the elderly through the use of virtual assistants in different case studies. In this sense virtual voice assistants along with the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can contribute to avoid sedentarism in the elderly however it is necessary to address the problem of proactivity presented by the virtual assistants available in the market. This article presents a solution that through the use of activity monitoring smart bracelets IoT devices and virtual voice assistants allow the elderly to monitor their daily physical activity simply by using their voice and therefore prevent them from sedentary patterns. Finally this study presents the technical results obtained after the deployment of the proposed system and discusses the main advantages and the current challenges of the use of virtual assistants in applications to prevent sedentary lifestyles in the elderly.;2021
The study of human-human communication and the development of computational models for human-agent communication have diverged significantly throughout the last decade. Yet despite frequently made claims of super-human performance in e.g. speech recognition or image processing so far no system is able to lead a half-decent coherent conversation with a human. In this paper we argue that we must start to re-consider the hallmarks of cooperative communication and the core capabilities that we have developed for it and which conversational agents need to be equipped with: incremental joint co-construction and mentalizing. We base our argument on a vast body of work on human-human communication and its psychological processes that we reason to be relevant and necessary to take into account when modeling human-agent communication. We contrast those with current conceptualizations of human-agent interaction and formulate suggestions for the development of future systems.;2021
The technology improvement has radically changed how tourists perform their journey offering new services to enhance their cultural experience and to easily retrieve required information. In this paper we propose a novel framework that models intangible and tangible cultural objects into a unified data model for supporting tourists journey. In particular a Micro-service architecture has been designed to provide several services whose tourists can access through a conversational agent based on the Seq2Seq model. Furthermore we propose also an Enterprise Service Bus to ingest events automatically from promotional website or manually from public and/or private organization. We have evaluated the proposed framework according to the following two experiments: (i) the efficiency and efficacy of the Chatbot engine showing that the use of GRU cells allows to obtain better results in terms of loss and accuracy with respect to LSTM one and (ii) the efficacy of the proposed framework according to the NASA-TLX asking to 50 users to interact with the Chatbot demonstrating that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the art ones combining natural processing language user profile information and historical activities.;2021
The term natural language refers to any system of symbolic communication (spoken signed or written) without intentional human planning and design. This distinguishes natural languages such as Arabic and Japanese from artificially constructed languages such as Esperanto or Python. Natural language processing (NLP) is the sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on modeling natural languages to build applications such as speech recognition and synthesis machine translation optical character recognition (OCR) sentiment analysis (SA) question answering dialogue systems etc. NLP is a highly interdisciplinary field with connections to computer science linguistics cognitive science psychology mathematics and others. Some of the earliest AI applications were in NLP (e.g. machine translation) and the last decade (2010-2020) in particular has witnessed an incredible increase in quality matched with a rise in public awareness use and expectations of what may have seemed like science fiction in the past. NLP researchers pride themselves on developing language independent models and tools that can be applied to all human languages e.g. machine translation systems can be built for a variety of languages using the same basic mechanisms and models. However the reality is that some languages do get more attention (e.g. English and Chinese) than others (e.g. Hindi and Swahili). Arabic the primary language of the Arab world and the religious language of millions of non-Arab Muslims is somewhere in the middle of this continuum. Though Arabic NLP has many challenges it has seen many successes and developments. Next we discuss Arabic's main challenges as a necessary background and we present a brief history of Arabic NLP. We then survey a number of its research areas and close with a critical discussion of the future of Arabic NLP.;2021
The Therapeutic Alliance (TA) between patient and health provider (therapist or clinician) is one of the most relevant factors for the success of a therapy. In the case of people suffering from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) the alliance is extended to all the people involved in their care (i.e. teachers therapists clinicians relatives). In this paper we propose a multimedia application named Thea for empowering the TA of children with ASD by improving the communication among the TA members sharing guidelines multimedia contents and strategies to comply with challenging behaviors and progress with particular attention towards end-users who are occasional smart-users. A detailed process for empowering the TA members by enhancing the informed interaction among all of them is proposed and implemented. A vocal assistant also supports patients/caregivers and therapists in documenting their activity with the person with ASD by recording videos in a free-hand modality. After a contextual analysis based on Thematic Analysis Template Thea has been implemented using a user-centered development approach. We performed three iterations involving the end-users. A user study is performed at the third iteration. Results of the user study revealed a positive attitude towards the application. In particular the perception of empowerment of participants increased after the tool had been used. We also highlighted the guidelines and tools that may be adopted for empowering different kinds of patients. The first results seem to suggest that the use of Thea may increase the belief of the caregivers of a person with ASD to be able to better take care of her in a more controlled and informed way.;2021
The trend of incorporating assistive conversational agents into people's lives has followed the unprecedented expansion in the usage of artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon in particular has been a key trendsetter in this area through its Alexa-powered devices. Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant (IPA) that performs tasks such as playing music providing news and information and controlling smart home appliances. While this IPA is widely utilized it is especially gaining attention and growing usage by people with special needs. Even though the importance of the utilization of AI by people with special needs has been widely acknowledged in the extant literature a sizeable gap exists in the marketing literature in relation to the assessment of the managerial and societal implications of IPAs when used by people with special needs. Accordingly this study aims to examine (a) the stages of relationship development between Alexa and consumers with special needs and (b) the potential opportunity of this relationship for Amazon in relation to their corporate image. The findings indicate that a relationship between Alexa and consumers with special needs is established as it helps them regain their independence and freedom. This relationship provides an opportunity for Amazon in enhancing its overall image for providing solutions to facilitate the lives of people with special needs.;2021
The ultimate goal of English teaching is to cultivate the students' ability to communicate information in English master good language learning methods and become independent language learners and users. Therefore successful English language teaching needs to be achieved through language communication training between teachers and students and between students. This article investigates the importance of promoting the reform of oral English teaching in China's English teaching environment. We believe that to promote the reform of oral English teaching an oral teaching environment must be available. However the current common problem in oral English teaching in colleges and universities is that the spoken conversation objects are not standard enough or there is no person who can talk to. Therefore an intelligent spoken dialogue system based on big data and neural network technology is particularly important and the quality of dialogue depends on accurate spoken speech evaluation. We first extracted six features of pronunciation quality fluency content richness topic relevance grammar and vocabulary richness. Secondly we propose an evaluation model that connects specific TDNN layers in a feedforward manner using the feature representation of target words in different TDNN layers which can obtain richer context information and greatly reduce the amount of model parameters. Finally we conducted a simulation experiment. The experimental results show that the proposed model is accurate in evaluating spoken English and can effectively assist the reform of spoken English teaching in colleges and universities and its performance is better than SVM by 9.2%.;2021
The use of chatbots to manage online interactions with consumers poses additional ethical challenges linked to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and opens up new ethical avenues for investigation. A literature analysis identifies a research gap regarding the ethical challenges related to chatbots as non-moral and non-independent agents managing non-real conversations with consumers. It raises concerns about the ethical implications related to the progressive automation of online conversational processes and their integration with AI. The conversational approach has been explored in the organisational and management literature which has analysed the features and roles of conversations in managing interactions ethically. This study aims to discuss conceptually the ethical challenges related to chatbots within the marketplace by integrating the current chatbot-based literature with that on conversation management studies. A new conceptual model is proposed which embraces ethical considerations in the future development of chatbots.;2021
The use of conversational agents in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has been identified as a useful tactic for motivational intervention. The purpose of the current study was to design and implement a conversational agent called a motivational online conversational agent (MOCA) that incorporated motivational interviewing (MI) and was based on an intelligent dialog engine to enhance learner engagement in CSCL. Additionally the study empirically examined the effects of MOCA on promoting positive changes in collaborative learning engagement through multiturn conversation interventions. A prototype system was developed by combining MOCA and an immersive virtual world and an effectiveness study was conducted with 40 volunteers. A series of multilevel growth models based on the framework of the hierarchical linear model was established through multiwave longitudinal data. The results indicated that the use of MOCA significantly improved student engagement scores (p < 0.001) and that female students performed better on collaborative tasks than male students (p < 0.05 t = 2.97). Additionally time was an important predictor and significantly interacted with the MOCA-use condition. The study has implications for the design and assessment of conversational agents embodied in virtual reality.;2021
The use of personal voice-assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant has been on the rise recently. To ensure a long-term success and widespread diffusion of these products it is important to evaluate their continued usage scenario instead of the initial adoption intention. Majority of research evaluating the continuance usage scenario do so via an expectation-confirmation approach. However in this work a user engagement-based approach is taken for evaluating the utilitarian and hedonic attitudes of the users towards the continued usage scenario. This is augmented with additional contextual constructs like trust privacy risk and satisfaction. At present there is little empirical evidence of user engagement with voice-assistants. Moreover the present work focuses on the continuance usage of late adopters by considering two unique personal factors (slowness of adoption and skepticism). By evaluating the engagement aspect of the laggard group the current findings contribute to theory by providing a better understanding of how the proposed antecedents determine the continuance intention. Data is collected from 244 late adopters of voice-assistants who use these devices in their daily life for building the research framework. All the proposed hypotheses are supported except the effect of privacy risk. The implications for both theory and practice are provided based on the findings.;2021
The user experience of an asynchronous video interview system conventionally is not reciprocal or conversational. Interview applicants expect that like a typical face-to-face interview they are innate and coherent. We posit that the planned adoption of limited probing through follow-up questions is an important step towards improving the interaction. We propose a follow-up question generation model (followQG) capable of generating relevant and diverse follow-up questions based on the previously asked questions and their answers. We implement a 3D virtual interviewing system Maya with capability of follow-up question generation. Existing asynchronous interviewing systems are not dynamic with scripted and repetitive questions. In comparison Maya responds with relevant follow-up questions a largely unexplored feature of virtual interview systems. We take advantage of the implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models to generate rich and varied natural language follow-up questions. Empirical results suggest that followQG generates questions that humans rate as high quality achieving 77% relevance. A comparison with strong baselines of neural network and rule-based systems show that it produces better quality questions. The corpus used for fine-tuning is made publicly available.;2021
The virtual assistants' market is drastically growing and is expected to reach $2.1 billion by 2020. Nonetheless the quick expansion and high penetration of e-retailers' AI ecosystem into the shopper's journey is still under researched in the extant literature. Amazon's Alexa in particular has been fast proliferating into the customer's journey favoring the development of captive audiences given this new ambient environment. Through a mixed methodology using both qualitative and quantitative approaches this study examines Amazon's captive relationship strategy on shoppers brands and competing retailers. The research findings show that Amazon's AI relationship strategy with its customers is based on forming a multi-faceted identity for the AI that would later on facilitate a captive situation that would lead to an addictive relationship. This study is amongst the first to examine the rapid development of e-retailers' AI ecosystem into the shopper's journey. Taking the pioneering case of Amazon's Alexa powered devices this research presents a working framework upon which scholars and practitioners alike could base their future studies and strategies on in the fast-growing field of interactive voice assistants and AI led conversations.;2021
The visual analysis dialog system utilizing natural language interface is emerging as a promising data analysis tool. However previous work mostly focused on accurately understanding the query intention of a user but not on generating answers and inducing explorations. A focus+context answer generation approach which allows users to obtain insight and contextual information simultaneously is proposed in this work to address the incomplete user query (i.e. input query cannot reflect all possible intentions of the user). A query recommendation algorithm which applies the historical query information of a user to recommend a follow-up query is also designed and implemented to provide an in-depth exploration. These ideas are implemented in a system called DT2VIS. Specific cases of utilizing DT2VIS are also provided to analyze data. Finally the results show that DT2VIS could help users easily and efficiently reach their analysis goals in a comparative study.;2021
The widespread adoption of smartphones and the new-generation wireless networks have changed the way that people interact among themselves and with their environment. The use of messaging platforms such as WhatsApp has become deeply ingrained in peoples' lives and many digital services have started to be delivered using these communication channels. In this work we propose a new OAuth grant type to be used when the interaction between the resource owner and the client takes place through a messaging platform. This new grant type firstly allows the authorization server to be sure that no Man-in-the-Middle risk exists between the resource owner and the client before issuing an access token. Secondly it allows the authorization server to interact with the resource owner through the same user-agent already being used to interact with the client i.e. the messaging platform which is expected to improve the overall user experience of the authorization process. To verify this assumption we conducted a usability study in which subjects were required to perform the full authorization process using both the standard authorization code grant type (through a web-browser) and the new grant type defined in this work. They have also been required to fill in a small questionnaire including some demographic information and their impressions about both authorization flows. The results suggest that the proposed grant type eases the authorization process in most cases.;2021
The widespread development of conversational agents (chatbots) has enabled us to communicate and collaborate with different forms and functions of robots using natural language thus facilitating a closer relationship between humans and technology. Given that chatbot services infused with domain knowledge are of great interest to not only global businesses but also academics chatbots have in recent years become a popular research topic in the field of natural language processing. We therefore aim at improving current chatbots with the addition of natural emotions. In contrast to previous work we intend to distinguish fine-grained emotion differences between words in order to better understand emotion expressions in sentences. Our approach infuses fine-grained emotion content into the response generation process to make the dialog more emotionally resonant. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can classify emotions more effectively. In addition the proposed hybrid model which consists of recurrent and convolutional neural networks with additional emotion specific valence-arousal features can correctly identify five emotions with a 67.89% overall F1-score. We further evaluate the subjective quality of the responses and discover that the infusion of finegrained emotion information substantially improves the quality and fluency of automatically generated empathetic conversation. We conclude that the proposed model can greatly improve the efficiency and usability of a conversational chatbot system. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2021
There are many young people who experience mental health and wellbeing challenges. A potential negative mental health trigger for some youth is a struggle to cope with stress at school feelings of depression and anxiety and availability of adequate help for these stressors. In response to youth needs a mental health and wellbeing Chatbot has been co-developed with youth technology partners and expert stakeholders. An element of the Chatbot is powered by artificial intelligence and rules based AI using natural language processing. It is created to communicate evidence based resources wellbeing support educational mental health information and adaptive coping strategies. This paper will discuss how the Chatbot has been developed highlighting its participatory co-design process with youth who are the key stakeholders to benefit from this digital tool. Research from interviews and surveys informed the creation of the Chabots personality and its character design. Examples of the conversation design and content development are provided. The paper finishes with how if at all digital tools such as Chatbot applications could support the mental health of young people in secondary schools or health care settings in conjunction with the wellbeing or health care team concluding with lessons learned and cautions.;2021
There has been a recent surge of interest in social chatbots and human-chatbot relationships (HCRs) are becoming more prevalent but little knowledge exists on how HCRs develop and may impact the broader social context of the users. Guided by Social Penetration Theory we interviewed 18 participants all of whom had developed a friendship with a social chatbot named Replika to understand the HCR development process. We find that at the outset HCRs typically have a superficial character motivated by the users' curiosity. The evolving HCRs are characterised by substantial affective exploration and engagement as the users' trust and engagement in self-disclosure increase. As the relationship evolves to a stable state the frequency of interactions may decrease but the relationship can still be seen as having substantial affective and social value. The relationship with the social chatbot was found to be rewarding to its users positively impacting the participants' perceived wellbeing. Key chatbot characteristics facilitating relationship development included the chatbot being seen as accepting understanding and non-judgmental. The perceived impact on the users' broader social context was mixed and a sense of stigma associated with HCRs was reported. We propose an initial model representing the HCR development identified in this study and suggest avenues for future research.;2021
There is an unprecedented demand for infodemic management due to rapidly evolving information about the novel COVID-19 pandemic. This viewpoint paper details the evolution of a Canadian digital information tool Chloe for COVID-19 based on incremental leveraging of artificial intelligence techniques. By providing an accessible summary of Chloe's development we show how proactive cooperation between health technology and corporate sectors can lead to a rapidly scalable safe and secure virtual chatbot to assist public health efforts in keeping Canadians informed. We then highlight Chloe's strengths the challenges we faced during the development process and future directions for the role of chatbots in infodemic management. The information presented here may guide future collaborative efforts in health technology in order to enhance access to accurate and timely health information to the public.;2021
There is growing interest in chatbots as a leading technology for digital transformation in the financial industry. However studies have largely investigated chatbots from the perspective of customers and developers and very few examine chatbot services from the perspective of managers who play a central role in the organizational adoption of chatbots. This paper aims to explore managers? perception of chatbots to help understand the initiation of financial chatbots and forecast the future of their service in South Korea which has seen active use of chatbots by financial firms. We conducted semi-structured interviews with managers in charge of chatbot services in Korean financial firms and employed a core?periphery analysis of social representations. Our findings will enhance the understanding of the status of chatbot services in the Korean financial industry and provide theoretical implications and managerial insights.;2021
Third-party tracking on the Web has been used for collecting and correlating user's browsing behavior. Due to the increasing use of ad-blocking and third-party tracking protections tracking providers introduced a new technique called CNAME cloaking. It misleads Web browsers into believing that a request for a subdomain of the visited website originates from this particular website while this subdomain uses a CNAME to resolve to a tracking-related third-party domain. This technique thus circumvents the third-party targeting privacy protections. The goals of this paper are to characterize detect and protect the end-user against CNAME cloaking based tracking. Firstly we characterize CNAME cloaking-based tracking by crawling top pages of the Alexa Top 300000 sites and analyzing the usage of CNAME cloaking with CNAME blocklist including websites and tracking providers using this technique to track users' activities. We also point out that browsers and privacy protection extensions are largely ineffective to deal with CNAME cloaking-based tracking except for Firefox with a developer's version of the uBlock Origin extension. Secondly we propose a supervised machine learning-based approach to detect CNAME cloaking-based tracking without the on-demand DNS lookup. We show that the proposed approach outperforms well-known tracking filter lists. Finally to circumvent the lack of DNS API in Chrome-based browsers we design and implement a prototype of the supervised machine learning-based browser extension to detect and filter out CNAME cloaking tracking called CNAMETracking Uncloaker. Our evaluation shows that CNAMETracking Uncloaker is able to filter out CNAME cloaking-based tracking requests without performance degradation when compared with the vanilla setting on the Chrome browser.;2021
This article illustrates how racial capitalism can enhance understandings of data capital and inequality through an in-depth study of digital platforms used for intervening in gender-based violence. Specifically we examine an emergent sociotechnical strategy that uses software platforms and artificial intelligence (Al) chatbots to offer users emergency assistance education and a means to report and build evidence against perpetrators. Our analysis details how two reporting apps construct data to support institutionally legible narratives of violence highlighting overlooked racialised dimensions of the data capital generated through their use. We draw attention to how they reinforce property relations built on extraction and ownership capital accumulation that reinforces benefits derived through data property relations and ownership and the commodification of diversity and inclusion. Recognising these patterns are not unique to anti-violence apps we reflect on how this example aids in understanding how racial capitalism becomes a constitutive element of digital platforms which more generally extract information from users rely on complex financial partnerships and often sustain problematic relationships with the criminal legal system. We conclude with a discussion of how racial capitalism can advance scholarship at the intersections of data and power.;2021
This article presents a novel design of a Virtual Assistant as part of a human-machine interaction system to improve communication between the presenter and the audience that can be used in education or general presentations for improving interaction during the presentations (e.g. auditoriums with 200 people). The main goal of the proposed model is the design of a framework of interaction to increase the level of attention of the public in key aspects of the presentation. In this manner the collaboration between the presenter and Virtual Assistant could improve the level of learning among the public. The design of the Virtual Assistant relies on non-anthropomorphic forms with 'live' characteristics generating an intuitive and self-explainable interface. A set of intuitive and useful virtual interactions to support the presenter was designed. This design was validated from various types of the public with a psychological study based on a discrete emotions' questionnaire confirming the adequacy of the proposed solution. The human-machine interaction system supporting the Virtual Assistant should automatically recognize the attention level of the audience from audiovisual resources and synchronize the Virtual Assistant with the presentation. The system involves a complex artificial intelligence architecture embracing perception of high-level features from audio and video knowledge representation and reasoning for pervasive and affective computing and reinforcement learning to teach the intelligent agent to decide on the best strategy to increase the level of attention of the audience.;2021
This correspondence introduces a correction on the survey entitled A Survey on Empathetic Dialogue Systems recently published in the Information Fusion journal. The authors of this correspondence first presented in 2010 a methodology for the scalable fusion of affective channels in a 2D continuous emotional space including a novel emotional kinematics filtering technique. This methodology was inappropriately attributed to other authors in the survey. This manuscript shows and clarifies its origin.;2021
This essay illuminates the ways that tech corporations harness the specter of white femininity and program it into artificially intelligent virtual assistants (AI VAs). Specifically AI VAs reflect characteristics of white femininity in voice and cultural configuration for the purposes of white supremacy and capitalistic gain. These characteristics serve to not only uphold whiteness as both normative and technologically superior but also rationalize neoliberal logics. I specifically focus on the projected supremacy of white voice and the use of AI VAs as playing into the white fantasy of exit what James Brook and Iain A. Boal deem another 'white flight.';2021
This explorative study investigated (a) whether social attraction self-disclosure interaction quality intimacy empathy and communicative competence play a role in getting-acquainted interactions between humans and a chatbot and (b) whether humans can build a relationship with a chatbot. Although human-machine communication research suggests that humans can develop feelings for computers this does not automatically imply that humans experience feelings of friendship with a chatbot. In this longitudinal study 118 participants had seven interactions with chatbot Mitsuku over a 3-week period. After each interaction participants filled out a questionnaire. The results showed that the social processes decreased after each interaction and feelings of friendship were low. In line with the ABCDE model of relationship development the social processes that aid relationship continuation decrease leading to deterioration of the relationship. Furthermore a novelty effect was at play after the first interaction after which the chatbot became predictable and the interactions less enjoyable.;2021

This paper presents a miniature and cost-effective cell fiber-spectrophotometer based on fluorescence emission sensing for real-time detection of biomarkers. The prototype comprises a highly sensitive spectrometer embedded in an inexpensive 3D-printed housing and a custom-designed printed circuit board to transmit the data wirelessly. Results show that this portable system can identify micro-volume samples of tubulin protein a well-known biomarker to study different types of cancer. Additionally our ambulatory prototype is small in size (30 mm x 24 mm x 43 mm) lightweight (19 g) economical and low-power (103 mW). Fluorescence spectrophotometry measurement results obtained in vitro for stained VERO E6 cells using the presented prototype are reported. A set of samples with varying concentrations of Alexa Fluor 488 were also tested and their spectral responses were measured within the range of 340-850 nm with a resolution of 15 nm. The measured limits of quantification and detection are 20 and 4 mu g/mL respectively while the measured responsivity is 85 mV/nW with a minimum detectable power of 117 fW at 519 nm. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations of 1.5% and 4.7% respectively were measured during longitudinal sensitivity experiments.;2021
This paper presents a new methodology for modeling the local semantic distribution of responses to a given query in the human-conversation corpus and on this basis explores a specified adversarial learning mechanism for training Neural Response Generation (NRG) models to build conversational agents. Our investigation begins with the thorough discussions upon the objective function of general Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) architectures and the training instability problem is proved to be highly relative with the special local distributions of conversational corpora. Consequently an energy function is employed to estimate the status of a local area restricted by the query and its responses in the semantic space and the mathematical approximation of this energy-based distribution is finally found. Building on this foundation a local distribution oriented objective is proposed and combined with the original objective working as a hybrid loss for the adversarial training of response generation models named as LocalGAN. Our experimental results demonstrate that the reasonable local distribution modeling of the query-response corpus is of great importance to adversarial NRG and our proposed LocalGAN is promising for improving both the training stability and the quality of generated results.;2021
This paper proposed a temperature adaptive refresh circuit for traditional memory with fixed refresh frequency high refresh power consumption at low temperature and low refresh frequency at high temperature. The 2T core storage unit combining with the existing CMOS process and circuit is taking as the research object considering the characteristics of temperature rising leakage current increasing information holding time shortening and the various constraints between the area power consumption and other performance this paper proposes to add the same redundant unit as the storage array to the storage array as the temperature monitoring circuit to realize the adaptive refresh function and designs the core circuit. The simulation results show that the design of SMIC 0.09 um standard CMOS process fully meets the requirements of memory adaptive refresh. In recent years with the continuous reduction of feature size and the vigorous development of PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) devices high-performance dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has been widely used in SoC [1]. However with the technological innovation and technological improvement on the one hand it is required the compatibility of logical process and interface can be comparable to SRAM on the other hand it is expected to have advantages in power consumption and density. As a new type of capacitor free memory device 2TGC (doubletube gain capacitor) memory cell has become one of the;2021
This paper proposes a hierarchical method for learning an efficient Dialogue Management (DM) strategy for task-oriented conversations serving multiple intents of a domain. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) networks specializing in individual intents communicate with each other having the capability of sharing overlapping information across intents. The sharing of information across state space and the presence of global slot tracker prohibits the agent to reask known information. Thus the system is able to handle sub-dialogues based on subset of intents covered by different Reinforcement Learning (RL) models thereby completing the dialogue without again asking already provided information common across intents. The developed system has been demonstrated for Air Travel domain. The experimental results indicate that the developed system is efficient scalable and can serve multiple intents based dialogues adequately. The proposed system when applied to 5-intent dialogue systems attains an improvement of 41% in terms of dialogue length as compared to a single-intent based system serving the same 5-intents.;2021
This paper provides a general overview of the literature regarding advanced assistive technologies devoted to improving elders' life.

While providing data on seniors' preferences about the design of assistive devices main evidence on both robots and virtual agent's appearance abilities/functionalities personalities and role features are summarized and commented.;2021
This research analyzes how digital technologies contribute to improving the successive stages of the recruitment process: identifying selecting and retaining talented people. E-recruitment is an emerging and polymorphous phenomenon that starts with identification of candidates on social networks continues through gamification of recruitment and job interviews with chatbots and ends by matching a candidate and a job using artificial intelligence. These technologies are particularly useful for social businesses looking to recruit not only skilled people but above all employees who have behaviors and values that match their mission. The methodology is based on grounded theory participant observation and qualitative data collection. A multiple case study is designed to analyze compare and combine several technologies dedicated to recruitment: (1) a social network with LinkedIn (2) a MOOC with Udacity (3) a serious game called Reveal from L'Ore ' al (4) a chatbot called Ari from TextRecruit and (5) a massive data analysis matching system with Randstad.tech. The discussion examines the respective performance and limits of these tools and their convergence via a progressive integration that leads to an uberization of recruitment. Managerial recommendations are formulated to support recruiters in their adoption of e-recruitment.;2021
This research note examines how framing influences attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI). It uses an experiment embedded in a nationally representative online survey to test the effects of text-based frames and visuals on opinion about developing funding and banning AI. Participants exposed to a social progress frame reported greater support for AI than those exposed to a Pandora's box frame. Images (virtual assistants personal robots menacing movie AIs or none) did not influence opinion by themselves but interacted with textual frames to do so. The results extend our understanding of framing effects on public attitudes toward emerging technologies.;2021
This research proposes a four-stage consultant framework for applying a chatbot as a data management system. With the advancement of computational power and data storage technology the increasing amount of data makes the issue of data management difficult to address. Management of a massive amount of data by utilizing chatbots to play the roles of a data manager and a data provider has been extensively studied. Although a chatbot system has been proven to increase the overall efficiency of data management implementing a chatbot system in a government department remains a challenge especially in a field with highly complex data. This research presents the authors' experience of applying a chatbot system in a department of the government of Taiwan for disaster response operations. A four-stage consulting framework comprising 1) existing workflow review 2) usability evaluation 3) system improvement and 4) management plan (EUSM) was thus proposed. After a two-year field test the authors found that the framework could help the department in clarifying their working process increase the overall efficiency of the chatbot system and identify the major issues of introducing the chatbot system.;2021
This study aimed to propose a novel method for designing a product recommendation virtual agent (PRVA) that can keep users motivated to interact with the agent. In prior papers many methods of keeping users motivated postulated real-time and multi-modal interactions. The proposed novel method can be used in one-direction interaction. We defined the notion of the hidden vector that is information that is not mentioned by a PRVA and that the user can suppose spontaneously. We conducted an experiment to verify the hypothesis that PRVAs having a hidden vector are more effective than other PRVAs. As a result it was shown that PRVAs having a hidden vector were perceived as being more persuasive than other PRVAs and strongly motivated the users to use the PRVAs. From these results the proposed method was shown to be effective.;2021
This study aims to evaluate the perceptions of librarians with regard to artificial intelligence in academic libraries. An online survey of 24 questions was distributed through library distribution lists in Canada and the United States at the end of the summer in 2019. Findings suggest that librarians do not agree on a definition of artificial intelligence which is in keeping with this emerging field. The survey responses highlight the fact that academic librarians require more training with regard to artificial intelligence and its potential applications in libraries. Other important implications include a recognition that library patrons are interested in AI and that little to no programming about it has been offered in academic libraries. Very few studies have focused on academic librarians' perceptions of AI. This article highlights some useful practical implications for AI technologies in libraries and how AI could help improve library services and workflows.;2021
This study aims to explore the influence of various possible combinations of consumer attribute benefits and the message direction provided by merchants on the final purchase intention of consumers. A two-factor experimental design was used to collect data from Generation Z consumers. Four experimental combination scenarios were designed based on consumer attribute benefits (hedonic or utilitarian) and message direction (positive or negative messages). A total of 160 valid samples were obtained and the influence of variable-final purchase intention was analyzed. The results showed that the combination of product attributes and message direction has a significant impact on purchase intention and that hedonic products should be recommended to process-benefit consumers through positive messages. However chatbots should choose utilitarian products and negative messages to effectively improve consumers' purchase intention and willingness. In practical application by finding out the best correspondence method of message transmission and providing the AI chatbot with a reference for the logical construction of content transmission the communication efficiency between merchants and consumers can be enhanced and the scientific and technological service capability of merchants can be improved.;2021
This study aims to investigate the effect of chatbots that work with artificial intelligence on the success of students and their opinions about chatbots in the 'Matter and the changing state of matter' unit in the 5th grade science course. In addition to text-based functions the designed chatbot includes a video accessed on the web to support students visually and aurally. The chatbot was designed using the Dialogflow program and an instant messaging program made available to students through a group created on Telegram. The study which used a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design included 41 participants (n = 20 for the experimental n = 21 for the control group) studying in the 5th grade of a state secondary school in the 2020-2021 academic year. Results suggest that although there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of academic achievement it was determined that the chatbot application positively affected the online learning experience of the experimental group students. Students' opinions about the chatbot included that it was useful and fun they would like to use it for other courses it provided useful assistance in learning outside the classroom and it allowed them to repeat the course again. The results showed that especially during the Covid-19 pandemic such applications could contribute positively to students' learning.;2021
This study analyzes the relationship between consumers' values and their reasons for and against perceived value co-creation as well as their behavioral intentions related to using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled travel service agents (chatbots). Structual equation modeling (SEM) results mainly support the hypotheses driven by the behavioral reasoning theory (BRT) but presume that one means lead to usage intentions of AI-enabled travel service agents. Given the interdependency and complexity of consumers' reasoning processes in addition fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is conducted to provide more insight into this unexplored topic presuming multiple different trajectories. The complex solutions of fsQCA indicate that four different combinations sufficiently explain consumers' intent to use AI-enabled travel service agents. Overall the findings shed light on a new area of consumer behavior and the acceptance of AI-enabled service encounters.;2021
This study developed a chatbot to improve the efficiency of government activation of mine safety procedures during natural disasters. Taiwan has a comprehensive governmental system dedicated to responding to frequent natural disasters and the Bureau of Mines has instituted clear procedures to ensure the delivery of disaster alarms and damage reports. However the labor- and time-consumption procedures are inefficient. In this study we propose a system framework for disaster-related information retrieval and immediate notifications to support the execution of mine safety procedures. The framework utilizes instant messaging (IM) applications as the user interface to look up information and send messages to announce the occurrence of disaster events. We evaluated the efficiency of the procedures before and after adopting the system and achieved a time-cost reduction of 55.8 min among three types of disaster events. The study has proven the feasibility of adopting novel techniques for decision-making and assures the improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedure activation.;2021
This study discussed and evaluated the usefulness performance and technology acceptance of a chatbot developed to educate users and provide health literacy. A semi-structured interview and analytic sessions were provided on Google Analytics dashboard and the users' acceptance toward the technology was measured using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). A total of 75 undergraduate students were involved over a total period of two months. Each respondent explored the health chatbot actively to get advice from it with a phrase that matched the chatbot's intents via mobile devices. The evaluation results showed that 73.3% of the respondents found that the chatbot can help understand several health issues and provide a good conversation. The performance evaluation also showed that the chatbot contributed a low percentage of exit where less than 37% of users exited the application. The overall assessment showed that the developed chatbot has a significant potential to be used as a conversational agent to increase health literacy especially among students and young adults. However more research should be done before the technology can replace humans in a real setting.;2021
This study examined how and when a chatbot's emotional support was effective in reducing people's stress and worry. It compared emotional support from chatbot versus human partners in terms of its process and conditional effects on stress/worry reduction. In an online experiment participants discussed a personal stressor with a chatbot or a human partner who provided none or either one or both of emotional support and reciprocal self-disclosure. The results showed that emotional support from a conversational partner was mediated through perceived supportiveness of the partner to reduce stress and worry among participants and the link from emotional support to perceived supportiveness was stronger for a human than for a chatbot. A conversational partner's reciprocal self-disclosure enhanced the positive effect of emotional support on worry reduction. However when emotional support was absent a solely self-disclosing chatbot reduced even less stress than a chatbot not providing any response to participants' stress. Lay Summary In recent years AI chatbots have increasingly been used to provide empathy and support to people who are experiencing stressful times. This study compared emotional support from a chatbot compared to that of a human who provided support. We were interested in examining which approach could best effectively reduce people's worry and stress. When either a person or a chatbot was able to engage with a stressed individual and tell that individual about their own experiences they were able to build rapport. We found that this type of reciprocal self-disclosure was effective in calming the worry of the individual. Interestingly if a chatbot only reciprocally self-disclosed but offered no emotional support the outcome was worse than if the chatbot did not respond to people at all. This work will help in the development of supportive chatbots by providing insights into when and what they should self-disclose.;2021
This study examined the factors that affect artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot users' use of profanity and offensive words employing the concepts of ethical ideology social competence and perceived humanlikeness of chatbot. The study also looked into users' liking of chatbots' responses to the users' utterance of profanity and offensive words. Using a national survey (N = 645) the study found that users' idealism orientation was a significant factor in explaining use of such offensive language. In addition users with high idealism revealed liking of chatbots' active intervention whereas those with high relativism displayed liking of chatbots' reactive responses. Moreover users' perceived humanlikeness of chatbot increased their likelihood of using offensive words targeting dislikable acquaintances racial/ethnic groups and political parties. These findings are expected to fill the gap between the current use of AI chatbots and the lack of empirical studies examining language use.;2021
This study examines technology effectiveness for industry demand in which artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in the financial sector. It summarizes prior studies on chatbot and customer service and investigates theories on acceptance attitudes for innovative technologies. By setting variables the study examines bank revenue methodologically and assesses the impact of customer service and chatbot on bank revenues through customer age classification. The results indicate that new product-oriented funds or housing subscription savings are more suitable for purchase through customer service than through chatbot. However services for existing products through chatbot positively affect banks' net income. When classified by age purchases by the majority age group in the channel positively affect bank profits. Finally there is a tendency to process small banking transactions through the chatbot system which saves transaction and management costs positively affecting profits. Through empirical analysis we first examine the effect of an AI-based chatbot system implemented to strengthen financial soundness and suggest policy alternatives. Second we use banking data to increase the study's real-life applicability and prove that problems in customer service can be solved through a chatbot system. Finally we investigate how resistance to technology can be reduced and efficiently accommodated.;2021
This study investigated how computer agents' language style affects summary writing in an Intelligent Tutoring System called CSAL AutoTutor. Participants interacted with two computer agents in one of three language styles: (1) a formal language style (2) an informal language style and (3) a mixed language style. Primary results indicated that participants improved the quality of summary writing spent less time writing summaries and had lower syntactic complexity but more non-narrative summaries on posttest than pretest. However this difference was not affected by the discourse formality that agents used during instruction. Results also showed participants rated peer summaries more accurately for cause/effect texts in the formal and mixed conditions but generated summaries with lower referential cohesion in the informal condition on posttest than pretest.;2021
This study investigated the impact of a chatbot-based micro-learning system on students' learning motivation and performance. A quasi-experiment was conducted with 99 first-year students taking part in a basic computer course on number system conversion. The students were assigned to a traditional learning group or a chatbot-based micro-learning group. After the experiment both groups achieved a comparable performance suggesting that students are sufficiently competent to learn independently in the chatbot-based learning environment without the need for continuous face-to-face delivery. Moreover students in the chatbot learning group attained significantly higher intrinsic motivation than the traditional learning group with perceived choice and perceived value as core predictors of intrinsic motivation. Further analysis with the Johnson-Neyman procedure revealed differences on interaction between the perceived choice and the learning environments. For students with a high initial perceived choice (>=5.1) chatbot-based learning further enhances their post choice motivation whereas for students with a low initial perceived choice (<=3.0) the traditional classroom is more suitable to enhance their post choice motivation. The implications of the findings can help instructors to incorporate chatbot-based learning in the classroom.;2021
This study proposes an intelligent knowledge-based conversational agent system architecture to support customer services in e-commerce sales and marketing. A pilot implementation of a chatbot for customer services is reported in a leading women's intimate apparel manufacturing firm. The proposed system incorporates various emerging technologies including web crawling natural language processing knowledge bases and artificial intelligence. In this study a prototype system is built in a real-world setting. The results of the system prototype evaluation are satisfactory and support the contention that the system is effective. The study also discusses the challenges and lessons learned during system implementation and the theoretical and managerial implications of this study.;2021
This study uses artificial intelligence and big data technologies to develop a chatbot prototype for veterinary consultations. To understand pet owners' behavioral intentions to use the chatbot for veterinary consultations we modify the technology acceptance model to develop a usage intention model for the veterinary consultation chatbot. We survey members of a pet network community by using Google Forms to collect data and partial least squares structural equation modeling for analysis. The results indicate that the perceived accuracy perceived completeness and perceived ease of use increased pet owners' user satisfaction of veterinary consultation chatbot the perceived convenience and pet owners' user satisfaction increased pet owners' behavioral intention to use chatbot for veterinary consultations. This study can be used as a basis for evaluation of using intelligent technologies in pet healthcare consultation and pet disease management. (C) 2020 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge.

This work aimed to study the effect of confinement on weight and lifestyle using the Wakamola chatbot to collect data from 739 adults divided into two groups (341 case-control 398 confinement). Nutrition score (0-100 scale) improved for men (medians 81.77-82.29 p<0.05) with no difference for women (medians 82.29 in both cases). Both genders reduced the consumption of sweetmeats and sugared drinks (p<0.01) men increased their consumption of vegetables salad and legumes (p<0.01). Both genders reduced their physical activity score (men 100-40.14 p<0.01 women 80.42-36.12 p<0.01). Women sat less hours/week men's medians 28.81-28.27 women's medians 35.97-23.33 p=0.03. Both genders slept longer (hours/day) men 7-7.5 women 7-8 (p<0.01) (medians). Their overall health score was significantly reduced (men 85.06-74.05 p<0.01 women 84.47-72.42 p<0.01) with no significant weight difference in either gender. Wakamola helped to contact participants and confirm changes in their lifestyle during confinement.;2021
This work conducts a comprehensive empirical analysis on the privacy policies of 64720 Amazon Alexa skills and 16002 Google Assistant actions. We show that a substantial number of problematic privacy policies exist in the Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant platforms.;2021
This work serves as a review of our experience applying off-policy techniques to train and evaluate a contextual bandit model powering a troubleshooting notification in a chatbot. First we demonstrate the effectiveness of off-policy evaluation when data volume is orders of magnitude less than typically found in the literature. We present our reward function and choices behind its design as well as how we construct our logging policy to balance exploration and performance on key metrics. Next we present a guided framework to update a model post-training called Post-Hoc Reward Distribution Hacking which we employed to improve model performance and correct deficiencies in trained models stemming from the existence of a null action and a noisy reward signal. Throughout the work we include discussions of various practical pitfalls encountered while using off-policy methods in hopes to expedite other applications of these techniques.;2021
To emulate the interactivity of in-person math instruction we developed MathBot a rule-based chatbot that explains math concepts provides practice questions and offers tailored feedback. We evaluated MathBot through three Amazon Mechanical Turk studies in which participants learned about arithmetic sequences. In the first study we found that more than 40% of our participants indicated a preference for learning with MathBot over videos and written tutorials from Khan Academy. The second study measured learning gains and found that MathBot produced comparable gains to Khan Academy videos and tutorials. We solicited feedback from users in those two studies to emulate a real-world development cycle with some users finding the lesson too slow and others finding it too fast. We addressed these concerns in the third and main study by integrating a contextual bandit algorithm into MathBot to personalize the pace of the conversation allowing the bandit to either insert extra practice problems or skip explanations. We randomized participants between two conditions in which actions were chosen uniformly at random (i.e. a randomized A/B experiment) or by the contextual bandit. We found that the bandit learned a similarly effective pedagogical policy to that learned by the randomized A/B experiment while incurring a lower cost of experimentation. Our findings suggest that personalized conversational agents are promising tools to complement existing online resources for math education and that data-driven approaches such as contextual bandits are valuable tools for learning effective personalization.;2021
To improve customer experience and achieve sustainable development many industries especially banking have leveraged artificial intelligence to implement a chatbot into their customer service. By integrating DeLone and McLean's information systems success (D&M ISS) model and the expectation confirmation model (ECM) with the factor of trust the aim of this study was to investigate the determinants of users' continuance intentions towards chatbot services in the context of banking in Vietnam. A total of 359 questionnaire surveys were collected from a real bank's chatbot users and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings revealed that users' continuance intentions towards the banks' chatbot services were influenced by satisfaction trust and perceived usefulness of which trust had the strongest effect. The results also indicate that information quality system quality service quality and confirmation of expectations had significant effects on three drivers of continuance intention in different ways. Our study contributes to the literature by providing a more comprehensive viewpoint to understand the perceptions and reactions of chatbot users in the post-adoption stage. The results of this study also yield several key suggestions for banking service providers on how to increase their customers' intentions to continue using chatbot services serving as a basis for long-term and sustainable development strategies in the current digital era.;2021
To support older users' accessibility and learning of the prevalent information and communication technologies (ICTs) libraries as informal learning institutes are committed to information literacy education activities with friendly interfaces. Chatbots using Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) with natural and intuitive interactions have received growing research and practical attention however older users report regular frustrations and problems in using them. To serve as a basis for the subsequent design and development of an automated dialog mechanism in senior-friendly chatbots a between-subject user experiment was conducted with 30 older adults divided into three groups. The preliminary findings on their interactions with the voice chatbots designed with different error handling strategies were reported. Participants' behavioral patterns performances and the tactics they employed in interacting with the three types of chatbots were analyzed. The results of the study showed that the use of multiple error handling strategies is beneficial for older users to achieve effectiveness and satisfaction in human-robot interactions and facilitate their attitude toward information technology. This study contributes empirical evidence in the genuine and pragmatic field of gerontechnology and expands upon voice chatbots research by exploring conversation errors in human-robot interactions that could be of further application in designing educational and living gerontechnology.;2021

Unstructured data from the internet constitute large sources of information which need to be formatted in a user-friendly way. This research develops a model that classifies unstructured data from data mining into labeled data and builds an informational and decision-making support system (DMSS). We often have assortments of information collected by mining data from various sources where the key challenge is to extract valuable information. We observe substantial classification accuracy enhancement for our datasets with both machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The highest classification accuracy (99% in training 96% in testing) was achieved from a Covid corpus which is processed by using a long short-term memory (LSTM). Furthermore we conducted tests on large datasets relevant to the Disaster corpus with an LSTM classification accuracy of 98%. In addition random forest (RF) a machine learning algorithm provides a reasonable 84% accuracy. This research's main objective is to increase the application's robustness by integrating intelligence into the developed DMSS which provides insight into the user's intent despite dealing with a noisy dataset. Our designed model selects the random forest and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms' F1 score where the RF method outperforms by improving accuracy by 2% (to 83% from 81%) compared with a conventional method.;2021

Using natural language processing (NLP) technologies to develop medical chatbots makes the diagnosis of the patient more convenient and efficient which is a typical application in healthcare AI. Because of its importance lots of researches have come out. Recently the neural generative models have shown their impressive ability as the core of chatbot while it cannot scale well when directly applied to medical conversation due to the lack of medical-specific knowledge. To address the limitation a scalable medical knowledge-assisted mechanism (MKA) is proposed in this paper. The mechanism is aimed at assisting general neural generative models to achieve better performance on the medical conversation task. The medical-specific knowledge graph is designed within the mechanism which contains 6 types of medical-related information including department drug check symptom disease and food. Besides the specific token concatenation policy is defined to effectively inject medical information into the input data. Evaluation of our method is carried out on two typical medical datasets MedDG and MedDialog-CN. The evaluation results demonstrate that models combined with our mechanism outperform original methods in multiple automatic evaluation metrics. Besides MKA-BERT-GPT achieves state-of-the-art performance.;2021
Virtual assistants are programs that interact with users through text or voice messages simulating a human-based conversation. The development of healthcare virtual assistants that use messaging platforms is rapidly increasing. Still there is a lack of validation of these assistants. In particular this work aimed to validate the effectiveness of a healthcare virtual assistant integrated within messaging platforms with the aim of improving medication adherence in patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus and depressive disorder. For this purpose a nine-month pilot study was designed and subsequently conducted. The virtual assistant reminds patients about their medication and provides healthcare professionals with the ability to monitor their patients. We analyzed the medication possession ratio (MPR) measured the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and obtained the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) score in the patients before and after the study. We also conducted interviews with all participants. A total of thirteen patients and five nurses used and evaluated the proposed virtual assistant using the messaging platform Signal. Results showed that on average the medication adherence improved. In the final interview 69% of the patients agreed with the idea of continuing to use the virtual assistant after the study.;2021
Virtual reality is a computer system that creates a virtual world and then experiences through multiple senses. It is generated by a computer and stimulated by perception systems such as hearing vision touch taste and smell providing users with a personal experience. Human-computer interaction is one of the core technologies of virtual reality. Wireless communication is the transmission of communications over long distances between multiple nodes without propagation through conductors or cables and can be carried out using radios radios etc. Wireless communication includes a variety of fixed mobile and portable applications such as two-way radios mobile phones personal digital assistants and wireless networks. Other examples of radio wireless communication are GPS garage door remotes wireless mice etc. Most wireless communication technologies use radio including Wi-Fi with distances of just a few meters but also deep space networks that communicate with Voyager 1 and distances of over millions of kilometers. With the continuous development of sensors and other supporting hardware facilities the current development of human-computer interaction in virtual reality has made rapid progress. In the research to be conducted in this article the virtual reality system used in this article cleverly integrates the three characteristics of immersion interactivity and conception so that the experimenter can obtain more realistic data in comparison. To this end this article first gives a general introduction to virtual reality technology and wireless communication tracking technology and then explains how to use wireless communication tracking technology to make the virtual reality interactive system smoother and smoother as well as the introduction of its devices. This article explores and analyzes the possible or existing problems of wireless communication tracking technology in virtual reality interaction hoping to contribute to the wider application of wireless communication tracking technology in virtual reality interaction. The positioning experiment on the wireless mobile signal identification points can be obtained. Among the 40 sensor nodes that are randomly deployed when the interval of adjusting the mobile signal identification point to broadcast the current position information is 5 s the average positioning error of the node is about 1.5 m when the interval is 3 s the average positioning error of the node is about 1.76 m. It can be seen that the positioning error of the node increases as the interval between the mobile signal identification points increases which is consistent with the simulation detection result. When the node position of the target signal identification point is chosen to calculate does not just stay on the node communication circle it introduces a certain localization distance difference and the further the target signal identification point is from the position of the signal circle the greater the error. Irregularity of RSS due to environmental changes analyzes the maximum error and provides the factors influencing the error and analyzing the maximum error and provide the factors that influence it.;2021
Visual dialog is a task that two agents: Question-BOT (Q-BOT) and Answer-BOT (A-BOT) which communicate in natural language on the situation of information asymmetry. Q-BOT generates questions based on an image caption and a historical dialog. A-BOT answers the questions grounded on the image. Moreover we play a cooperative 'image guessing' game between Q-BOT and A-BOT so that Q-BOT can select an unseen image from a set of images. However as the valid information of the image caption and the historical dialog fades along the interaction existing methods usually generate irrelevant and homogenous questions which are worthless to the visual dialog system. To tackle this issue we propose an A ttentive M emory N etwork (AMN) to fully exploit the image caption and historical dialog information. Specifically the attentive memory network mainly consists of a memory network and a fusion module. The memory network holds long term historical dialog information and gives each round of the dialog a different weight. Aside from the historical dialog information the fusion module in Q-BOT and A-BOT further uses the image caption and the image feature respectively. The caption information assists Q-BOT with the attentive generation of the questions and the image feature helps A-BOT produce precise answers. With the AMN the generated questions are diverse and concentrated and the corresponding answers are accurate. The experimental results on VisDial v1.0 show the effectiveness of our proposed model which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2021
Visual dialogue systems need to understand dynamic visual scenes and comprehend semantics in order to converse with users. Constructing video dialogue systems is more challenging than traditional image dialogue systems because the large feature space of videos makes it difficult to capture semantic information. Furthermore the dialogue system also needs to precisely answer users' question based on comprehensive understanding of the videos and the previous dialogue. In order to improve the performance of video dialogue system we proposed an end-to-end recurrent cross-modality attention (ReCMA) model to answer a series of questions about a video from both visual and textual modality. The answer representation of the question is updated based on both visual representation and textual representation in each step of the reasoning process to have a better understanding of both modalities' information. We evaluate our method on the challenging DSTC7 video scene-aware dialog dataset and the proposed ReCMA achieves a relative 20.8% improvement over the baseline on CIDEr.;2021
Voice assistants such as Siri Alexa and Google Assistant have recently been the subject of lively debates in regard to issues such as artificial intelligence surveillance gender stereotypes and privacy. Less attention however has been given to the fact that voice assistants are also web interfaces that might impact on how the web is accessed understood and employed by users. This article aims to advance work in this context by identifying a range of issues that should spark additional reflections and discussions within communication and media studies and related fields. In particular the article focuses on three key issues that have to do with long-standing discussions about the social and political impact of the internet: the role of web platforms in shaping information access the relationship between production and consumption online and the role of affect in informing engagement with web resources. Considering these issues in regard to voice assistants not only helps contextualize these technologies within existing debates in communication and media studies but also highlights that voice assistants pose novel questions to internet research challenging assumptions of what the web looks like as speech becomes one of the key ways to access resources and information online.;2021
Voice assistants-or voice-enabled artificial intelligence-have changed the way people interact with their surroundings dramatically. Utilizing an enactive view of social cognition theory this study demonstrates how voice assistants can act as [semi] autonomous agents to hold instantaneous social interactions with consumers. This research employed two experimental studies. Study 1 used two voice assistant mobile applications Microsoft Cortana and Google Assistant and Study 2 used Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana. The contributions this paper makes are two-fold. First the results illustrate how perceived auditory sense drives perceived auditory control through auditory social interactions with a voice assistant that lead to brand affect and con sumers' trust in the voice assistant. Second results shed light on the role of surprise as a repelling drive that attenuates the effect of perceived auditory control on brand affect.;2021
Voice controlled virtual assistants delivered via consumer devices such as smart speakers and tablets are being trialled by local authorities across England as a convenient and low-cost supplement or potential alternative to traditional telecare. Few papers have explored this increasingly widespread phenomenon despite its growing importance. This article looks at choices by some local authorities to trial Alexa within the context of the ongoing care crisis in England with councils facing depleted funds a lack of expert guidance on care technologies and an increasingly complex and fragmented care technology marketplace. It draws on interviews with managers from eight English local authorities involved in the commissioning and trialling of technologies for adult social care to examine how and why virtual assistants are being implemented and what implications their use might hold for care. Scaling up the application of such technologies could shift the role of local authorities towards one of an app developer and data broker while generating considerable risks of reliance on the precarious technological infrastructure of global corporations that may have little interest in or sensitivity towards local care concerns. The findings suggest an urgent need for a national social care technology strategy and increased support for local authorities.;2021
Voice user interfaces (VUI) have been increasingly used in everyday settings and they are growing in popularity. These interfaces have predominantly eyes-free and hands-free interactions. This kind of experiences continues to be an inceptive field compared to other input methods such as touch or using the keyboard/mouse. Thus it is important to identify tools used to evaluate the usability of VUIs. This article presents a systematic review in which we analyzed 57 articles and describes nine questionnaires used for evaluating the usability of VUIs assessing the potential suitability of these questionnaires to measure different types of interactions and various usability dimensions. We found that these questionnaires were used to evaluate the usability of voice-only and voice-added VUIs: AttrakDiff ICF-US MOS-X SUISQ-R SUS SASSI UEQ PARADISE and USE where the SUS questionnaire is the most commonly used. However its items do not directly assess voice quality although it evaluates the general user interaction with a system. All the questionnaires include items related to three usability dimensions (effectiveness efficiency and satisfaction). The questionnaire with the most homogeneous coverage regarding the number of items in each aspect of usability is the SASSI questionnaire. It is a normal practice to use multiple questionnaires to obtain a more complete measurement of usability. We perceive the necessity to increase usability research about the differences between the voice interaction with diverse display types (voice-first voice-only voice-added) and the dialog types (command-based and conversational) and how usability affects the user expectations about the VUIs.;2021
We are living in a digital era where ubiquitous social media are becoming part of the everyday lives of many. These social media platforms were designed for the living however an estimated 8000 Facebook members die daily. It is therefore no surprise that the phenomena of how social media platforms are adopted to discuss death dying and grieving have become a growing area of research across numerous disciplines. Using qualitative methods this article adds to and moves beyond existing research by focusing on the creation and inheritance of Facebook pages thanablogs posthumous chatbots posthumous messages and posthumous avatars to explore whether digital afterlives enabled by the Internet affect how people grieve. In order to examine how these messages and memories are experienced this study used in-depth qualitative interviews with participants from 3 distinct areas: Digital Creators (DC) Digital Inheritors (DI) and Service Providers (SP) the findings presented here explore three emerging themes (1) the link between comfort and control (2) the changing landscape of the uncanny valley and (3) the fear of 'second loss'.;2021
We explored the utility of chatbots for improving data quality arising from collection via sonline surveys. Three-hundred Australian adults sampled via Prolific Academic were randomized across chatbot-supported or unassisted online questionnaire conditions. The questionnaire comprised validated measures along with challenge items formulated to be confusing yet aligned with the validated targets. The chatbot condition provided optional assistance with item clarity via a virtual support agent. Chatbot use and user satisfaction were measured through session logs and user feedback. Data quality was operationalized as between-group differences in relationships among validated and challenge measures. Findings broadly supported chatbot utility for online surveys showing that most participants with chatbot access utilized it found it helpful and demonstrated modestly improved data quality (vs. controls). Absence of confusion for one challenge item is believed to have contributed to an underestimated effect. Findings show that assistive chatbots can enhance data quality will be utilized by many participants if available and are perceived as beneficial by most users. Scope constraints for this pilot study are believed to have led to underestimated effects. Future testing with longer-form questionnaires incorporating expanded item difficulty may further understanding of chatbot utility for survey completion and data quality.;2021
We live in a time when dialogue systems are becoming a very popular tool. It is estimated that in 2021 more than 80% of communication with customers on the first line of service will be based on chatbots. They enter not only the retail market but also various other industries e.g. they are used for medical interviews information gathering or preliminary assessment and classification of problems. Unfortunately when these work incorrectly it leads to dissatisfaction. Such systems have the possibility of contacting a human consultant with a special command but this is not the point. The dialog system should provide a good uninterrupted and fluid experience and not show that it is an artificial creation. Analysing the sentiment of the entire dialogue in real time can provide a solution to this problem. In our study we focus on studying the methods of analysing the sentiment of dialogues based on machine learning for the English language and the morphologically complex Polish language which also represents a language with a small amount of training resources. We analyse the methods directly and use the machine translator as an intermediary thus checking the quality changes between models based on limited resources and those based on much larger English but machine translated texts. We manage to obtain over 89% accuracy using BERT-based models. We make recommendations in this regard also taking into account the cost aspect of implementing and maintaining such a system.;2021
We present a new method SOLOIST(1) that uses transfer learning and machine teaching to build task bots at scale. We parameterize classical modular task-oriented dialog systems using a Transformer-based auto-regressive language model which subsumes different dialog modules into a single neural model. We pre-train on heterogeneous dialog corpora a task-grounded response generation model which can generate dialog responses grounded in user goals and real-world knowledge for task completion. The pre-trained model can be efficiently adapted to accomplish new tasks with a handful of task-specific dialogs via machine teaching where training samples are generated by human teachers interacting with the system. Experiments show that (i) SOLOIST creates new state-of-the-art on well-studied task-oriented dialog benchmarks including CamRest676 and MultiWOZ (ii) in the few-shot fine-tuning settings SOLOIST significantly outperforms existing methods and (iii) the use of machine teaching substantially reduces the labeling cost of fine-tuning. The pre-trained models and codes are available at https://aka.ms/soloist.;2021
We present a series of mHealth applications and studies pursued as part of the Fittle+ project. This program of research has the dual aims of (1) bringing scalable evidence-based behavior-change interventions to mHealth and evaluating them and (2) developing theoretically based predictive models to better understand the dynamics of the impact of these interventions on achieving behavior-change goals. Our approach in the Fittle+ systems rests on the idea that to master the complex fabric of a new healthy lifestyle one must weave together a new set of healthy habits that over-ride the old unhealthy habits. To achieve these aims we have developed a series of mHealth platforms that provide scaffolding interventions: Behavior-change techniques and associated mHealth interactions (e.g. SMS reminders chatbot dialogs user interface functionality etc.) that provide additional support to the acquisition and maintenance of healthy habits. We present experimental evidence collected so far for statistically significant improvements in behavior change in eating exercise and physical activity for the following scaffolding interventions: guided mastery teaming self-affirmation and implementation intentions. We also present predictive computational ACT-R models of daily individual behavior goal success for data collected in guided mastery and implementation intention studies that address goal-striving and habit formation mechanisms.;2021
We present a Wizard-of-Oz experiment examining phonetic accommodation of human interlocutors in the context of human-computer interaction. Forty-two native speakers of German engaged in dynamic spoken interaction with a simulated virtual tutor for learning the German language called Mirabella. Mirabella was controlled by the experimenter and used either natural or hidden Markov model-based synthetic speech to communicate with the participants. In the course of four tasks the participants' accommodating behavior with respect to wh-question realization and allophonic variation in German was tested. The participants converged to Mirabella with respect to modified wh-question intonation i.e. rising F-0 contour and nuclear pitch accent on the interrogative pronoun and the allophonic contrast [IC] vs. [IK] occurring in the word ending <-ig >. They did not accommodate to the allophonic contrast [epsilon] vs. [e:] as a realization of the long vowel <-a->. The results did not differ between the experimental groups that communicated with either the natural or the synthetic speech version of Mirabella. Testing the influence of the Big Five personality traits on the accommodating behavior revealed a tendency for neuroticism to influence the convergence of question intonation. On the level of individual speakers we found considerable variation with respect to the degree and direction of accommodation. We conclude that phonetic accommodation on the level of local prosody and segmental pronunciation occurs in users of spoken dialog systems which could be exploited in the context of computer-assisted language learning.

We present lessons learned from an ongoing attempt to conceptualize develop and refine a way for teachers to gather formative assessment evidence about classroom argumentation as it happens. The system-named DiALoG (Diagnosing Argumentation Levels of Groups)-includes a digital scoring tool that allows teachers to assess oral classroom argumentation across two primary dimensions: one to capture the Intrapersonal discipline-specific features of scientific arguments and another to capture the Interpersonal group regulatory features of argumentation as a dynamic social act. Coupled with the digital assessment are responsive mini-lessons (RMLs) which provide follow-up curriculum for teachers to respond to different levels of classroom argumentation proficiency for each item assessed. We use classroom observations interviews and surveys from piloting science teachers in two different states to iteratively refine this multifaceted formative assessment system of oral classroom argumentation. Lessons learned include the realization by pilot teachers that using the DiALoG system fine-tunes their professional vision to notice student practices they had not previously considered and the accompanying RMLs help fill gaps in their pedagogical content knowledge and repertoire. Furthermore while the DiALoG system is intended to be a formative assessment we learned that the mere presence of numerical scores can queue teacher schema for summative assessment. This prompted us to do away with numbers entirely in the latest version of our digital scoring tool. Such lessons learned from teacher experiences with the development of a novel formative assessment system like DiALoG can be instructive to the development of science educational technology more broadly.;2021
We propose a method of automatically selecting appropriate responses in conversational spoken dialog systems by explicitly determining the correct response type that is needed first based on a comparison of the user's input utterance with many other utterances. Response utterances are then generated based on this response type designation (back channel changing the topic expanding the topic etc.). This allows the generation of more appropriate responses than conventional end-to-end approaches which only use the user's input to directly generate response utterances. As a response type selector we propose an LSTM-based encoder-decoder framework utilizing acoustic and linguistic features extracted from input utterances. In order to extract these features more accurately we utilize not only input utterances but also response utterances in the training corpus. To do so multi-task learning using multiple decoders is also investigated. To evaluate our proposed method we conducted experiments using a corpus of dialogs between elderly people and an interviewer. Our proposed method outperformed conventional methods using either a point wise classifier based on Support Vector Machines or a single-task learning LSTM. The best performance was achieved when our two response type selectors (one trained using acoustic features and the other trained using linguistic features) were combined and multi-task learning was also performed.;2021
We propose a new approach towards emotional natural language generation using bidirectional seq2seq model. Our goal is to generate emotionally relevant language that accommodates the emotional tone of the prior context. To incorporate emotional information we train our own embeddings appended with emotion values through valence arousal and dominance scores. We use a reinforcement-learning framework which is tuned using policy gradient method. Two of the internal rewards in our reinforcement learning framework viz. Ease of Answering and Semantic Coherence are based on prior state-of-the-art. We propose a new internal reward Emotional Intelligence computed by minimizing the affective dissonance between the source and generated text. We also train a separate external reward analyzer to predict the rewards as well as to maximize the expected rewards (both internal and external). We evaluate the system on two common corpora used for Natural Language Generation tasks: the Cornell Movie Dialog and Yelp Restaurant Review Corpus. We report standard evaluation metrics including BLEU ROUGE-L and perplexity as well as human evaluation to validate our approach. We demonstrate the ability of proposed model to generate emotionally appropriate responses on both corpora.;2021
We recently proposed a novel intelligent newscaster chatbot for digital inclusion. Its controlled dialogue stages (consisting of sequences of questions that are generated with hybrid Natural Language Generation techniques based on the content) support entertaining personalisation where user interest is estimated by analysing the sentiment of his/her answers. A differential feature of our approach is its automatic and transparent monitoring of the abstraction skills of the target users. In this work we improve the chatbot by introducing enhanced monitoring metrics based on the distance of the user responses to an accurate characterisation of the news content. We then evaluate abstraction capabilities depending on user sentiment about the news and propose a Machine Learning model to detect users that experience discomfort with precision recall F1 and accuracy levels over 80%.;2021
We study the impacts of humanizing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled autonomous customer service agents (chatbots). Implementing a field experiment in collaboration with a dual channel clothing retailer based in the United States we automate a used clothing buy-back process such that individuals engage with the retailer's autonomous chatbot to describe the used clothes they wish to sell obtain a cash offer and (if they accept the offer) print a shipping label to finalize the transaction. We causally estimate the impact of chatbot anthropomorphism on transaction conversion by randomly exposing consumers to exogenously varied levels of chatbot anthropomorphism operationalized by incorporating a random draw from a set of three anthropomorphic features: humor communication delays and social presence. We provide evidence that in this retail setting anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes but that it also leads to significant increases in offer sensitivity. We argue that the latter effect occurs because as a chatbot becomes more human-like consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset. We also provide descriptive evidence suggesting that the benefits of anthropomorphism for transaction conversion may derive at least in part from consumers' increased willingness to disclose personal information necessary to complete the transaction.;2021
What would a machine say about politics if it could speak? Because of virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri social scientists are now equipped to answer this question. Yet little is known about what these machines say about politics or why they say it even though their political responses are potentially consequential given their widespread usage. In this article I survey six virtual assistants and find that they typically have an above average knowledge of politics an elementary understanding of important political concepts and only a handful of opinions on important political issues. In follow-up interviews with tech workers ranging from software engineers to executives I use grounded theory to generate hypotheses about how companies craft responses to political questions. I find that tech companies are motivated in large part by economic considerations and that the future responses of the virtual assistants will likely create political echo chambers in which responses are highly customized to individual users. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for political polarization democratic citizenship and the growing prevalence of artificial intelligence in politics.;2021
While Interactive systems such as Chatbots are well known in personal environments with technologies like Apple's Siri or the Google's Assistant the acceptance of said technologies in the enterprise context has hardly been examined. Literature shows that these technologies hold great potential for enterprises as they can increase productivity and are cost-efficient by automating processes. Still to not alienate employees when introducing these systems called Enterprise Bots in this paper it is crucial to understand how employees accept and adopt these new systems. This paper derives a research model based on the decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour which is tested in a survey with 198 participants. Results from a structural equation model show that intrinsic motivation of the employees has a strong positive influence on the intention to use Enterprise Bots whereas external influences showed smaller effects. The results indicate that it is important that employees are convinced of the usefulness of a tool for themselves. The paper provides theoretical insights and helps decision makers to introduce such systems.;2021
Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are emerging technologies used in the medicinal market for various applications. They connect sensors throughout the human body and hence possibly used to monitor health. However one of the significant disadvantages of WBANs is notable security and protection problems that need rectification to protect critical data. In previous researches WBANs have single-layer authentication protocols that are not compatible with their device design qualities and malicious attackers can take advantage of this. For this purpose this work has introduced a lightweight and multilayer authentication protocol for WBANs which uses one-to-one group authentication and group key development algorithm with low software costs to communicate between personal digital assistants and sensor hubs. This model presents the Elliptical Curve Algorithm using Foci calculation which provides low computing cost high security etc. that further integrates with the hash function. Finally the security and implementation analysis reveal the stability and effectiveness of our convention. All key generations and validations used in our protocol implemented are for better performance and efficiency.;2021
With advances in technology new innovative methods for evaluating teamwork skills are emerging however little research has been done into students' reactions to such innovative assessments in an educational setting. This study investigated the reactions of undergraduate students to a high-fidelity behavioral simulation assessment for teamwork skills and explored some of the factors behind those reactions. 168 undergraduate students completed a simulation assessment and filled out surveys of reactions perceptions and personality. The results of a structural equations model indicate that reactions were positively related to perceived scenario realism characters (chatbots) realism and design clarity.;2021
With aggressive scaling of transistor size and supply voltage the critical charge of the sensitive nodes is reducing rapidly. As a result when these deep submicron devices are used in memory cells in the space environment single-event upsets (SEUs) also known as soft-errors pose a great threat to the reliability of the cells. To mitigate the effects of SEUs we propose a soft-error-immune read-stability-improved (SIRI) SRAM cell. To assess the performance of the proposed cell it is compared with other soft-error-immune SRAM cells namely QUCCE12T WE-QUATRO RHPD12T RHBD14T and RSP14T. Simulation results confirm that the detrimental effects of SEUs do not alter the state of SIRI as all the sensitive nodes can reattain their initial states after being impacted by an SEU. The cell can also recover from single-event multi-node upsets (SEMNUs) that occur at its storage node-pair. Moreover the storage nodes of the proposed cell are isolated from the bitlines during read operation. Hence it exhibits the highest read stability. The write ability and write delay of SIRI are also superior to those of the majority of the comparison cells and it consumes much lower hold power than many of the conventional SRAM cells. All these improvements are brought about only at the expense of a slightly longer read delay.;2021
With the aim of enhancing human-chatbot interactions this paper presents a novel sentiment classification framework that recognizes both semantics emotion terms and emojis. Underpinned by Word2vec and vector arithmetic a deep model learns the vectors of emotion words and emojis from a large-scale corpus of conversations. The vectors are then assembled into a dictionary evaluated with an improved k-means similarity calculation and assigned to a category of emotions. To accommodate negative grammar constructions e.g. not happyas opposed to unhappy a separate module combines the vectors of negatives and emotion words using vector addition. The final sentiment classification results are derived by calculating the similarity between an utterance and the emotion categories. Experiments show this strategy results in multi-emotion and polarity classifications between 3 and 4% more precise than the next best performing baseline classifier.;2021
With the development of artificial intelligence technology voice-based intelligent systems (VISs) such as AI speakers and virtual assistants are intervening in human life. VISs are emerging in a new way called human-AI interaction which is different from existing human-computer interaction. Using the Kansei engineering approach we propose a method to evaluate user satisfaction during interaction between a VIS and a user-centered intelligent system. As a user satisfaction evaluation method a VIS comprising four types of design parameters was developed. A total of 23 subjects were considered for interaction with the VIS and user satisfaction was measured using Kansei words (KWs). The questionnaire scores collected through KWs were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. ANOVA was used to analyze differences in emotion. On the pleasurability and reliability axes it was confirmed that among the four design parameters sentence structure of the answer and number of trials to get the right answer for a question affect the emotional satisfaction of users. Four satisfaction groups were derived according to the level of the design parameters. This study can be used as a reference for conducting an integrated emotional satisfaction assessment using emotional metrics such as biosignals and facial expressions.;2021
With the growing utility of today's conversational virtual assistants the importance of user motivation in human-artificial intelligence interactions is becoming more obvious. However previous studies in this and related fields such as human-computer interaction scarcely discussed intrinsic motivation (the motivation to interact with the assistants for fun). Previous studies either treated motivation as an inseparable concept or focused on non-intrinsic motivation (the motivation to interact with the assistant for utilitarian purposes). The current study aims to cover intrinsic motivation by taking an affective engineering approach. A novel motivation model is proposed in which intrinsic motivation is affected by two factors that derive from user interactions with virtual assistants: expectation of capability and uncertainty. Experiments in which these two factors are manipulated by making participants believe they are interacting with the smart speaker Amazon Echo are conducted. Intrinsic motivation is measured both by using questionnaires and by covertly monitoring a five-minute free-choice period in the experimenter's absence during which the participants could decide for themselves whether to interact with the virtual assistants. Results of the first experiment showed that high expectation engenders more intrinsically motivated interaction compared with low expectation. However the results did not support our hypothesis that expectation and uncertainty have an interaction effect on intrinsic motivation. We then revised our hypothetical model of action selection accordingly and conducted a verification experiment of the effects of uncertainty. Results of the verification experiment showed that reducing uncertainty encourages more interactions and causes the motivation behind these interactions to shift from non-intrinsic to intrinsic.;2021
With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic misinformation and unscientific interpretations flooded the internet. Seeking credible information in Egypt was paramount at the time. An answer to this quest was 'Ask Nameesa' an award-winning Egyptian-focused chatbot that utilizes Facebook Messenger to communicate with social media users in an individualized response engagement. It relies on information validated by WHO and the Egyptian Ministry of Health. This article examines the structure of Ask Nameesa as an example of infobots and studies the interactive engagement it offers users to provide health information. The study analyses data gathered by interviewing the founder and CEO of DXwand the company that developed Ask Nameesa as well as content analysis of conversations with Ask Nameesa to assess its user engagement. The study aims at understanding the potential Ask Nameesa has in providing information literacy and tackling public demand for information.;2021
With the popularity of financial technology (fintech) chatbots equipped with artificial intelligence understanding the user's response mechanism can help bankers formulate precise marketing strategies which is a crucial issue in the social science field. Nevertheless the user's response mechanism towards financial technology chatbots has been relatively under-investigated. To fill these literature gaps latent growth curve modeling was adopted by the present research to survey Taiwanese users of fintech chatbots. The present study proposed a customer continuance model to predict continuance intention for fintech chatbots and that cognitive and emotional dimensions positively influence the growth in a user's attitude toward fintech chatbots which in turn positively influences continuance intention over time. In total 401 customers of fintech chatbots were surveyed through three time points to examine the relationship between these variables over six months. The results support the theoretical model of this research and can advance the literature of fintech chatbots and the information technology adoption model.;2021
With the prevalence of virtual avatars and the recent emergence of metaverse technology there has been an increase in users who express their identity through an avatar. The research community focused on improving the realistic expressions and non-verbal communication channels of virtual characters to create a more customized experience. However there is a lack in the understanding of how avatars can embody a user's signature expressions (i.e. user's habitual facial expressions and facial appearance) that would provide an individualized experience. Our study focused on identifying elements that may affect the user's social perception (similarity familiarity attraction liking and involvement) of customized virtual avatars engineered considering the user's facial characteristics. We evaluated the participant's subjective appraisal of avatars that embodied the participant's habitual facial expressions or facial appearance. Results indicated that participants felt that the avatar that embodied their habitual expressions was more similar to them than the avatar that did not. Furthermore participants felt that the avatar that embodied their appearance was more familiar than the avatar that did not. Designers should be mindful about how people perceive individuated virtual avatars in order to accurately represent the user's identity and help users relate to their avatar.;2021
With the rapid development from traditional machine learning (ML) to deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) dialog system equipped with learning mechanism has become the most effective solution to address human-machine interaction problems. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey on learning-based human-machine dialog systems with a focus on the various dialog models. More specifically we first introduce the fundamental process of establishing a dialog model. Second we examine the features and classifications of the system dialog model expound some representative models and also compare the advantages and disadvantages of different dialog models. Third we comb the commonly used database and evaluation metrics of the dialog model. Furthermore the evaluation metrics of these dialog models are analyzed in detail. Finally we briefly analyze the existing issues and point out the potential future direction on the human-machine dialog systems.;2021
With the rise in initiatives such as software ecosystems and Internet of Things (IoT) developing web Application Programming Interfaces (web APIs) has become an increasingly common practice. One main concern in developing web APIs is that they expose back-end systems and data toward clients. This exposure threatens critical non-functional requirements such as the security of back-end systems the performance of provided services and the privacy of communications with clients. Although dealing with non-functional requirements during software design has been long studied there is still no framework to specifically assist software developers in addressing these requirements in web APIs. In this paper we introduce Rational API Designer (RAPID) an open-source assistant that advises on designing non-functional requirements in the architecture of web APIs. We have equipped RAPID with a broad range of expert knowledge about API design systematically collected and extracted from the literature. The API design knowledge has been encoded as a set of 156 rules using the Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) multi-valued logic a formal framework commonly used to describe non-functional and functional requirements of software systems. RAPID uses the encoded knowledge in a stepwise inference procedure to arrive from a given requirement to a set of design alternatives to a final recommendation for a given API design specification. Seven well-experienced software engineers have blindly evaluated the accuracy of RAPID's consultations over seven different cases of web API design and on providing design guidelines for thirty design questions. The results of the evaluation show that RAPID's recommendations meet acceptable standards of the majority of the evaluators 73.3% of the time. Moreover analysis of the evaluators' comments suggests that more than one-third of the unacceptable ratings (33.8%) given to RAPID's answers are due to valid but incomplete design guidelines. We thus expect that the accuracy of the consultations will increase as RAPID's knowledge of API design is extended and refined.;2021
Within the anamnesis medical information is frequently withheld incomplete or incorrect potentially causing negative consequences for the patient. The use of conversational agents (CAs) computer-based systems using natural language to interact with humans may mitigate this problem. The present research examines whether CAs differ from physicians in their ability to elicit truthful disclosure and discourage concealment of medical information. We conducted an online questionnaire with German participants (N = 148) to assess their willingness to reveal medical information. The results indicate that patients would rather disclose medical information to a physician than to a CA there was no difference in the tendency to conceal information. This research offers a frame of reference for future research on applying CAs during the anamnesis to support physicians. From a practical view physicians might gain better understanding of how the use of CAs can facilitate the anamnesis.;2021
A conversational agent (chatbot) is a software that can communicate with humans using natural language. Conversation modeling is an extremely important topic in natural language processing and artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed since the birth of AI creating a good chatbot remains one of the most difficult challenges in this field. Although chatbots can be used for a variety of tasks they generally need to understand what users are saying and to provide appropriate answers to their questions. In this paper we present midoBot: a deep learning Arabic chatbot based on the seq2seq model. midoBot is capable of conversing with humans on popular conversation topics through text. We built the model and tested it in the Tensorflow 2 deep learning framework using the most seq 2 seq Model architectures. We use a dataset of similar to 81659 pairs of conversations created manually and without any handcrafted rules. Our algorithm was trained on a VM on google cloud (GPU TESLA K80 10 GO). The results obtained are significant In most questions the chatbot was able to reproduce good answers.;2022
A starting point of many digital health interventions informed by the Stages of Change Model of behavior change is assessing a person's readiness to change. In this paper we use the concept of readiness to develop and validate a prediction model of health-seeking behavior in the context of family planning. We conducted a secondary analysis of routinely collected anonymized health data submitted by 4088 female users of a free health chatbot in Kenya. We developed a prediction model of (future) self-reported action by randomly splitting the data into training and test data sets (80/20 stratified by the outcome). We further split the training data into 10 folds for cross-validating the hyperparameter tuning step in model selection. We fit nine different classification models and selected the model that maximized the area under the receiver operator curve. We then fit the selected model to the full training dataset and evaluated the performance of this model on the holdout test data. The model predicted who will visit a family planning provider in the future with high precision (0.93) and moderate recall (0.75). Using the Stages of Change framework we concluded that 29% of women were in the Preparation stage 21% were in the Contemplation stage and 50% were in the Pre-Contemplation stage. We demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict future healthcare-seeking behavior based on information learned during the initial encounter. Models like this may help intervention developers to tailor strategies and content in real-time.;2022
Although there is an increasingly number of research about the design and use of conversational agents it is still difficult for conversational agents to completely replace human service. Therefore more and more companies have adopted human-AI collaborative systems to deliver customer service. It is important to understand how people obtain information from human-AI collaborative conversations. While the existing work relies on self-reported methods to elicit qualitative feedback from users we have concluded a categorization system for user messages in human-AI collaborative conversations after a thorough examination of a real-world customer service log which could objectively reflect the user's information needs. We categorize user messages into five categories and 15 specific types related to three high-level intentions. Two annotators independently classified the same set of 1478 user messages from 300 conversations and reached a moderate consistency. We summarize and report the characteristics of different message types and compare their usage in sessions with only human AI or both representatives. Our results show that different message types vary significantly in usage frequency length and text similarities with other messages in a session. Also the frequency of using different message types in our dataset seems consistent over sessions with different types of representatives. But we also observed some significant differences in a few specific message types across the sessions with different representatives. Our results are used to suggest some areas for improvement and future work in human-AI collaborative conversational systems.;2022
An idiom is a common phrase that means something other than its literal meaning. Detecting idioms automatically is a serious challenge in natural language processing (NLP) domain appli-cations like information retrieval (IR) machine translation and chatbot. Automatic detection of Idioms plays an important role in all these applications. A fundamental NLP task is text classi-fication which categorizes text into structured categories known as text labeling or categoriza-tion. This paper deals with idiom identification as a text classification task. Pre-trained deep learning models have been used for several text classification tasks though models like BERT and RoBERTa have not been exclusively used for idiom and literal classification. We propose a pre-dictive ensemble model to classify idioms and literals using BERT and RoBERTa fine-tuned with the TroFi dataset. The model is tested with a newly created in house dataset of idioms and literal expressions numbering 1470 in all and annotated by domain experts. Our model outperforms the baseline models in terms of the metrics considered such as F-score and accuracy with a 2% improvement in accuracy.;2022
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reconstructing consumer experiences with brands in recent years. However there have been the unsettled debates on whether humans react to robots (e.g. chatbots) in the same way as they do to other humans and how the intrinsic strength of AI (i.e. autonomous processing and synthetization of information) and humans (i.e. emotional intelligence) factor in the human-AI interactions in brand communication settings. Hence this study investigates the conditions under which a service entity of a brand can optimize their potential. To this end the current study conceptualizes and operationalizes two dimensions that define chatbots' capabilities - message contingency (i.e. contingency-based interactivity) and emotional intelligence (i.e. sympathy). Based on two experiments we found that regarding the same online customer service of an apparel brand participants rated the human employee to be more competent and warmer than a chatbot. When a human employee who expresses sympathy to the afflicted customer during the conversation participants considered the employee to be more competent when he/she also exhibits contingency (vs. no contingency) during the conversation which in turn elicited higher patronage intentions among participants.;2022
As organizations increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) systems for their online communication with publics conceptualizing and operationalizing perceived humanness presents an important challenge to understanding how consumers and other publics respond to both AI and human agents in live chats with organizations. This study develops a measure of consumer-perceived humanness derived from three related constructs: conversational human voice anthropomorphism and social presence. The new measure was tested for reliability and validity including tests of criterion validity predicting how it would relate to perceived relational investment and trust as relational outcomes. Two online studies (N-1 = 172 N-2 = 375) were conducted in which participants interacted with either human or machine online chat agents. Greater perceived humanness of chat agents was found to correlate with greater perceived relational investment and trust in the organization with perceived relational investment mediating the relationship between perceived humanness and trust. Perceived humanness can be utilized subsequently to assess both human and machine agents. Its corollary perceived machineness was also identified as a separate factor to be taken into consideration in future research and theory building.;2022
Avatars are becoming increasingly popular in contemporary marketing strategies but their effectiveness for achieving performance outcomes (e.g. purchase likelihood) varies widely in practice. Related academic literature is fragmented lacking both definitional consistency and conceptual clarity. This article makes three main contributions to avatar theory and managerial practice. First to address ambiguity with respect to its definition this study identifies and critically evaluates key conceptual elements of the term avatar offers a definition derived from this analysis and provides a typology of avatars' design elements. Second the proposed 2 x 2 avatar taxonomy suggests that the alignment of an avatar's form realism and behavioral realism across different contingencies provides a parsimonious explanation for avatar effectiveness. Third the authors develop an emerging theory of avatar marketing by triangulating insights from fundamental elements of avatars a synthesis of extant research and business practices. This framework integrates key theoretical insights research propositions and important managerial implications for this expanding area of marketing strategy. Lastly the authors outline a research program to test the propositions and insights as well as advance future research.;2022
Chatbots have become common in digital customer service contexts across many industries. While many companies choose to humanize their customer service chatbots (e.g. giving them names and avatars) little is known about how anthropomorphism influences customer responses to chatbots in service settings. Across five studies including an analysis of a large real-world data set from an international telecommunications company and four experiments the authors find that when customers enter a chatbot-led service interaction in an angry emotional state chatbot anthropomorphism has a negative effect on customer satisfaction overall firm evaluation and subsequent purchase intentions. However this is not the case for customers in nonangry emotional states. The authors uncover the underlying mechanism driving this negative effect (expectancy violations caused by inflated pre-encounter expectations of chatbot efficacy) and offer practical implications for managers. These findings suggest that it is important to both carefully design chatbots and consider the emotional context in which they are used particularly in customer service interactions that involve resolving problems or handling complaints.;2022
Collecting construction equipment information such as the site equipment enter and exit date-time driver's name type and quantity is essential in construction management. Most construction projects use paper to record the equipment access history. However manual recording is always labour-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore this research aims to develop an assistant system Site Equipment Management Assistant (SEMA) to automate the site equipment management processes. With the introduction of image recognition and multiple objects tracking technologies the proposed system can extract equipment-related information from raw videos. SEMA is designed as a chatbot system that contains three major modules: data acquisition information extraction and information delivery. A deep learning-based model was first trained to automatically recognize and track construction equipment passing by the site monitor. Information such as equipment entering and exiting date-time type and quantity would be extracted and stored in a database. A chatbot interface was developed for users to obtain data from the database through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. A system evaluation and usability test were conducted. The results showed that the system could effectively improve the construction equipment management process. SEMA can save 60.7% of users' operation time on obtaining related information.;2022
Considering that emotions have a great impact on motivation reasoning and decision making affective computing methods that were designed to attempt to understand and respond to human emotional states have been used in more than one field including e-learning. Thus a systematic literature review was conducted on 4 search engines resulting in a set of papers that were filtered in a systematic way until we obtained a corpus of 27 papers. Data were extracted to answer four research questions concerning the use and efficacy of affective computing in e-learning in recent years. We found out that the majority of studies about emotion recognition use uni-modal systems in which facial expressions emotion detection is the most present. The major research purpose is designing/building systems approaches methods detectors for emotion recognition. For the e-learning environments the most present is conversational agents. The emotions detected or used are basic emotions non-basic emotions learning-centered emotions trait emotions or a combination of two or three of them. This systematic literature review also provides the major findings challenges and future research.;2022
Conversational agents (CAs) are often unable to provide meaningful responses to user requests thereby triggering user resistance and impairing the successful diffusion of CAs. Literature mostly focuses on improving CA responses but fails to address user resistance in the event of further response failures. Drawing on inoculation theory and the elaboration likelihood model we examine how inoculation messages as communication that seeks to prepare users for a possible response failure can be used as an alleviation mechanism. We conducted a randomized experiment with 558 users investigating how the performance level (high or low) and the linguistic form of the performance information (qualitative or quantitative) affected users' decision to discontinue CA usage after a response failure. We found that inoculation messages indicating a low performance level alleviate the negative effects of CA response failures on discontinuance. However quantitative performance level information exhibits this moderating effect on users' central processing while qualitative performance level information affected users' peripheral processing. Extending studies that primarily discuss ex-post strategies our results provide meaningful insights for practitioners.;2022
Conversational agents are systems capable of processing and responding to human language. They have evolved over the years from a means to pass the Turing Test to chatbots that fulfill a utilitarian purpose. Closed-domain chatbots are specialized in a specific knowledge base and are often used in an attempt to assist users in an educational context. Existing open-source educational assistant chatbots are narrow in immediate functionality thus limiting the content and services that can be provided to students and educators. To address this limitation a novel multiagent framework is proposed providing diverse capabilities and component flexibility to better meet varied educational requirements. The version presented in this experiment can not only answer questions in different styles but is also able to provide content summaries and links. The solution is tested by presenting participants with a lesson containing information related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) followed by engagement with the chatbot system a subsequent evaluation of its responses and a quiz to quantify its pedagogical efficacy. COVID-19 was chosen as the knowledge base due to its current relevance in society. The chatbot framework's knowledge base is comprised of two data sets containing facts related to the virus one which is used to provide longer frequently asked questions-type responses and another used to provide short answers. The resulting participant evaluations indicate a preference for more informative responses in the experimental context and showcase the benefit of the framework's malleability in not only fulfilling but discovering varying needs in educational assistance.;2022
Conversational agents or chatbots are a novel highly accessible and low-resource method of psychological intervention delivery. The present research aims to compare two brief chatbot interventions that delivered cognitive restructuring and defusion interventions respectively. It was hypothesized that a defusion chatbot would lead to reduced cognitive fusion and decreased thought believability relative to cognitive restructuring and a nonactive control. Participants (N = 223 M age of 28.01 [SD = 10.29] 47 identified as male 174 as female and 2 as nonbinary) were randomized into one of three conditions (defusion restructuring control) engaged for 5 days completing thought and mood measures pre- and postintervention. Sixty-two participants (M age of 25.98 SD = 8.647 years) completed measures again at time 2 (49 identified as female 12 as male and 1 as nonbinary). No statistically significant differences were observed among groups on believability of thoughts (F[2 25] = .79 p = .47 eta p(2) = .06) negativity of thoughts (F[225] = 1.49 p = .25 eta (2) = .11) discomfort associated with thoughts (F[2 25] = .48 p = .62 eta p(2) = .04) and willingness (F[2 25] = 3.00 p = .07 eta p(2) = .19) to have negative self-referential thoughts. Moreover substantial attrition of 72% was observed. Acceptability and usability of the chatbots employed are discussed as contributing toward the limited effectiveness of interventions and elevated attrition. Various recommendations are presented to support researchers and clinicians in developing engaging and effective chatbots.;2022
Creation of task-oriented dialog/virtual agent (VA) capable of managing complex domain-specific user queries pertaining to multiple intents is difficult since the agent must deal with several subtasks simultaneously. Most end-to-end dialogue systems however only provide user semantics as inputs from texts into the learning process and neglect other useful user behaviour and information from other modalities such as images. This stresses the benefit of incorporating multi-modal inputs for eliciting user preference in the task. Also sentiment of the user plays a significant role in achieving maximum user/customer satisfaction during the conversation. Thus it is also important to incorporate users' sentiments during policy learning especially when serving user's composite goals. For the creation of multi-modal VA aided with sentiment for conversations encompassing multi-intents this paper introduces a new dataset named Vis-SentiVA: Visual and Sentiment aided VA created from open-accessed conversational dataset. We present a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) typically options-based VA to learn policies for serving multi-intent dialogues. Multi-modal information (texts and images) extraction to identify user's preference is incorporated in the learning framework. A combination of task-based and sentiment-based rewards is integrated in the hierarchical value functions for the VA to be user adaptive. Empirically we show that all these aspects induced together in the learning framework play a vital role in acquiring higher dialogue task success and increased user contentment in the process of creating composite-natured VAs. This is the first effort in integrating sentiment-aware rewards in the multi-modal HRL framework. The paper highlights that it is indeed essential to include other modes of information extraction such as images and behavioural cues of the user such as sentiment to secure greater user contentment. This also helps in improving success of composite-natured VAs serving task-oriented dialogues.;2022
Depression is a common illness worldwide with potentially severe implications. Early identification of depressive symptoms is a crucial first step towards assessment intervention and relapse prevention. With an increase in data sets with relevance for depression and the advancement of machine learning there is a potential to develop intelligent systems to detect symptoms of depression in written material. This work proposes an efficient approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to identify texts describing self-perceived symptoms of depression. The approach is applied on a large dataset from a public online information channel for young people in Norway. The dataset consists of youth's own text-based questions on this information channel. Features are then provided from a one-hot process on robust features extracted from the reflection of possible symptoms of depression pre-defined by medical and psychological experts. The features are better than conventional approaches which are mostly based on the word frequencies (i.e. some topmost frequent words are chosen as features from the whole text dataset and applied to model the underlying events in any text message) rather than symptoms. Then a deep learning approach is applied (i.e. RNN) to train the time-sequential features discriminating texts describing depression symptoms from posts with no such descriptions (non-depression posts). Finally the trained RNN is used to automatically predict depression posts. The system is compared against conventional approaches where it achieved superior performance than others. The linear discriminant space clearly reveals the robustness of the features by generating better clustering than other traditional features. Besides since the features are based on the possible symptoms of depression the system may generate meaningful explanations of the decision from machine learning models using an explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The proposed depression symptom feature-based approach shows superior performance compared to the traditional general word frequency-based approaches where frequency of the features gets more importance than the specific symptoms of depression. Although the proposed approach is applied on a Norwegian dataset a similar robust approach can be applied on other depression datasets developed in other languages with proper annotations and symptom-based feature extraction. Thus the depression prediction approach can be adopted to contribute to develop better mental health care technologies such as intelligent chatbots.;2022
Dialogic reading when children are read a storybook and engaged in relevant conversation is a powerful strategy for fostering language development. With the development of artificial intelligence conversational agents can engage children in elements of dialogic reading. This study examined whether a conversational agent can improve children's story comprehension and engagement as compared to an adult reading partner. Using a 2 (dialogic reading or non-dialogic reading) x 2 (agent or human) factorial design a total of 117 three- to six-year-olds (50% Female 37% White 31% Asian 21% multi-ethnic) were randomly assigned into one of the four conditions. Results revealed that a conversational agent can replicate the benefits of dialogic reading with a human partner by enhancing children's narrative-relevant vocalizations reducing irrelevant vocalizations and improving story comprehension.;2022
Digital personal assistants (DPAs) have recently grown in popularity because they are both a commercially available new technology and reasonably affordable to the average household. This opens opportunities for new ways to assist people in everyday activities in their homes through voice-interaction. Physical activity has significant health benefits and yet globally 1 in 4 adults are not active enough. To address this we investigate the persuasive potential of DPAs in increasing people's physical activity at home. We conducted a study with 48 participants to understand the effect of applying three of Fogg's persuasive principles to the design of a DPA exercise programme: Suggestion Virtual Reward and Praise. Our findings show that DPAs have the potential within their current technical and reactive capabilities to persuade people to increase their physical activity at home using Suggestion to encourage physical effort Virtual Reward to encourage endurance and Praise to create reassurance for beginners. Based on this we offer three alternate perspectives for developing persuasive DPAs. We also discuss limitations of the study and suggest future research directions around using persuasion with DPAs.;2022
Emotionally-responsive chatbots are marketed as agents with which one can form emotional connections. They can also become weak ties in the outer layers of one's acquaintance network and available for social support. In this experiment which was designed to study the acquaintance process we randomly assigned 417 participants into three conditions: face-to-face (FTF) chat with a human online chat with a human and online chat with a commercially-available emotionally-responsive chatbot Replika. After a 20-min getting-acquainted chat participants reported their affective state and relational evaluations of the chat. Additionally all chats were recorded and text analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. In all conditions participants reported moderate levels of positive emotions and low levels of negative emotions. Those who chatted FTF with a human reported significantly more negative emotions than those who chatted with a bot. However those who chatted with a human also reported more homophily with and liking of their chat partner and that their partner was more responsive. Meanwhile participants had fewest conversational concerns with the chatbot. These findings have implications for future computer-mediated interaction studies: conversations with chatbots appear to have different affordances and effects on chatter enjoyment and conversational concerns in getting-acquainted contexts. These results may help designers improve reception and marketability for chatbots in consumer markets.;2022
Emotion-aware chatbots that can sense human emotions are becoming increasingly prevalent. However the exposition of emotions by emotion-aware chatbots undermines human autonomy and users' trust. One way to ensure autonomy is through the provision of control. Offering too much control in turn may increase users' cognitive effort. To investigate the impact of control over emotion-aware chatbots on autonomy trust and cognitive effort as well as user behavior we carried out an experimental study with 176 participants. The participants interacted with a chatbot that provided emotional feedback and were additionally able to control different chatbot dimensions (e.g. timing appearance and behavior). Our findings show first that higher control levels increase autonomy and trust in emotion-aware chatbots. Second higher control levels do not significantly increase cognitive effort. Third in our post hoc behavioral analysis we identify four behavioral control strategies based on control feature usage timing quantity and cognitive effort. These findings shed light on the individual preferences of user control over emotion-aware chatbots. Overall our study contributes to the literature by showing the positive effect of control over emotion-aware chatbots and by identifying four behavioral control strategies. With our findings we also provide practical implications for future design of emotion-aware chatbots.;2022
Every larger organisation must establish a set of normative documents to control its processes and describe solutions to common problems. These documents are usually formally written and hard to read. This leads to the necessity off different customer services. Nowadays a lot of companies are developing chatbots to automate firstline customer support. If a company does not have a large question-answer dataset to build a chatbot the answers can be automatically answered directly from the documents. However we found that the automatic answering usually does not work well on the normative documents. In this paper we describe a novel method for preprocessing of normative documents in order to use them for such automatic question answering. Our method efficiently exploits the strict document structure that is typical for normative documents. The method enabled us to increase the recall from 35% to 84% (for paragraph-size answers) on selected normative documents from university and bank domains.;2022
Generating semantically and emotionally context-consistent responses is key to intelligent dialogue systems. Previous works mainly refer to the context in the dialogue history to generate semantically related responses ignoring the potential emotion in the conversation. In addition existing methods mainly fail to consider the emotional changes of interlocutors and emotional categories simultaneously. However emotion is crucial to reflect the interlocutor's intent. In this paper we propose an Emotion Capture Chat Machine (ECCM) that is able to capture the explicit and underlying emotional signal in the context to generate appropriate responses. In detail we design a hierarchical recursive encoder-decoder framework with two enhanced self-attention encoders to capture the semantic signal and emotional signal respectively which are then fused in the decoder to produce the response. In general we consider the dynamic and potential information of emotion to generate the response in multi-turn dialogues in the field of both daily conversation and psychological counseling. Our experimental results on a daily Chinese conversation dataset and a psychological counseling dataset show that ECCM outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of Perplexity Distinct-1 Distinct-2 and manual evaluation. In addition we find that ECCM performs well for input contexts with different lengths.;2022
Healthcare systems across the world are transitioning into patient-centered healthcare models to ensure improved health outcomes increased operational efficiencies and respectful patient engagement. Digital health technologies are at the forefront of this transition in facilitating a role for the patient in the clinical dimensions of the healthcare trajectory from diagnosis and interventions to treatment and recovery. Despite this prevalence in the clinical space the non-clinical needs of patient mental health and wellbeing are frequently overlooked by contemporary patient-centered healthcare models. Conversational agents (or chatbots) are digital dialogue systems that are widespread and widely used in sequential information provision and information acquisition tasks. Given the intimate nature of this human-machine interaction conversational agents can be effectively utilized to support and sustain patient mental health and wellbeing. In this paper we propose an empathic conversational agent framework based on an ensemble of natural language processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms for real-time monitoring and co-facilitation of patient-centered healthcare for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The technical contributions of this framework are detection of patient emotions prediction of patient emotion transitions detection of group emotions formulation of patient behavioral metrics and resource recommendations based on patient concerns. The architectural contributions of the framework are intelligent communication channels that stream empathic conversational elements and resource recommendations for the multi-user conversations and co-facilitation updates for the human healthcare provider interface. The framework was empirically evaluated on a benchmark dataset and further validated based on a clinical protocol designed for its application in an online support group setting for cancer patients and caregivers in Canada. The results of these experiments confirm the effectiveness of this framework its contributory role and practical value in realizing a patient-centered healthcare model for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes.

How do cultural values influence/are influenced by algorithms? A comparative study was conducted between the United States (US) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to investigate how users in the different cultures perceive the features of chatbot-driven news and how they view ethical issues concerning chatbot journalism. Different models of chatbot news perception reveal that the acceptance of chatbots involves a cultural dimension as the algorithms reflect the values and interests of their constituencies. How users perceive chatbot news and how they consume and interact with the chatbots depend on the cultural and social contexts in which the interaction is taking place. Our results suggest the algorithms reflect cultural values and algorithms are implicitly situated in social contexts mediated by cultural artifacts and activities. The results resonate with ongoing debates on whether and how algorithms reinforce cultural and social values implying the co-evolving nature of algorithms and humans.;2022
In recent years personalized dialogue generation has attracted researchers' attention due to its wide range of applications. Although there has been much excellent research current chatbots are known to generate uninteresting responses without personality. In a general way persona information is adopted to mitigate these issues. Yet how to integrate persona information reasonably based on historical dialogue in responses is still a severe challenge. Thus we present a solution that consolidates the persona information memory process and pretrained method to generate personalized and fluency responses. Moreover we adopt a reinforcement learning algorithm to joint each part of the dialogue model. Last but not least we present a self-learning framework to explore the hypothetical space and make the responses more personalized and fascinating. Extensive experiments on the large-scale dialogue public dataset ConvAI2 verify the effectiveness of our method.;2022
In this paper we propose a speech pseudonymization framework that utilizes cascaded and superposition-based voice modification modules. With increasing opportunities to use spoken dialogue systems nowadays research regarding protecting the privacy of speaker information encapsulated in speech data is attracting attention. Pseudonymization which is one method for voice privacy protection aims to keep the intelligibility of speech while simultaneously suppressing speaker-specific information. One motivation of our framework is to achieve a reliable pseudonymization performance with light computation. To do this we utilize the advantages of both machine learning-based and signal processing-based approaches. The advantages are (1) using signal processing-based methods parameterized with few hyperparameters and (2) using machine learning-based optimization to optimize all hyperparameters on the basis of black-box systems consisting of automatic speaker verification and automatic speech recognition. Our method of cascading signal processing modules which are jointly optimized in a data-driven manner can pseudonymize speech in a lightweight manner. Additionally we discuss irreversible pseudonymization approaches and propose a superposition approach yet another pseudonymization method that is more irreversible than the cascade method in terms of estimating the adequate parameters to recover the original signal. From the experimental results conducted under the VoicePrivacy 2020 protocols we can demonstrate that (1) our cascade method succeeds in deteriorating the speaker recognition rate by over 24% while simultaneously improving the speech recognition rate by approximately 8% compared with a signal processing-based baseline system of VoicePrivacy 2020 and that (2) our superposition method works comparable to our cascade method in terms of pseudonymization performance.;2022
In this paper we uncover a new off-path TCP hijacking attack that can be used to terminate victim TCP connections or inject forged data into victim TCP connections by manipulating the new mixed IPID assignment method which is widely used in Linux kernel version 4.18 and beyond. Our attack has three steps. First an off-path attacker can downgrade the IPID assignment for TCP packets from the more secure per-socket-based policy to the less secure hash-based policy thus building a shared IPID counter that forms a side channel in the victim. Second the attacker detects the presence of TCP connections by observing the side channel of the shared IPID counter. Third the attacker infers sequence and acknowledgment numbers of the detected connection by observing the side channel. Consequently the attacker can completely hijack the connection e.g. resetting the connection or poisoning the data stream. We evaluate the impacts of our attack in the real world and we uncover that more than 20% of Alexa top 100k websites are vulnerable to our attack. Our case studies of SSH DoS manipulating web traffic and poisoning BGP routing tables show its threat on a wide range of applications. Moreover we demonstrate that our attack can be further extended to exploit IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networks on increasing the hash collisions and enlarging vulnerable populations. Finally we analyze the root cause and develop a new IPID assignment method to defeat this attack. We prototype our defense in Linux 4.18 and confirm its effectiveness in the real world.;2022
Internet connects people to people people to machine and machine to machine for a life of serendipity through a Cloud. Internet of Things networks objects or people and integrates them with software to collect and exchange data. The Internet of things (IoT) influences our lives based on how we ruminate respond and anticipate. IoT 2021 heralds from the fringes to the data ecosystem and panaches a comfort zone. IoT is overwhelmingly embraced by businessmen and consumers due to increased productivity and convenience. Internet of Things facilitates intelligent device control with cloud vendors like Amazon and Google using artificial intelligence for data analytics and with digital assistants like Alexa and Siri providing a voice user interface. Smart IoT is all about duplex connecting processing and implementing. Centralized IoT architecture is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. With Block Chain it is possible to maintain transparency and security of the transaction's data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) using bots has automated laborious tasks in 2019. Embedded Internet using Facial Recognition could reduce the coronavirus pandemic crisis by making a paradigm shift from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition. Security concerns are addressed with micro-segmentation approaches. IoT an incredible vision of the future makes systems adaptive with customized features responsive with increased efficiency and procurable with optimized cost. This research delivers a comprehensive insight into the technical perspectives of IoT focusing on interoperability flexibility scalability mobility security transparency standardization and low energy. A smart classroom is implemented based on the concepts of IoT.;2022
Many experts have emphasised that chatbots are not sufficiently mature to be able to technically diagnose patient conditions or replace the judgements of health professionals. The COVID-19 pandemic however has significantly increased the utilisation of health-oriented chatbots for instance as a conversational interface to answer questions recommend care options check symptoms and complete tasks such as booking appointments. In this paper we take a proactive approach and consider how the emergence of task-oriented chatbots as partially automated consulting systems can influence clinical practices and expert-client relationships. We suggest the need for new approaches in professional ethics as the large-scale deployment of artificial intelligence may revolutionise professional decision-making and client-expert interaction in healthcare organisations. We argue that the implementation of chatbots amplifies the project of rationality and automation in clinical practice and alters traditional decision-making practices based on epistemic probability and prudence. This article contributes to the discussion on the ethical challenges posed by chatbots from the perspective of healthcare professional ethics.;2022
Mobile and cell devices have empowered end users to tweak their cell phones more than ever and introduce applications just as we used to with personal computers. Android likewise portrays an uprise in mobile devices and personal digital assistants. It is an open-source versatile platform fueling incalculable hardware units tablets televisions auto amusement frameworks digital boxes and so forth. In a generally shorter life cycle Android also has additionally experienced a mammoth development in application malware. In this context a toweringly large measure of strategies has been proposed in theory for the examination and detection of these harmful applications for the Android platform. These strategies attempt to both statically reverse engineer the application and elicit meaningful information as features manually or dynamically endeavor to quantify the runtime behavior of the application to identify malevolence. The overgrowing nature of Android malware has enormously debilitated the support of protective measures which leaves the platforms such as Android feeble for novel and mysterious malware. Machine learning is being utilized for malware diagnosis in mobile phones as a common practice and in Android distinctively. It is important to specify here that these systems however utilize and adapt the learning-based techniques yet the overhead of hand-created features limits ease of use of such methods in reality by an end user. As a solution to this issue we mean to make utilization of deep learning-based algorithms as the fundamental arrangement for malware examination on Android. Deep learning turns up as another way of research that has bid the scientific community in the fields of vision speech and natural language processing. Of late models set up on deep convolution networks outmatched techniques utilizing handmade descriptive features at various undertakings. Likewise our proposed technique to cater malware detection is by design a deep learning model making use of generative adversarial networks which is responsible to detect the Android malware via famous two-player game theory for a rock-paper-scissor problem. We have used three state-of-the-art datasets and augmented a large-scale dataset of opcodes extracted from the Android Package Kit bytecode and used in our experiments. Our technique achieves F1 score of 99% with a receiver operating characteristic of 99% on the bytecode dataset. This proves the usefulness of our technique and that it can generally be adopted in real life.;2022
Modern-day demands for services often require an availability on a 24/7 basis as well as online accessibility around the globe. For this sake personalized virtual assistants called chatbots are implemented. Such systems offer services goods or information in natural language. These natural language processing (NLP) programs respond to the user in real time and offer an intuitive and simple interface to interact with. Advantages like these make them increasingly popular. Therefore ensuring correct functionality of chatbots is of increasing importance. However since different implementations and user behaviour result in unpredictable results the chatbot's input and output data are difficult to predict and classify as well. Under such circumstances test cases can be inferred from the domain of possible inputs of a system under test (SUT). Ontologies are concepts used in AI to provide formal representations of knowledge for a specific domain. Such ontological models contain structured information that is used for test generation. On the other hand testing of chatbots represents a challenge because of the absence of a test oracle. In this paper both challenges are addressed by conceptualizing ontologies for input generation and output processing in form of a metamorphic testing approach. In this scenario both concepts are applied for automated testing of chatbots. The approach is demonstrated on a real system from the tourism domain thereby discussing the obtained results.;2022
Objective Prevention of eating disorders (EDs) is of high importance. However digital programs with human moderation are unlikely to be disseminated widely. The aim of this study was to test whether a chatbot (i.e. computer program simulating human conversation) would significantly reduce ED risk factors (i.e. weight/shape concerns thin-ideal internalization) in women at high risk for an ED compared to waitlist control as well as whether it would significantly reduce overall ED psychopathology depression and anxiety and prevent ED onset. Method Women who screened as high risk for an ED were randomized (N = 700) to (1) chatbot based on the StudentBodies (c) program or (2) waitlist control. Participants were followed for 6 months. Results For weight/shape concerns there was a significantly greater reduction in intervention versus control at 3- (d = -0.20 p = .03) and 6-m-follow-up (d = -0.19 p = .04). There were no differences in change in thin-ideal internalization. The intervention was associated with significantly greater reductions than control in overall ED psychopathology at 3- (d = -0.29 p = .003) but not 6-month follow-up. There were no differences in change in depression or anxiety. The odds of remaining nonclinical for EDs were significantly higher in intervention versus control at both 3- (OR = 2.37 95% CI [1.37 4.11]) and 6-month follow-ups (OR = 2.13 95% CI [1.26 3.59]). Discussion Findings provide support for the use of a chatbot-based EDs prevention program in reducing weight/shape concerns through 6-month follow-up as well as in reducing overall ED psychopathology at least in the shorter-term. Results also suggest the intervention may reduce ED onset. Public Significance We found that a chatbot or a computer program simulating human conversation based on an established cognitive-behavioral therapy-based eating disorders prevention program was successful in reducing women's concerns about weight and shape through 6-month follow-up and that it may actually reduce eating disorder onset. These findings are important because this intervention which uses a rather simple text-based approach can easily be disseminated in order to prevent these deadly illnesses.

Personal virtual assistants (PVAs) based on artificial intelligence are frequently used in private contexts but have yet to find their way into the workplace. Regardless of their potential value for organizations the relentless implementation of PVAs at the workplace is likely to run into employee resistance. To understand what motivates such resistance it is necessary to investigate the primary motivators of human behavior namely emotions. This paper uncovers emotions related to organizational PVA use primarily focusing on threat emotions. To achieve our goal we conducted an in-depth qualitative study collecting data from 45 employees in focus-group discussions and individual interviews. We identified and categorized emotions according to the framework for classifying emotions Beaudry and Pinsonneault (2010) designed. Our results show that loss emotions such as dissatisfaction and frustration as well as deterrence emotions such as fear and worry constitute valuable cornerstones for the boundaries of organizational PVA use.;2022
Problem definition: In this research we study how buyers' use of artificial intelligence (AI) affects suppliers' price quoting strategies. Specifically we study the impact of automation-that is the buyer uses a chatbot to automatically inquire about prices instead of asking in person-and the impact of smartness-that is the buyer signals the use of a smart AI algorithm in selecting the supplier. Academic/practical relevance: In a world advancing toward AI we explore how AI creates and delivers value in procurement. AI has two unique abilities: automation and smartness which are associated with physical machines or software that enable us to operate more efficiently and effectively. Methodology: We collaborate with a trading company to run a field experiment on an online platform in which we compare suppliers' wholesale price quotes across female male and chatbot buyer types under AI and no recommendation conditions. Results: We find that when not equipped with a smart control there is price discrimination against chatbot buyers who receive a higher wholesale price quote than human buyers. In fact without smartness automation alone receives the highest quoted wholesale price. However signaling the use of a smart recommendation system can effectively reduce suppliers' price quote for chatbot buyers. We also show that AI delivers the most value when buyers adopt automation and smartness simultaneously in procurement. Managerial implications: Our results imply that automation is not very valuable when implemented without smartness which in turn suggests that building smartness is necessary before considering high levels of autonomy. Our study unlocks the optimal steps that buyers could adopt to develop AI in procurement processes.;2022
Purpose Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots have brought unprecedented business potential. This study aims to explore consumers' trust and response to a text-based chatbot in e-commerce involving the moderating effects of task complexity and chatbot identity disclosure. Design/methodology/approach A survey method with 299 useable responses was conducted in this research. This study adopted the ordinary least squares regression to test the hypotheses. Findings First the consumers' perception of both the empathy and friendliness of the chatbot positively impacts their trust in it. Second task complexity negatively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. Third disclosure of the text-based chatbot negatively moderates the relationship between empathy and consumers' trust while it positively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. Fourth consumers' trust in the chatbot increases their reliance on the chatbot and decreases their resistance to the chatbot in future interactions. Research limitations/implications Adopting the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework this study provides important insights on consumers' perception and response to the text-based chatbot. The findings of this research also make suggestions that can increase consumers' positive responses to text-based chatbots. Originality/value Extant studies have investigated the effects of automated bots' attributes on consumers' perceptions. However the boundary conditions of these effects are largely ignored. This research is one of the first attempts to provide a deep understanding of consumers' responses to a chatbot.;2022
Purpose Chatbots are increasingly prevalent in the service frontline. Due to advancements in artificial intelligence chatbots are often indistinguishable from humans. Regarding the question whether firms should disclose their chatbots' nonhuman identity or not previous studies find negative consumer reactions to chatbot disclosure. By considering the role of trust and service-related context factors this study explores how negative effects of chatbot disclosure for customer retention can be prevented. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents two experimental studies that examine the effect of disclosing the nonhuman identity of chatbots on customer retention. While the first study examines the effect of chatbot disclosure for different levels of service criticality the second study considers different service outcomes. The authors employ analysis of covariance and mediation analysis to test their hypotheses. Findings Chatbot disclosure has a negative indirect effect on customer retention through mitigated trust for services with high criticality. In cases where a chatbot fails to handle the customer's service issue disclosing the chatbot identity not only lacks negative impact but even elicits a positive effect on retention. Originality/value The authors provide evidence that customers will react differently to chatbot disclosure depending on the service frontline setting. They show that chatbot disclosure does not only have undesirable consequences as previous studies suspect but can lead to positive reactions as well. By doing so the authors draw a more balanced picture on the consequences of chatbot disclosure.;2022
Purpose Current possibilities of accessing business data by regular users usually involve complicated user interfaces or require technical expertise. This results in situations when business owners are separated from their data. The aim of this research is to apply an innovative approach leveraging conversational interfaces to tackle this problem. Design/methodology/approach The authors examine the current possibilities of accessing business data by business users with an emphasis on conversational interfaces employing a chatbot as an alternative to traditional approaches. The authors propose a new concept relying on a guided conversation and through experiments with a real chatbot and database the authors demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach. Findings The authors found out that the key to the success of our approach is a decomposition of complex database queries and their incremental construction in conversations. This also enables natural discovery of the domain model through constantly provided feedback. Based on the experiments with a real chatbot the authors demonstrate that defining conversation flows and maintaining the conversation context is a crucial aspect contributing to the overall accuracy together with keeping the conversation within the defined limits in its certain parts. Originality/value The authors present a novel approach using natural language interfaces for accessing data by business users. In contrast to existing approaches the authors emphasize incremental construction of queries predefined conversation flows and constraining the conversations when necessary.;2022
Purpose The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the impact of technology-enabled service co-creation on patients' service patronage behaviour in healthcare retailing. The first objective is to examine the mediating roles of spatial presence and co-presence in the relationship between technology enabled co-creation and service experience. The second objective is to investigate if healthcare service experience impacts patients' relationship value with hospitals and subsequent patronage intention. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a sample of 516 customers of three leading hospitals in India during the social isolation period of COVID-19. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings The study results demonstrate that customers' favourably perceived technology-enabled co-creation generates feelings of spatial presence and co-presence in the technology-enabled platform. The feeling of presence enhances patients' health care service experiences which in turn predict their relationship value perceptions towards the healthcare service provider. Co-presence dominates as a mediator in terms of magnitude over spatial presence. The favourable value perception positively impacts patients' intention to come back to the same hospital. Research limitations/implications The study uses cross-sectional data which does not incorporate any temporal variations in the investigated relationships. The study does not account for differences in government vs. private undertakings of healthcare system. Practical implications The findings envisage a digital healthcare retail system where hospitals can enhance patients' perceptions of healthcare service experience relational value and re-patronage intention based on the digital mediated environment design elements i.e. spatial presence and co-presence. As co-presence is a dominant factor ensuring that human healthcare experts (rather than technology based e-service elements like chatbots) participate in healthcare service co-creation is of prime importance to provide enriching service experience to the patients. Originality/value The value of the research lies in extending the theories of presence UTAUT and S-O-R to understand digital healthcare retailing in order to identify the mechanism of how online co-creative platform can generate hospital patronage behaviour among patients through the serial mediation of presence augmented service experience and relationship value.;2022
Purpose This study aims to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot marketing efforts (CMEs) in the establishment of relationships between brands and their customers extending the link between relationship marketing and online consumer behavioral intentions. Design/methodology/approach Data are collected from 1072 customers in the USA who used chatbot marketing activities from any of 30 brands leading their industries in messaging innovation. Structural equation modeling is used for data analysis. Findings Results show that interaction information accessibility entertainment and customization are important CMEs components. CMEs have significant direct effects on the quality of communication with chatbot agents and indirectly affect customer-brand relationships (CBR) and customer response. In addition the findings demonstrate that CBR mediates the association between communication quality and customer response. Originality/value Implications of this study can enable practitioners to understand the effects of AI on user experiences and provide a guide for the development of CMEs strategies and relationship building.;2022
Rapid advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are transforming customer service by making it possible to create chatbot applications that can understand users' intents and response in a human-like manner. Chatbots promise to enhance customer experiences by creating more personal customer interactions than those afforded by traditional menu-based web applications. But are chatbots always superior to more traditional user interfaces (UI)? This study seeks to understand the differences in user satisfaction with a chatbot system vis-a-vis a menubased interface system and identify factors that influence user satisfaction. Grounded in the self-determination theory the research model proposed here focuses on the effect of chatbot use on perceived autonomy perceived competence cognitive load performance satisfaction and system satisfaction. An experimental study was conducted and data were analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling. The findings indicate that chatbot systems lead to a lower level of perceived autonomy and higher cognitive load compared with menu-based interface systems resulting in a lower degree of user satisfaction. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.;2022
Recently reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to task-oriented dialogue systems by using latent actions to solve shortcomings of supervised learning (SL). In this paper we propose a multi-domain task-oriented dialogue system called Dialogue System with Optimizing a Recurrent Action Policy using Efficient Context (DORA) that uses SL with subsequently applied RL to optimize dialogue systems using a recurrent dialogue policy. This dialogue policy recurrently generates explicit system actions as a both word-level and high-level policy. As a result DORA is clearly optimized during both SL and RL steps by using an explicit system action policy that considers an efficient context instead of the entire dialogue history. The system actions are both interpretable and controllable whereas the latent actions are not. DORA improved the success rate by 6.6 points on MultiWOZ 2.0 and by 10.9 points on MultiWOZ 2.1.;2022
Releasing an upgraded version of a product is a common tactic that firms use to maintain competitiveness. However in light of the significant research and development investment required to upgrade products a new industry trend has emerged in which incumbents collaborate with market entrants to innovate products. At the same time such collaboration may lead customers to think that the upgraded products are more similar than those innovated without collaboration. Consequently we consider the following tradeoff: collaboration allows firms to share the innovation investment but leads to less differentiated products. Specifically we consider a two-period model where the incumbent is a monopoly during the first period. This incumbent and a market entrant decide whether or not to collaborate to innovate their products and the two firms sell their products during the second period. We find that both firms can benefit from a higher innovation cost. Moreover the market entrant can be better off when the products become less differentiated due to collaboration or when customers are impatient to buy in the second period. Finally we find customers can be worse off when there is a lower innovation cost or more differentiated products.;2022
Sentiment analysis in conversations has gained increasing attention in recent years for the growing amount of applications it can serve e.g. sentiment analysis recommender systems and human-robot interaction. The main difference between conversational sentiment analysis and single sentence sentiment analysis is the existence of context information that may influence the sentiment of an utterance in a dialogue. How to effectively encode contextual information in dialogues however remains a challenge. Existing approaches employ complicated deep learning structures to distinguish different parties in a conversation and then model the context information. In this paper we propose a fast compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework named bidirectional emotional recurrent unit for conversational sentiment analysis. In our system a generalized neural tensor block followed by a two-channel classifier is designed to perform context compositionality and sentiment classification respectively. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state of the art in most cases. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2022
Spoken language is becoming one of the key components of human-machine interaction both to send information to the machine - e.g. voice control - and to receive from it - e.g. virtual assistants. In this scenario text-to-speech (TTS) models have become an essential artificial intelligence capacity. Even though this interaction can be based on neutral style speech generating speech with different styles pitches and speaking rates may improve user experience. With this in view this paper presents CAMNet a controllable acoustic model for efficient expressive high-quality TTS. CAMNet is based on deep convolutional TTS (DCTTS) a state-of-art acoustic model which is efficient and produces neutral speech. DCTTS was first adapted to generate Bark cepstrum acoustic features in order to integrate well with the LPCNet (linear prediction coefficient) neural vocoder and to remove the reduction factor which demanded the presence of an upsampling network before the vocoder - i.e. the CAMNet output can be directly fed into LPCNet. Next style transfer functionality was added by means of a novel characterisation of the prosodic information from the Bark cepstrum acoustic features and a new approach to inject this information into the convolutional layers. Finally controllability is provided via a variational autoencoder module which creates a smoothed disentangled latent space which allows interpolation and extrapolation of reference styles as well as independent and simultaneous control of two generative factors: pitch and speaking rate. Moreover this controllability is implemented using a simple offset-based approach. To sum up CAMNet is an efficient acoustic model which provides a simple but consistent controllability on coarse-grained expression pitch and speaking rate while still providing high-quality synthesised speech.

The aims of nursing training include not only mastering skills but also fostering the competence to make decisions for problem solving. In prenatal education cultivating nurses' knowledge and competence of vaccine administration is a crucial issue for protecting pregnant women and newborns from infection. Therefore obstetric vaccination knowledge has become a basic and essential training program for nursing students. However most of these training programs are given via the lecture-based teaching approach with skills practice providing students with few opportunities to think deeply about the relevant issues owing to the lack of interaction and context. This could have a negative impact on their learning effectiveness and clinical judgment. To address this problem a mobile chatbot-based learning approach is proposed in this study to enable students to learn and think deeply in the contexts of handling obstetric vaccine cases via interacting with the chatbot. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach an experiment was implemented. Two classes of 36 students from a university in northern Taiwan were recruited as participants. One class was the experimental group learning with the proposed approach while the other class was the control group learning with the conventional approach (ie giving lectures to explain the instructional content and training cases). The results indicate that applying a mobile chatbot for learning can enhance nursing students' learning achievement and self-efficacy. In addition based on the analysis of the interview results students generally believed that learning through the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self-efficacy as well as their learning engagement and performance. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Issues relevant to AI technology in education have been extensively discussed and explored around the world. Among the various AI systems the potential of chatbots has been highlighted by researchers owing to the user-friendly interface developed using the natural language processing (NLP) technology. Few studies using AI chatbots in professional training have been conducted. What this paper adds In this study a mobile chatbot was used in a nursing training program to enhance students' learning achievement and self-efficacy for handling vaccine cases. The mobile chatbot significantly improved the students' learning achievement and self-efficacy in comparison with the conventional learning approach in the vaccine training program. From the interview results it was found that the students generally believed that the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self-efficacy as well as learning engagement and performances in the vaccine training program. Implications for practice and/or policy Mobile chatbots have great potential for professional training owing to their convenient and user-friendly features. It would be worth applying mobile chatbots as well as other NLP-based applications to other professional training programs in the future.;2022
The English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' levels of attention and meditation as well as brainwaves while interacting with an interlocutor in three different second-language (L2) socialization contexts-with another human in person with another person through a virtual platform and with an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot-were explored in this study. Thirty participants participated in an experiment throughout which they were asked to wear a NeuroSky Mindwave headset to assess their real-time levels of attention and meditation as well as their brainwave activities in each of the three contexts. Statistical analyses of the results revealed a significant effect of the EFL socialization context on participants' level of attention and meditation. The EFL learners' level of attention was highest when they were socializing with other humans in person. When their interlocutor was a chatbot their level of meditation was highest. When they were interacting with another person in a virtual environment both their attention and meditation were lowest. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of the dominant ratios of participants' brainwave activities based on their interactions with interlocutors in all three contexts. The AI chatbot was associated with the greatest dominant ratio of delta and theta brainwaves for EFL learners. Face-to-face L2 socialization with interlocutors triggered alpha and beta brainwaves whereas interaction with human interlocutors in the virtual environment made gamma brainwaves dominant. The present study is the first to have empirically examined EFL learners' levels of attention and meditation as well as brainwaves during L2 socialization in three different contexts.;2022
The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a user-centered chatbotfor collecting linked data to study overweight and obesity causes ina target population. In total 980 people participated in the feasibility study organized in three studies: (1) within a group of university students (88 participants) (2) in a small town (422 participants) and (3) within a university community (470 participants). We gathered self-reported data through the Wakamola chatbot regarding participants diet physical activity social network living area obesity-associated diseases and sociodemographic data. For each study we calculated the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) and number of people in each BMI level. Also we defined and calculated scores (1-100 scale) regarding global health BMI alimentation physical activity and social network. Moreover we graphically represented obesity risk for living areas and the social network with nodes colored by BMI. Students group results: Mean BMI 21.37 (SD 2.57) (normal weight) 8 people underweight 5 overweight 0 obesity global health status 78.21 alimentation 63.64 physical activity 65.08 and social 26.54 3 areas with mean BMI level of obesity 17 with overweight level. Small town ' s study results: Mean BMI 25.66 (SD 4.29) (overweight) 2 people underweight 63 overweight 26 obesity global health status 69.42 alimentation 64.60 physical activity 60.61 and social 1.14 1 area with mean BMI in normal weight University ' s study results: Mean BMI 23.63 (SD 3.7) (normal weight) 22 people underweight 86 overweight 28 obesity global health status 81.03 alimentation 81.84 physical activity 70.01 and social 1.47 3 areas in obesity level 19 in overweight level. Wakamola is a health care chatbot useful to collect relevant data from populations in the risk of overweight and obesity. Besides the chatbot provides individual self-assessment of BMI and general status regarding the style of living. Moreover Wakamola connects users in a social network to help the study of O & O ' s causes from an individual social and socio-economic perspective.;2022
The use of chatbots as an online survey tool is becoming increasingly popular owing to their convenience particularly when face-to-face interactions are difficult. However with longer surveys interaction experience and data quality can decrease due to several factors such as increased fatigue. In this study we compared how applying humanization techniques to survey chatbots can affect survey-taking experience in three aspects: respondents' perceptions of chatbots interaction experience and data quality. To address our research goal two different versions of survey chatbots were compared: a humanization applied survey chatbot (HASbot) and a baseline chatbot (baselinebot). The HASbot simultaneously incorporates four humanization techniques: use of self-introduction addressing by name using adaptive response speed and echoing respondents' answers. Our experimental study with 59 middle school-aged adolescents showed that compared to the baselinebot respondents' perceptions of the HASbot were more positive with higher levels of anthropomorphism and social presence. In terms of interaction experience the respondents spent more time interacting with the HASbot and showed a higher level of satisfaction. For data quality the HASbot outperformed the baselinebot in terms of self disclosure however the HASbot also elicited a higher social desirability bias. No difference was observed in the response differentiation between the two chatbots.;2022
There is evidence that linguistic alignment can give rise to prosocial effects in human-human interaction (HHI) but little has been done to explore whether the same effects can be evoked in human-computer interaction (HCI). This study investigates whether being lexically aligned improves people's evaluation of their conversational partner and the interaction in HHI and HCI and whether such effects differ in HHI and HCI. A text-based interaction task was adopted in which a naive participant and his/her partner took turns to name and match pictures. In both HHI and HCI participants interacted with a computer program but they were led to believe that the partner they were interacting with was a human interlocutor in HHI conditions but a smart dialogue system (i.e. a computer partner) in HCI conditions. Lexical alignment was varied in the experiment such that in the align condition the program repeated the word use of participants whereas in the nonalign condition it chose words different from those used by participants. After the interaction task a questionnaire survey was carried out to measure participants' evaluation of their partner and the interaction. Results showed that lexical alignment significantly improved participants' evaluation of the interaction in terms of perceived cognitive demand and response accuracy in both HHI and HCI. In addition lexical alignment significantly enhanced people's liking of the aligning partner and reduced their perceived annoyance in HHI but the effect was negligible in HCI.;2022
This paper presents the Storybox Methodology which combines a novel framework for structuring knowledge and conversations around a story (D-PAF) with a live chatroom-based training approach that builds the conversation knowledge base via live chatroom interactions. Chatbots have achieved success as intelligent interfaces in education health sales and support but their move towards mainstream adoption has been hindered by the large amount of development resources required in terms of data collection preparation user testing and technical knowledge. The complexity of the development task often necessitates both a system author and a domain expert working effectively together adding further complexity and risk. Overcoming these barriers could increase feasibility of chatbots in a range of expert contexts. In education there are groups of learners who do not enjoy reading and writing. Storytelling chatbots might be able to introduce these groups to enjoyable new ways to read and write having a beneficial impact on their education and future prospects. This paper proposes the Storybox Methodology for the rapid development of storytelling chatbots. Storybox is evaluated by creating training and testing 'The Ghost' a chatbot enacting Hamlet's Ghost character from William Shakespeare's dramatic tragedy. The results showed that after a period of live chatbot training of only 25 training conversations The Ghost was able to conduct convincing conversations with participants.;2022
This paper proposes a general approach for using conversational interfaces such as chatbots to offer adaptive learning of business processes in an environment involving different actors. Adaptivity concerns both the content being proposed the sequence of learning items and the way the conversation is conducted. The original approach allows the development of sustainable chatbots and empowers various non-technical actors (authors teachers publishers and learners) to control the chatbot features directly. The aCHAT-WF framework (adaptive CHATbot for WorkFlows) proposed in this paper for managing conversational interfaces conceptually represents all the aspects related to a conversation about business processes with different facets for the user the conversation flow and the conversation contents combining them to obtain a flexible interaction with the user. The paper focuses on the different preparation phases for instructional material based on Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) models separating the different roles involved in the construction of a chatbot for teaching business processes and with the possibility of defining different styles for the interaction with the users. The proposed method is configuration-driven to facilitate the separation of the different aspects of the control of the interaction and the delivery of contents.;2022
This paper proposes methods for unsupervised lexical acquisition for relative spatial concepts using spoken user utterances. A robot with a flexible spoken dialog system must be able to acquire linguistic representation and its meaning specific to an environment through interactions with humans as children do. Specifically relative spatial concepts (e.g. front and right) are widely used in our daily lives however it is not obvious which object is a reference object when a robot learns relative spatial concepts. Therefore we propose methods by which a robot without prior knowledge of words can learn relative spatial concepts. The methods are formulated using a probabilistic model to estimate the proper reference objects and distributions representing concepts simultaneously. The experimental results show that relative spatial concepts and a phoneme sequence representing each concept can be learned under the condition that the robot does not know which located object is the reference object. Additionally we show that two processes in the proposed method improve the estimation accuracy of the concepts: generating candidate word sequences by class n-gram and selecting word sequences using location information. Furthermore we show that clues to reference objects improve accuracy even though the number of candidate reference objects increases.;2022
This survey aims to investigate analyze and compare the state-of-the-art chatbots' feasibility and defects for psychotherapy. The survey points out a series of tasks necessary for future psychotherapy chatbots. We searched about 1200 related literature in public databases and selected five typical and state-of-the-art psychotherapy chatbots. Most of the state-of-the-art psychotherapy chatbots use retrieval-based methods to generate dialogs. Some psychotherapy chatbots incorporate psychological theories such as cognitive behavior therapy to solve unique psychological problems. The assessments show that chatbots can preliminarily recognize specific kinds of negative emotions and give relatively appropriate responses. The randomized controlled trials prove that psychotherapy chatbots are useful for some people with a mental health condition. Compared with real psychologists psychotherapy chatbots have some advantages such as accessibility without the limitation on time or location. However some critical technical obstacles limit the usage of psychotherapy chatbots. The limitations require a series of necessary tasks for more effective and safer psychotherapy chatbots such as collecting standard valid real and rich corpora. In conclusion current psychotherapy chatbots can hardly replace human psychologists in the short term but they can improve human psychologists' effectiveness and efficiency as an auxiliary tool.;2022
To detect fraudulent TLS server certificates and improve the accountability of certification authorities (CAs) certificate transparency (CT) is proposed to record certificates in publicly-visible logs from which the monitors fetch all certificates and watch for suspicious ones. However if the monitors either domain owners themselves or third-party services fail to return a complete set of certificates issued for a domain of interest potentially fraudulent certificates may not be detected and then the CT framework becomes less reliable. This paper presents the first systematic study on CT monitors. We analyze the data in 88 public logs and the services of 5 active third-party monitors regarding 3000431 certificates of 6000 selected Alexa Top-1M websites. We find that although CT allows ordinary domain owners to act as monitors it is impractical for them to perform reliable processing by themselves due to the rapidly increasing volume of certificates in public logs (e.g. on average about 5 million records or 28.29 GB daily for the minimal set of logs that need to be monitored in 2018 or more than 7 million records per day in 2020 according to the Chrome CT policy). Moreover our study discloses that (a) none of the third-party monitors guarantees to return the complete set of certificates for a domain and (b) for some domains even the union of the certificates returned by the five third-party monitors can probably be incomplete. As a result the certificates accepted by CT-enabled browsers are not actually visible to the claimed domain owners even when CT is adopted with well-functioning logs. The risk of invisible fraudulent certificates in public logs raises doubts on the reliability of CT in practice.;2022
Users interact with chatbots for various purposes and motivations - and for different periods of time. However since chatbots are considered social actors and given that time is an essential component of social interactions the question arises as to how chatbots need to be designed depending on whether they aim to help individuals achieve short- medium-or long-term goals. Following a taxonomy development approach we compile 22 empirically and conceptually grounded design dimensions contingent on chatbots' temporal profiles. Based upon the classification and analysis of 120 chatbots therein we abstract three time-dependent chatbot design ar-chetypes: Ad-hoc Supporters Temporary Assistants and Persistent Companions. While the taxonomy serves as a blueprint for chatbot researchers and designers developing and evaluating chatbots in general our archetypes also offer practitioners and academics alike a shared understanding and naming convention to study and design chatbots with different temporal profiles.;2022
Virtual assistants powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and integrated into the smart home ecosystems facilitate human-building interactions. We have envisioned that the proactive virtual assistant capabilities could be designed to encourage energy conservation behaviours by relying on their nudging effect through conversational interactions autonomous actuation and guiding users' decision-making. To this end we investigated how proactive virtual assistants in a simulated smart home ecosystem influence occupants to take energy-saving adaptive actions for Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) operations and how participants' personal characteristics affect their responses. Through an interactive online experiment we collected data from 307 participants from diverse backgrounds across the United States. It was found that proactive communications with follow-up conversations can significantly increase the likelihood of accepting virtual assistance recommendations. This improvement was reflected in an increased number of participants (by 16%) who accepted energy-saving suggestions by comparing initial versus final responses during proactive conversations. Characterizing groups of participants based on their personal features and individual differences showed that user experience (with similar to 30% increase) pro-environmental values/beliefs (with similar to 24% to 35% increase) and forgiving thermal preferences (with similar to 12% increase) had a significant influence on participants' stated likelihood to accept virtual assistants' recommendations and their evaluation of the general concept of proactive communication from virtual assistants.;2022
Virtual personal assistants (VPAs) are becoming so widely available that considerations are being made as to whether to begin including them in self-driving vehicles. While research has been done exploring human interactions with single VPAs there has been a little work exploring human interactions and human mental models with interconnected systems. As companies like Amazon consider whether to integrate Alexa in their self-driving car research needs to be done to explore whether individual's mental model of these systems is of a single system or if every embodiment of the VPA (e.g. echo) represents a different VPA. Knowing this will allow researchers and practitioners to apply existing models of trust and predict whether high trust in the Siri that exists in an iPhone will carry over into high (and potentially miscalibrated) trust in Apple's Siri-directed self-driving vehicle. Results indicate that there is not one consistent mental model that users have and provides the framework for greater exploration into individual differences and the determinants that affect users' mental model.;2022
Wearable devices have now become virtual assistants and the sports industry also aims in technological integration. The objective of this research article is to introduce a wearable device to detect and record the movement of a cricket player during his training session. The designed system collects the displacement and rotational information through a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope placed on the cricket bat. We propose a data-driven machine learning model which takes raw analog data as input for classifying the strokes. The algorithm used is the polynomial support vector machine a supervised classification algorithm with 300 independent variables to enable accurate and real-time stroke classification. The system has a dedicated user interface for accessing these real-time details. This wearable embedded system does not require any cloud services as the complex analyses are performed in the processor itself. The player and the coach can get visual reference support and the mistakes can be corrected during the training period itself. The device can detect the arm action of a cricket player with a success rate of 97%. The hardware is powered using a 10000 mAh rechargeable battery.;2022
With overwhelming volumes of official emails being exchanged in enterprises every day emails have become vital information storehouses. Automatic generation of FAQs from email systems helps in identifying important information and could serve potential applications such as chatbots and intelligent email answering. While there exist studies in the literature focusing on automatic FAQ generation and automated email answering there are few studies that apply recently developed deep learning techniques to fetch FAQs from emails. This paper proposes a novel framework named F-Gen which is an expert system that generates potential FAQs from emails utilizing state-of-the-art methodologies. The key characteristics of this study are as follows: 1. Designing F-Gen with various subsystems that interoperate together for the FAQ generation 2. Identifying the parameters that determine a valid FAQ. The three subsystems of F-Gen are: (a) query classifier subsystem (QC subsystem) for email texts (b) FAQ group generator subsystem (FGG subsystem) for generating FAQ groups from email queries. And (c) FAQ generator subsystem (FG subsystem) for conversion of email query clusters into FAQs. Experiments on the email dataset that practically reflect the above-mentioned problem resulted in FAQs with a ROUGE-1 F-Score of 74.10% when compared with the ground truth.;2022
With rapid development of voice control technology making speech recognition more precisely in various IoT domains have been an intractable problem to be solved. Since there are various conversation scenes understanding the context of a dialog scene is a key issue of voice control systems. However the reality is available training data for dialog system are always insufficient. In this paper we mainly solve the problem of data lacking in dialog systems by data augmentation technique. A Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)-based model is proposed and the data are augmented effectively. It can generate from text to text enhance the original data with text retelling and improve the robustness of parameter estimation of unknown data by using the sample data generated by GAN model. A new N-gram language model is used to evaluate multiple recognition candidates of speech recognition and the candidate sentences with the highest evaluation scores are selected as the final result of speech recognition. Our data enhancement algorithm based on the Generative Model is verified by the experiments. In the result of model comparison test the error rates of data set THCHS30 and AISHELL are 3.3% and 5.1% which are lower than that of the baseline system.;2022
With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) countries are increasingly adopting AI-guided chatbots to improve service on government portals. The reduction in face-to-face services under COVID-19 pandemic will further accelerate this trend. However the adoption and performance of the existing chatbots differ. Based on the literature on e-government adoption and innovative policy innovation diffusion this article examines both the initial and postadoption stages of chatbot usage in China's local governments. While the first phase employs the survival model of event history analysis to explore the factors that influence the decision to adopt chatbots in local government the second phase analyzes the determinants of those chatbots' performance in the postadoption stage. We find that pressure factors and readiness factors play different roles in the different adoption stages. Although pressure can encourage local governments to implement chatbots these governments' readiness determined how well the chatbots perform after their initial adoption. The implications and limitations of the research are also discussed.;2022
