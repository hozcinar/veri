A diagnosis of an aesthetic smiling deformity which is functional rather than anatomic is essential for provision of the best treatment in rhinoplasty. Smiling deformity consists of three elements: (a) the nasal tip tending to retrodisplace and rotate inferiorly (b) the lower part of the upper lip moving superiorly and (c) a horizontal groove occurring in the midphiltral area. An active depressor septi and orbicularis muscle can accentuate a drooping nasal tip and shorten the upper lip during smiling. Downward movement of the nasal tip and a sharper nasolabial angle usually are aesthetically unpleasant. During the study period (January 2000 to January 2004) the authors identified 38 patients with smiling deformities 16 of whom underwent dissection and transposition of the paired depressor septi during rhinoplasty. The remaining 22 patients experienced hyperactivity of both the depressor septi and orbicularis muscles as diagnosed by a descending nasal tip and a shortened upper lip at animation. These patients underwent a modification of the depressor septi and orbicularis muscles. No relapse was evident up to 2 years postoperatively. Repositioning of the depressor septi nasi muscle improved only mild cases. However modification of the orbicularis and depressor septi muscles was a valuable adjunct to rhinoplasty for moderate and severe forms of smiling deformity. The new approach for smiling deformity provided an aesthetically pleasant appearance for the patient both at rest and when smiling.;2005
A double-blind randomized study was designed to determine the efficacy of dexamethasone in decreasing periorbital edema and ecchymosis after rhinoplasty. Sixty rhinoplasty patients undergoing hump resection and lateral osteotomy were included in the study and were divided into 6 groups: group I (n = 10) single dose of 8 mg intravenous (IV) dexamethasone I hour before the operation group 2 (n = 10) single dose of 8 mg IV dexamethasone at the beginning of the operation group 3 (n = 10) 3 doses of 8 mg IV dexamethasone I hour before the operation and 24 and 48 hours after the operation group 4 (it = 10) 3 doses of 8 mg IV dexamethasone at the beginning of the operation and 24 and 48 hour after the operation group 5 (n = 10) 3 doses of 8 mg IV dexamethasone immediately after the operation and 24 and 48 hours after the operation group 6 (it = 10) control no dexamethasone administration before or after the operation. Intraoperative blood loss was recorded for each patient. Patients were evaluated at 24 hours and days 2 5 7 and 10. For the postoperative evaluation of periorbital ecchymosis and edema a scale of 0 to 4 points was used. There was no significant difference between groups in terms of bleeding (P > 0.05). In the groups using steroid before osteotomy edema and ecchymosis were significantly lower during the first 2 days compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No significant difference was seen between groups I and 2. When patients were evaluated on day 5 edema and ecchymosis were significantly lower in groups 3 and 4 (P < 0.05) compared with other groups but there was no difference between them. Group 5 had a significantly higher level of edema and ecchymosis compared with groups I through 4 at 24 hours and at days 2 5 and 7 (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference between groups on day 10. In conclusion if the first dose is given before osteotomy triple-dose steroid application is the best bet for decreasing postoperative edema and ecchymosis. None of the patients had any complications related to the use of dexamethasone.;2003
A double-blind randomized trial with placebo control was planned to evaluate the effects of corticosteroids (betamethasone dexamethasone methylprednisolone) in approximately equivalent doses (8 mg dexamethasone/day) and to compare their effects with that of tenoxicam an antiinflammatory drug on both the edema and ecchymosis in open rhinoplasty with osteotomies. For this study 40 patients were divided randomly into five groups of 8 patients each which received respectively betamethasone (group 1) dexamethasone (group 2) methylprednisolone (group 3) tenoxicam (group 4) and placebo (group 5). Open rhinoplasty with osteotomies was performed by the same surgeon with the patient under general anesthesia. Drugs were administered just before the induction of anesthesia and continued for 3 days. Only acetaminophen was used to control postoperative analgesia. Digital photographs of each patient were taken on postoperative days 1 3 and 7. Scoring was performed separately for eyelid swelling and ecchymosis by three observers independently using a graded scale from 0 to 4. No statistically significant differences existed among the five groups in terms of age sex duration of surgery amount of bleeding and intravenous fluid administration during the surgery. On postoperative days 1 3 and 7 no differences in the levels of ecchymosis or edema among the steroid groups the tenoxicam group and the control groups were observed. In conclusion the authors observed no significant differences among the different kinds of steroids administered in equivalent doses (8 mg dexamethasone/day). Steroids used in these doses were not effective in preventing or reducing edema and ecchymosis after open rhinoplasty with osteotomies. Tenoxicam also was not effective. No complications caused by the use of steroids were observed during the 6-month follow-up period.;2006
A fuzzy logic-based model is used for generating an index which reflects the harmony of nasal proportions of a rhinoplasty patient. The index generated by the model is intended to be used as an objective tool for evaluating the harmony of nasal proportions of the patient. One of the possible uses of the index is to rate the nasal proportions of the patient relative to an ideal nose. Another possible use of the index is to generate a score for the patient before and after the rhinoplasty operation so that the improvement due to rhinoplasty operation can be determined objectively.

A meticulous nasal dorsal dissection is an indispensable tool for a successful rhinoplasty. To achieve an aesthetically pleasing dorsum fine dissection of the upper lateral cartilages (ULC) nasal bones and keystone area is crucial. In this Featured Operative Technique article the author describes a different concept of nasal dorsal skeletonization: the perichondro-periosteal flap technique. This technique has several advantages in restoring the nasal dorsum after hump reduction. Namely the preparation and protection of the perichondrium and the periosteum of the nasal dorsum as a single entity allows a healthier separate-layer closure over the osseocartilaginous dorsum.;2013
A new technique for the correction of the severely deviated nose is described. After submucosal resection of the septum the nasal hump is resected reversed and reinserted. This technique was applied to 27 patients over a four-year period with successful results. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed.;1995
A novel method for repair of septal perforations. Fifteen volunteers with symptomatic septal perforations were recruited. Open technique rhinoplasty approach was preferred: auricular conchal cartilage graft with intact perichondrium on both sides was harvested and shaped to fit the perforated site and attached to the septum with absorbable sutures. All margins of the graft were covered with nasal mucosa. The severity of patient symptoms was assessed at preoperation 3 and 6 months postoperatively via visual analogue scale (VAS). Crust formation whistling nasal blockage epistaxis and overall comfort were evaluated. Mucosal physiology was assessed by nasal mucociliary clearance time. The mean age of the patients was 47.3 years. Average perforation size was 1.86 +/- A 0.78 cm. 14/15 (93.3%) perforations were repaired and only one patient required revision surgery. VAS scores improved significantly (p < 0.001). Mean mucociliary clearance time improved from 17.6 +/- A 3.83 to 10.3 +/- A 3.30 min and 9.3 +/- A 3.36 min at 3 and 6 months respectively. This is a novel simple and safe method for repairing the deficient mucosal area in septal perforations up to 25 mm in diameter.;2012
A novel technique for maintaining nasal tip support and external nasal valve integrity is proposed. The procedure involves mobilizing the lateral crus to a more cranial position after altering its shape from convexity to a more flat shape. With the described technique the lower lateral cartilage is dissected free from the skin in a retrograde fashion after an intercartilaginous incision. The ligament between the lateral crus and the upper lateral cartilage is cut. The vestibular mucosa is not freed. With this maneuver the lateral crus usually flattens sufficiently. When the convexity flattens an extra millimeter of cartilage at the cephalic end is gained in the horizontal dimension. When the cut vestibular mucosa is sutured back to its place the cephalic end of the lateral crus is advanced over the upper lateral cartilage. This technique allows durable support to maintain patency of the nasal valve. No bridges are burned because no cartilage is excised. The surgeon is left with the flexibility to modify the result on the operating table. The technique was successfully used for 48 consecutive patients over a 3-year period. All the operations were primary rhinoplasties performed using a closed technique. The mean age of the patients was 32 years. For 72% of the patients septoplasty also was performed. None of these patients had to undergo reoperation. The authors emphasize the importance of the lateral crus in rhinoplasty and demonstrate that good results at the tip of the nose can be accomplished without cephalic trimming averting related complications in selected cases.;2009
A perfect surgical approach to nasal cavity and paranasal sinus tumors should provide a broad exposition preserving the important structures with no cosmetic defect. Midfacial degloving (MD) technique provides good exposure without incisions and scars in the face. Classic MD technique includes rhinoplasty incisions. However combination of the facial plastic skills of the rhinoplasty techniques with an oncologic approach limits its popularity. We modified the classic technique which is performed without classic rhinoplasty incisions. The surgical approaches to 55 patients with benign and malignant sinonasal neoplasms are reviewed and the modification of MD technique performed without rhinoplasty incisions is described. The study includes 41 male and 13 female patients with both benign and malignant sinonasal neoplasms. The ages of the patients were between 9 and 78 years with a mean age of 41.15 years. Follow-up of the patients ranged from 2 to 96 months with a mean of 31.7 months. Most of the cases were angiofibroma and inverted papilloma. Modified MD approach was used for all patients and in 6 cases the technique was combined with subcranial approach. We successfully resected the tumors in all of the patients. The most frequently encountered complaint in the postoperative period was temporary nasal crusting and epistaxis. An important complication was the rupture of subpetrous part of the internal carotid artery in one patient and also a temporary facial palsy in another one. Palatal dysfunction oroantral fistula or vestibular stenosis which are significant complications of MD were not observed in any of our cases. In this modified technique rhinoplasty incisions are not used therefore the duration of operation is shortened the technique becomes easier and the incisions of the rhinoplasty procedure which could cause circular stenosis are avoided.;2008
A slightly convex forehead without wrinkles adds attractiveness to a woman's face and to the general perceived image. It is also important for the balance and harmony of the face especially in the lateral and oblique views. We used a new fat injection technique for correction of the contours of the forehead. In this study fat injection was applied in nine female patients for restoring the contour and reducing forehead wrinkles along with a primary rhinoplasty operation. After dissecting all forehead skin from the underlying muscle with a sharp curved-tip epidural needle fat grafts were injected into the newly created pocket until the forehead area looked moderately ballooned and gentle digital pressure was used for feathering. The patients wore hair bandages continuously for 2 weeks after the operation. The minimal follow-up time was 12 months (range = 12-48 months) and all the patients were pleased with the results. When we compared the photos before and after the operation it was observed that the fat grafts were stable and retained the volume replacement. Patients declared that they had glossy and better quality skin after the operation and also had new regenerated contours. We did not observe any complications. We performed only one additional lipofilling in one patient to obtain an optimal forehead contour. This technique is easy to perform and effective in reducing forehead wrinkles and correcting the contour. It was also observed that better perceived nasal results could be obtained with concomitant forehead lipofilling in rhinoplasty operations.;2012
A spreader flap or autospreader flap is a flap used for dorsal reconstruction in primary rhinoplasty after cartilage dorsum excision. Despite its significant advantages the spreader flap also has distinct shortcomings. The most common problem encountered in using a spreader flap is the technique's inability to provide adequate dorsal width compared with spreader grafts. Additionally the use of a spreader flap has not been described for special cases such as crooked noses cases with minimal dorsal humps and secondary cases. This report presents the authors' modification of the spreader flap technique to expand its indications and extend the spreader effect down to the entire dorsum. This modification positions and fixes the medial borders of the upper lateral cartilages (ULCs) on both sides of the septum by asymmetric mattress sutures. Using the ULCs without folding affords the opportunity to restore a dorsum with sufficient width. Different entry and exit points of the suture help to maintain the cartilage substance horizontally rather than folded as in the conventional spreader flap technique. Another drawback of the spreader flap technique is its inability to address the lower third of the dorsum when ULCs do not extend down to the anterior septal angle (ASA). In these cases attempts were made to extend the spreader effect by placing two small cartilage grafts on both sides of the ASA. Over a period of 2 years the authors operated on 169 patients. For 81 of these patients the modified spreader flap alone was used and for the remaining 88 patients both the modified spreader flap technique and ASA grafting (combined modification) were used. During a mean follow-up period of 17 months no narrowing in the middle nasal dorsum and no inner valve deficiencies were seen in any of the cases.;2011
A successful rhinoplasty mainly depends on maintaining adequate nasal tip projection and achieving the desired tip refinement. In endonasal rhinoplasty the surgeon can modify the tip anatomy while still preserving the key structural support mechanisms. Herein we describe a new modification of retrograde technique for the resection of the cephalic margin of the lateral crus in endonasal rhinoplasty in which a combined resection of the cephalic margin of the lateral crus and its underlying mucoperichondrium are performed.;2012
A thin or damaged skin soft tissue envelope may cause concerns in primary and secondary rhinoplasty. During postoperative healing unpredictable scarring and contraction may occur and lead to significant aesthetic and trophic sequelae. Besides a meticulous surgical technique there are no reliable techniques to prevent long-term skin damage and shrinkage. Fat transfer with addition of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) harbors the possibility of local soft tissue regeneration and skin rejuvenation through growth factors and mesenchymal stem cells. It may also facilitate the creation of a thin fat layer on the dorsum to prevent shrink-wrap forces and conceal small irregularities. The goal is to provide evidence for the feasibility durability and beneficial effect of diced macrofat transfer bonded with PRF on the nasal dorsum. We present the technique of fat transfer conjugated with PRF as a nasal dorsal graft. Clinical endpoints were the prevention of trophic disturbances and atrophy at a 1-year postoperative follow-up. We present the skin mobility test as a clinical indicator of a healthy soft tissue envelope. The presented case series consists of 107 rhinoplasties. Fat was harvested in the umbilical or costal region. PRF was created by centrifugation of autologous whole blood samples. Macrofat was diced cleaned and bonded with PRF. The compound transplants were transferred to the nasal dorsum. There were no perioperative complications or wound-healing issues. Mean follow-up was 14 months. Clinical inspection showed good skin quality and no signs of shrinkage marked scarring or color changes with positive skin mobility test in all patients. Survival of fat was confirmed by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Diced macrofat transfer in conjunction with PRF to the nasal dorsum is a feasible and safe method. A beneficial effect on the soft tissue envelope is demonstrated as well as the prevention of shrink-wrap forces.;2021
A video of revision rhinoplasty on a Middle Eastern nose accompanies this article In this article the main characteristics of Middle Eastern patients seeking rhinoplasty are reported. Besides the preoperative preparation surgical techniques that can be used to obtain good results are discussed. The pitfalls of profile alignment tip procedures and skin have been noted as well.;2014
A visible scar on the columella is undesirable result for both patient and surgeon. So it is one of the major disadvantage of open nose surgery. Different columellar incision types have been used in open technique of nasal surgery. In this prospective study we compare W incisions and inverted-V columellar incisions with a scar assessment scale. In this prospective randomized study open nasal surgery (open rhinoplasty and open technique septoplasty) were performed on 93 patients between November 2009 and July 2012. The inverted-V incision was used on 31 patients (24 males 7 females). The W incision was used on 62 patients (40 males 22 females). The entire surgical procedure was performed by a single surgeon. The columellar incision was closed using 6-0 interrupted polypropylene sutures. All sutures were removed on the seventh postoperative day. Scars were assessed at 6 moths with 3 items scar assessment scale we observed satisfactory scar pigmentation and notching. We compared both groups and found that the scar pigmentation notching and scar formation are similar to each other. As a result of this study we concluded that the inverted-V incision or W incision might be a similar choice in open nasal surgery.;2018
A wide variety of autologous grafts have been used for the coverage of contour deformities in rhinoplasty. Mastoid fascia tissue (MFT) grafts are easy to harvest and very versatile and the resulting donor site scar is not visible. Natural looking results can be obtained with MFT grafts when used for the coverage of dorsal irregularities for dorsal augmentation for camouflaging abnormalities related to skin atrophy and even for tip-of-nose coverage and tip augmentation. Mastoid fascia tissue was used as a graft in 8 primary and 22 secondary cases for various purposes. All patients had satisfactory cosmetic results. Used in conjunction with a rigid graft such as cartilage MFT grafts which are ideal fillers can be successfully used in rhinoplasty.;2012
Aesthetic diagnosis of the smiling deformity which is functional rather than anatomical is essential to provide the best treatment in rhinoplasty. The nasal tip tends to rotate inferiorly during smiling and the central upper lip moves superiorly. A posteriorly sloping upper lip with a retrodisplaced columella-labial junction gives an unaesthetic appearance. Downward movement of the tip and a sharper nasolabial angle are usually aesthetically unpleasant. In 28 nasal surgeries augmentation of the columella-labial angle with cartilage strip grafts has been performed. The augmentation of the angle and additionally cutting of the depressor septi muscle created a wider nasolabial complex and this angle looks full and more pleasant. This procedure has mainly been used as an additional procedure to standard reduction rhinoplasty in order to improve smiling deformity. Strip cartilage grafts were inserted subcutaneously into the upper lip extending half way to the columella and secured with a transcutaneous suture under the columella labial angle to prevent misslocation. Augmentation by the cartilage graft together with cutting the depressor septi muscle prevented elevation and shortening of the upper lip and also drooping of the nasal tip. This procedure provided an aesthetically pleasant appearance both at rest and during smiling.;1998
After harvesting the conchal cartilage in a large series of secondary rhinoplasties using the anterior approach there was a marked improvement in the shape of the auricle with unnoticeable scarring hidden under the convolution of the antihelix. In this series of 250 cases there were no hypertrophic scars or keloid formations. Based on these favorable results a new modification of otoplasty was developed using only the anterior approach. Between 1992 and 2000 108 otoplasties were performed on 55 patients to correct the prominent ear using only the anterior approach. All maneuvers used in modern otoplasty such as conchal reduction scaphal cartilage scoring and folding placement of horizontal mattress buried sutures conchal setback and the positioning of the tail and upper pole can be easily and effectively performed using only the anterior approach as described in this article. The use of an anterior approach does not disturb the neurovascular system of the ear because it is located on the ear's posterior side. Overall patient and physician satisfaction has continued to be very high during the 8 years that this technique has been used. Some patients experienced a few minor complications such as postoperative pain (16.3 percent) late suture reaction (1.8 percent) hidden helix (3.6 percent) and partial relapse (3.6 percent) that were easily corrected by the application of a Kaye-type buried suture and that were not directly related to the technique.;2001
After hump removal in reduction rhinoplasty one of the main steps is to rebuild the middle vault. Spreader grafts have long been the main tool for the surgeon. Within the last two decades the spreader flaps have started to be very popular as well. In accordance with the experience and technical preferences of the surgeon there are many different options. In this article the spreader grafts are classified as traditional modified splinting and reconstructive. The spreader flaps are designed in accordance with their relationship with the septum and the spreader grafts.;2016
After rhinoplasty during the first 24 hours the patients should be closely monitored for pain and discomfort nausea and vomiting and cool compresses must be applied regularly to decrease edema and ecchymosis. In the early postoperative period of the first month the sutures cast and splints are usually removed during the first week. Then the patient is followed-up at 1 3 6 and 12-month intervals routinely to observe healing. In the meantime any kind of intranasal and extranasal complications should be noted. The outcome measures such as ROE NOSE or SCHNOS should be used 3 to 6 months after surgery. If the patient is closely followed-up then any unwanted complication or dissatisfaction can be solved after 6 to 12 months.;2018
Aim: In this study we aimed to compare the effects of standard verbal information in the preoperative period and the information by visual expression and physical applications in the development of agitation edema and ecchymosis in the postoperative period. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in 60 ASA I-II patients who were going to undergo open rhinoplasty by plastic surgery. In the Preoperative Anesthetic Assessment the patients were divided into two groups as the patients given standard verbal information (Group S n = 30) and those informed with a catalog which contains visuals (Group V n = 30) In the preoperative period anxiety levels of the patients were evaluated. Standard anesthesia induction was performed in both groups after standard monitoring. Patients were monitored in the post-anesthesia care unit and ward. Patient's extubation quality presence of postoperative agitation and periorbital edema and ecchymosis at the 6th 12th 18th and 24th hours were evaluated. Results: No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of intraoperative and postoperative MAP HR extubation quality presence of recovery agitation postoperative pain development edema and ecchymosis (P > 0.05). Significant positive correlation was found between post-extubation MAP and edema scores at the 16th and 24th hours postoperatively and between the post-anesthesia care unit entry MAP and ecchymosis at the 24th postoperative hours independently of the groups (r = 0.27P = 0.038 r = 0.302P = 0.019 r = 0.345P = 0.007 respectively). Result: In our study it was concluded that detailed visual information and physical application in the preoperative period among rhinoplasty patients had no effect on the incidence of postoperative agitation development of edema and ecchymosis.;2020
Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of piezoelectric surgery (piezosurgery) on soft tissue in open septorhinoplasty. Methods: A total of 30 patients (21 females 9 males mean age 29.16 +/- 8.17 years range 18-43 years) who underwent open septorhinoplasty between January 2019 and February 2019 were randomly divided into 2 groups. After the nasal dorsum was opened in all groups 1 mm(3) tissue under the skin in radix region was taken as punch biopsy. In the first group (classical group n = 15) the cartilage hump was resected with number 15 scalpel and the bone hump with the help of a chisel. Lateral and median osteotomies were conducted using 4 mm sharp osteotomes. Rasping was performed to dorsum to correct bone deformities. Then 1 mm(3) punch biopsy was taken from under the skin tissue of the nose back near the radix. In the second group (piezo group n = 15) hump excision osteotomies and rasping were performed by piezoelectric surgery. Then 1 mm(3) punch biopsy was taken from the subcutaneous tissue of the nose back near the radix. Biopsies were examined histopathologically in the light microscope for edema necrosis and inflammation. Results: Of the 30 patients presented in this series 21 were female and 9 were male. In the classical group edema in the soft tissue was seen in 86.7% of the cases after osteotomy while this rate was 26.7% in the piezosurgery group. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Although necrosis was not seen prior to the osteotomy in both groups the rate of necrosis in the classical group was 13.3% and in the piezo group it was 66.7%. Necrosis was significantly different in the piezosurgery group compared with the classical osteotomy group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Piezosurgery is not completely harmless to soft tissue. A statistically significant increase in subcutaneous necrosis compared with the classical group can be explained by long-term soft tissue trauma caused by piezoelectric vibrations. We think that developing necrosis may cause problems in late period especially in patients with thin skin.;2019
Aim: The forehead region is the ideal site for nasal reconstruction and the biggest disadvantage of the forehead flap used for this purpose is that it requires two or three sessions of surgery. Subcutaneous pedicled forehead flap was described previously. However venous congestion was observed because the vein was ignored while the flap was planned. For this reason we made nasal reconstruction with forehead flap in one stage and planned the flap pedicle to include the vein and artery together. Material and Method: The data of 8 patients who underwent axial subcutaneous pedicled forehead flap due to a defect in the proximal 2/3 of nose between January 2016 and January 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. The mean age of the patients was 62.88 and the mean follow-up period was 14.13 months. Results: The operations lasted 85 minutes on average and nasal defects were reconstructed with a single stage forehead flap. Clinically we observed less venous congestion and less bleeding. No partial or total loss was observed in any flap. All patients were discharged on postoperative day 1. Discussion: The subcutaneous axial pedicled forehead flap can be safely used for defects in the superior 2/3 of the nose. However larger superficial vein should be determined first and then the flap pedicle should be planned by marking the artery while planning this flap. In this way nasal reconstruction is made in one session with a subcutaneous pedicled axial forehead flap that includes both artery and vein.;2020
Aim: The present study aimed to compare edema and ecchymosis in the early and late postoperative periods following the application of different surgical techniques (open and endonasal) and different types of lateral osteotomy (internal and external). Methods: The files and photographs of a total of 120 patients whose records were regularly maintained/updated and who underwent septorhinoplasty operation with the same surgeon were retrospectively evaluated. Sixty-nine (57.5%) patients were women and 51 (43.5%) were men. The patients were divided into 4 different groups according to the operations they underwent as follows-Group I: open technique septorhinoplasty + internal/continuous lateral osteotomy Group II: endonasal rhinoplasty + internal/continuous lateral osteotomy Group III: open technique septorhinoplasty + external/perforating lateral osteotomy and Group IV: endonasal rhinoplasty + external/perforating lateral osteotomy. Postoperative edema and ecchymosis andlateral nasal wall mucosal damage because of osteotomy were evaluated. Results: Postoperative second day edema and ecchymosis scores were statistically significantly better in patients in Group II compared with the patients in Group I (P = 0.010 and P = 0.004 respectively). Postoperative first day edema and postoperative seventh day ecchymosis scores were statistically significantly better in the patients in Group IV compared with the patients in Group III (P = 0.025 and P = 0.011 respectively). Intraoperative bleeding was similar in all groups. The nasal tip was more flexible in patients who underwent closed technique rhinoplasty. Unilateral mucosal damage occurred in 3 patients (4%) with internal lateral osteotomy whereas no mucosal damage was present in patients with external osteotomy. Conclusions: The difference in the rate of edema and ecchymosis in the early postoperative period between the closed technique rhinoplasty and the open surgical approach was statistically significant whereas osteotomy did not cause a significant difference. According to these results the authors suggest endonasal surgery to prevent the development of edema and ecchymosis whereas the choice of lateral osteotomy should be dependent on the experience of the surgeon.;2015
Aim: The purpose of the study was to examine psychopathological traits and psychiatric co-morbidities in seekers of cosmetic rhinoplasty. Subjects and Method: Fifty persons seeking cosmetic rhinoplasty and 50 control subjects were admitted to the study. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Symptom Checklist 90 [Revised] (SCL-90-R) were administered to people who requested cosmetic rhinoplasty and control subjects. All participants were also screened by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-(SCID-I/CK SCID-II). Results: Thirteen cosmetic rhinoplasty seekers [CRS] (26%) and three control subjects (6%) had at least one psychiatric diagnosis. There was a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.006). Beck depression inventory (p = 0.002) and BAI (p = 0.046) levels above the cut-off point point were significantly higher in the CRS group than in the normal control. Somatoform disorders were statistically higher in the CRS than control group (p = 0.007). Nine CRS (18%) and two control subjects (4%) had at least one personality disorder. There were differences between the two groups (p = 0.025). The average of SCL-90-R was significantly higher in the CRS than in the control subjects (p < 0.001). The most prevalent somatoform disorders of the CRS were six with body dysmorphic disorder [BDD] (12%). The most prevalent personality disorders of the CRS were three with avoidant (6%) and three with narcissistic (6%) personality. Conclusion: Assessment of detailed psychopathological aspects and psychiatric co-morbidities could help to define the clinical profile of people requesting cosmetic rhinoplasty in cosmetic surgery settings. Research into these factors may be important as it is essential to detect crucial problems such as personality disorders and BDD before surgery.;2013
Aim: This article reports the treatment of an 33-year-old female patient with pyknodysostosis by rigid external distraction II midface distraction system. Study Design: The patient with pyknodysostosis described in this report had severe midfacial hypoplasia. Correction of this by use of routine orthognathic surgery would require osteosynthesis and bone grafting. Risk of infection and/or nonunion after such a surgical procedure was considered too great and therefore the possibility of treatment by distraction osteogenesis of the maxilla was evaluated. The rigid external distraction II midface distraction system was used to relocate the hypoplastic maxilla at anterior-inferior projection. Conclusions: Distraction osteogenesis should be considered as the primary reconstructive method for maxillofacial deformities in patients with sclerosing bone dysplasias since this is the second reported case treated successfully with rigid external distraction.;2011
Aim: This study aims to evaluate the effect of infraorbital region taping on patients' postoperative edema and ecchymosis satisfaction levels and anxiety during follow-up. Methods: A total of 64 patients who underwent septorhinoplasty were included in this randomized controlled prospective study. According to the randomization list the taping group's (TG) infraorbital region was taped with adhesive strips. Others were included in the control group and were classified as the nontaping group. Two blinded physicians evaluated the degree of edema and ecchymosis according to the photographs of patients taken on the first second fifth and seventh postoperative days. Patient's appearance satisfaction was evaluated for ecchymosis levels. State anxiety inventory (STAI-S) and trait anxiety inventory (STAI-T) were used to measure preoperative and postoperative anxiety levels of patients. Results: The degree of ecchymosis and edema were not significantly different except on the first day in the TG (P = 0.01 P = 0.01 respectively). Significant increment was found in the TG on first second and fifth days based on the satisfaction levels of patients for their appearance (P = 0.05 P = 0.03 P = 0.04 respectively). Preoperative STAI-S and STAI-T were similar for the groups (P = 0.78 P = 0.17 respectively). However postoperative STAI-S of the TG were significantly lower compared with those of the nontaping group except seventh day (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Infraorbital taping did not decrease the edema and ecchymosis except on the first postoperative day. However it had a significant ameliorating effect on patients' anxiety and satisfaction levels.;2020
Aim: To evaluate the contribution to patient satisfaction of the newly reshaped topographic anatomy of the nose demographic and functional results in the postoperative period of septorhinoplasty surgery. Method: A total of 370 patients applied with open and closed septorhinoplasty techniques for various reasons were grouped according to the postoperative Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) Scale results Group 1 (open rhinoplasty satisfied group ROE >= 12 points n:194) Group 2 (open rhinoplasty dissatisfied group ROE <12 points n:23) Group 3 (closed rhinoplasty satisfied group ROE >= 12 points n:137) Group 4 (closed rhinoplasty dissatisfied group ROE <12 points n:16). The groups were evaluated in respect of the effect on patient satisfaction of functional and demographic variables and satisfaction with the topographic outcome of the nose. Results: The effect of the topographic surgical results was evaluated on patient satisfaction. A correlation was determined between nasal topographic satisfaction and patient satisfaction (r:0.228 P = 0.009). In the subgroup analyses the only factor among the topographic factors which had an effect on satisfaction was the nasal tip (r:0.187 P = 0.024). Although 30.7% (n:39) of patients dissatisfied with the surgery reported that they were not satisfied with the nasal base results no correlation was determined between nasal base and satisfaction (r:0.091 P = 0.463). The strongest correlations of patient satisfaction were determined to be with subjective (NOSE score [r:0.530 P < 0.001]) and objective (high nasal resistance levels [r:0.579 P < 0.001]) functional results. Conclusion: The 2 basic components of postoperative satisfaction with SRP surgery were shown to be functional healing and cosmetic outcomes. Of the surgical topographic results nasal tip and nasal base were the parts determined to require the most attention.;2021
Aim: To examine the effect of the piezoelectric application used increasingly for osteotomy and correction of nasal dorsum in septorhinoplasty surgeries on early auditory functions. Methods: Our study was conducted after the decision of 10840098604.01.01- E. 9057 taken from Istanbul Medipol University Clinical Research Local Ethics Committee. This study was designed to be prospective randomized and controlled. Twenty patients between 18 and 50 years of age that piezoelectric technique was used in the study group and 10 patients in the same age range who underwent nasal surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery septoplasty lower concha radiofrequency and nasal valve surgery) for any reason in the control group were included in the study. Audiologic functions of the patients in both the groups were assessed by pure audio audiometry tympanometry and distortion product otoacoustic emission test before the surgery and 24 hours after the surgery. The data obtained were statistically compared using the SPSS 22.0 program and P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: Twenty patients (5 males 15 females) that piezoelectric (ultrasonics) technique was used during septorhinoplasty in the study group and 10 patients (5 males 5 females) in the control group were included in the study. In the study and the control groups preoperative and postoperative air/bone path thresholds at the right and left ears did not differ significantly (P>0.05) at 250 500 1000 2000 4000 6000 and 8000Hz. The results of distortion product otoacoustic emission results (signal/noise ratio) obtained postoperativelywere not statistically significant (P>0.05) with the results obtained preoperatively. Conclusion: The results of the study show that the piezoelectric technique used in septorhinoplasty does not cause a negative effect on auditory functions. This study is the first comparative study to investigate the effect of piezoelectric technique used in septorhinoplasty surgery on auditory functions. After further clinical studies performed with well- selected and large patient population the piezoelectric techniques can be a preferred technique during septorhinoplasty operations.;2018
Aim: To investigate patient-reported functional and aesthetic outcomes and psycho-social distress levels in patients undergoing rhinoplasty with regard to technique type and indications of surgery. Methods: A total of 90 patients (mean(SD) age: 27.4(6.5) years 64.4% females) undergoing rhinoplasty were included prospectively. Data of Nasal Symptom Obstruction Evaluation (NOSE) scale for the functional outcome the rhinoplasty outcome evaluation (ROE) scale for the esthetic outcome and the Derriford Appearance Scale (DAS-24) for psychosocial outcomes were recorded preoperatively and in the postoperative 1st 3rd and 6th month. Results: No significant difference was noted in ROE or NOSE scores with regard to technique (open vs. closed) type (primary vs. secondary) and indication (functional vs. cosmetic) of rhinoplasty during study visits. Open vs. closed surgery secondary vs. primary rhinoplasty and cosmetic vs. functional indication for rhinoplasty were associated with significantly higher DAS-24 scores at the preoperative visit (p < 0.001 for each) and postoperative 1st (p < 0.001 for each) and 3rd month (p < 0.001 p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively) visits. NOSE ROE and DAS-24 scores significantly decreased from the preoperative to the postoperative period and from 1st month to 3rd and 6th months of postoperative follow-up in all patients regardless of the rhinoplasty subgroup (p < 0.001 for each). Conclusion: In conclusion our findings revealed favorable postoperative functional and esthetic outcome and improved psycho-social distress in patients undergoing rhinoplasty with significantly improved NOSE ROE and DAS-24 scores after rhinoplasty during the entire 6-month follow-up regardless of the technique (open vs. closed) type (primary vs. revision) and indication (cosmetic vs. functional) of rhinoplasty. Closed rhinoplasty may be a more preferable method because of less psycho-social distress. (C) 2019 British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Aim:To investigate the relationship between body dysmorphic syndrome and self-esteem in rhinoplasty candidates.Results:A negative statistical correlation was evident between Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination-Self Report (BDDE-SR) scores. In terms of responses to the first Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ) question which focuses on general attitude toward body dysmorphic syndrome the average RSES YES score was significantly less than the NO score. No significant differences appeared between RSES scores and scores for the 4th subgroup of BDDQ questions (subgroups A B and C these questions explore how much time is spent daily on maintenance of bodily appearance). However significant differences appeared between scores for the 4th subgroup of BDDQ questions and BDDE-SR scores. The average BDD-SR score of subgroup A (less than 1hour spent on bodily maintenance) was significantly lower than those of group B (1-3hours) and group C (more than 3hours). However no significant differences appeared in average BDD-SR scores between subgroups B and C.Materials and Methods:In this prospective study 56 patients (31 females and 25 males) were evaluated preoperatively using the BDDQ the BDDE-SR and the RSES. Patients younger than 15 years and those with deformities caused by trauma were excluded.Conclusions:Rhinoplasty candidates had higher levels of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Although patients with low RSES scores were more likely to have BDD rhinoplasty candidates were not notably deficient in self-esteem. However in rhinoplasty candidates with low RSES scores the frequency of BDD was elevated. Therefore the authors suggest that rhinoplasty candidates with low RSES scores should be investigated carefully in terms of BDD.;2015
Aims: One of the most commonly performed operations in aesthetic plastic and reconstructive surgery is rhinoplasty the aim of which is to construct an altered nasal shape either for aesthetic or functional reasons. The lateral osteotomy is the most traumatic step of rhinoplasty and is generally difficult to perform. The lacrimal system can be damaged during the lateral osteotomy procedure. In this study we aimed to measure the distance between the lacrimal system and the lateral osteotomy line and to determine the safe and ideal osteotomy level which is very important in rhinoplasty procedures. We also evaluated the safe relationship of this osteotomy level with the lacrimal system by constructing a three-dimensional model. Materials and methods: The three-dimensional models were constructed on axial planes using paranasal computed tomographic (CT) images of 40 male and 40 female patients. The 'lateral osteotomy model' was designed in three dimensions. The axial CT images were obtained from the model. On the CT images the distance between the lateral osteotomy line and the lacrimal system was assessed by measuring three distances. The first was the distance between the anterior lacrimal crest and the lateral osteotomy line. The second was the distance from the midpoint between the anterior lacrimal crest and the inferior meatus to the lateral osteotomy line. The third was the distance between the opening of the lacrimal canal to the inferior meatus and the lateral osteotomy line. Results: No lacrimal system injury was seen on any of the models. The shortest distance was found between the anterior lacrimal crest and the lateral osteotomy line measured at 4.5 mm and 5.0 mm in the female and male patients respectively. Conclusion: Performing the lateral osteotomy meticulously while paying attention to remaining anterior to the medial canthal ligament will not lead to any lacrimal system injury.

Aims: We aimed to evaluate the results of simultaneous rhinoplasty and Abbe flap for the reconstruction of the secondary bilateral cleft and nasal deformity by means of a newly developed software-based method. Patients and Methods: A total of 16 patients with the bilateral cleft lip nasal deformity received Abbe flap and simultaneous open rhinoplasty between 2004 and 2010. The mean age of the patients was 21 years and the average follow-up time was 2.4 years. After the open rhinoplasty procedure the upper lip was reconstructed with the Abbe flap. Preoperative and postoperative photographs that had been taken laterally were evaluated by using Adobe Photoshop (R) CS4 and Adobe InDesign (R) software. The length of the columella and the relative changes of the most anterior point of the upper lip to the vertical plane tangent to the most anterior point of the lower lip were measured in pixels on standardized preoperative and postoperative images. The differences were calculated and compared as a percentage (%). Results: There was no flap loss and associated problems. The measurements of columellar length revealed an average increase of 51.8 +/- 11.3% while the relative change of the most anterior point of the upper lip revealed an average increase of 68.6 +/- 11.2%. Conclusion: The results of the treatment modality were successfully evaluated by a newly developed software-based method.

Alar base surgery is one of the most important and challenging steps of aesthetic rhinoplasty. While an ideally shaped alar base is the goal in a desired nose nearly all patients have asymmetric nostrils preoperatively. Ethnicity trauma cocaine use or previous rhinoplasties are some factors affecting the width and shape of the nasal base. After the conclusion of all planned rhinoplasty sequences and closure of the mid-columellarincision we mark the midline inferior to the columella at the nasolabial junction and use acaliper to measure an equal distance from the mid- columellar point to the alar creases on eachside and mark the medial points of the alar creases. Next we draw on the natural creasesbilaterally extending to 3 o'clock on the right side and 9 o 'clock on the left side as the limit ofthe lateral excisions to avoid scarring. We then gently depress the alae and alarfacial grooveswith the index finger and allow the formation of new creases superior to the original alarcreases in order to detect excess skin to remove. After marking the resection was performed with a no. 15 blade. The excision was closed using 6-0 Prolene sutures. We aimed to describe a simple technique for making asymmetric resections in which theapplication of pressure by a finger reveals excess skin in both nostril sill and nostril flareindependently for each alar base. With these asymmetric excisions from the right and left alar bases a more symmetric nostrils and nasal base can be achieved. Level of Evidence: Level IV therapeutic study.;2017
Alar cartilage malposition is a common anatomic variation in which the axis of the lateral crus lies cephalically and may be parallel to the cephalic septum. Malposition of the lateral crura may produce inward collapse of the alae that is observable on deep inspiration. The authors performed the alar rim flap technique to treat patients with alar malposition and assessed functional and aesthetic outcomes. Twelve patients who underwent primary open rhinoplasty with the alar rim flap technique were evaluated in a prospective study. A 2- or 3-mm caudal portion of the lateral crus was elevated from the underlying mucosa pulled caudally and extended with a cartilage graft. This extension of the alar rim flap was placed through the pyriform aperture for additional support. Patients completed pre- and postoperative questionnaires addressing nasal obstruction and underwent paranasal computed tomography. Patients received follow-up for an average of 16 months (range 8-27 months). Patients with alar cartilage malposition and external valve insufficiency experienced aesthetic and functional improvements after rhinoplasty with the alar rim flap technique. No patients developed alar rim collapse or flap displacement. The alar rim flap technique is effective for the correction of malpositioned lateral crura and external valve insufficiency. Because this technique does not damage the scroll area disruption of the internal valve area is avoided.;2015
All suspected congenital abnormalities of the nose require further evaluation. The nasal dermoid sinus cyst (NDSC) is one of the many midline nasal masses that often pose diagnostic and treatment dilemmas for the plastic and reconstructive surgeon. NDSCs are distinct from other facial dermoids in their potential for involving deeper contiguous structures and intracranial extension. Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to avoid craniofacial skeletal deformation cyst rupture and infection that could cause cutaneous ocular or intracranial complications. A comprehensive discussion of the embryogenesis pathogenesis diagnosis and surgical management of the NDSC is presented to delineate the role of open rhinoplasty in optimizing the management of this congenital nasal deformity.;2001
Alloplastic materials are frequently used in facial plastic surgeries such as rhinoplasty and nasal reconstruction. Unfortunately the ideal alloplastic material has not been found. This experimental study evaluates the tissue response and durability of five novel polymers developed as an alloplastic material. In this experimental study involving a tertiary university hospital six subcuticular pockets were formed at the back of 10 rabbits for the implantation of each polymer and sham group. Each pocket was excised with its adjacent tissue after three months and collected for histopathological examination. Semi-quantitative examination including neovascularisation inflammation fibrosis abscess formation multinucleated foreign body giant cells was performed and integrity of polymer was evaluated. A statistical comparison was performed. No statically significant difference was detected in neovascularisation inflammation fibrosis abscess formation and multinucleated foreign body giant cells when a paired comparison between sham and polymer II II and IV groups was performed individually. Nevertheless the degree of fibrosis was less than sham group in polymer I (p = .027) and V (p = .018) although the other variables were almost similar. The integrity of polymers II (9 intact 1 fragmented) and IV (8 intact 2 absent) was better than the other polymers. These novel synthetic polymers could be considered as good candidates for clinical applicability. All polymers provided satisfactory results in terms of tissue response however fibrovascular integration was higher in polymers II II and IV. In addition the durability of polymer II and IV was better than the others.;2016
Although costal cartilage autograft has versatile usage harvesting the graft is an invasive procedure with potential risks for complications. Therefore it is important to make every effort to minimize these risks. Moreover sculpting costal cartilage to the desired shape is challenging and time-consuming because of the natural rigidity. This study aimed to evaluate cases of costal cartilage harvest in terms of the most important donor site complications and to present a novel practical and inexpensive technique to overcome the challenges in costal cartilage harvesting and contouring. A retrospective review of patient records was made of 103 patients who underwent costal cartilage harvest by the senior author. Costal cartilage harvest was applied using either the thermal chondroplasty technique or the conventional technique on patients undergoing revision rhinoplasty surgery. The number of complications and operation times were compared between the 2 techniques. A cohort of 47 patients (30 males 17 females mean age 34.5 years [range 28-48 years]) underwent costal cartilage harvest using the thermal chondroplasty technique and a cohort of 56 patients (31 males 25 females mean age 36 years [range 28-52 years]) underwent costal cartilage harvest with the conventional technique. The mean operation time for the costal cartilage harvest decreased by 7.5 minutes and the total operation time decreased by 17 minutes with the use of the thermal chondroplasty technique compared to the conventional technique (P < 0.05). Complications of 2 pneumothorax and 1 hematoma developed in the conventional technique group and no complications were seen in the thermal chondroplasty group. The results of this study suggest that the thermal chondroplasty technique is safer and time-saving compared to the conventional technique.;2020
Although the psychological aspect of the rhinoplasty operation has been a subject of interest for a long time with the exception of a few studies sociological factors have been almost totally ignored. In this prospective study the personality characteristics and socioeconomic backgrounds of 216 rhinoplasty patients were evaluated. Between 1994 and 2000 a questionnaire and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) were given preoperatively to 157 females and 59 males. The MMPI was also given to age-matched people as a control. Six months after surgery patients were called on the telephone and asked to rate their satisfaction. According to questionnaire a great majority of the rhinoplasty patients were young unmarried women with high education levels. In the rhinoplasty group one or more scales of the inventory were not in the normal ranges in 45% of the patients whereas this proportion in the control group was 28% (p < 0.01). When MMPI results are considered female patients of this study could be described as egocentric childish highly active impulsive competitive reactive perfectionistic about themselves talkative and emotionally superficial. Male patients could be described as rigid stubborn over-sensitive suspicious perfectionistic pessimistic over-reactive and having somatizations. Tension and anxiety with feelings of inferiority were found to be characteristics of the male patients. The satisfaction rate after six months was reported as 72%. There was no significant correlation between MMPI results and demographic variables nor satisfaction rate. In conclusion the rhinoplasty patients in our study are young people at the very beginning of their careers. It could be that their personalities and socioeconomic backgrounds combine to make aesthetic surgery rewarding enough both socially and personally to encourage them to follow through.;2003
Although various techniques have been described for treatment of severe nose deformities these problems have high revision rates. Conventional nasal septal surgery may not be adequate for all cases. A 21-year-old male patient with nose deformity underwent a nasal surgery. Patient had both functional and aesthetic nasal problems. Rigid fibular bone graft was used for corrective nasal surgery. Duration of the operation was three hours. Patient recovered without problems. Aesthetic and functional results of the operation were acceptable. Fibular bone graft may offer a long lasting support in treatment of severe nose deformity.;2017
Among aesthetic surgery procedures rhinoplasty is one of the most common. Preoperative simulations have become increasingly commonplace through the recent years along with a controversy regarding their use. Although capable of building a solid rapport between the surgeon and the patient by visualizing the end result it can also prove to be a liability for a surgeon who is not confident about delivering the result which has been put on screen. The objective of this study is to evaluate the outlook of the surgeons and patients on preoperative simulations. Plastic surgeons who perform rhinoplasty and individuals who consider rhinoplasty were surveyed via an online questionnaire system. Their opinions about the practice of simulation were questioned and they were asked to distinguish between simulated and actual postoperative results. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. Major factors influencing the decision-making process of patients were the availability of preoperative simulation being shown appealing results of the surgeon's previous work and a personal reference from a patient with an appealing result. Within the health care professionals it has been observed that experienced surgeons are more confident about using simulations while inexperienced ones are daunted by being bound with a visual contract (p < 0.05). However it has been noted that the preference of withholding the simulation or providing a copy to the patient was similar in all experience levels (p > 0.05). In conclusion our findings suggest that the patients' self-consciousness regarding preoperative simulations seem to grow faster than the surgeons' confidence in their use. Level of evidence is Level V.;2017
An adequate nasal tip projection is of the utmost importance for good nasal aesthetics. Conventional rhinoplasty procedures are not adequate for achieving nasal tip projection in ''tips with inadequate projection'' (TIP). This article describes our technique of using an umbrella-shaped cartilage graft to the tip. The graft is carved from caudal septal and alar cartilages. The results and advantages of the technique are discussed.;1993
An experimental model was used for the comparative evaluation of autogeneous and homogeneous nasal dorsal onlay cartilage grafts. This study was conducted on 18 adult white New Zealand male rabbits. Nasal septal cartilage (NSC) sliced nasal septal cartilage (SNSC) and auricular cartilage (AC) grafts were prepared in autogeneous and homogeneous forms and placed into the subcutaneous pockets of the nasal dorsum of rabbits. After a period of 3 months the animals were painlessly killed and each site was analyzed histologically for inflammation neovascularization fibrosis and resorption. Inflammation fibrosis and neovascularization were found to be significantly more extensive in the homogeneous graft groups and autogeneous SNSC group 3 months after implantation. Resorption was significantly high in both homogeneous and autogeneous AC groups and significantly low in the autogeneous and homogeneous SNSC groups. There was no significant difference between the homogeneous and autogeneous grafts in terms of resorption rates. In conclusion the results of this experimental study demonstrate that resorption was lesser than expected in the sliced cartilage graft and that homologous cartilage graft applications had activity and reliability similar to that of autogenous cartilage grafts.;2015
Anterior septal height is an important determinant of nasal tip projection. Accordingly the anterior septal extension technique has proven itself to be a powerful tool for achieving long-lasting nasal tip projection in rhinoplasty. However anterior septal extension does not protect against postoperative loss of nasal tip rotation unless an additional suspension strategy is used. A tip-suspending transfixion suture is the authors' strategy for supporting nasal tip rotation whenever an anterior septal extension technique is performed. Of 156 rhinoplasties performed by the authors between 2010 and 2012 a cohort of 22 droopy-tip rhinoplasties was extracted in which the described technique was used. The patients in this cohort were included in a retrospective nasal tip projection and rotation analysis. The nasolabial angle (NLA) and Goode ratio measurements were compared between preoperative 3-week postoperative and 1-year postoperative profile-view photographs. The NLA and the Goode ratio measurements were significantly higher in the 3-week postoperative group than in the preoperative group indicating an effective gain in both tip projection and rotation. The NLA and the Goode ratio measurements did not differ statistically between the postoperative 3-week and postoperative 1-year groups indicating long-term maintenance of nasal tip position. A tip-suspending transfixion suture is an easy method for securing nasal tip rotation when used in conjunction with an anterior septal extension.

Asian noses are mainly characterized by a low nasal dorsum a short nose and an underprojected nasal tip due to underdeveloped (short and weak) alar cartilages. The goals of the surgery are to increase the tip projection elongate the nose and augment the dorsum. In Asian noses the structural approach helps strengthen the weak cartilages and add definition to the nasal tip. There are various methods to increase tip projection and definition. Columellar strut caudal septal extension graft tip grafts and lateral crural grafts in order to elongate the upper legs of the nasal tip tripod can be used. The method described in this article seems a useful solution in Asian rhinoplasty patients who do not want to use rib cartilage. The Skiff Graft functions similar to caudal septal extension graft with its elongation and raise effect at the caudal septum. However in cases which need significant increase in tip projection and nose elongation this method may be insufficient. In such cases stronger structural grafts prepared from rib cartilage will give a better tip definition and more predictable outcome.;2017
Augmentation mentoplasty is a cosmetic surgical procedure to correct chin retrusion or microgenia which usually requires placement of an alloplastic material over the pogonion and which results in increased chin projection and a more aesthetically balanced facial profile. Polypropylene mesh is easy to purchase widely available in a general hospital and most commonly used by general surgeons. In this series of 192 patients we wanted to demonstrate our simple mentoplasty technique using prolene mesh that can easily be combined with a rhinoplasty procedure with possible causes of infection and the rationale for using prolene mesh in such procedures.;2011
Autogenous fascia including the temporalis fascia has a particular role in rhinoplasty as radix and dorsal onlay grafts. The main purpose of this study is to achieve desired appearance of facial harmony using either a complete or partial sheet of deep temporal fascia as a radix graft in the patients with required permanent radix augmentation. This is a prospective study of 15 patients who referred to Gandi Day Clinic Tehran Iran between 2005 and 2006 and underwent rhinoplasty including nasal radix augmentation using deep temporalis fascia through external rhinoplasty approach. The patients with hump noses had low radix and required radix augmentation. Full sheet facial graft was used in 13 patients. Partial sheet facial graft was used in two patients. As a donor site problem minor hematoma was observed in one patient. Temporary hair loss in incision line was another problem which were seen in five. As for the recipient site no infection persistent erythema of nasal skin extrusion visibility displacement of graft materials or irregularity of graft contour were observed postoperatively. Resorption rate was approximately 30% for grafted fascia. Using fascia grafts in radix point the revision rate was minimal. In order to augment the radix if 4 mm augmentation is needed it should be considered that full sheet fascia graft alone would be insufficient. If more than 4 mm of augmentation is needed 30% overcorrection would manage well the permanent radix augmentation without any problem.;2011
Background Algorithms define a sequence to approaching a subject. This study represents a scoping review seeking to define the role of surgical algorithms in rhinoplasty. Methods A scoping review was conducted. Pubmed/MEDLINE Web of Science and Google Scholar as well as a citation searching was performed to find eligible studies for review. Eligibility criteria included studies published in English human subjects >= 15 years old and all included surgical algorithms were for primary cosmetic rhinoplasty. Results In total 514 studies included the key search terms. Thirty-nine studies were evaluated for data extraction. The majority of the algorithms were from USA-based publications (22/39). Flow-chart type algorithm was used in 23 and text-based algorithms in 15 of the 39 studies. Algorithms related to tip shape and/or position were most frequent (19/39) followed by those for crooked nose and dorsal height. Only 7 of the algorithms described outcomes for utilizing the algorithm. Conclusions Very few surgical algorithms have been published for cosmetic rhinoplasty. A minority of these studies have published outcomes. This study provides a description and summary of these algorithms and also shows that future studies could be done to further develop surgical algorithms for rhinoplasty and evaluate outcomes.;2021
Background Although casts or external splint materials are commonly applied on the external nose after rhinoplasty their beneficial effects have not been previously demonstrated in controlled studies. Methods A total of 40 adult patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty were included in this prospective study. The patients were randomized into 2 groups to use an external splint or not after surgery. Only surgical taping was applied to the nasal dorsum of the patients for whom external splints were not used. The periorbital edema and ecchymosis levels of the patients were recorded on the second and seventh days after surgery. Moreover all patients had a computed tomography scan at the third postoperative week to measure the distance between the beginning of the osteotomy line on the right and left sides and the midline. Results On the second and seventh postoperative days the levels of periorbital edema and ecchymosis were significantly lower in the patients with taping than in the patients with splints (P < 0.05 for each). No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of the difference in the distance between the beginning of the osteotomy line on the right and left sides to the midline between the group with external splints and that with tape (P = 0.661). Conclusions External splinting may not be used in cases where osteotomy is not performed or in patients where the osteotomies are sufficiently stable. Thus the disadvantages of external splinting are avoided and at the same time periorbital edema and ecchymosis are less common.;2021
Background Although columellar strut grafts (CSGs) are considered among the fundamental steps for providing nasal tip support a downward rotation of the nasal tip in patients with strut grafts can still be encountered. Patient-related factors such as nasal skin thickness can allow the plastic surgeon to anticipate certain drawbacks that can be encountered in the healing phase but patient-based differences of nasal cartilage and the resulting impact have yet to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the biomechanical properties of CSGs on late postoperative nasal tip position and support. Methods The study was undertaken with the participation of 20 patients undergoing closed-technique primary rhinoplasty with CSGs. Each cartilage specimen was biomechanically analyzed to calculate the modulus of elasticity. Preoperative and postoperative images were obtained to determine nasal tip position and rotation with quantitative measurements. Postoperative 3- and 12-month measurements were evaluated according to their relationship with the elasticity modulus of the utilized cartilages. Results The evaluation demonstrated that the elasticity modulus can impact the long-term support of the nasolabial angle in which an increase in the coefficient of elasticity can result in a decrease in long-term nasal tip support. Conclusion The results of the study reveal a new objective variable that can impact nasal tip dynamics and patient-related differences following rhinoplasty. This study not only brings forth a different perspective in the evaluation of nasal tip dynamics but can also provide data for determining ideal values for cartilage prefabrication.;2019
Background and Objective: Different accesses have been used to perform lateral osteotomies in rhinoplasty. All of them have some disadvantages. The aim of this paper was to report a new access to overcome drawbacks of the other techniques in lateral osteotomy during open rhinoplasty. Methods: An anatomical study was designed to search possibility of intranasal extramucosal access (open sky access) for the lateral osteotomy in open rhinoplasty. It was performed directly on the lateral wall of piriform aperture and then possible advantages of this technique were investigated. Five fixed cadavers were used for this purpose. No drawbacks were observed during procedure in cadavers. Then the same procedure was performed in 23 consecutive rhinoplasty patients. Nineteen operations were primary and 4 operations were secondary. Median oblique osteotomies were added to the procedure in all patients. The mean follow-up was 17 months. Results: Intranasal extramucosal access during lateral osteotomy was easily performed in all patients. Hemorrhage due to angular vessel injury was not occurred during intraoperative period. Edema and ecchymosis was minimal. Intranasal examination did not show any sign for nasal mucosal tearing in all patients. Residual bone spurs or bone irregularities were not observed in any patients. Conclusion: Intranasal extramucosal access that produces precise predictable and reproducible aesthetic and functional results could also provide better exposure during lateral osteotomy. Additionally open sky access minimizes scars because it does not need additional incisions on the skin and mucosa. Protection of the internal periosteum of the nasal bones may be the main advantages of this technique.;2016
Background and objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine an alpha(2)- adrenoceptor agonist on intraoperative bleeding anaesthetic drug requirement and postoperative pain. Methods: Forty patients scheduled for elective tympanoplasty and septorhinoplasty operations under general anaesthesia were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either a dexmedetomidine 1 mu g kg(-1) bolus 10 min before induction of anaesthesia plus 0.5 mu g kg(-1) h(-1) infusions during maintenance or placebo. Mean arterial pressure was maintained between 60 and 80 mmHg. Perioperative mean arterial pressure heart rate time to extubation and time to awakening were recorded. Bleeding during surgery was assessed by the surgeon blinded to the study drugs both intraoperatively and postoperatively as a final personal opinion about the whole surgical process. Results: The heart rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly lower during induction operation and extubation in the dexmedetomidine group (P < 0.05). Blood losses were lower in the dexmedetomidine group (P < 0.05). Propofol dose required for induction and fentanyl and isoflurane consumption were significantly reduced in the dexmedetomidine group (P < 0.05). The total amounts of nitroglycerin and meperidine used were higher in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine decreased bleeding postoperative analgesic requirements and intraoperative anaesthetic requirements and was associated with more stable haemodynamic responses to anaesthesia. We conclude that dexmedetomidine is a useful adjuvant to decrease bleeding when a bloodless surgical field is requested.;2007
Background and Objectives: Rhinoplasty is a frequently performed surgical procedure. Besides an aesthetically successful outcome determination of additional nasal pathologies and making a simultaneous intervention on these are also essential for a successful functional outcome. This study aims to determine the rates of accompanying nasal pathologies in patients undergoing rhinoplasty and reveals whether any additional interventions were performed during operation. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 496 Caucasian Turkish patients who underwent rhinoplasty at the Plastic Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery and Otorhinolaryngology clinics of our research hospital between 2015 and 2018 were retrospectively examined. Among them the results of 271 patients who had preoperative paranasal computerized tomography scans were evaluated. Results: The mean age of the 271 patients was 28.8 years (Range: 17-55). Among them 156 (57%) were female and 115 (42%) were male. The numbers of patients with septal deviation inferior concha hypertrophy unilateral/bilateral concha bullosa nasal polyp mucosal thickening and retention cysts at the Otorhinolaryngology clinic were found to be 126 (82%) 77 (50%) 20 (13%) 10 (6.5%) 77 (50%) and 41 (27%) respectively and these numbers were respectively 97 (82%) 60 (51%) 11 (9.3%) 2 (1.7%) 57 (48%) and 17 (14%) at the Plastic Reconstructive a Aesthetic Surgery clinic. A statistically significant difference was found in terms of the presence of retention cysts between the clinics (95% CI -0.11% to 0.16% P=.014 P<.005) and the presence of retention cysts was significantly higher at the Otorhinolaryngology clinic. A total of 18 (12%) patients were found to have additional surgical interventions. Conclusions: This study showed that additional nasal pathologies were frequently present in patients undergoing rhinoplasty operations. Hence for a successful operation it is essential to have Otorhinolaryngology consultation and detect accompanying pathologies in rhinoplasty cases which will be performed by Plastic Reconstructive a Aesthetic Surgery specialists.

Background Correction of a crooked or deviated nose is a complex cosmetic and functional problem as well as a big challenge for the rhinoplasty surgeon. Although corrections using a wide range of surgical techniques to straighten the nose and maximize nasal function have been proposed recurrence is very common because of cartilage memory and scar contracture. Therefore to prevent recurrence and maintain the correction of the septum a permanent support that is stable and strong with the ability to maintain its given shape after placement on one or both sides of the septum is needed. Methods The author used a nasal bone graft. In this study the concept and technique for correction of the crooked nose and the author's experience using it are presented. Results This graft material was used for 12 patients with crooked noses (8 with C-type and 4 with S-type noses). During a mean follow-up period of 20 months (range 12-36 months) there were no complications recurrences or extrusions. Functional evaluations were performed using a visual analog scale before surgery and 6 months after surgery. Patients were asked to score their nasal breathing on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. The mean preoperative value was 17.67% +/- 1.22% (range 15-25%) and the postoperative value was 89.88% +/- 1.24% (range 85-95%). Use of nasal bone grafts as the spreader graft is a safe effective reliable and permanent method for correction of the crooked nose. The author advises using this technique with nasal bone grafts for functional recovery and increased strength against further trauma or forces of scar contracture. This technique may prevent recurrence attributable to cartilage memory.;2008
Background Currently saddle nose deformity is one of the most challenging deformities in all of rhinoplasty surgery. Recent advances in aesthetic reconstructive surgical techniques warrant discussion of this subject. Methods A review of saddle nose cases from January 2003 to February 2007 showed that the existence of an important subgroup exists designated as septal saddle nose deformity. The pathophysiology was weakening or loss of septal support bone or both but not the classic dorsal overresection. A prospective study of 33 consecutive cases was completed with emphasis on analysis classification and treatment. Results Prior attempts at classification have emphasized cause. The author's study indicated that the majority of cases had multiple causes the most common being trauma followed by septorhinoplasty (immediately or later) as opposed to simple fracture reduction. In addition 23 of 33 cases were true secondary saddle nose deformities. Classification was divided into types. Different methods of composite reconstruction were devised according to each case and grade which allows construction of a deep structural foundation layer that then is superimposed with an aesthetic layer. Conclusions Septal saddle nose still is an important entity that must be recognized and treated especially when it is progressive. Composite reconstruction offers a unique solution to saddle nose deformity because it is a flexible method of restoring structural support and aesthetic contour.;2008
BACKGROUND Edema persists for months after rhinoplasty. Numerous modalities have been described to counteract postoperative edema. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of postrhinoplasty taping (PRT) on nasal edema and nasal draping. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized clinical trial 57 patients undergoing rhinoplasty at a tertiary reference center from August 1 2014 to January 31 2015 were assigned to a control group or to 2- or 4-week PRT groups. Baseline nasal thickness was measured with ultrasonography at the nasion rhinion supratip and tip and mean nasal skin thickness (MNST) was calculated. Participants in each group were categorized by the baseline MNST measurement from the lowest to greatest MNST those in the upper half were categorized as having thick skin those in the lower half thin skin. The control group underwent no PRT after the removal of external packing. Patients in the 2- and 4-week PRT groups received additional taping during the allocated time. Data were collected from August 1 2014 to June 31 2015. Follow-up was completed on June 31 2015 and data were analyzed from July 1 to August 1 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Postoperative measurements of MNSTwere performed at the end of weeks 1 3 and 5 and month 6. RESULTS Of the 57 total patients (33 male and 24 female patients mean [SD] age 30.0 [11.7] years) 17 were in the 2-week PRT group 20 the 4-week PRT group and 20 the control group. Compared with the control group 4-week PRT had a significant effect on the supratip (P = .001). Comparisons of MNST with the control group revealed significant effects of 2-week (P = .02) and 4-week (P = .007) PRT. The effect on the tip was not significant (P = .052). Postrhinoplasty taping had no effect in thin-skinned patients. Comparison among thick-skinned patients revealed a significant effect on the MNST (P = .01) and the rhinion (P = .02) but not the tip (P = .06) and supratip (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Postrhinoplasty taping helps the skin envelope to compress to the underlying framework and decrease postoperative edema. The procedure can be used particularly in thick-skinned patients in whom skin draping and nasal refinement is crucial to the surgical outcome.;2016
Background Emergence agitation (EA) defined as restlessness disorientation excitation and/or inconsolable crying is a common phenomenon during early recovery from general anesthesia. In this study we aimed to determine the (1) EA incidence after rhinoplasty operations in adults (2) the effects of ketamine administered at sub-anesthetic doses just 20 min before the end of the surgery in rhinoplasty operations on agitation level postoperative pain side effects and complications and (3) to determine the risk factors for EA in adults after rhinoplasty. Materials and Methods Totally 140 patients scheduled to undergo elective rhinoplasty were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients were equally and randomly divided into two groups: saline group (control group) (n = 70) and ketamine group (n = 70). Twenty minutes before surgery completion 1 ml saline was administered via the intravenous (i.v.) route to the saline group while 0.5 mg/kg ketamine was administered via i.v. patients in the ketamine group. The emergence agitation level of the patients was evaluated using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale just after extubation and in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). For postoperative pain evaluation the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was scored (from 0 to 10) every 10 min until the patients were discharged from PACU. Results EA incidence in the control group was as high as 54.3% while in the ketamine group it was 8.6% just after extubation (p < 0.001). In the PACU EA incidence was 28.6% in the control group while none of the patients had EA in the PACU in the ketamine group (p < 0.001). Male gender severe pain (NRS >= 5) and smoking were defined as significant risk factors for EA both after extubation and during follow-ups in the PACU (p < 0.001). Conclusions Emergence agitation after rhinoplasty is a common complication likely disturbing operative outcomes in adults. Ketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is highly effective in preventing EA. Further larger-scale prospective studies are warranted to determine preventive measures for EA development in rhinoplasty.;2018
Background Following open rhinoplasty a postoperative scar at the columellar incision line is a common morbidity. The aim of this study is to compare absorbable and nonabsorbable suture materials which had been used for closing the transcolumellar incision in the aspect of risk of postoperative infection wound healing postoperative columellar scar and patient satisfaction. Method A prospective randomized single-blind study was conducted between May 2017 and February 2018. Sixty-four rhinoplasty patients were randomly assigned to absorbable (n = 32) or nonabsorbable (n = 32) groups. The columellar incision was closed with 7 full-thickness skin sutures. Either nonabsorbable 6/0 polypropylene (Group 1) or absorbable 6/0 polyglytone 6211 (Group 2) sutures were placed at the columellar incisions. Polypropylene sutures were removed at the 7th postoperative day. A Mann-WhitneyUtest and Monte Carlo were used for statistical comparison. Photographs of the patients at the postoperative third month (Fig. 2) were evaluated and scored in terms of scarring pigmentation notching level differences in the incision area by two different otorhinolaryngologists who did not know the randomization. Suture removing discomfort was assessed with visual analogue scale scores. A satisfaction survey was filled out by all the patients completing their third month after the operation. Results According to the results of both otorhinolaryngologists there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of pigmentation level difference notching overall appearance and total score (p = 0.920p = 0.498 respectively). The mean score on the Wong-Baker scale was 3.19 +/- 1.67 in group 1. In the Satisfaction Survey the average score of the group 1 was 6.90 +/- 3.24 while the mean score of the group 2 was 7.062 +/- 2.77. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.715). Conclusions Suturing inverted V transcolumellar incisions with rapid resorbable sutures caused significantly less discomfort but no difference in scarring compared to nonresorbable sutures as evaluated by patients and observers.;2020
Background Graft use is inevitable in some primary and secondary rhinoplasty cases with cartilage or bone deficiency. Although rib graft is one of the best graft sources it has several disadvantages. The purpose of this study is to minimize the risks of using rib grafts. Material and Methods Between 2018 and 2020 a total of 21 patients aged between 25 and 55 have undergone revision rhinoplasty under general anesthesia with a split cartilage graft of central origin. A 3-4-mm-thick bridge was left at the superior and inferior edges of the donor area and the graft was harvested from the central region without disrupting the costal integrity. A special retractor was placed between the perichondrium and the rib at the posterior of the costa to prevent damage to the pleura while cutting the rib. The previously marked grafts were cut in the donor area and harvested ready for use. The harvested grafts were used as spreader strut alar rim and nasal valve grafts. Results None of the patients had complications due to rib graft harvesting. After the operation pain in the donor region and analgesic requirement of these patients were less compared to the patients with full-layer grafts. Conclusions The grafts taken from the center of the costa without breaking its integrity seem quite suitable for revision rhinoplasty surgeries. This technique prevents various morbidities and enables patients to have a more comfortable postoperative period.;2021
Background In lower lateral cartilage (LLC) surgery cephalic trimming poses risks for the collapse of the internal and external nasal valves pinched nose and drooping deformity. The cephalic lateral crural advancement (CLCA) technique presented herein was aimed at using a flap to increase nasal tip rotation and support the lateral crus in addition to the internal and external nasal valves by avoiding grafts without performing excision. Methods This study included 32 patients (18 female and 14 male) and the follow-up period for patients having undergone primer open rhinoplasty was 12 months. The LLC was elevated from the vestibular skin using the CLCA flap. A cephalic incision was performed without cephalic trimming. Two independent flaps were formed while preserving the scroll ligament complex. The CLCA flap was advanced onto the lower lateral crus while leaving the scroll area intact. The obtained data were analyzed retrospectively. Results The mean age of the patients was 31.6 years (range 20-51 years). The Rhinoplasty Outcome Examination scores after 12 months varied from 90 to100 points and 93% of patients reported perfect satisfaction. At a 1-year follow-up the patients' nasal patency (visual analogue scale) rose from 4.56 +/- 1.53 (out of 10) to 9.0 +/- 0.65 (P< 0.001). Conclusions The CLCA flap led to better nasal tip definition by protecting the scroll area increasing tip rotation and supporting the internal and external nasal valves without cephalic excision.;2021
Background In rhinoplasty many techniques are used to increase the permanence of the planned final shape of the nose. Cartilage grafts can be diced and applied directly to the nasal dorsum or by wrapping with a material. We aim to show that mixing and using diced cartilage grafts with fat grafts can contribute to the viability of cartilage grafts by comparing our early postoperative and long-term results. Materials and Methods A total of 228 cases were analyzed. Postoperative 1-month 6-month and 1.5-year photographs of the patients were compared and the places that descended on the nasal dorsum were measured. In addition dorsal height was measured and compared. Preoperative and postoperative first-year rhinoplasty outcome evaluation scales were performed. Specimens from 6 patients were examined histopathologically. Results After the first month the mean regression in the dorsum was measured as 1.4 mm. The decrease in dorsal height between 1 month and 6 months was significantly greater than the decrease between 6 months and late periods. According to the rhinoplasty outcome evaluation (ROE) scale the average preoperative score of the patients was 45 while the mean postoperative score was 81.5. The viability of chondrocyte cells was measured as 85-90% histopathologically. Conclusion This approach has been evaluated as an application that satisfies both the surgeon and the patient due to the advantages of fat grafts such as preventing the cartilage and osteotomy lines from being palpated in thin-skinned patients holding the diced cartilage grafts together by acting as a glue increasing the viability of cartilage grafts.;2021
Background In this study demographic data the incidence among rhinoplasty cases and treatment approaches of cases diagnosed with congenital ONS in our clinic were discussed. Methods Facial nerve examinations of 728 patients who applied to our plastic surgery outpatient clinic seeking primary rhinoplasty for cosmetic reasons between January 2015 and January 2019 and nine cases with ONS were included in the study. Family history sex age unilateral or bilateral involvement accompanying muscles movement amplitude accompanying anomalies and treatment modalities of the subjects were documented. Results Among 728 primary rhinoplasty cases who admitted to our clinic nine patients were diagnosed with ONS. Of these rhinoplasty patients 76% were female (n 553) and 24% were male (n 175). In the study the rate of ONS was found to be 0.12% among the patients seeking rhinoplasty. The mean age of the cases was 28.12 years (range 19-47). All patients were female. Eight patients had right-sided ONS and in one patient it was located on the left side. No family histories or coexisting anomalies accompanied ONS in any of the patients. The CNMm accompanying the contraction of the OOm muscle was observed during the eye blink in seven cases dilator naris anterior muscle (DNAm) in one case and transverse part of nasalis muscle (TNm) in another case. Conclusions In the light of the data obtained from this study we conclude that ONS is fairly common among rhinoplasty cases and in order to prevent misunderstandings and medico-legal problems it is essential to recognize this condition before undertaking rhinoplasty blepharoplasty or any other surgical procedure. Level of evidence: Level V diagnostic study.;2020
Background Lower face dimensions have a great impact on the perception of nasal beauty. For this reason evaluation of the lower face is important in patients applied for rhinoplasty. In this study we aimed to describe the values of lower face anthropometric measurements in Turkish patients who applied for rhinoplasty and to compare these values with measurements of individuals who are pleased with their nasal appearance. Methods A Turkish population of 252 rhinoplasty-negative individuals and 171 rhinoplasty patients were included in this study as the control and rhinoplasty groups. Using the preoperative photographs of the facial profile seven vertical measurements were taken and seven indices were used to determine the relationships between measurements of the lower face. Results In the rhinoplasty group most vertical profile measurements were greater in males. The only variables with no gender differences were lower and upper vermilion heights. Only variables with a significant difference between two groups were upper lip vermilion height in females and upper lip height in males. Conclusions This study provides objective reference material for the evaluation of the lower face when planning for rhinoplasty. Besides the differences found between two groups emphasize the importance of the nasolabial region when planning for rhinoplasty.;2015
Background Management of the nasal dorsum is an important part of rhinoplasty. Hump removal results in the destruction of the internal valve and keystone area which are reconstructed with either spreader flaps or grafts for aesthetic and functional reasons. Objectives The goal of this work was to present the dorsal roof technique for both dorsum reduction and narrowing during rhinoplasty. Methods Fifty-two patients (35 females 17 males) underwent septorhinoplasty surgery with the dorsal roof technique. During the follow-up period all patients were photographed in the standard views. Photos were examined by two independent plastic surgeons. The pyramidal angles of the patients were measured with a protractor preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. A rhinoplasty outcomes evaluation questionnaire was administered to all patients at the 1-year follow-up visit. Functional improvement was assessed utilizing self-evaluated nasal patency. The chi-square test was employed for statistical analyses. Data were evaluated retrospectively. Results Of the 52 patients 44 completed the 1-year follow-up period and rhinoplasty outcomes evaluation questionnaire. During the follow-up period no irregularity or residual hump was detected. Significant narrowing was achieved (P < 0.001). High patient satisfaction was achieved and no functional or aesthetic complications were encountered. Conclusions Whenever possible the dorsal roof technique is preferred to resection or camouflage the dorsum. This technique allows treatment of the wide dorsum wide nasal base and dorsal hump without resection thus maintaining the integrity of the dorsal bone-cartilage complex.;2020
Background Modern techniques of osteotomy have evolved to take into account the effects of bony repositioning on functional as well as aesthetic outcomes. Although a variety of methods have been described to appropriately mobilize and reposition the bony nasal vault there is still no single procedure that can successfully manage nasal bones in its entirety. Material and Methods We present the bone chisel scraping osteoectomy technique for lateral and medial osteotomies with the aim of managing nasal bone deformities that can overcome diverse shortcomings of the conventional methods. The new operative method was performed in 184 nasal bone osteoectomies (92 patients 22 men and 70 women) ranging in age from 18 to 69 years (mean age 38 years). The functional results were evaluated postoperatively by the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale a brief and easy to complete validated questionnaire with a final score grading from 0 to 100 at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Results With this new approach no functional problems were reported. The mean Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale score was 5.3 at 3 months and 1.9 at 6 months. Only 1 primary case was reoperated for open roof deformity. Comparing the results with the previous osteotomy series of the senior author osteoectomy and osteotomy revision rates for inadequate bone mobilization were similar but osteoectomy technique did not create functional problems as the osteotomy technique did. Conclusions Although this technique prolongs the operating time it could offer considerable advantages in comparison with the classical techniques using osteotomies and hammer. This is because it offers a greater respect to the nasal respiratory function and gives a much better nasal base width control resulting in more predictable results less trauma and therefore a lower risk of postoperative complications.;2016
Background Musculus depressor septi nasi and its tendon the dermocartilaginous ligament play an important role in external nasal valve and nasal respiration. If the ligament is cut during septorhinoplasty operations nasal functions of the nose and facial expressions are affected. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the role of M. depressor septi nasi in nasal respiration at open rhinoplasty operations using rhinomanometry and electromyography. Methods The study included 29 patients who had only external nasal deformity (nasal hump deformity). All patients underwent open rhinoplasty. The dermocartilaginous ligament of the patients in the study group (DCL + group) was repaired but not in the control group (DCL - group). Rhinomanometry and electromyography were applied to all patients preoperatively and postoperatively. Results In the DCL - group right and left nasal airflow values were significantly lower in post-op (562.92 cm(3)/s and 548.57 cm(3)/s) whereas right left and total nasal resistances were significantly lower in pre-op (0.28 Pa/cm(3)/s 0.22 Pa/cm(3)/s and 0.11 Pa/cm(3)/s). Statistically significant differences were not found between rhinomanometric measurements in pre-op and post-op values of the DCL + group. Post-op right left and mean values of M. depressor septi nasi amplitude in the DCL + group (2.05 mV 2.0 mV 2.02 mV) were significantly higher than those in the DCL - group (1.52 mV 1.61 mV 1.57 mV). Conclusion Repair of the dermocartilaginous ligament during open rhinoplasty operations enhances nasal respiratory functions by expanding the external nasal valve through M. depressor septi nasi and allows the nose to participate in mimic movements.;2020
Background Nasal base retraction results from cephalic malposition of the alar base in the vertical plane causing disharmonies in the alar base. In literature there are some excisional procedures to correct this deformity but it may result to nostril distortion stenosis or upper lip elevation. Here a new technique is reported for the correction of nasal base retraction in crooked nose by manipulating the levator labii alaeque nasi muscle. Methods Sixteen patients 6 women and 10 men ranging in age from 21 to 42 years who have alar retraction with crooked nose were operated with a follow-up period of 12 months. Preoperative and postoperative frontal profile base and oblique base views in a standard manner were taken and analyzed with Image software. Results Comparison of preoperative and postoperative photographs demonstrated that nasal base retractions were corrected in all cases without distortion and recurrence. Nasal obstruction was reduced after surgery and self-evaluation of nasal patency scores significantly increased in all patients (P < 0.001). Functional and aesthetic outcomes were satisfactory for surgeons and the patients. Conclusions Careful analysis to identify the deformity and proper selection of the technique will ensure a pleasing outcome. The new techniques presented for the correction of nasal base retraction and prevention of the recurrence of the dorsal deviation will help rhinoplasty surgeons obtain pleasing outcomes.;2016
Background Nasal dorsum anatomy is disrupted in rhinoplasty operations. Nasal dorsum restoration is critical in providing a natural smooth and stable nasal dorsum. In this article a dorsum restoration technique for protecting anatomical structures and 1-year postoperative outcome assessment is presented. Methods A total of 324 patients who all had a dorsal hump > 3 mm and required dorsal hump reduction were included in the study. All patients underwent dorsum restoration using the same technique which included medial lateral and horizontal osteotomies and nasal dorsal and mucosal approximating by polydioxanone sutures. At 1 year follow-up dorsal irregularities and symmetry of dorsal aesthetic lines were evaluated by analysis of standard pictures. Evaluations were performed by two other plastic surgeons. Patients also completed a Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaire with high scores indicating greater patient satisfaction. Results The average duration of operations was 168 min. At follow-up dorsal aesthetic lines of 299 patients (92.2%) were symmetrical. Unacceptable dorsum irregularity was detected by palpation in 12 (3.7%) patients and 18 (5.5%) patients underwent revision rhinoplasty. All patients (n = 324) completed ROE questionnaire (score range 0-24) and the mean ROE score was 21.45. The results of the ROE scores show that 65% and 28% of patients gave 4 points and 3 points for ROE questionnaire respectively which shows that 93% of points were 3 and higher. Only seven patients scored their appraisal of nasal appearance < 3 while 237 patients reported a maximum score for social admiration. The aesthetic and functional results were satisfactory for patients and the surgeon.

Background Nasal filling has gained popularity in plastic surgery practice and strengthened the surgeon's hand. Mild deformities of the nose can be treated with nasal filling instead of rhinoplasty or small contour irregularities following surgical rhinoplasty can be corrected by dermal filler injections. It is a significant advantage of hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers that they can be dissolved with hyaluronidase in case of the patient dislikes the appearance and desires a surgical rhinoplasty. However there is no publication about when rhinoplasty surgery can be performed safely after hyaluronidase injection. Objectives In this case series we shared our experiences with nasal filling in plastic surgery practice under three headings: primary nasal filling nasal filling for post-rhinoplasty defects and rhinoplasty after hyaluronidase injection in dissatisfied filling patients. We presented our nasal filling technique indications result analysis and also our rhinoplasty experiences we performed at different times after hyaluronidase injection. Methods Nasal filling patients from July 2015 to March 2020 were divided and analyzed in three groups: (a) Primary nasal filling was provided to 62 patients (b) nasal filling for post-rhinoplasty defect was provided to 18 patients and (c) rhinoplasty after hyaluronidase injection was performed in five patients who are not satisfied with results. The duration between hyaluronidase and rhinoplasty operation was respectively 6 months 3 months 3 months 2 months and 1 week. Results (a) In primary nasal filling 57 patients were fully satisfied two patients were satisfied and three patients were dissatisfied with results. Results were stable up to at least 6 months (Range 6-14 months). (b) In nasal filling for post-rhinoplasty defects all patients were fully satisfied with results. Results were stable for at least 12 months (Range 12-36 months). (c) In rhinoplasty after hyaluronidase injection any filling residue was not observed and there were no complications. The postoperative results were satisfactory. Conclusion Nasal filling with hyaluronic acid represents an excellent alternative for patients who do not wish to undergo a rhinoplasty or a revision rhinoplasty procedure. HA filler can be dissolved easily with hyaluronidase if the patient does not like the result and we think that rhinoplasty can be performed safely at least one week later from hyaluronidase treatment.

Background Pain ecchymosis and edema are major postoperative transient complications of septorhinoplasty procedures. They increase the patient's anxiety and decrease satisfaction levels as well as extend recovery time in the early postoperative period. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of total nasal block (TNB) and central facial block (CFB) on postoperative pain edema and ecchymosis. Methods A total of 60 consecutive patients enrolled in this study and were divided into three groups as Controls (n = 20) TNB (n = 20) and CFB (n = 20). The two block methods mentioned above were performed at both the beginning and end of the surgery in the TNB and CFB groups. The Control group was not subjected to any block methods. Pain edema and ecchymosis score results according to the three scales were recorded postoperatively after 24 h and on days 2 5 7 and 10. Results were analyzed statistically. Results Of all patients 28 were male and 32 were female. Ages were between 18 and 52 years (mean = 26.3 years). Pain edema and ecchymosis scores were significantly lower in the TNB and CFB groups than in the Control group. Additionally there was a significant difference between the TNB and CFB groups in terms of pain and edema at postoperative 24 h and on day 2. Ecchymosis scores were lower in the CFB group than in the TNB group at 24 h and on days 2 and 5 after the operation. Conclusion Both TNB and CFB decreased postoperative pain edema and ecchymosis in septorhinoplasty. However CFB was more effective than TNB in terms of pain edema and ecchymosis relief after septorhinoplasty procedures.

Background Photographic documentation of the nose is the standard procedure for many surgeons who perform rhinoplasty across the world. One of the most challenging views in the photograph documentation is the frontal view that requires special photographic skills and may create a bias. Our dynamic video recording process allows us to improve the quality of patient evaluation making the assessment more convenient and enabling the documentation of high-level rhinoplasty database. Objectives Our main goal was to present our selected video recording process that ensures standardized high-quality documentation of the data from rhinoplasty patients. As per our knowledge this tool has not been published before. Methods We have invented a rotational platform-based chair that allows us to make a dynamic evaluation of the patients under standardized photograph settings (patient's position camera and lighting features) through a video recording. Results We demonstrated that the quality of our rotational video recording process is similar to that of standardized photographs. However this additional dynamic evaluation helps to avoid Photoshop (R) corrections which may result in bias. Conclusions This high-quality patient evaluation represents advancement in the photograph-documentation process in the modern era of rhinoplasty. This new dynamic video recording process prevents image misinterpretation helps improve the quality of patient evaluations makes the process more convenient and enables the documentation of high-quality data for rhinoplasty patients. Moreover this new recording process is an excellent tool for educational purposes and presentations.;2020
BACKGROUND Reconstruction of the nasal lining is the most difficult part of complex nasal reconstruction because the mucosa has a unique texture and fineness. Many techniques ranging from skin grafts to local flaps have been applied for the reconstruction of the mucosa. In some cases even free flaps have been used. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to discuss the feasibility of using turn-in flaps in nasal reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventeen patients with full-thickness nasal defects underwent reconstruction with turn-in flaps. In all the patients the bone structure was formed using cartilage grafts and the skin defects were reconstructed using paramedian forehead flaps. A rhinoplasty procedure was added in 10 of the patients. RESULTS Necrosis was not observed in any of the flaps and the results were satisfactory for all the patients. CONCLUSION This technique provided enough support for the onlay cartilage grafts and the flap was thin enough to avoid any nasal airway obstruction. In selected patients this technique can also be used in conjunction with a rhinoplasty procedure.;2017
Background Reduction rhinoplasties regardless of the methods used (structural or preservation) can cause a reduction in the internal nasal volume which may lead to breathing problems. In 1977 Webster proposed preserving a little triangle in the beginning of the lower lateral osteotomy line to prevent breathing problem. However its importance is still controversial. Objectives and methods: This prospective randomized controlled study (level of evidence 1) included 46 patients without nasal breathing problem. High-to-low (Webster's triangle preservation) osteotomy (control group n = 23) and low-to-low osteotomy (study group n = 23) were performed. All operations were performed according to the proposed volumetric rhinoplasty steps (examination/measurement prevention and treatment). Nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) test visual analog scale acoustic rhinometry rhinomanometry peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and three-dimensional measurements were performed in all patients. Breathing tests were repeated before and 6 months after surgery with and without xylometazoline administration. Results No statistically significant difference in NOSE and visual analog scale scores was found between the two groups. Acoustic rhinometry PNIF and rhinomanometry findings showed no statistically significant breathing difference between the two groups. Conclusions In reduction rhinoplasties a decrease in the internal volume may be expected as directly proportional with the reduction amount. The decrease in the internal volume may create nasal breathing problems. To prevent it nasal airflow should be adjusted according to new anatomy. In this study we discussed volumetric rhinoplasty steps to prevent breathing problems in reduction rhinoplasty. Following these steps not preserving Webster's triangle (low-to-low osteotomy) has no effect on the nasal airway.

Background Rhinoplasty can be performed using both open and closed approaches. A visible scar on the columella is the major disadvantage of open rhinoplasty. Different columellar incision types have been used in open rhinoplasty. In this retrospective study we compare transverse and inverted-V columellar incisions with a scar assessment scale. Methods In this retrospective study open rhinoplasty was performed on 84 patients between 2001 and 2006. The transverse incision was used on 39 patients (18 males 21 females). The inverted-V incision was used on 45 patients (21 males 24 females). The entire surgical procedure was performed by a single surgeon. The columellar incision was closed using 6-0 interrupted polypropylene sutures. All sutures were removed on the fifth postoperative day. With this assessment scale we observed satisfactory scar pigmentation and notching. Results We compared both groups and found that the inverted-V incision resulted in better scar formation (p < 0.05) and less notching (p < 0.07). Scar pigmentation was found to be irrelevant to the incision technique employed (p < 0.3). Conclusion As a result of this study we concluded that the inverted-V incision might be a better choice in open rhinoplasty.;2008
Background Rhinoplasty is one of the most unforgiving operations in facial plastic surgery. The correction of nasal deviation in an asymmetrical face can be challenging because known facial landmarks may mislead the surgeon. Eyebrows trimmed asymmetrically in an effort to create a more symmetrical facial appearance may be overlooked by surgeons. Objective To define the relationship between the eyebrow position and external nasal deviation in patients with a crooked nose. Design Setting and Participants Analysis was made of the preoperative and 6-month postoperative life-size photographs of female rhinoplasty patients who had been referred to the senior author's clinic between May 2014 and June 2019. The anthropometric landmarks on the life-size photographs were identifed. The most medial points of the eyebrows and most deviated part of the nose were marked and the distance from the mid-canthal point was measured. Main Outcomes and Measure The direction and amount of eyebrow shift were compared with the direction and amount of nasal deviation. Results Of the total 94 female rhinoplasty patients with at least one level external nasal deviation 67 (71.2%) had ipsilateral eyebrow shift with external nasal deviation. The preoperative external nasal deviation amount was 1.81 +/- 1.21 mm and preoperative eyebrow shift was 1.18 +/- 1.06 mm (rS = 0.429p < 0.001). The postoperative nasal deviation was 0.79 +/- 0.92 mm and the eyebrow shift was 0.54 +/- 0.62 mm (rS = 0.570p < 0.001). Conclusion and Relevance Patients may tend to trim their eyebrows towards the side of the external nasal deviation. After centralization of the crooked nose with rhinoplasty asymmetric eyebrow shaping tendencies of the patients were also seen to be improved.;2020
Background Rhinoplasty is one of the most widely conducted and challenging types of aesthetic surgical operations and dorsal hump reduction is a commonly performed aesthetic surgery among Caucasian patients. Dorsal hump resection is traditionally conducted by removing the dorsal nasal bone and cartilage. The push-down and let-down techniques are used for dorsal preservation in dorsal hump reduction operations. Different patients require different approaches to achieve the best results in terms of aesthetic appearance and functionality. Objectives In the present research the author describes two novel approaches that combine the push-down and let-down techniques for appropriate patients. Methods The records of 45 patients (40 females and 5 males) were assessed and those who were eligible for the present approaches were included. The author defined two approaches in which the push-down and let-down techniques were used simultaneously (mix-down methods). All patients included in the study completed the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaire before surgery and at their one-year follow-up appointment. Results The median ROE scores were 60.1 points before surgery and 92.2 points one year after surgery this difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusions The present study is the first to demonstrate the beneficial effects of combining the push-down and let-down techniques in a selected patient population. These new approaches will improve both cosmetic and functional outcomes and allow surgeons to choose the best option for patients who are eligible for these mix-down approaches.;2021
Background Several grafting materials have been used in revision rhinoplasty to correct overresected dorsum. Autologous materials are generally preferred but have the drawbacks of additional surgical time and donor site morbidity. Tutoplast-processed fascia lata (TPFL) offers a commercially available alternative to autologous fascia grafts. We reviewed the results of 42 revision rhinoplasty procedures that used TPFL with or without autologous cartilage to correct overresected dorsum. Methods Forty-two patients with overresected dorsum underwent revision rhinoplasty with multilayered TPFL at our institution between 2005 and 2012. Saddle nose deformities were classified into one of three types according to severity. Surgical results were evaluated as excellent good or fair by an otolaryngologist who compared preoperative photographs with pictures taken at final follow-up. Surgical complications were analyzed. Results Of the 42 patients who underwent rhinoplasty with multilayered TPFL 36 were treated with TPFL alone while autologous cartilage was used concurrently in six. Twenty-six (62 %) of the patients showed excellent aesthetic improvement 11 (26 %) showed good improvement and five (12 %) showed fair improvement. There were no major complications. Minor complications included edema in six patients major resorp-tion in three and minimal resorption in nine. Patients with mild or moderate saddle nose deformity had better surgical results than those with more severe deformity. Conclusions There are many possible methods to correct overresected dorsum. Multilayer TPFL is safe alternative to autologous rib cartilage grafts.;2015
Background Smiling causes a deformity in some rhinoplasty patients that includes drooping of the nasal tip elevation and shortening of the upper lip and increased maxillary gingival show. The depressor septi muscle leads this deformity. The dermocartilaginous ligament originates from the fascia of the upper third of the nose and extends down to the medial crus merging into the depressor septi muscle. Methods In this study 100 primary rhinoplasty patients were studied for hyperdynamic nasal tip ptosis. Of these patients 36 had hyperdynamic nasal tip ptosis due to hyperactive depressor septi nasi muscle. The dermocartilaginous ligament was used as a guide to reach the depressor septi muscle in open rhinoplasty. Muscle excision was performed just below the footplates of the medial crura. A strong columellar strut graft was placed between the medial crura to avoid narrowing of the columellar width resulting from tissue excision and to withstand activation of depressor septi muscle remnants. Results No complications such as infection or hematoma occurred in the early postoperative period. The technique corrected the hyperdynamic nasal tip ptosis increased upper lip length and decreased gingival show when patients smiled. There was no narrowing of the columellar width. No depression in the columellar-labial junction due to distal resection of the depressor septi muscle was observed. Conclusion The dermocartilaginous ligament can be used as a reliable guide to reach the depressor septi muscle in open rhinoplasty. Therefore the hyperactive depressor septi muscle can be definitively identified and treated without an intraoral approach.

Background The age at which nasal tip support changes start to occur is unknown. Evaluation of nasal tip support is difficult especially as the ideal nasal tip support pressure remains elusive. The aim of this study is to determine the nasal tip support pressure alterations relative to age and sex. Objectives The aim of this study is to determine the changers in resistance of the nasal tip support in relation to age and sex. Methods This prospective clinical study was conducted between January and April 2019 at a tertiary health facility. Nasal tip resistances were measured in four different age-groups (20-29 30-39 40-64 and > 65 years) with a digital Newton meter. A total of 159 patients with a minimum of 36 patients per group were included in the study. Nasal tip resistance measurements were compared among nasal tip displacement distances of 2 3 and 4 mm focusing on age and sex. Results The nasal tip resistance of the 20-29 age-group was significantly higher at 2 3 and 4 mm nasal tip displacement distances when compared with the 30-39 and 40-64 age-groups whereas compared to the > 65 years group it was significantly higher at 3 and 4 mm nasal tip displacement distances (p < 0.005). Nasal tip resistance of males was found to be significantly higher than that of females at 3 and 4 mm nasal tip displacement distances (p < 0.001). Conclusions Nasal tip resistance is higher in males and universally decreases significantly after 30 years of age while remaining constant at later ages. Therefore surgeons should prefer nasal tip resistance increasing techniques in the rhinoplasty operations that are performed on patients even from early years of age in order to maintain and strengthen the nasal tip resistance.;2020
Background The aim of this work is to provide a stepwise systematic guide for a preoperative photo-editing procedure for rhinoplasty cases involving the cooperation of a graphic artist and a surgeon. Methods One hundred female subjects who planned to undergo a reduction rhinoplasty operation were included in this study. The Cingi Steps for Preoperative Computer Imaging (CS-PCI) program a stepwise systematic guide for image editing using Adobe PhotoShop's liquify effect was applied to the rhinoplasty candidates. The stages of CS-PCI are as follows: (1) lowering the hump (2) shortening the nose (3) adjusting the tip projection (4) perfecting the nasal dorsum (5) creating a supratip break and (6) exaggerating the tip projection and/or dorsal slope. Results Performing the Cingi Steps allows the patient to see what will happen during the operation and observe the final appearance of his or her nose. After the application of described steps 71 patients (71%) accepted step 4 and 21 (21%) of them accepted step 5. Only 10 patients (10%) wanted to make additional changes to their operation plans. Conclusion The main benefits of using this method is that it decreases the time needed by the surgeon to perform a graphic analysis and it reduces the time required for the patient to reach a decision about the procedure. It is an easy and reliable method that will provide improved physician-patient communication increased patient confidence and enhanced surgical planning while limiting the time needed for planning.;2014
Background The authors of this study have developed a novel graft called the 'The Joint Tip Graft' which adds support to the lateral crus camouflages the tip grafts supports the facet and adds volume to the nasal tip as a single graft. The aim of this study was to define and introduce the tripod graft. Methods Thirty patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty at a tertiary academic center were included. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups according to the grafts used: group 1: Joint tip graft was additionally used and group 2: Joint tip graft was not used. All patients were photographed by a photographer who is familiar with medical photography. Preoperative and postoperative sixth month photographs were taken for analysis. The brightest point of the infratip lobule and the darkest point of the facets were selected and analyzed with computer software. The luminance ratio of facet to infratip lobule was calculated to overcome light and head position differences. Results Mean infratip luminance scores were 112.2 +/- 05.72 and 109.73 +/- 7.13 in groups 1 and 2 respectively (p > 0.05). Mean facet luminance scores were 101.33 +/- 4.91 and 89.27 +/- 5.11 in groups 1 and 2 respectively (p < 0.05). Facet/infratip luminance ratios were calculated for each group. Mean facet/infratip luminance ratios were 0.90 +/- 0.01 and 0.82 +/- 0.16 for groups 1 and 2 respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusions The joint tip graft is a novel graft that is easy to harvest and apply. It spans both of the alar cartilages supports the facet area and creates a smooth gradual light shadow transition. Additionally it acts as a camouflage over the tip grafts.;2019
Background The cephalic trimming of the lower lateral cartilage (LLC) is an attempt to reduce tip bulbosity unfortunately it has the potential to cause a pinched nose deformity and valve collapse. Objectives The author sought to use the superior-based transposition (ST) flap to reshape relocalize and reinforce the LLC as a support material for both internal and external valves with aesthetic corrections leaving the scroll area untouched. Methods A total of 367 patients (female 215 male 152) were operated with the presented technique. The ST flap was simply used to prepare a cartilage flap based on the scroll area in the cephalic portion of the LLC and then this flap was advanced over the remaining LLC. The data were evaluated retrospectively. Results Functionally the ST flap was used to reshape and support the LLC and the internal valve by keeping the scroll intact and increasing the internal valve angle. The support and suspension of the LLC with this novel technique improve the functional results and prevent complications such as stenosis of both the external and internal valve angles. Aesthetically the convexity and concavity of the LLC could be fixed with the adaptation of these two surfaces in different angles thereby achieving a narrower refined and aesthetically pleasing tip. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the ST flap can be one of the main maneuvers performed during rhinoplasty for many purposes such as reshaping and supporting the LLC increasing the tip rotation achieving more aesthetically pleasing tips suspending the internal and external valves and protecting the scroll area.

Background The effect of a spreader flap on the keystone area and the upper bony vault depends on the structural strength and cephalic extent of upper lateral cartilages both of which can be significantly variable among individuals. Objectives The authors present a novel cephalically extended osseocartilaginous composite spreader flap technique that was designed to overcome the limitations of a conventional spreader flap on the keystone area upper bony vault in patients with cephalically short and structurally weak upper lateral cartilages and thin nasal bones. Methods This study was a retrospective review of the recorded perioperative information to investigate the frequency of the use of the composite spreader flap technique and perioperative parameters that relate to postoperative dorsal deformities. One-hundred-seventy-six consecutive primary open approach rhinoplasty cases performed by the first author (O.B.) between November 2015 and February 2017 were included in the study. Patient data were obtained from rhinoplasty data sheets standardized photographs and postoperative physical examinations. Results Of the 176 cases who underwent primary open approach rhinoplasty whose data were reviewed for the purpose of this study 38 (32 females 6 males) had dorsal reconstruction with the use of a composite spreader flap. Seventeen patients had a deviated nose with an asymmetric bony pyramid. In 8 patients the composite spreader flap was used unilaterally. No patients in the composite spreader flap group had a postoperative dorsal deformity or required surgical revision. Conclusions Composite flap preparation extends the reliability and the reach of the spreader flap technique beyond its previous borders.;2019
BACKGROUND The efficiency of nasal surgeries can be determined by objective or subjective methods. We have assessed the effect of nasal obstruction after different nasal surgeries using Acoustic Rhinometry (AR) and Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale. METHODS Between May 2011 and May 2012 40 young adult patients and 10 healthy volunteers as control group who referred to Otorhinolaryngology Clinic in Eskisehir Military Hospital due to nasal obstruction were enrolled. Depending on operation patients were divided into four equal groups. Group 1: Septoplasty Group 2: Septoplasty with sprader graft Group 3: Septorinoplasty and Group 4: Septorhinoplasty with spreader graft. The patients completed NOSE scale 1 week before and 1 month after the surgery and AR measurements. RESULTS There were a significant improvement in mean NOSE scores of patients and statistical difference was found between pre and post-operational values for each group. There was a statistically significant change of the mean minimal cross section areas (MCA) of the deviated side of nasal passages measured by AR between pre and postoperative period. CONCLUSION In patients with nasal obstruction functional nasal surgeries which were performed after appropriate medical examination and with right operation methods had a positive impact on quality of life and patient satisfaction. We observed that nasal findings were correlated with NOSE scores and MCA values. So we suggest that NOSE scale and AR to be used for evaluation of the efficiency of functional nasal surgeries.;2016
Background The internal nasal valve is one of the highly important anatomical points in rhinoplasty procedures. As a key anatomical area the anatomical and functional integrity of this region must be preserved or reconstructed during rhinoplasty procedures. Several techniques have been defined in the literature for midvault restoration among which the most common are spreader grafts and flaps. Both techniques achieve a natural and harmonic contour but may fail to provide the splay effect to the upper lateral cartilages in some cases. A new technique known as the T-splay graft to be used as an alternative approach in cases where there is a risk of midvault collapse and in which the splay effect in the upper lateral cartilage is preferred to be augmented is explained in the present study. Methods In the present study a septal tunnel is opened of sufficient size for the cartilage graft planned for placement at the planned level of the septum to expand the midvault region and create a splay effect. A bilateral pocket is created in the inferior mucosa of the upper lateral cartilages. The harvested cartilage graft is passed through the septum in the horizontal plane. The cartilage graft is inserted into the bilateral pockets so as way to create convexity to the dorsum. Results As a result of the applied method it was established that the internal nasal valve angle could be expanded to the desired extent and the dorsal aesthetic lines could be achieved in a normal anatomical structure. Conclusions This technique enables the lateral direction of the tension between the graft and the upper lateral cartilages and the creation of a splay effect. As such we believe that this method is a highly effective alternative for use in appropriate cases.;2021
Background The junction between upper and lower lateral cartilages known as the scroll area is an important determinant of the spatial relationship between the middle and lower nasal thirds. Objectives We offer a graduated and reproducible surgical technique of scroll area management that takes into consideration anatomic functional and aesthetic relationships. Methods This study was a retrospective review of the recorded intraoperative information to investigate the frequency of the use of scroll reconstruction techniques and perioperative parameters that relate to unintended component alterations in the scroll area. A total of 364 consecutive primary open approach rhinoplasty cases performed by the first author (O.B.) between July 2011 and September 2015 were included in the study. Results Of the 364 cases who underwent primary open approach rhinoplasty 329 received some form of scroll reconstruction. Scroll reconstruction was performed in all deviated cases and 88% of straight noses. The most common technique for scroll reconstruction was overlapping repair (88.3%). As expected both alar rim and alar crease asymmetries were very frequent in the deviated nose group 89.4% and 75% respectively. Alar rim and alar crease asymmetries were frequent enough in the straight nose group to deserve special attention 14.2% and 10.4% respectively. Conclusions With careful attention to anatomic details of the scroll area nasal tip refinements can be performed with predictable safety and accuracy. Our approach is a graduated reproducible and individualized way of scroll area management that aims to create the ideal cartilage configuration while preventing unintended component alterations.

Background The nose has a great impact on facial beauty and appearance. Therefore rhinoplasty is one of the most performed procedures worldwide. However considering the varying degrees of cosmetic operations holistic approach to face is essential to achieve more successful results. In order to this the forehead is noteworthy with its gender-related features and important relation to the nose. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of forehead contouring with fat grafting adjunct to rhinoplasty on personal traits facial appearance and patient satisfaction. Methods A total of 15 patients who underwent rhinoplasty and forehead contouring with fat grafting were enrolled in this retrospective study. Facial appearance and personal traits were evaluated via subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S-GAIS) and patient satisfaction was assessed with custom design Forehead Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation Questionnaire (F/ROE-Q). Forehead inclination was calculated as an objective indicator of fat graft survival and contour improvement. Pre- and postoperative photographs were taken and used for evaluation. Results According to the F/ROE-Q score mean total preoperative score was 913 and the mean total postoperative score was 2486 (p < 001). High postoperative satisfaction scores were observed in all patients. Statistically significant improvement was observed in attractiveness femininity youthfulness facial harmony forehead contour facial profile view parameters based on S-GAIS assessment. The mean forehead inclination angle was 1904(o) preoperatively and 1674 degrees postoperatively. Conclusion With the important benefits such as higher patient satisfaction and improvement on facial appearance and personal traits forehead contouring with fat grafting was an efficient and applicable procedure adjunct to rhinoplasty.;2021
Background The posterior cephalic soft triangle is formed between the posterior cephalic border of the lower lateral cartilage posterior caudal border of the upper lateral cartilage and the caudal edge of the nasal bone. PCST is an important component of the external nasal valve which provides resistance against dynamic collapse. Objectives The objective of this study was to describe the anatomy of the PCST and to demonstrate its anatomic variations dynamic interplays and surgical implications. Methods A retrospective review was conducted of 310 primary and 42 secondary cases who underwent extended open approach rhinoplasty by the first author. The structures that create the PCST of the nose were preserved unless resection/displacement of them was absolutely necessary. Whenever an external nasal valve pathology was found it was corrected with one or combination of the following maneuvers: triangular PCST onlay graft caudal bone outfracture alar rim graft lateral crural strut graft. Results Twenty-four non-consecutive cases were identified in which PCST was intraoperatively confirmed to be weak or deformed. The most common pathology in the PCST was overresection of the posterior segments of the LLC during primary surgery (54.1%) followed by en bloc medialization of the PCST (33.3%). Triangular onlay grafting of the PCST was the most common corrective surgical intervention (83.3%) followed by corrective lateralization of caudal edge of nasal bone (29.1%). External valve function has been restored in 21 (87.5%) cases. Conclusions PCST of the nose is an important anatomic landmark which has esthetic and functional significance in rhinoplasty.;2021
Background The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of columellar strut and septal extension grafts for reconstruction of caudal nasal supportive structures on the long-term stability of nasal projection and rotation. Methods A comparison was done on the differences between the early- and long-term results of the ratios of nasal projection to nasal length and columella labial angle values in 36 patients who were operated on by the same surgeon using columellar or septal extension grafts. Results Both grafts had the effect of increasing nasal projection and this effect was found to be stable over time. Some increased values of nasal projection obtained in the early postoperative period were lost over time. Although no significant difference was found between the groups clinical and numerical observations showed that the values decreased less in the group that received septal extension grafts. Conclusion The tip position was more stable in cases with septal extension grafts than in those with columellar strut grafts.;2013
Background The scroll area of the nose is important for breathing thereby its reconstruction can improve the nasal patency. Objective To evaluate the effect of scroll reconstruction on breathing in patients following open rhinoplasty. Methods Using the prospective controlled study design we enrolled a cohort of patients undergoing open rhinoplasty. The patients were randomly divided into two groups (each group with n = 14). The predictor variable was scroll reconstruction (yes/no). The main outcome variables include pre- and postoperative third-month peak nasal inspiratory flowmeter (PNIF) value (ml/min) and 10-Item Standardized Cosmesis and Health Nasal Outcomes Survey (SCHNOS). Appropriate statistics were computed and a P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results There was no demographic difference between both groups. Scroll reconstruction was associated with significantly improved PNIF post-surgery (P = 0.047). However postoperative mean SCHNOS-O and SCHNOS-C was not different between the study and control groups (P = 0.58) Conclusions This study suggests that scroll reconstruction helps improve nasal patency during forced inspiration in open rhinoplasty patients and provides a similar aesthetic outcome compared to the non-scroll-reconstructed group. Future research works should be done in a larger patient cohort.;2021
Background The shaping of the cartilage and keeping it in place is very significant for patients who need nasal reconstruction with costal grafts at traumatic or secondary rhinoplasties. In this study a template is prepared during the surgery that shows the dorsal defect in a 3-dimensional manner and acts as a guide while shaping the cartilage. Methods Seventeen patients who required secondary rhinoplasties because of trauma or previous operations were included in this study. The patients were operated on between the years 2009 and 2013. The mean age of the patients was 24 years (19-38 years). According to the surgical technique bone wax was placed in a sheath prepared from the finger of a sterile nylon surgical glove before the dorsal reconstruction. It was placed to the nasal dorsum and shaped over the skin with digital maneuvers. Afterward the bone wax was stripped off the nylon glove and it was used as a template to shape the cartilage graft. Results No need for revision rhinoplasties was seen in any of the patients during the mean follow-up period of 19 months. The patients stated that they were satisfied by both the functional and the aesthetic results. Conclusions The bone wax template and the defect fit in a key and keyhole fashion. It is supported by multiple points on the nasal bone and the septum. Thus it does not slide and its warping is avoided. We think that it gives satisfactory results and it shortens the learning process.;2015
Background The tripod theory explains the dynamics of the nasal tip where surgery is difficult because of anatomic variations and pathologies and the various surgical possibilities. Abnormalities or weaknesses of the lateral crura can result in concavity in ala or alar collapse and cause aesthetic and functional impairments of the nose. Several tip plasty techniques and lateral crura modifications are used in rhinoplasty. Objective To describe the vertical alar folding (VAF) technique for making modifications in the lateral crura (LC) and rotation of the tip. Methods Included in the study were 83 patients (59 women 24 men) undergoing rhinoplasty using VAF with the senior author as surgeon between 2013 and 2018. The mean age was 26.3 years (range 18-47). Mean postoperative follow-up period was 26.7 months (range 12-64). Patients who completed the 1-year postoperative period completed the rhinoplasty outcome evaluation (ROE) questionnaire. Outcome measures were performed at examinations and preoperative and postoperative photographs of the patients were analyzed. Results In the span of 5 years no revision surgery was required for technique-specific reasons. In patients who had a droopy or asymmetric tip or long and concave lateral crura we saw remarkable functional and aesthetic improvements with VAF. According to the ROE questionnaire 90.3% (75 out of 83) of the patients were content with the aesthetic and functional results. Conclusion VAF is a useful and effective method for modifying the LC and tip of the nose. VAF allowed for controlling the rotation and projection of the tip changing the length of the lateral crus and nose with durability and smooth symmetric contours and correcting concavity of a lateral crus for better functioning and aesthetics.

Background This randomized double-blind study was designed to assess the effect of perioperative remifentanil with controlled hypotension on intraoperative bleeding postoperative edema and ecchymosis. Methods Fifty-two patients undergoing rhinoplasty were divided into 2 groups. The remifentanil group received 1 mu g kg(-1) intravenously as a bolus before induction of anesthesia 0.5 to 1 mu g kg(-1) h(-1) by continuous intravenous infusion during the operation. After anesthesia induction with propofol (2-3 mg kg(-1)) and fentanyl (1-15 mu g kg(-1)) muscle relaxation was achieved with rocuronium (0.45-0.90 mg kg(-1)). Mean arterial pressure was maintained at 50 to 60 mm Hg in controlled hypotensive anesthesia achieved using remifentanil infusion. Perioperative hemodynamics and bleeding early postoperative pain and agitation scale postoperative first third and seventh day edema and ecchymosis were evaluated. Edema and ecchymosis were evaluated using graded scale from 0 to 4. Results Remifentanil reduced mean arterial pressure during the entire operative period and the first 30 minutes postoperatively (P < 0.05 for these comparisons). Intraoperative bleeding also decreased (P < 0.001). There was a significant decrease in edema in both upper and lower eyelid edema on the first and third days in the remifentanil group although this difference was not detected on the seventh day (P-1upper = 0.000 P-1lower = 0.000 P-3upper = 0.008 and P-3lower = 0.002). Ecchymosis decreased significantly in both upper and lower eyelids on the first third and seventh days in the remifentanil group (P-1upper = 0.000 P-3upper = 0.000 P-3upper = 0.002 P-3lower = 0.002 P-7upper = 0.049 and P-7lower = 0.038). There were no differences in postoperative pain and agitation between 2 groups. Conclusions Remifentanil with controlled hypotension may reduce edema and ecchymosis of the upper and lower eyelids by reducing mean arterial pressure and amount of bleeding in rhinoplasty.;2014
Background This study aimed to evaluate the impact of isotretinoin therapy on the nasal skin thickness and elasticity with regard to implications for rhinoplasty Methods A total of 40 acne vulgaris patients (mean +/- SD age: 20.9 +/- 3.0 years 65.0% were females) initiating oral isotretinoin treatment (0.25 mg/kg/day n = 16 or 0.5 mg/kg/day n = 24) were included in this prospective 4-month isotretinoin follow-up study. Ultrasonography assessments regarding nasal skin thickness (dermis and soft tissue) and elastography were repeated at second and fourth months of treatment. Results No significant difference was noted between isotretinoin dose groups in terms of second month and fourth month nasal skin thickness (dermis and soft tissue) values measured at any region. Each dose revealed significant decrease in dermis and soft tissue thickness from baseline at any region (p ranged < 0.001 to < 0.001) while only fourth month values at nasal tip and second month values at rhinion for dermis and only fourth month values at rhinion and glabella for subcutaneous tissue significantly differed from baseline (p < 0.01 for each) in the 0.25 mg and 0.50 mg dose groups respectively. Elastography values at fourth month of isotretinoin treatment were significantly higher than pre-treatment and second month values in both 0.25 mg (90.4 +/- 20.6 vs. 59.5 +/- 21.8 and 76.4 +/- 22.9 p < 0.01 for each) and 0.5 mg (86.7 +/- 20.6 vs. 61.8 +/- 23.2 and 76.9 +/- 24 p < 0.01 for each) dose groups. Conclusions In conclusion our findings revealed the association of isotretinoin treatment with a significant decrease in dermis and subcutaneous soft tissue thickness measured at each anatomical landmark regardless of the treatment dose.;2021
Background Tip plasty is the most important step of rhinoplasty. To achieve symmetrical cartilages with ideal tip rotation projection and supratip break many techniques were defined. Besides suture techniques tip grafts still maintain their importance and widely used among surgeons. However graft visibility and distortion are the main drawbacks of this technique. In this study double-layered lateral crural perichondrial flap technique was introduced to prevent graft visibility and distortion as a novel technique. Methods A total of 16 patients who underwent rhinoplasty with this novel technique were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patient satisfaction was assessed with Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation Questionnaire (ROE-Q). Graft visibility and asymmetry of tip defining point as an indicator of graft distortion were evaluated by two independent Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic surgeons. Pre and postoperative photographs were taken and used for evaluation. A three-point Likert scale was used for assessment. Cohen's Kappa statistic and percent agreement test were used to test inter-rater reliability Results The mean follow-up time was 15 months (ranging between 12 and 19 months). According to the ROE-Q score the mean total preoperative score was 625 and the mean total postoperative score was 1806 (p<005). No or minimal evident graft visibility and asymmetry of tip defining point was observed in 12 patients and 10 patients respectively. Mild evident graft visibility was observed in only 1 patient with thin skin. Severe evident graft visibility or asymmetry of tip defining point was not observed in none of the patients. Conclusion The double-layer crural perichondrial flap was an effective and sufficient method for preventing graft visibility and graft distortion. Features like easy and fast flap elevation no additional comorbidity being autologous tissue and sufficient flap length and thickness make this technique valuable and useful.;2021
Background Trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR) consists of bradycardia or asystole along with hypotension and apnea coinciding with stimulation of the trigeminal nerve. During rhinoplasty procedures we noticed that local anesthetic solution (LAS) application to the columellar area results in bradycardia. We planned to conduct a randomized prospective study on 47 patients undergoing rhinoplasty to demonstrate the characteristics of TCR arising from the columella. Method Local anesthetic solution containing 2% prilocaine with 1:80000 adrenaline was applied under standard general anesthesia protocol. In group 1 (study group n = 24) 2 mL of LAS was applied to the columella. In group 2 (control group n = 23) 2 mL of LAS was applied to the nasal dorsum. In group 3 (control group n = 20) after LAS was applied to nasal dorsum in group 2 we waited for 10 minutes. Then 2 mL of LAS was applied to the columella. Here recordings were taken for the columella. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were recorded just before needle insertion (baseline level) at the time of needle insertion (NIT) to the columella or dorsum and after the 1st 5th 10th 30th and 60th seconds. Results Transient bradycardia (>= 20% drop in HR) was observed in 33% of the patients in group 1. Decrease in HR compared to the baseline level in group 1 was significantly greater than that of groups 2 and 3 at all times (P <= 0.05). Systolic BP in NIT and in 60th second in group 1 only in NIT in group 2 was significantly lower than that of baseline levels (P <= 0.05). Conclusions We concluded that stimulation of a sensory branch of the trigeminal nerve in the columellar area leads to TCR under general anesthesia by eliciting clinical hypotension with a drop in systolic BP and in HR of more than 20% compared to the baseline level. Knowing the existence of a certain TCR area will be helpful to the surgeon and anesthesiologist to exercise extra vigilance and to make continuous and meticulous monitoring of the electrocardiogram HR and BP during which the TCR may be precipitated such as local anesthetic infiltration to the columellar area in rhinoseptoplasty operations.;2015
Background/aim: Periorbital edema and ecchymosis may develop following rhinoplasty. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of adhesive strip application on the upper and lower eyelids to reduce postoperative edema and ecchymosis following rhinoplasty. Materials and methods: The eyelids of one side were randomly selected and an adhesive strip of standard size and number was applied at the end of the operation. The strips were removed at postoperative day 3 photos of the eyes were taken at days 3 and 7. Edema and ecchymosis were graded on a scale from 1 to 4. The ecchymosis areas on the lower and upper eyelids were measured and compared in square centimeters. Results: The mean ecchymosis area of the lower eyelid on the side of the adhesive strip and on the side without the strip was 1.63 cm2 and 3.32 cm2 in the early period respectively. It was 1.15 cm2 on the upper eyelid on the side of the adhesive strip and 1.87 cm2 on the side without the strip. It was 0.224 cm2 on the side of the adhesive strip and 0.498 cm2 on the side without the adhesive strip in the late period. Conclusion: Applying adhesive strips reduces periorbital edema and ecchymosis.;2018
Background/aim: The objective of this study was to compare the postoperative changes taking place in the nasal senses of patients who underwent a rhinoplasty through the open or closed incision method. Materials and methods: In a prospective study 15 patients had a closed rhinoplasty surgery and 15 others had an open one. By pinpointing 9 spots in the nose a sensory assessment was made by means of Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments prior to the surgery and 1 week and 1 3 and 6 months after the surgery. Results: In the open and closed groups there was hypoesthesia 1 week after the surgery compared with the preoperative period (P = 0.01 and P = 0.016). In the first week a sense reduction in the upper columella was observed in the open group when compared with the closed one (P = 0.035). There were no other significant differences between the groups in the nasal regions at other times. Conclusion: It was ascertained that there was reduced sensation in the upper columella in the open incision group in the first postoperative week. The sensation was reduced in both groups in the first postoperative week. The nasal sensation recovered after the first month.;2016
Background/aim: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of addition of subanesthetic doses of ketamine to an epinephrine-lidocaine solution on postoperative pain analgesic use and patient comfort during rhinoplasties. Materials and methods: Ninety patients were randomly divided into three groups: Group L lidocaine with epinephrine Group K lidocaine with epinephrine plus ketamine and Group S (control group) physiological saline solution with epinephrine. The local anesthetic solution was injected as preincisionally with intranasal submucosal infiltration following induction of general anesthesia. We evaluated visual pain score analgesic demand Wilson sedation score and antiemetic demand at 5 15 and 30 min and 1 2 4 6 8 16 and 24 h after the operation. The patient satisfaction score was checked 24 h after the operation. Results: Visual pain score was significantly reduced in Group K in comparison with the other groups and this group did not need any rescue analgesics (P < 0.05). The postoperative patient satisfaction scores were highest in Group K compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Addition of ketamine solution to lidocaine for infiltration block during rhinoplasty was successful in decreasing pain during postoperative periods and reducing analgesic consumption during the first 24 h after the operation.;2016
Background: A beautiful and appealing nose receives the greatest contribution from the nasal tip subunit which should be regarded as the primary center of attention during a rhinoplasty procedure. In achieving the desired shape and position of the nasal tip during closed rhinoplasty the septocolumellar suture functions as the major determinant together with the caudal portion of the septal cartilage which has a significant influence on the versatility of the septocolumellar suture. The purpose of this study was to present the analysis of the indications the technical steps and the advantages of caudal septal graft and septocolumellar suture utilization in closed rhinoplasty. Methods: The septocolumellar suture with or without the caudal septal graft combination procedure has been performed in 2286 patients via a closed rhinoplasty approach. Intraoperatively the septal cartilage at hand was thoroughly evaluated and one of the 5 types of caudal septal grafts was used when necessary. After the establishment of a strong and straight septal cartilage with sufficient height and length 4 different septocolumellar sutures in a specific order were used to modify the relationship between the lower lateral cartilages and the nasal septum. Results: Of the 2286 cases 1837 (80.3%) were primary and 449 (19.7%) secondary rhinoplasties which have been followed up for 9 to 48 months. The caudal septal graft was combined to the septocolumellar suture in 621 (27.1%) patients. Of the caudal septal grafts 69.7% were used for primary rhinoplasty cases and 30.3% for secondary rhinoplasties. At the 18th month postoperatively tip projection was found to be satisfactory for 98% of the patients. Conclusions: The septocolumellar suture combined with caudal septal graft in closed rhinoplasty substantially facilitates the achievement of a cosmetically and functionally pleasing end result bringing the solution for a wide array of problems such as short nose supratip deformity nasolabial angle change or columellar bowing. Nevertheless the technique has a steep learning curve therefore a meticulous preoperative evaluation should be exerted a precise surgical planning should be prosecuted and an excessive reduction of the nasal tip or exaggerated columellar retraction should be avoided.;2016
Background: A complete subperichondrial and subperiosteal dissection technique during rhinoplasty may minimize soft tissue disruption resulting in less scar tissue formation and preservation of ligamentous structures. Objectives: The authors describe their results with subperichondrial dissection of the nasal framework and manipulation of the preserved nasal ligaments. Methods: The charts of 228 consecutive patients who underwent rhinoplasty with complete subperichondrial dissection via an open or closed approach between May 2008 and April 2011 with the senior author (BC) were retrospectively reviewed. Intraoperatively the scroll ligament and Pi midline ligament were repaired to stabilize the internal valve and tip position respectively. Results: Patients in this series (182 women 46 men) ranged in age from 18 to 54 years (mean 24.3 years). A total of 203 procedures were primary rhinoplasties 14 were secondary and 11 were revisions. The open approach was used in 92 patients whereas a closed dome delivery was used in the remaining 136 patients. Follow-up ranged from 9 months to 3 years. A complete subperichondrial dissection technique resulted in relatively limited edema and more rapid patient recovery compared with the authors' previous experience with the sub-superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) approach. Repeat elevation in the subperichondrial plane was easier and less traumatic in revision cases compared with secondary rhinoplasty cases. Conclusions: Subperichondrial dissection of the nasal framework allows reshaping and redraping of the nasal tip and controlled manipulation and repair of ligaments without disturbing the overlying soft tissue.;2012
Background: A low-to-low lateral osteotomy combined with a transverse osteotomy offers a reliable technique to mobilize the lateral walls in patients with broad bony vaults but variable brittling characteristics of the nasal bones near the radix make it difficult to guarantee the result of manual transverse osteotomy. Objectives: The author describes a split-thickness transverse osteotomy with the aid of an oscillating micro-saw under video/endoscopic control to eliminate the risk of probable pitfall fractures on the structure of the bony nasal vault near the radix during blind manual osteotomy. Methods: The author reviewed 1550 consecutive rhinoplasty and septorhinoplasty operations performed between April 2005 and October 2010. Among these the transverse osteotomy was used bilaterally in 1374 cases. Split-thickness transverse osteotomy was carried out with a powered micro-saw system from an endonasal approach under video/endoscopic control. CT-based 3D models of 16 patients with different functional indications were used to assess the mean depth of the transverse osteotomy line. Results: The mean depth of the nasal wall at the thickest point of the transverse osteotomy line near the radix was 2.5 +/- 0.66 mm. It decreased toward the medial canthus in all 16 patients. The mean thickness of bone was 1.2 +/- 0.21 mm in the medial canthal area. Conclusions: The oscillating micro-saw is a safe and pliable instrument to aid in transverse osteotomy during rhinoplasty. Video endoscopy provides an excellent view of the osteotomy site including direction and depth in addition to providing documentation for and education about the procedure.;2012
Background: A retrospective evaluation of the authors' 32 years of experience in revision rhinoplasty is presented. The authors suggest that iatrogenic nasal deformities are studied under four groups on the basis of their location and the affected structures: lower third middle third upper third and combined deformities. The authors also present the vertical columellar incision for insertion of alloplastic implants and cartilage grafts a genuine approach avoiding contamination with the nasal flora. Methods: A total of 182 cases were studied as follows: lower third (n = 81) middle third (n = 65) upper third (n = 17) and combined (n = 19) deformities. The mean age of the patients was 40 years. Results: Our follow-up was a minimum of 2 years and some of the cases with Proplast implants have been followed for as long as 21 years. During this rather long follow-up only two of the Proplast implants had to be removed (one because of an acute infection and the other because of a chronic infection causing extrusion after 5 years). Conclusions: The authors have always preferred to use autogenous cartilage grafts for tip deformities and Proplast implants for middle and upper third saddle nose deformities whenever necessary. Their long-term results with Proplast for more than 20 years show that alloplastic materials may be as reliable as autogenous implants if the surgical principles are met and the cases are carefully selected.;2005
Background: A successful rhinoplasty procedure requires a well-defined and properly projected nasal tip however surgical control of the nasal tip is difficult. The aim of this investigation was to assess the efficacy and safety of a modified suture technique which can be used to fix the caudal septal extension graft during primary rhinoplasty of the Asian population and revision septorhinoplasties of the Caucasian population and to compare it with those of other commonly used techniques. Methods: After peeling of perichondrium of scapular cartilages cartilage pieces of 3 x 1 cm in size and 2 mm in thickness were divided into two from the midline. These pieces were repaired end-to-end using three different repair techniques: two simple interrupted in Group A (n=40) vertical figure-of-eight in Group B (n=40) and modified vertical figure-of-eight (transloop) in Group C (n=40). All repaired cartilage specimens were subjected to a biomechanical analysis in which four different forces were applied: tension lateral bending shearing and buckling. Results: According to the tensile test Group C had statistically significantly higher strength than Group A at 2mm range. The lateral bending test similarly revealed that Group C had statistically significantly higher strength at 1.5 mm and 2mm range than Group A. However there was no statistically significant difference between the three groups in the assessment of shearing and buckling forces. Conclusion: The modified transloop suture technique provides a more stable repair and we consider that it can be used as an alternative suture repair method.

Background: A supratip deformity (SD) is an iatrogenic convexity that occurs in the cephalic region of the nasal tip. SD is still a major problem after rhinoplasty surgery. Objectives: With the method we have described a ligamentous flap was used to create a supratip transition with adjustable sharpness while the refinements of the tip rotation and definition were ensured. The aim of the study is to present the results of this technique which to the best of our knowledge has been described here for the first time. Methods: Our ligamentous flap technique was applied to 24 patients between August 2017 and March 2018. All of the patients were evaluated in terms of the formation of an SD a hanging columella tip projection and the loss of rotation at the postoperative followups. The photos of patients were evaluated by another independent plastic surgeon and patients themselves at 3 months after the surgery. Results: There were no early or late complications such as an infection excessive bleeding or prolonged edema. Moreover SDs hanging columellas tip projections and rotational losses which would require revisions were not detected in any of the patients. Postoperative scores given by the patients and surgeons were significantly higher than the preoperative values (P< 0.05). Only 2 patients required minor revisions due to dorsal irregularities in the upper 1/3 of the nasal segment. Conclusion: The early results of this Pitanguy composite flap technique which can be easily applied in every case with thin or thick skin in an open rhinoplasty are promising. However there is a need for an evaluation of the long-term results as well as the advantages and disadvantages in a larger case series.;2020
Background: Alar cartilage malposition is an anatomical variation. Axis of the lateral crus lies cephalically and can be parallel to the cephalic septum. The characterised findings of the malposition are broad and bulbous nasal tip abnormal lateral crural axes long alar creases that extend to the nostril rims alar wall hollows frequent nostril deformities and associated external valvular incompetence. This article presents a new technique for the repositioning of the lateral crus in this article. Methods: Open rhinoplasty was conducted. A cartilage Z plasty was performed on the lateral crus of the alar cartilage to treat for malposition. The 14 women and 8 men included in the study had an average age of 27 years (range 18-46 years). The average follow-up period was 12 months (range 4-20 months). Results: Alar cartilage malposition was successfully corrected in patients with aesthetic and functional improvements. Conclusions: Cartilage Z plasty can effectively correct alar cartilage malposition. Advantages of this technique can be listed as follows: it does not require extra graft material and protects the lateral crural complex it does not disrupt movements of the alar muscles and can also serve to adjust projection of the nasal tip.

Background: Alar notching retraction or soft triangle deformities have an important impact on rhinoplasty outcome. In this paper we present the results of an anatomical graft used to correct alar notching and the deformity in the soft triangle region. Patients and Methods: Twenty-four patients were included in the study (10: Female 14: Male). Following the open rhinoplasty steps the harvested cartilage grafts were reshaped in an ellipsoid fashion with a width of 0.5-1 mm a height of 4-6 mm and a length of 1.5-2 cm. These prepared grafts were placed under the intermedial crus and caudal part of the lateral crus. Results: In all patients except one alar notching and soft triangle deficiency were successfully treated. In one patient minimal notching persisted following the surgery and the patient did not want any revision surgery. We did not encounter gross absorption graft exposure graft visibility or recurrence of deformities in any patient. Conclusion: We think that this technique can be used in alar notching and soft triangle deformities whether for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes.;2019
Background: All grafts present the potential problem of late visibility distortion and (occasionally) absorption. To overcome these problems and obtain a smoother surface in 1989 the author initiated the use of finely diced cartilage wrapped in Surgicel. It is well known that the resolution of edema at the end of 1 year postoperatively is approximately 90 to 95 percent. Complete resolution continues until the end of 4 years postoperatively. However it is important to understand what occurs beyond 4 years and how the nose changes as the face ages. Methods: The author presents his experience of the past 25 years on 9398 primary and secondary rhinoplasty patients treated using his personal approach the Turkish delight. Patients with a postoperative range from 4 to 25 years were selected. Results: The Turkish delight type of cartilage graft (diced cartilage wrapped in Surgicel) has been free of late show complications often experienced with other types of tip grafts. Long-term results from 4 to 25 years are very satisfactory with an acceptably low complication rate. Conclusions: This technique is safe reliable effective simple and easily applicable by plastic surgeons at all levels of experience. Early and long-term results from 1 to 25 years are very satisfactory. The overall complication rate is very low compared with other techniques. In addition there is no late show as is sometimes seen with other types of cartilage grafts such as crushed oval or rectangular grafts.;2016
Background: Although hundreds of quality-of-life (QOL) studies are available in the literature very few were designed that include both a global and a procedure-specific evaluation of QOL and an inventory for the assessment of body image. The purpose of this study was to use condition-specific and global measures as well as psychological evaluations in a case series of rhinoplasties for a more comprehensive assessment of patient-reported outcomes. Methods: Records of 225 patients aged 18-57 years who underwent rhinoplasty were prospectively included in the study. Study participants completed both a baseline questionnaire before the rhinoplasty operation and a postsurgical patient questionnaire 12 months after the operation including the European QOL Questionnaire (EQ) Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation Questionnaire (ROE) and the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ). Results: Mean values corresponding to the EQ VAS results except for discomfort and anxiety domains increased after treatment compared with baseline. Both male and female patients experienced significant improvement in ROE scores with larger differences between pre- and postoperative ROE scores in male patients compared with female patients. The analyses of variance in the MBSRQ results revealed significant postsurgical improvements on the appearance orientation subscale. Conclusion: The development standardization and use of validated procedure-specific QOL tools are essential components for accurately measuring patient-reported outcomes of facial plastic surgery procedures. To measure patient satisfaction in a more objective and standardized manner specific questionnaires or instruments should be used that can determine the QOL changes associated with each procedure of interest.

Background: Although some studies about the effects of steroids on surgical. trauma in closed or combined (closed and open together) rhinoplasty have been reported in the literature still more information is needed in order to enlighten rhinoplasty surgeons. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti - inflammatory activity of steroids administered in high doses to prevent and decrease periorbital. ecchymosis and oedema in patients who underwent open rhinoplasty with osteotomies by the same surgeon. This is the first study in open rhinoplasty atone. Methods: The study was performed on 40 patients under general anaesthesia. Patients were divided randomly into five groups (eight patients in each group) the groups comprised: a single 250 mg dose of methylprednisolone (Group I) a single 500 mg dose of methylprednisolone (Group II) four 250 mg doses of methylprednisotone (Group III) four 500 mg doses of methylprednisotone (Group IV) and placebo (Group V). Digital photographs were taken of each patient on the first third and seventh postoperative days. Scorings of eyelid swelling and ecchymosis were evaluated separately using a graded scale from 0 to (+) 4 by three observers independently. Additionally blood samples were taken for the evaluations of C-reactive protein (CRP) white blood cell (WBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) on the same days. Results: Clinically and statistically significant difference was observed in the decrease of both ecchymosis and oedema between the placebo and high dose methylprednisolone groups which is effective to prevent and to decrease both the ecchymosis and oedema in open rhinoplasty with osteotomies. CRP was the most sensitive acute phase reactant among CRP ESR and WBC. No complication was observed due to steroid usage. Conclusions: We can confidently say that high dose methylprednisolone is effective in preventing and reducing both the periorbital ecchymosis and oedema in open rhinoplasty with osteotomies and it can be used safety for this purpose.

Background: An assessment of rhinoplasty from the patient's perspective in terms of satisfaction and quality of life is quite important because these are the predominant factors indicating the success of rhinoplasty. Aims: To translate the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation into Turkish and then validate the new version for use in Turkish patients. Study Design: Validation study. Methods: We enrolled 30 participants who were able to read and write Turkish and underwent primary rhinoplasty. The control group consisted of 58 healthy volunteers with no need for aesthetic or functional nasal surgery. The reliability of the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T was analyzed according to its internal consistency and test-retest reproducibility. Discriminant validity was calculated by comparing the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T scores between the patient and control groups. Responsiveness and sensitivity to changes in rhinoplasty outcomes were analyzed by comparing the patients' pre- and postoperative Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T scores. Results: The scores for questions 1-6 of the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T as well as the total scores were significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group (all p<0.05). In the patient group the scores for questions 1-6 of the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T as well as the total scores were higher postoperatively than preoperatively (all p<0.05). The scores for each Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T question as well as the total scores did not differ significantly with respect to test-retest reproducibility (all p>0.05). The internal consistency of the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T was high as evidenced by Cronbach's a values of 0.887 preoperatively and 0.798 postoperatively. Conclusion: The Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T constitutes a validated instrument with which to measure rhinoplasty outcomes among Turkish patients.;2019
Background: An important consideration in rhinoplasty is maintenance of the applied tip rotation. Different techniques have been proposed to accomplish this. Loss of rotation after surgery not only results in a derotated tip but also can create a supratip deformity. Objectives: As a supplement to dorsal reconstruction the authors introduced and applied the lateral crural rein flap technique whereby cartilage flaps are created from the cephalic portion of the lateral crura to control and stabilize tip rotation. Methods: Eleven patients underwent primary open-approach rhinoplasty that included the lateral crural rein technique the mean follow-up time was 18 months. Excess cephalic portions of the lateral crura were prepared as medial crura-based cartilaginous flaps and were incorporated into the nasal dorsum (similar to spreader grafts) and stabilized to achieve the desired tip rotation. Results: The lateral crural rein flap technique provided stability to the nasal tip while minimizing derotation in the postoperative period. Long-term follow-up revealed maintenance of the nasal tip rotation and symmetric dorsal aesthetic lines. Conclusions: The lateral crural rein flap technique is effective for controlling nasal tip rotation while reducing lateral crural cephalic excess. Longevity of the applied tip rotation is reinforced by secure attachment of the lower nasal cartilage complex to the midvault structures.;2014
Background: Anatomical structures of the nose (including muscles) are elevated sutured or reshaped during rhinoplasty. Electromyography and electroneurography are the objective electrophysiologic tests performed for the direct measurement of nasal muscle function. Objectives: The authors investigate the predictive values and functional status of nasal muscles during voluntary facial and nasal movements following open and closed rhinoplasty. Methods: In 48 patients who underwent rhinoplasty surface electrodes were placed to preoperatively and postoperatively measure nasal muscle function with electromyography and electroneurography. Results were analyzed according to whether the patient had undergone open or closed rhinoplasty. Results: Electroneurography amplitudes were decreased postoperatively on both sides in both groups. This increase was statistically significant (p < .001). Electromyography-recorded amplitude of nasal muscle contraction tension significantly decreased postoperatively in response to all voluntary movements in two cases in the closed rhinoplasty group (6.6%) and in two cases in the open rhinoplasty group (11.1%). In essence the activity strength of the nasal muscles decreased postoperatively for some patients. The mean differences between the two groups were not statistically significant (p = .280). Conclusions: The data showed no meaningful difference in injury to the nasal muscular layer between open and closed rhinoplasty.;2011
Background: Augmentation mentoplasty is a common procedure applied especially in conjunction with rhinoplasty. Although various materials have been used for this procedure diced high-density porous polyethylene (Medpor) has not been used so far. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of diced high-density porous polyethylene in chin augmentation. Methods: A subperiosteal. pocket is prepared through submental incision. A high-density porous polyethylene block is diced into 1 X 1.5-mm pieces to be placed into the subperiosteal pocket as much as needed by wrapping into oxidized cellulose (Surgicel). Immediately after the incision is closed shaping with external massage is performed and an external bandage is applied. Results: This procedure was performed in 20 patients in addition to rhinoplasty with a mean follow-up of 14 months (range 8 to 20 months). Five to 14 mm of augmentation was achieved. There were no complications except for early seroma formation in three patients which required aspiration by syringe. It is easy to give shape to diced high-density porous polyethylene by means of massage 3 weeks after surgery. Conclusions: Diced high-density porous polyethylene in augmentation mentoplasty is cheap easy to insert and moldable by external massage and has flexibility in conforming to the shape of the mandible. It also avoids all the disadvantages of monobloc implants allowing postoperative ingrowth of fibrous tissues precluding late displacement and giving a natural feel to the reconstructed area.;2007
Background: Bleeding during rhinoplasty leads to many undesirable effects such as loss of vision in the surgery area complications during the procedure and postoperative complications. The most important effect that increases bleeding is hemodynamic changes during surgery. Considering that osteotomy is the most challenging process in rhinoplasty this study aimed to examine the hemodynamic changes during osteotomy and changes in the depth of anesthesia. Methods: A total of 50 patients aged 18 to 65 years with an ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) score of 1 and 2 who underwent osteotomy during rhinoplasty under general anesthesia were examined retrospectively. After routine monitoring the patients underwent general anesthesia induction and endotracheal intubation. Before the surgery they received remifentanil 1 mu g/kg as an intravenous bolus followed by 0.5 mu g/(kg center dot min) as intravenous infusion until the end of the surgery. The hemodynamic parameters and depth of anesthesia [bispectral index (BIS) values] of the patients were examined before anesthesia 10 minutes before osteotomy during osteotomy and 10 minutes after osteotomy. Results: A significant difference was found in heart rate (beats/min) systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mm Hg) and BIS values of the patients measured before during and after osteotomy (P < 0.001). The heart rate systolic and diastolic blood pressures and BIS values were significantly higher during osteotomy. Until the 10th minute after osteotomy all 4 parameters nearly reached the values measured before osteotomy. Conclusions: Osteotomy directly affects hemodynamic parameters and depth of anesthesia. Hence it is of utmost importance that the analgesic need and depth of anesthesia are adequately monitored and adjusted during osteotomy. By suppressing hemodynamic stress responses the amount of bleeding can be reduced thus increasing the surgical success and the patient's comfort.;2020
Background: Cartilage grafting has been used extensively to correct the nasal framework in traumatic and postrhinoplasty nasal deformities. Autologous cartilage grafts yield satisfactory reconstructive results but their use is limited by donor-site morbidity patient choice the requirement for increased operative time and the lack of a sufficient quantity and availability of tissue for more extensive deformities. Alternatively preserved costal cartilage homograft represents a readily available easily contoured material. Methods: The preserved costal cartilage homograft has been used by the authors on 68 patients over the past 5 years: in 52 patients with postrhinoplasty deformity and in 16 patients with traumatic nasal deformity. In cases with more severe nasal depression the cartilage graft was carved and placed over the remaining septum in block form. The Turkish Delight technique which was initially described by Erol was used in cases of mild to moderate nasal depression. The cartilage graft was diced into 0.5- to 1-mm pieces. The diced cartilage mass was then wrapped in Surgicel and inserted under the dorsal nasal skin. Results: Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 5 years. During this period no major complications were noted and satisfactory results were obtained. Recurrence of the dorsal depression was seen in five patients and required repeated augmentation. The complication and revision rates were acceptable. Conclusions: This technique seems to be effective for augmentation of the nose shortens the operative time significantly by eliminating graft harvest and avoids donor-site morbidity. Therefore it is recommended for nasal augmentation and contouring for traumatic and postrhinoplasty nasal deformities.;2005
Background: Cartilage grafts are frequently used in nasal surgery for structural and/or aesthetic purposes. The literature holds contradictory reports concerning the effect of crushing on the viability of cartilage grafts. Methods: Nasal septal and costal cartilage grafts were harvested from 12 New Zealand rabbits. Each nasal septal and costal cartilage was divided into five equal pieces. One of the pieces was left intact and the remaining four were prepared as slightly moderately severely or significantly crushed. The cartilage pieces were then autoimplanted into the paravertebral skin of the rabbits. The animals were euthanized 4 months later and the effect of crushing on cartilage grafts was assessed pathologically. Results: The viability of the chondrocytes was found to be decreased as the level of crushing increased. The mean chondrocyte viability rates for the intact slightly crushed moderately crushed severely crushed and significantly crushed cartilages were 88 75 51 41 and 13 percent for the septal cartilages and 94 83 62 32 and 26 percent for the costal cartilages respectively. The differences between the mean viability rates of septal and costal cartilage groups were statistically not significant. Conclusions: The level of crushing determines the rate of viability for the crushed cartilage. Viability rates and the clinical properties of the slightly crushed cartilage grafts at long-term follow-up may be similar to those of the intact cartilage grafts. However severe or significant crushing leads to a decrement in the viability of the chondrocytes and may cause unpredictable degrees of volume loss at long-term follow-up. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 128: 1045 2011.);2011
Background: Cartilage grafts are routinely used in secondary and posttraumatic rhinoplasty. However in most cases there are weak areas in the nasal bones and upper lateral cartilages. The purpose of this study was to seek a solution for the keystone area and dorsum of the nose in revision and posttraumatic rhinoplasty cases and reconstruction of saddle nose deformity including upper lateral cartilage with a roof-shaped graft. Methods: A retrospective review of reconstructive rhinoplasties performed for saddle nose deformities was conducted. A part of the costochondral graft was carved and thinned (roof graft) for reconstruction of the keystone area and upper lateral cartilages and another portion was used for making a neoseptal (reconstructed septum) graft and strut graft. The roof graft was capped onto the neoseptal graft with sutures and this cartilage framework was adapted with fitting the cranial edge of the neoseptal cartilage between the nasal bones. Finally the strut graft was fixed to the cartilage framework. Results: A significant improvement in nasal shape and overall appearance was achieved in all cases and 71.42 percent of patients recovered from nasal obstruction. No gross absorption graft exposure or recurrence of deformities was observed. Conclusions: Surgical correction of a saddle-shaped nose should be an acceptable and uncomplicated technique and the cosmetic result should be totally acceptable. There are many management options for a saddle-shaped nose. Use of roof grafts (shrunk gull-wing grafts) with neoseptal and strut grafts enables simulation of the internal nasal valve and results in a natural nasal position.;2018
Background: Considering that revision rhinoplasty is one of the most difficult plastic surgical procedures evaluating patient satisfaction is fundamental in order to determine success and identify variables that may affect the outcomes. Our first study objective was to determine satisfaction levels in revision patients and to compare results with those obtained in primary rhinoplasty patients. Second we sought to identify factors that may influence the degree of satisfaction. Methods: Satisfaction was evaluated in 54 revision and 54 primary rhinoplasty patients using the rhinoplasty outcome evaluation questionnaire. To identify associated factors patients were assessed for demographic characteristics medical history follow-up time reason for revision graft usage the severity of nasal deformity and satisfaction with the provided care and information given before the surgery. Results: All revision and primary rhinoplasty patients experienced improvements in satisfaction scores. Although the improvements were higher in primary rhinoplasty patients the levels obtained in revision patients can be considered high. We found that young and male patients tend to have less satisfaction increment after the surgery. Patients who underwent revision for aesthetic reasons had higher improvements in satisfaction scores when compared to those patients who underwent revision for a combination of aesthetic and functional reasons. The improvement in satisfaction scores in patients who were satisfied with the information given before surgery was higher. Conclusion: Our data suggest that significant patient satisfaction is achieved after revision rhinoplasty and highlight the importance of the informed consent process when planning revision especially on young and male patients.;2016
Background: Diced cartilage grafts have long been used in rhinoplasty. Along with their various reported advantages they also have some disadvantages. The irregular resorption rate of the engrafted mass is one of the major issues noted with diced cartilage grafts. An explanation for the unpredictable resorption rate has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to determine the role of traumatized versus nontraumatized cartilage as the source of diced cartilage grafts. Methods: This study included the noses of 32 patients (19 traumatized noses and 13 nontraumatized noses) who underwent surgery using Surgicel-wrapped diced cartilage grafts. Results: The most remarkable result noted in this study was that a Surgicel-wrapped diced cartilage graft if prepared from traumatized cartilage (in 19 patients) failed to maintain a stable long-term volume. Partial volume loss was noted in 100% of these patients. However the rate of this partial resorption was different for every individual and could not be predicted. The highest retention of cartilage graft volume was seen primarily over the nasal osseocartilaginous junction. In nontraumatized patients however the engrafted mass maintained long-term volume stability. These patients evidenced no visible external irregularities and only a few very slight imperfections were noted with finger palpation. Conclusion: Diced cartilage of traumatic origin is not recommended for any purpose. In such cases the authors' engrafting algorithm consists of autobone or ear conchal cartilage grafts for dorsal augmentation columellar struts from the nontraumatized part of the septum and spreader grafts from the nontraumatized part of the septum or ear concha.;2007
Background: Dorsal hump reduction is a critical step in rhinoplasty. Most of the reasons behind revisional procedures are related to incorrect hump reduction. Methods: The authors used a modified dorsal hump reduction method in their primary cases the steps of which are as follows: 1) dissection of the nasal vault 2) bilateral submucoperichondrial dissections to free the cartilaginous septum 3) separation of the upper lateral cartilages from the cartilaginous septum 4) partial dissection of the upper lateral cartilages from the inner surfaces of the nasal bones bilaterally 5) separation of the bony septum from the nasal bones bilaterally 6) reduction of the partially isolated nasal bones 7) en bloc cartilaginous and bony septum removal. The authors have operated on 68 primary cases over a 2 year period (30 mo). Results: In the great majority of cases the results were satisfactory. No revisions were performed in this patient group. Conclusions: This method is a good alternative to traditional techniques in noses with a high and narrow roof thin skin and weak middle nasal vault. Revision could be performed more easily when required. Initially wide noses may not seem good candidates for this procedure however careful case-based preoperative planning may overcome this difficulty.;2007
Background: Dorsum augmentation is one of the most delicate components of rhinoplasty. Although various solid grafts have been used in the past for this purpose diced cartilage grafts wrapped in fascia have become popular in recent decades. In this study the authors analyze and discuss the results of using diced cartilage grafts wrapped in rectus abdominis muscle fascia for dorsal augmentation. Methods: Nasal dorsum augmentation using the diced cartilage wrapped in rectus abdominis fascia technique was performed on 109 patients between 2008 and 2014. Six patients were primary cases 69 patients were secondary and 18 were tertiary. Sixteen patients had previously undergone more than three operations. In all patients the rectus abdominis fascia was harvested with the described technique and wrapped around the diced cartilages obtained from the costal cartilage. Results: The average follow-up period was 19.6 months (range 6 to 47 months). Satisfactory results were obtained with acceptable complications and revision rates. Three patients underwent reoperation because of overcorrection. Insufficient augmentation was seen in five patients. In four patients infection developed after postoperative day 5. One patient complained of a hypertrophic scar on the donor site. None of the patients showed any symptoms indicating an abdominal hernia. Conclusions: Techniques using diced cartilage grafts wrapped in fascia have now become the gold standard for dorsal augmentations. When it is considered that secondary cases requiring dorsal augmentation are usually those also needing costal cartilage grafts rectus abdominis fascia becomes a useful carrier for diced cartilages which is in the same donor area. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.;2016
Background: Emergence agitation (EA) is a clinical condition that occurs early in recovery from general anaesthesia and reduces patient comfort. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of low-flow sevoflurane anaesthesia and total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) on agitation in rhinoplasty patients and to determine the frequency of EA in low flow sevoflurane anaesthesia after rhinoplasty. Material and methods: A total of 90 rhinoplasty patients under general anaesthesia were included in this prospective randomised study. After induction of anaesthesia propofol infusion was initiated in the TIVA group (n = 45) and sevoflurane was administered in the SEVO group with a fresh gas flow of 1 l/min and MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) 1-1.1 (n = 45). Early emergence times Richmond agitation-sedation scale (RASS) Boezaart scale Likert scale and incidences of nausea/vomiting were recorded at the end of surgery. Results: Early emergence time was significantly shorter in the TIVA group than in the SEVO group (p < 0.001). Intraoperative bleeding was significantly lower in the TIVA group than in the SEVO group (p = 0.005) and surgical field image quality and surgeon satisfaction were better in the TIVA group (p = 0.016 p < 0.001). The ratio of patients with RASS > +1 for all patients was 35.6% at 0 min postoperatively. This rate was 12.2% (n = 11) in the TIVA group and 23.3% (n = 21) in the SEVO group (p = 0.028). Conclusions: In rhinoplasty TIVA caused shorter early emergence times less bleeding high surgeon satisfaction and lower EA scores when compared with low flow sevoflurane anaesthesia.;2020
Background: Excessive concavity of the lower lateral crura can cause significant aesthetic problems for the nasal tip and can be associated with significant functional problems such as insufficiencies in the external nasal valve. Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop a novel technique for the improvement of several alar concavities that preserve the scroll area. Methods: In this retrospective study 51 primary rhinoplasty patients with unoperated alar concavity deformities were assessed. Alar concavities were repaired with alar strut grafts and a superior transposition flap or superior-based sliding flap which were designed with the sandwich technique. Additionally the scroll ligament was completely preserved in the 2 variants of the technique. All patients who were included in the study were assessed with the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaire before surgery and at their 1-year follow-up appointment. Results: The median age of patients was 29.2 years (range 19-49 years). The ROE scores ranged between 90 and 100 points after 1 year. The median score was 91.2 points and this was significantly increased at the 1-year follow-up appointment (P=0.002). Patient satisfaction was found to be excellent in 92% of the included patients. Patients were also evaluated in terms of functionality. The patients' patency scores increased to 9.4 from 6.1 (out of 10) after a 12-month follow-up (P=0.003). Conclusions: This sandwich technique involves a combination of superior transposition flaps superior-based sliding flaps and alar strut grafts. Thus patients who receive this treatment may also benefit from new flap techniques and vertical and longitudinal scroll ligament preservation. This new technique presents a novel and easy method for the reconstruction of severe alar concavities.;2020
Background: Facial aesthetic treatments are among the most popular cosmetic procedures worldwide but the factors that motivate women to change their facial appearance are not fully understood. Objectives: The authors examine the relationships among the facial areas on which women focus most as they age women's general self-perception and the effect of their personal focus on beauty points on their perception of other women's faces. Methods: In this prospective study 200 women who presented to a cosmetic surgery outpatient clinic for consultation between December 2009 and February 2010 completed a questionnaire. The 200 participants were grouped by age: 20-29 years 30-39 40-49 and 50 or older (50 women in each group). They were asked which part of their face they focus on most when looking in the mirror which part they notice most in other women (of different age groups) what they like/dislike most about their own face and whether they wished to change any facial feature. Results: A positive correlation was found between women's focal points and the areas they dislike or desire to change. Younger women focused mainly on their nose and skin while older women focused on their periorbital area and jawline. Women focus on their personal focal points when looking at other women in their 20s and 30s but not when looking at older women. Conclusions: Women presenting for cosmetic surgery consultation focus on the areas that they dislike most which leads to a desire to change those features. The plastic surgeon must fully understand patients' expectations to select appropriate candidates and maximize satisfaction with the outcomes.;2012
Background: Free diced cartilage smaller than 0.2 mm in diameter to smoothen the nasal dorsum is a well-known procedure. However creating smaller diced cartilage takes a really long time. In contrast the free diced cartilage technique has some visibility problems especially in thin-skin patients although a fine job is done to chop the cartilage. The author aimed to present the ultra diced cartilage graft and the way to achieve it to eliminate the problems of diced cartilage during rhinoplasty and compare it with free diced cartilage grafting technique. Methods: Between April of 2015 and December of 2018 the ultra diced cartilage graft technique in 104 patients and the free diced cartilage graft technique in 113 patients were used to smoothen the dorsum or augment the radix/dorsum. Operation records rhinoplasty outcome evaluation questionnaire palpation test and evaluation of the immediate postoperative photographs on the table with postoperative 1-year postoperative photographs by two independent blinded plastic surgeons were analyzed. Results: Ultra diced cartilage seemed superior to free diced cartilage grafting with regard to graft visibility and resorption. Conclusions: Ultra diced cartilage graft is an effective and easily reproducible technique in rhinoplasty. There is no extra cost and it is the easiest and fastest way to have this perfectly pliable cartilage have no dead space. The ultra diced cartilage grafting technique should be known by all plastic surgeons to achieve fineness in rhinoplasty.;2021
Background: Historically one of the most persistent challenges to the rhinoplasty surgeon has been the thick heavy and poorly defined nasal tip. In the Mediterranean Anatolian and Middle Eastern regions rhinoplasty is the most frequently performed aesthetic procedure. In these regions the ethnic characteristic of the nasal tip is mostly broad with thick skin a poorly defined nasal tip and weak lower lateral cartilages which makes shaping the tip challenging. In this population conventional rhinoplasty techniques may result in dissatisfied patients and surgeons. Methods: The author presents his experience over the past 20 years with 3800 rhinoplasty patients with broad noses treated using his personal approach. Results: Using the Turkish delight type of cartilage graft (diced cartilage wrapped in Surgicel) for the tip region and the columellar strut improved the author's results considerably giving the tip the desired form and eliminating the complications of late show seen in other types of tip grafts. In patients with very short columellae insertion of a secondary strut was necessary after 1 year. Conclusions: This technique is safe reliable effective simple and easily applicable by plastic surgeons at all experience levels. Early and late results are very satisfactory and there is no late show as is sometimes seen with other types of cartilage grafts such as crushed oval or rectangular grafts. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 130: 185 2012.);2012
Background: Hormonal changes that take place during the menstrual cycle may have an effect on perioperative bleeding. Previous studies have confirmed a relationship between the menstrual cycle and surgical bleeding in rhinoplasty and breast reduction surgery yet both surgical sites display changes in accordance with sex hormone levels during the menstrual phase. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the menstrual cycle on perioperative bleeding when undergoing surgeries of sites not directly related to menstrual hormonal changes. Materials and methods: Forty-one patients undergoing abdominoplasty were grouped as group A - perimenstrual (0-7 21-28 days) group B - periovulatory (8-20 days) and group C - post-menopausal. Intra-operative blood loss was calculated during surgery while postoperative blood loss was determined by measuring the amount of drainage. All menstrual data were recorded. Age body mass index and weight of the resected tissue were also considered as factors that can affect the amount of bleeding and therefore were also evaluated in terms of significance. Results: There was no significant difference between groups regarding intra-operative and postoperative blood loss. Body mass index and weight of the resected tissue had a strong influence on the time of drain removal and the amount of intra-operative and postoperative blood loss. Conclusion: This study strongly suggests that the menstrual period does not affect perioperative blood loss for operations on areas less sensitive to sex hormone levels such as the abdomen. In light of the results we can conclude that the patient's menstrual date is not of vital importance regarding perioperative blood loss when planning surgery for areas with less sensitivity to menstrual hormonal changes.

Background: Hump recurrence is a commonly encountered problem following dorsal preservation (DP) rhinoplasty when surgeons are learning the procedure. Objectives: The aim of this paper was to compare the different methods for the prevention and treatment of dorsal problems following DP surgery. Methods: One hundred and fifty primary rhinoplasty patients were included in our study. Their noses were classified in terms of both hump shape (V- or S-shaped) and height. All patients had a DP rhinoplasty by either a push-down (PD) or a let-down (LD) technique. The PD method was used for humps <4 mm and the LD for humps >4 mm. Follow-up evaluations were made with physical examination and photographs at 1 week 3 months and 12 months. Results: Mean follow-up was 12.68 [1.78] months. Seventy-eight humps were V-shaped and 72 were S-shaped. PD was used for 67 cases LD for 83 cases. Eight patients (5.3% 8/150) had a visible dorsal hump problem after DP surgery. Based on their preoperative hump shape 3 cases were V-shaped and 5 were S-shaped. All recurrent cases had a preoperative hump deformity >4 mm. The revision procedures were as follows: 4 patients had a PD procedure 3 had a LD procedure and 1 patient was treated by classic open resection rhinoplasty. Conclusions: There is a correlation between preoperative hump height and eventual hump recurrence. The complication rate can be decreased with additional technical maneuvers and proper patient selection.;2021
BACKGROUND: Hump reduction with manual osteotomy is an invasive procedure in aesthetic rhinoplasty. OBJECTIVE: We describe powered micro saw osteotomy as an effective alternative to manual hump removal. METHODS: Powered micro saw osteotomy was performed to reduce the bony hump layer by layer to reach the intended level. The edges of the open roof were softened with a powered reciprocating rasp. Shielded burrs were used to remove minimal bony prominences as needed. RESULTS: Between April 2005 and February 2007 the author performed 332 primary rhinoplasty and septorhinoplasty procedures. Hump reduction with powered micro saw osteotomy was performed in 259 cases including 127 with moderate humps (3 to 4 mm) 112 with large humps (5 to 6 mm) and 20 with very large humps (7 to 8 mm). Satisfactory results were maintained in all cases with minimal revision in 10 cases and no complications. CONCLUSIONS: Powered micro saw osteotomy provides a less invasive approach to bony hump reduction and prevents the multiple complications associated with manual osteotomies. (Aesthetic Surg J 200928:6-11.);2009
Background: Hump removal frequently results in an open roof during rhinoplasty which is conventionally closed with lateral osteotomies are problematic. However if the patient has a narrow bony vault lateral osteotomics are problematic. in this article the author presents a new and practical approach to fix the open roof deformity. Methods: A total of 240 patients (female n = 187 male n = 53) were enrolled and operated on with the presented technique. This approach has four steps as follows: complete submembranous dissection preparation of spreader flaps harvesting of bone dust from the bony hump and placement of the bone dust. The patient's nasal dorsum was evaluated by it ultrasonography. During the follow-up period all patients were photographed postoperatively from standard views using a digital camera. Photographs were inspected by two independent plastic surgeons. A palpation test for the nasal dorsum was conducted by a senior surgeon to identify any irregularities. A rhinoplasty outcomes evaluation questionnaire was administered to all patients at a 1-year follow-up visit. Functional improvement was assessed with self-evaluation of nasal patency. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the 240 patients 182 completed the 1-year follow-up period and rhinoplasty outcomes evaluation questionnaire. Thirty-seven patients were evaluated by ultrasonography at 1 year postoperatively. During the follow-up period no resorption or displacement was detected. High patient satisfaction was achieved and no complications were encountered. Conclusion: The presented four-step surgical concept was useful for rhinoplasty surgeons to successfully manage open roof deformity in selected patients.;2018
Background: In deviated noses a beveled hump resection is recommended to preserve the shorter nasal wall. Even with this precaution in some patients the shorter wall does not reach the planned dorsal level when the lateral wall is transposed toward the midline after the lateral osteotomy. Method: A double-layered stepped spreader graft was used on the shorter wall side to construct symmetrical lateral nasal walls. The composite graft was constructed by fixing a smaller cartilage graft to the side of the dorsal border of a slightly larger than normal standard spreader graft. The smaller graft component adds height to the shorter lateral wall while the larger one functions as a usual spreader graft. Results: Stepped spreader grafts were used in 4 primary and 2 secondary rhinoplasty cases. All compound grafts were harvested from the septal cartilage except for one of the secondary cases in which auricular cartilage was used. Two patients received a usual spreader graft on the contralateral side. Postoperatively none of the patients exhibited significant recurrent deviation and acceptable symmetrical dorsal esthetic lines were obtained in all patients. Conclusion: This technique should be considered whenever the height of the lateral wall is shorter than desired after centralization of a deviated nose. Reconstruction of the shorter wall by adding height with a stepped spreader graft results in a more stable dorsum that resists relapse. Dorsal esthetic lines can also be reconstructed at the same time.;2009
Background: In this study patients who required aesthetic revision surgery after open rhinoplasty were retrospectively screened for risk factors. Methods: Two hundred fifty-two patients who underwent revision were included in the study. Nasal deformities before the revision were determined for each patient and evaluated in terms of their statistical relationship with preoperative nasal morphology and surgical techniques used. Results: The revision rate was found to be 10.8 percent. The three most common aesthetic reasons for revision were insufficient nasal tip rotation (37.7 percent) hanging columella (30.2 percent) and supratip deformity (28.6 percent). According to logistic regression analysis the use of a strut increased the risk of inadequate nasal tip rotation by 5.3-fold compared to the tongue-in-groove technique whereas inadequate nasal tip projection before surgery increased this risk by 2-fold. Being older than 40 years increased the risk of hanging columella by 6.8-fold whereas the use of strut grafting instead of the tongue-in-groove technique increased this risk by 5.9-fold. The use of strut grafts instead of the tongue-in-groove technique increased the risk of supratip deformity by 2.2-fold. Conclusions: To ensure adequate nasal tip rotation after surgery in patients with advanced age and low nasal tip projection and rotation it will be more appropriate to either use the tongue-in-groove technique or rotate the nasal tip more than normal. In patients with advanced age (>40 years) and low nasolabial angle before surgery the use of tongue-in-groove technique instead of strut grafting may be advantageous for reducing the incidence of supratip and hanging columella.;2021
Background: In this study the authors aimed to investigate the use of spreader and determine the efficacy and superiority of different spreader techniques in septorhinoplasty in terms of nasal and olfactory functions. Methods: A total of 60 patients who had undergone septorhinoplasty with the open technique were included in the study. In addition to open septorhinoplasty 20 patients also underwent bilateral spreader graft placement and 20 bilateral spreader flap placement. For the remaining 20 patients open septorhinoplasty was performed without spreader grafts or flaps. The patients completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale consisting of five questions and the Brief Smell Identification Test was used to detect olfactory dysfunction. Results: The preoperative mean NOSE score of all patients was 10.87 (1-18) while the postoperative mean value was 1.83 (0-10). The preoperative mean olfactory score was 6.23 +/- 2.20 in all patients while it was 7.33 +/- 1.75 postoperatively. There was a statistically significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative NOSE and olfactory scores in all patients but no statistically significant difference was observed between the three groups. Conclusion: Spreader graft or flap techniques used in septorhinoplasty are safe in terms of nasal obstruction and olfactory function and there is no statistically significant difference between them.;2021
Background: In this study we aimed to present a novel application and use of Kirschner wire-guided suturing that is less invasive and allows permanent fixation for nasal dorsal reconstruction. Methods: A total of 23 patients who underwent surgery between 2009 and 2013 were included in this study: 19 with saddle nose deformity and 4 patients with keystone area damage or collapse of the dorsal nasal support during primary septoplasty or rhinoplasty. The patients were asked to fill out a nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) scale preoperatively and at the postoperative sixth month to assess breathing quality. The patients were followed up for complications such as nasal dorsal contour irregularity dorsal collapse as well as graft malposition and infections. The results of the surgeries were assessed on the basis of preoperative and postoperative examinations septal support test NOSE scale results and photographic comparison. Results: The mean (SD) NOSE scales were 78.91 (10.09) and 30.48 (10.71) in the preoperative and postoperative periods respectively. The difference of mean NOSE scale was statistically significant (P < 0.001). None of the patients experienced nasal dorsal collapse or graft malposition. Two patients had nasal dorsal irregularity complaints owing to inadequate costal cartilage edge beveling. None of the patients had complications of suture reaction suture visibility or suture extrusion. All of the patients stated that they were happy with the cosmetic outcome. Conclusions: Permanent sutures introduced through channels made with the Kirschner wire provide a less invasive cosmetically pleasing and functional solution promising more reliable results in the long term.;2015
Background: Injectable fillers are sometimes necessary to correct slight skin irregularities. However there have been reports of necrosis after injection of alloplastic materials and heterogeneous transplants. On the other hand the advantages of autogenous tissue grafts over those fillers are well established. Volumetric reshaping of the face with autologous tissue injection is a popular and reliable method with good long-term results. However procedures performed on the fragile skin of the nose are prone to complications. Objectives: The author conducted a study of injectable autologous microfat grafting to the nose in patients with secondary nasal deformities. Methods: During a 5-year period 313 patients who had secondary nasal deformities with slight skin irregularities or severe nasal skin damage were treated with microfat grafting. At each patient's first injection session excess harvested fat was cryopreserved for subsequent injection. To correct minor irregularities 0.3 to 0.8 mL of microfat was injected during each session for major irregularities or defects 1 to 6 mL was required for each session. Results: One to 3 injections of microfat provided satisfactory results in all patients who had minor irregularities. For patients with multiple and severe irregularities 3 to 6 injections were necessary and resulted in high patient satisfaction. In another group of patients with severe traumatic skin damage 6 to 16 injections were necessary for reconstruction. After repeated injections each patient's skin damage was repaired. Conclusions: Autologous microfat injection appears to be safe and effective for correcting slight irregularities of the nose.;2014
Background: Late correction of cleft lip nose deformity continues to be a challenge because of the weakness of cartilages and the collapsing forces of tight contracted soft tissues. The authors describe the new technique of costal cartilage spring graft for columella and lower lateral cartilage as a block to achieve symmetric aesthetically more durable and acceptable results for the late correction of cleft lip nose deformity. Methods: Late cleft lip nose repair with simultaneous rhinoplasty was performed in 92 patients with unilateral cleft lip nose deformity. For correction of cleft lip nose deformity a strut graft 2 to 3 mm in width 0.5 to 1 mm in thickness and 5 to 7 cm in length was prepared from costal cartilage (autograft or allograft). The strut graft was curved and bowed with fingers to simulate the medial and lateral crura of the alar cartilage. A crescent-shaped skin excision from the alar rim and a vertical incision in the columella were made. The intercrural and alar areas were dissected to create sufficient space for the insertion of a bow-shaped spring cartilage graft. After insertion of the cartilage graft the alar rim was closed with continuous 6-0 Monocryl and the columella was closed with 5-0 Vicryl. Results: Correction of depressed alar cartilage and webbing lengthening the columella using spring costal cartilage and symmetric nostrils were achieved in all cases. The mean follow-up period was 5 years (range 2 to 15 years). Conclusion: These procedures septoplasty and simultaneous rhinoplasty provided long-term satisfactory results in the late correction of cleft lip nose deformity.;2021
Background: Management of nasal tip projection and support for positioning of the tip represent an important part of rhinoplasty operations that must be handled properly for a final satisfying result. Manipulation of the nasal tip is complex and variable. Plastic surgeons use many techniques to achieve this goal. Methods: The authors propose that the caudal septal advancement technique be used to manipulate the positioning of the nasal tip especially in cases of an underprojected tip and those requiring tip support. The authors prepare a rectangular septal cartilage which after advancement carries the nasal tip to the desired position. Results: This technique is easy to use and the results are dependable. All the patients who underwent surgery with this technique were satisfied with the result. Conclusion: The caudal septal advancement technique presents another good and reliable alternative for managing nasal tip projection and support.;2006
Background: Many surgical technique have been described for repair of nasal septal perforations with different success rates. This study aimed to describe authors' surgical technique and discuss its results as well as those reported in the literature. Methods: Nineteen patients with nasal septal perforation were operated on between March 2009 and February 2015 at Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty. The technique described in this article closure of the perforation with unilateral upper lateral cartilage inner mucoperichondrial flap and inferior meatal advancement flap is an alternative surgical technique. Results: Nineteen patients with symptomatic nasal septal perforation were operated with this technique. All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon. Neither intraoperative nor postoperative major complications were observed in any patients. Preoperative and postoperative symptom scores for nasal obstruction epistaxis nasal discharge crusting whistling snoring and olfactory loss as well as overall discomfort levels were compared using a visual analog scale. Complete closure of the perforation was achieved in 18 patients (95%). Conclusions: Small and large perforations may be reliably closed with this technique. Also this technique can be easily applied via closed or external approach.;2016
Background: Middle crura support deficiency and short middle crura can usually cause insufficient definition and projection of the tip and can sometimes result in a flat tip. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a new technique involving a tip reinforcement flap to strengthen the middle crura and to achieve a well-projected and defined tip. Methods: Twenty-nine patients who underwent primary open-approach rhinoplasty that included the use of tip reinforcement flaps were included in the study. Cartilage flaps that had been created from the excess cephalic portion of the lateral crura were prepared as medial crura-based cartilaginous flaps. Results: There were 29 patients (17 women 12 men) aged 18 to 44 years (mean age 31 years). Follow-up time ranged between 3 and 25 months (mean 21 months). Preoperative and postoperative average of nasal tip length was 10.84 (+/- 1.07) mm and 14.32 (+/- 2.34) mm respectively (P = 0.0214). Preoperative and postoperative average of nasolabial angle was 97.42 degrees (+/- 9.84 degrees) and 107.99 degrees (+/- 12.16 degrees) respectively (P = 0.0344). Preoperative and postoperative average of nasal projection ratio was 0.53 (+/- 0.04) and 0.57 (+/- 0.03) respectively (P = 0.4347). The tip reinforcement flap technique provided strengthening and extra support for the middle crura and increased definition projection and stability to the domal area. Conclusions: The tip reinforcement flap technique offers advantages for tip plasty in those cases with middle crural deficiency short middle crura and middle crural weakness. The technique also provides an additional projection stabilization and definition to the nasal tip while reducing lateral crural cephalic excess. This technique improves nostril-lobular disproportion and has the advantage of hiding extra support grafted into the folded flap. Complications such as graft visibility malposition and asymmetry which may occur with the use of classic tip grafts can be eliminated with the tip reinforcement flap technique.;2019
Background: Nasal base retraction results from cephalic malposition of the alar base in the vertical plane which causes disharmony of the alar base with the rest of the nose structures. Correcting nasal base retraction is very important for improved aesthetic outcomes however there is a limited body of literature about this deformity and its treatment. Objectives: Create a nasal base retraction treatment algorithm based on a severity classification system. Methods: This is a retrospective case review study of 53 patients who underwent rhinoplasty with correction of alar base retraction by the senior author (S.T.). The minimum follow-up time was 6 months. Levator labii alaque nasi muscle dissection or alar base release with or without a rim graft on the effected side were performed based on the severity of the alar base retraction. Aesthetic results were assessed with objective grading of preoperative and postoperative patient photographs by two independent plastic surgeons. Functional improvement was assessed with patient self-evaluations of nasal patency. Also a rhinoplasty outcomes evaluation (ROE) questionnaire was distributed to patients. Results: Comparison of preoperative and postoperative photographs demonstrated that nasal base asymmetry was significantly improved in all cases and 85% of the patients had complete symmetry. Nasal obstruction was also significantly reduced after surgery (P < 0.001). The majority of patients reported satisfaction (92.5%) with an ROE total score greater than or equal to 20. Conclusions: New techniques and a treatment algorithm for correcting nasal base retraction deformities that will help rhinoplasty surgeons obtain aesthetically and functionally pleasing outcomes for patients.;2017
Background: Nasal hump relapse and its probable reasons or mechanisms have been less discussed after dorsal preservation rhinoplasty. In this article the authors would like to share their experiences and offer solutions regarding this subject. Methods: Five hundred twenty patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty between the years 2015 and 2017 were included in the study. The push-down method was used for noses with a hump less than 4 mm and the let-down procedure was performed for others. Hump height was measured from profile photographs. The cases were evaluated in terms of nasal dorsal problems and their probable mechanisms. Results: Five hundred twenty patients 448 with a straight nose and 72 with a deviated nose were enrolled in this study. Mean follow-up was 13 months (range 9 to 16 months). Visible dorsal hump recurrence was observed in 63 patients and they appeared at 1 to 4 months postoperatively. Forty-one of these had a dorsal hump more than 4 mm preoperatively. Hump recurrence was not more than 2 mm in 34 patients and they did not wish to have any revision intervention because of cosmetic satisfaction. In 11 cases the height of the hump recurrence was 2 to 3 mm. These patients were treated with only minimal rasping. The remaining 18 patients had a hump recurrence with a height of 3 to 4 mm. They underwent secondary surgery using let-down rhinoplasty. Conclusion: The authors recommend subperichondrial/subperiosteal dissection subdorsal excision of cartilaginous and bony septum scoring the resting upper part of the septum just below the keystone area and performing lateral keystone dissection and preferring let-down procedure for kyphotic noses to prevent hump relapse after dorsal preservation rhinoplasty.;2019
Background: Nasal septal deviation may affect nasal bone growth and facial morphology. Knowledge of nasal morphologic parameters may plays an important role in planning successful rhinoplasty and septoplasty operation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between the direction and degree of nasal septal deviation with nasal bone morphology along with factors such as age and gender. Methods: Maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) of 250 patients with nasal septal deviation was analyzed retrospectively in this study. We excluded patients with factors that could affect their nasal bone morphology and a total of 203 patients (111 males 92 females mean age 36.23 years age range 18- 79 years) were evaluated. The nasal deviation angle was measured on coronal CT images as the angle between the most deviated point of the septum and the midline nasal morphology was determined by measuring nasal length internasal angle and lateral and intermediate nasal thickness on both sides. Results: The deviation of nasal septum has been detected as to the right in 107 patients (52.7%) and to the left in 96 patients (47.3%). Lateral and intermediate nasal bone thickness and nasal bone length were significantly greater on the ipsilateral deviation side (Table 3). No significant correlation was found between the variation of the nasal deviation angle and nasal bone morphology (Table 4). There were significant differences between the sexes for all investigated parameters except for the nasal deviation angle (p = 0.660). We found that the only internasal angle increases with aging (p = 0.002). Conclusion: The study shows that the direction of nasal septal deviation may be a factor that affects nasal bone morphology.;2017
Background: Nasal tip surgery is the most important and most difficult step of an aesthetic rhinoplasty operation. Various suture and grafting techniques have been described for adequate tip rotation and projection in nasal tip surgery. Objectives: The author describes his technique of three-dimensional (3D) columellar strut graft in nasal tip surgery. Methods: Each patient is treated using the open technique rhinoplasty. The author's technique uses a 3D dorsal columellar strut with a special anatomy in the shape of a Y-on a horizontal plane. When the dorsal columellar strut is placed in a way to maintain the interdomal angle this technique perfectly stabilizes the lower lateral cruses (LLCs) that have been shaped with cephalic dome suture (CDS). Results: A retrospective analysis of 78 patients who underwent 3D columellar strut graft technique were included in the study. The mean follow-up period was 15 months. All of the patients were satisfied with their tip shapes. Conclusions: The 3D dorsal columellar strut graft technique is an easily administered technique with reliable outcomes. The purpose of this graft is to support the reshaped LLCs with a perfect anatomic alignment. It does not require any additional cartilaginous graft in patients undergoing a reduction of the dorsum.;2017
Background: Numbness of the nasal skin is one of the most common complications following rhinoplasty. Objectives: The present study investigated postoperative changes in nasal skin sensation among primary and revision rhinoplasty patients and evaluated the recovery outcomes for both groups. Methods: A prospective randomized blinded study was undertaken involving 100 primary and 34 revision open rhinoplasty patients and 50 volunteers as control group. Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing was performed on 7 designated nasal points preoperatively and at postoperative months 1 3 6 and 12 and the results were evaluated. Results: Among the primary rhinoplasty patients the change in reduced sensation on pressure to the tip and infratip over time was significant (P<0.001) whereas there was no statistically significant difference for the other points. Among the revision rhinoplasty patients the change in reduced sensation on pressure to the tip infratip and base of columella over time was significant (P<0.001) whereas there was no statistically significant difference at the other points. In a comparison of the revision and primary rhinoplasty patients at all timepoints a statistically significant reduction in sensation was noted on the application of pressure to all points in the revision patient group (P<0.001). Conclusions: This study found that the sense of touch on pressure returned to normal aside from at the tip and infratip by the end of month 12 in primary rhinoplasty patients. The revision rhinoplasty patients in turn were observed to have reduced sensation on pressure by the end of month 12 with the greatest reduction at the tip infratip and columellar base.;2021
Background: One of the main difficulties of revision rhinoplasty is the lack of sufficient septal cartilage. To overcome this problem additional cartilage sources such as costal or conchal cartilages are widely used among surgeons. However these methods can cause some complications. The sphenoidal process of septal cartilage (SPSC) is a unique part of septal cartilage located between the vomer bone and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and generally untouched during the surgery. As an autologous graft option the SPSC may be an important cartilage source for revision rhinoplasty cases especially in patients requiring minor surgical intervention. Methods: Between February 2019 and February 2020 a total of 50 patients who underwent paranasal computed tomography were enrolled in this retrospective study. The length height and surface area of the SPSC and surface area of total septal cartilage were calculated. Results: The mean total septal area was 886.2 mm(2) ranging from 554.7 mm(2) to 1277.5 mm(2). The mean total SPSC area was 67.39 mm(2). The mean length of SPSC was 12.8 mm in all populations. The highest sphenoidal process length measurement was 27.32 mm and the lowest was 4.82. Mean sphenoidal process height values were similar in female and male groups (4.99 mm and 5.2 mm respectively). Conclusion: The sphenoid process of septal cartilage may be an important autologous cartilage option for revision surgeries in terms of sufficient length and height dimensions.;2021
Background: One of the main operative goals achieved with tip surgery is to reach the ideal nasolabial angle. The main purpose of the current study was to compare the effects of alar cartilage vertical incision and shortening (ACS) and columellar-septal suture (CSS) techniques on the nasolabial angle. Methods: In this retrospective study 2 groups were examined: the patients in the first group were operated on using vertical alar cartilage incision and shortening and the patients in the second group were operated on using columellar-septal cartilage suture. Postoperative photographs between the 2 groups were compared with respect to nasolabial angle differences. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS version 20. Results: In the postoperative evaluation 50% of ACS and 72.5% of CSS groups had achieved desired clinical outcomes. Although the efficacy of the CSS group was found to be superior to that of the ACS group there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Greater nasolabial angle was gained using the CSS technique however the risk for overrotation was higher in the CSS group. Conclusions: Both ACS and CSS techniques provide reliable reconstructive option for nasolabial angle modifications. More predictable results were obtained with the ACS technique. The CSS technique is a versatile way of nasolabial angle alteration but there is a higher risk for overrotation.;2015
Background: Open rhinoplasty has been performed for over 50 years. Rhinoplasty procedures have a risk of complications and it is important to follow each step diligently in order to avoid complications. Periorbital edema is the most common complication of septorhinoplasty. As far as we are aware there are no studies in the available literature examining the impact of the septorhinoplasty on intraocular pressure and the retina. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of septorhinoplasty-related periorbital edema on intraocular pressure and the retina by means of objective tests. Methods: Ten patients with phase 4 periorbital edema (5 males and 5 females) who underwent open rhinoplasty with bilateral lateral osteotomies were enrolled in the study. All the patients were examined by an eye specialist for visual acuity intraocular pressure retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell complex pathologies with optical coherence tomography preoperatively and postoperatively on the seventh day. Results: Preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity intraocular pressure average superior and inferior retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and total superior and inferior ganglion cell complex thickness in both eyes for all patients were within normal limits. There was no statistical difference between preoperative and postoperative values (P> .05). Conclusion: We concluded that periorbital edema after septorhinoplasty causes no significant complications affecting intraocular pressure and visual acuity. We believe that when osteotomies and local anesthetic injections are undertaken correctly periorbital complications do not affect vision.;2021
Background: Osteotomy is a crucial step in rhinoplasty which can have a significant impact on the outcome. In addition to previous percutaneous (external perforating) and endonasal (internal) approaches piezosurgery has been used in rhinoplasty practice since 2007. This experimental model was planned to compare the three osteotomy techniques. Materials and methods: This study was performed on a caprine skull osteotomy model. Three groups were created from 12 animals namely endonasal continuous external perforating and piezosurgery groups. All the groups were evaluated for bone gaps comminuted fractures and nasal mucosa damage. Results: There were no comminuted fractures and mucosal defects in any of the samples in the piezo osteotomy group. The average amount of bone gap at the osteotomy site and the nasal mucosa damage was lower in the piezo group than in the other groups. The time required for the osteotomy was shorter in the endonasal group similar to that in the external and piezo groups. Conclusion: New techniques are constantly being developed to achieve better results in rhinoplasty. As a natural consequence to technological developments new devices are being introduced to rhinoplasty practice. Piezo is one such device. We have found that piezo osteotomy has resulted in lower amounts of nasal mucosal damage and comminuted fractures. We believe that piezo can safely be used in rhinoplasty practice until newer and more reliable technologies are being developed.

Background: Osteotomy is one of the major parts of a rhinoplasty operation Edema and ecchymosis most commonly appear as a result of this surgical manipulation. Different authors use different techniques to perform osteotomy The external perforating approach and the internal continuous technique are the 2 main ways of doing osteotomy in rhinoplasty In our study we tried to compare the effects of these 2 techniques regarding edema and ecchymosis. Material and Methods: Two groups that consisted of 20 patients were studied In group A osteotomy was performed through an external route in a perforating fashion. In group B the osteotomy was performed through an internal route and in a continuous fashion. The patients in each group were scored according to a visual scoring system that describes the site and extension of ecchymosis and degree of edema on the second and seventh days after the surgery. The scoring was made by 2 examiners blinded to the type of surgery. Results: Edema scores were almost the same between the 2 groups on the second and seventh days after the surgery Ecchymosis scores were the same between the groups on the seventh day However the score for ecchymosis on the second day is significantly less in the internal continuous technique (P < 0.05) when it is compared with the external technique. Conclusion: External and internal techniques of osteotomy almost give the same results regarding edema and ecchymosis but the internal continuous technique shows a tendency to produce less ecchymosis on the second postoperative day.;2005
Background: Pollybeak deformity due to abundant fibrosis formation in the supratip region after rhinoplasty is still a common problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a modified subcutaneous approximation suture on pollybeak deformity of soft tissue origin. Methods: Three groups each consisting of eight rabbits were included in the study. Nasal skin was elevated with an open rhinoplasty approach in all groups. During closure of the skin to minimize supratip dead space a horizontal subcutaneous approximation suture was used in group I external tape fixation was used in group II and no further action was taken for supratip skin approximation in the control group. Full-thickness supratip skin biopsy specimens reaching down to the underlying cartilage tissue were taken from each subject on the 60th day after the operation. Thicknesses of subcutaneous scar tissues were measured histologically in all groups and compared. Results: The mean thickness of the subcutaneous scar tissues was significantly lower (0.98 +/- 0.32 mm) in group I than in group II (1.65 +/- 0.61 mm p = 0.036) and the control group (1.72 +/- 0.49 mm p = 0.019). However there were no significant differences between group II and the control group in the mean thickness of subcutaneous scar tissues (p = 1.000). Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that the subcutaneous approximation suture is effective for preventing excessive scar tissue formation in the supratip area after rhinoplasty in rabbits. Further clinical studies are needed to determine its efficacy in humans. (Am J Rhinol Allergy 26 e111-e114 2012 doi: 10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3780);2012
Background: Prediction of the nose from the skull remains an important issue in forensic facial approximation. In 2010 Rynn et al. published a method of predicting nose projection from the skull. With this method three craniometric measurements (x y z) are taken and these are then used in regression formulae to estimate the nasal dimensions. Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine and test the accuracy of the Rynn et al. method and if necessary to adapt the formulae for this population. Subjects and methods: A sample of 90 CT scans of Turkish adults was used in the study. The actual and predicted dimensions were compared using t-test. The age of the individuals ranged from 20 to 40 years by sex. Results: The descriptive statistics and correlations were calculated and the actual and predicted measurements were compared. The differences between the actual and predicted values were statistically significant (p < 0.01) with -1 mm for males and -1.5 mm for females. Validation accuracies ranged from 76 to 92% in females and 72 to 82% in males. Recalibration equation accuracies ranged from 88 to 100% in females and 90 to 100% in males. Conclusion: The results showed that the recalibration of the Rynn et al. method and its formulae gave satisfactory results with less error and can be employed in facial approximation cases.;2019
Background: Repair of nasal septal perforations is one of the most challenging procedures in nasal surgery. The aim of this prospective clinical study was to determine the efficacy of using an inferior turbinate composite graft (ITCG) for the repair of nasal septal perforation. Methods: Between 2009 and 2011 27 consecutive patients with nasal septal perforation underwent endoscopy-assisted endonasal septal perforation repair by using an ITCG alone or in combination with bipedicled mucosal advancement flap. Results: Complete closure of the perforation was achieved in 24 of 27 (88.8%) patients and incomplete closure was observed in 2 patients with medium-sized perforation and 1 patient with large perforation. Conclusion: The ITCG technique provides three-layer repair of the defect under no tension in closure of small perforations located anteriorly posterior perforations with mucosal atrophy or previous unsuccessful surgical repair. In graft-depleted revision rhinoplasty cases with small-sized septal perforations this technique provides a simple solution with autogenous grafts. In cases involving larger perforations the ITCG technique can easily be combined with bipedicled flap and allows for more options to solve a challenging problem. Current data from this prospective study suggest that this surgical technique may be used in the repair of nasal septal perforation. (Am J Rhinol Allergy 26 237-242 2012 doi: 10.2500/ajra.2012.26.3765);2012
Background: Repair of the septal perforation is a challenging procedure and there are many different surgical techniques. In this study the authors present a novel method which the authors use costal cartilage and costal perichondrium sandwich graft as an interposition graft with bilateral opposing mucoperichondrial flaps. Patients and Methods: Fourteen patients (5 females 9 males) underwent septal perforation repair. All surgeries were performed through an open approach septoplasty technique. The edges of the perforation were incised to excise the mucosa with a thickness of 2 mm. Bilateral mucoperichondrial flaps were raised. Then costal cartilage and costal perichondrium were harvested from the rib. The cartilage was divided into a smaller piece which is 2 mm thick and 1 cm wider than perforation size. The prepared cartilage was wrapped with perichondrium to obtain a sandwich graft. This sandwich graft was placed between the mucoperichondrial flaps corresponding to the perforation. Results: After 9 months of follow-up 11 (78%) of the 14 perforations were completely closed. Failure of the repair was observed in 3 patients 2 of the perforations were medium size and one perforation was large size. No complications occurred. Conclusion: Using costal cartilage and costal perichondrium sandwich graft is a novel and useful technique especially in large septal perforations. Considering that septum surgery has an important role in the etiology of septum perforation this method provides a good graft source for both perforation closure and simultaneous rhinoplasty surgery.;2020
Background: Rhinoplasty has become one of the most frequently performed worldwide aesthetic procedures thanks to the successful results obtained by plastic surgeons. In this study soft tissue defects encountered as an undesirable and fearsome complication following rhinoplasty its causes and precautions are presented by authors. Materials and Methods: Eight patients operated between December 2015 and December 2018 were enrolled in this study. According to the causes of soft tissue defects observed following rhinoplasty patients were examined in 5 groups consisting of excessive subcutaneous adipose tissue defatting improper dissection plane compression of cast splint and strip materials pressure applied to skin by cartilage grafts and overresection. Results: Herein while subcutaneous excessive defatting and intense cigarette smoking was responsible of the necrosis in the first patient we defined high pressure on skin due to tight bandaging or external splint materials lead to skin necrosis in our patients 2 3 and 4. The 5th and 6th patients were candidates of a revision rhinoplasty however both resulted with necrosis probably by reason of inaccurate dissection and/or possible diminished vascularity by previous rhinoplasty operations. In the 8th patient necrosis was observed due to the compression of the bulky autologous cartilage graft used in the skin. Conclusion: In conclusion skin necrosis is a rare but bothersome complication of rhinoplasty. The importance of atraumatic techniques and appropriate dissection plane during the rhinoplasty operation as well as the importance of the effect and control of the postoperative applied splint and bandage materials is so obviously seen.;2020
Background: Rhinoplasty has become one of the most frequently requested and performed surgical procedures for both functional and aesthetic purposes. As an attention-attracting prominence even the slightest disfigurement of the nose causes serious disturbance to the patient before or after the operation. Functional problems also cause discomfort. For these reasons postrhinoplasty complications are regarded as challenging problems for both for the patient and the surgeon. Some cases necessitate grafts for better aesthetic or functional outcome but there is still controversy over the preference for autogenous or allogenous grafts both for primary and secondary cases. Evaluation of autogenous and allogenous grafts implanted in the nose is quite challenging for several reasons including the possibility of unpredictable complications leading to catastrophic disfigurements the impossibility of obtaining pathologic specimens and the need for a long follow-up period for stable results. An experimental model for rhinoplasty fulfilling the need for precise evaluation was planned and performed after anatomical observation of the noses of rabbits. Methods: Fifteen adult New Zealand rabbits were used five for the anatomical evaluation and 10 for the rhinoplasty model. Computed tomographic images and measurements were obtained before and after the surgical processes. Results and Conclusion: This experimental model for rhinoplasty has not been reported in any previous studies. This study demonstrates the surgical anatomy of the rabbit in detail and constitutes a guide for researchers as a convenient experimental model for rhinoplasty with all stages similar to those performed on humans.;2006
Background: Rhinoplasty is a common surgical procedure that is requested and accepted by patients for cosmetic and functional reasons. Osteotomies are performed on nasal bone maxillary crest or vomer to fix the deviations of the nasal dorsum or septum. During the percussion of the osteotomes with the surgical mallet the vibration energy diffuses to the cranium. Auditory and vestibular systems may be affected by these vibrations. Objectives: To assess the effects of rhinoplasty in which osteotomies were performed using a hammer on the audiovestibular system. Methods: Thirty adults who underwent rhinoplasty were included in the study group. Ten age and gender matched adults who had nasal surgery without surgical mallet or osteotome served as the control group. The patients in both groups were assessed using pure tone audiometry tympanometry distortion product otoacoustic emission testing and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential as well as video head impulse tests (vHIT) before the operation and 1 week after the operation. Results: On auditory assessment there was no significant difference between the study and control groups regarding pure tone thresholds at frequencies of 250 Hz to 8 kHz (P > 0.05) as well as otoacoustic emissions. The vestibular assessment performed by using vestibular-evoked myogenic potential and vHIT did not reveal a statistically significant difference between the groups before surgery or after surgery (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Rhinoplasty appears to be a safe operation in terms of audiovestibular functions and osteotomy in which a hammer is usually used does not have an impact on hearing or balance functions of the ear.;2018
Background: Rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure to smooth out the nasal deformities and to fix nasal breathing problems. Spreader grafts and flaps are used to prevent some complications such as middle vault collapse narrowing the internal nasal valve and inverted V deformity. To obtain more stable middle vault spreader grafts and flaps could be used together. Many researchers have tried different graft and flap techniques to reach more successful aesthetic and functional results. In this research we investigated effects of triangular graft on the internal nasal valve angle nasal breathing and aesthetic outcomes when it used together with sprader flap. Methods: In this prospective study 3 different groups were formed as: the spreader flap group (group 1) the spreader flap with the rectangular spreader graft group (group 2) and the spreader flap with the triangular spreader graft group (group 3). Preoperative nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) scale was used to evaluate nasal breathing and visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate aesthetic appearance. And also measurement of the internal nasal valve angle was performed for each patients. These evaluations were repeated at postoperative 3rd month. Preoperative and postoperative comparisons between study groups were performed. Results: There were 12 patients in group 1 14 patients in group 2 and 10 patients in group 3. In each group statistically significant decrease in NOSE scores (P< 0.05) and statistical significant increase in VAS scores (P< 0.05) were observed. And also increased internal nasal valve angle after surgery was detected in all groups (P< 0.05). Postoperative NOSE and VAS scores were found similar in 3 different groups (P> 0.05). On the contrary the internal nasal valve angles were found statistically significant increased in group 3 according to other groups (P< 0.05). Conclusion: The results of this prospective study presented that the use of triangular spreader graft with spreader flap was an appropriate technique to obtain successful aesthetic and functional outcomes with widening the internal nasal valve angle.;2018
Background: Saddle nose deformity (SND) is a collapse of the cartilage and bone structures forming the dorsal projection of the nose. After the use of autologous cartilage in the treatment of SND resorption and warping continue to be a problem. Methods: This study presents results from 11 patients with SND types III and IV from 2005 to 2017 treated with autologous cartilage fixed with microplates and microscrews. The patients were monitored for at least 1 year. Resorption and warping were measured using postoperative photographs of the patients in the 3rd and 12th months after treatment. Results: No signs of resorption or warping were noted in the patients. Conclusions: Our findings indicate autologous cartilage use with microplates and microscrews is a viable long-term treatment option for patients with SND types III and IV.;2019
Background: Septal cartilage still is the most appropriate graft material used in rhinoplasty. In traumatic or revision cases septal cartilage can be insufficient and the need for an implant material emerges. In this study the safety and efficacy of polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) used as an implant material in nasal dorsal augmentation were assessed. Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed 74 patients who underwent nasal dorsal augmentation with Gore-Tex. Of the 74 patients who underwent rhinoplasty with Gore-Tex for dorsal augmentation from February 1999 to January 2006 46 (62.2%) represented primary cases and 28 (37.8%) represented revision cases. The patients were followed from 5 to 62 months (average 28 months) and questioned about cosmetic and functional outcomes. The results were assessed according to patients' charts as well as preoperative and postoperative photographic documentation. Results: There were no complications such as infections foreign body reaction extrusions resorption or migration and all the patients were satisfied with their results. Only one case of soft tissue reaction was observed which lasted for 3 weeks postoperatively. Conclusions: Biocompatibility ease of use lack of extrusion or resorption and low rate of infection make Gore-Tex a good alternative to autogenous tissue. However long-term success and complication rates still are lacking and large numbers of patients with longer follow-up periods are required.;2007
Background: Shape of the tip is supplied by lower lateral cartilages (LLC) which are divided into 3 crura each composed of 2 segments divided by junction lines (JL). Tip restoration becomes more complicated with the presence of angulation deformities (AD) over LLC. It is aimed to classify AD based on their relationship to JL to clarify their causes of the formation and to discuss restoration techniques for each of them. Material and Methods: Between 2016 and 2018 375 primary rhinoplasties have been performed. All types of the AD have been retrospectively determined renamed. Six different types of AD have been encountered in this series. Four of AD (types A B C and D) have been located over JL and 2 of AD (types S and T) have not been located over JL. Results: Type-A AD diverging the footplates were observed in 9 patients type-B AD resulting in a boxy-nose were observed in 18 cases type-C AD resulting in acute angulation of the dome at the medial genu were observed in 4 patients type-D AD resulting in a pinched tip and concave alar wings were observed in 6 patients type-S AD resulting in a weak and short columella were observed in 5 patients type-T AD that creates a bulge over ala was observed just in 1 patient in our series. The total number of patients with AD was 39 (10.4% of all cases). Conclusion: Classification of AD over LLC based on their relationship to certain JL provides ease for recognition of these deformities and immediate per-operative planning for their restoration.;2019
Background: Simultaneous open rhinoplasty and alar base excision are a very safe procedure for protecting the vascular supply of the nasal dip and the columellar skin in primary cases when surgical dissection is performed below the musculoaponeurotic layer of the nose. Major arteries of the external nose lie above the musculoaponeurotic layer. However secondary cases may pose increased risks to the blood supply of the nasal tip and columella skin because of the decreased vascular supply and increased scar tissue from the previous rhinoplasty. We studied our secondary cases of simultaneous open rhinoplasty and alar base excision to assess the real risk for necrosis of the nasal tip and columellar skin. Methods: A total of 12 secondary patients (6 men and 6 women) underwent simultaneous open rhinoplasty and alar base excision in the past 3 years. Their average age was 27 years (range 21-35 years). The average follow-up period was 15 months (range 1-35 moths). A modified grading system originally described by Bafaqeeh and Al-Qattan was used for assessment of the blood supply in the nasal tip and the columellar skin. Results: Satisfactory results were obtained for our patients with the exception of one case. Grade 3 vascular compromise to the nasal tip and the columella was observed in one case but the patient healed well with wound care treatment. Conclusion: Simultaneous alar base excision and open rhinoplasty can be performed safely in secondary cases. However some surgical maneuvers such as subcutaneous pocket preparation for the tip graft in closed rhinoplasty and subdermal defatting in the first rhinoplasty as well as previous scarring on the nasal lobule can disrupt the vascular supply of the nasal tip and columella skin. Under these conditions alar base excision should be deferred and then performed as an isolated excision procedure.;2005
Background: Social media addiction is currently a common problem worldwide. Studies have suggested that individuals who underwent rhinoplasty are susceptible to the aforementioned condition but no evidence-based research has been conducted to derive a definitive conclusion to this issue. Objective: This study was aimed at comparing the self-esteem body perception and social media use of individuals with and without a history of rhinoplasty. Design Setting and Participants: The study was conducted at two treatment centers. Rhinoplasty patients were selected from those who sought treatment in the private clinic of one of the researchers whereas the control cohort participants were chosen from among employees of a university hospital. After the implementation of inclusion and exclusion criteria 100 patients and 102 healthy unmatched control subjects were enrolled in the research. Main Measures and Outcomes: The collected sociodemographic data covered age gender years of education and type of social media use. Social media addiction was measured using the social media addiction scale self-esteem was ascertained with the Rosenberg self-esteem scale and body perception was assessed using the body perception scale. The independent samples t-test was conducted twice to compare the mean scores of the participants and mediation analysis was carried out to determine the effects of body image and self-esteem scores on social media addiction scores. Two-sided p-values were calculated and differences were considered significant at the 0.1 0.05 and 0.001 levels. Results: The groups obtained similar body image and self-esteem scores but the difference in the social media addiction scores of the rhinoplasty patients and control participants was statistically significant at the 0.05 level with the former having higher addiction scores. On the basis of the cutoff for social media addiction 8 and 10 participants from the rhinoplasty and control groups respectively exhibited signs of dependency on Web-based social networks and similar innovations. The self-esteem scores (X) and body image scores (M) predicted the social media addiction scores (Y). The coefficient of the body image scores was statistically significant but that of the self-esteem scores was not. The X + M -> Y model indicated statistically significant effects. Conclusion and Relevance: We compared the social media usage of rhinoplasty patients and control participants. Our findings indicated no evidentiary support for the view of rhinoplasty patients as social media addicts and suggested that such a perception is a form of stigmatization.;2020
Background: Soft tissue thickness (STT) is a major factor affecting the outcome in rhinoplasty. However limited information is found in the literature on the age- and gender-related variations of the nasal STT. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to measure STT at various landmarks over the nasal framework and compare the age- and gender-related differences. Methods: STT measurements were made at 11 landmarks in 325 patients by employing magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were divided into subgroups to compare the STT differences between female and male and between the age groups as young middle age and elderly. Results: Soft tissue was thickest at the nasion and thinnest at the rhinion. The soft tissue coverage was significantly thicker in the male population at the supratip tip nasal bones upper lateral cartilages and alar lobules whereas it is thicker in females at the rhinion. Average thickness of the soft tissues over the entire nasal framework increases with age except the rhinion. Conclusions: The STT is variable over different parts of the osteocartilaginous framework. Gender and age influence the STT. The soft tissue is thicker at the distal half of the nose in male patients and these areas become gradually thicker with age whereas the soft tissue over the midvault becomes thinner. Increasing age presents a particular challenge to achieve predictable results in rhinoplasty and an understanding of the soft tissue envelope allows for improved aesthetic outcome.;2020
Background: Some deviated nasal septa can never be straightened completely due to their 3-dimensional (3-D) nature. Based on a Study of models and clinical cases a basic classification and treatment strategy was proposed for 3-D septal deviations. Methods: basic types of 3-D septal L struts were crafted from pieces of thick plastic sheeting. By a carefully placed through-and-through incision in the angle area and overlapping the resultant segments the models became 2 dimensional (2-D). We used this technique intraoperatively in some cases resecting the overlapping area of septal tissue along with a septal extension graft in 11 patients who were followed up for more than 6 months. Results: External nasal deviation due to a deviated septum was obvious in 5 cases and all were relieved postoperatively. Preoperative breathing difficulties were improved in 7 of 8 patients. Conclusion: Correction of 3-D septal L deformity can be successfully performed by constructing 2-D L struts by making a full-thickness incision of the angle area and then overlapping the segments. This approach is especially beneficial in those having a septal extension graft that need a perfectly straight caudal septum upon which to fix the extension graft.;2008
BACKGROUND: Stimulation of various sites from the nasal mucosa to the diaphragm can evoke laryngospasm. To reduce airway reflexes tracheal extubation should be performed while the patient is deeply anesthetized or with drugs that do not depress ventilation. However tracheal extubation during rhinoplasty may be difficult because of the aspiration of blood and the possibility of laryngospasm. Dexmedetomidine and fentanyl both have sedative and analgesic effects but dexmedetomidine has been reported to induce sedation without affecting respiratory status. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl on airway reflexes and hemodynamic responses to tracheal extubation in patients undergoing rhinoplasty. METHODS: This double-blind randomized controlled study was conducted at the Erciyes University Medical Center Kayseri Turkey. Patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 or II who were undergoing elective rhinoplasty between January 2007 and June 2007 with general anesthesia were eligible for study entry. Using a sealed-envelope method the patients were randomly divided into 2 groups (20 patients per group). Five minutes before extubation patients received either dexmedetomidine 0.5 mu g/kg in 100 mL of isotonic saline or fentanyl 1 mu g/kg in 100 mL of isotonic saline intravenously. All patients were extubated by anesthesiologists who were blinded to the study drugs and all were continuously monitored for 15 minutes after extubation. Heart rate (HR) systolic blood pressure (SBP) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) were recorded before anesthesia after drug administration after skin incision at the completion of surgery and 1 5 and 10 minutes before and after tracheal extubation. Any prevalence of laryngospasm bronchospasm or desaturation was recorded. RESULTS: Forty patients (25 men 15 women mean [SD] age 24.86 [7.43] years) were included in the study. Dexmedetomidine was associated with a significant increase in extubation quality compared with fentanyl reflected in the prevalence of Cough after extubation (85% [17/20] vs 30% [6/20] of patients respectively P = 0.001). There were no clinically significant decreases in HR SBP DBP or SpO(2) after extubation with dexmedetomidine or fentanyl. In the dexmedetomidine group HR was not significantly after extubation however in the fentanyl group HR was significantly increased compared with the preextubation values (all P = 0.007). HR was significantly higher in the fentanyl group compared with the dexmedetomidine group at 1 5 and 10 minutes after extubation (all P = 0.003). Compared with preextubation values SBP was significantly increased at I and 5 minutes after extubation in the dexmedetomidine group (both P = 0.033) and at 1 5 and 10 minutes after extubation in the fentanyl group (all P = 0.033). The postoperative sedation scores and the extubation awakening and orientation times were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In the dexmedetomidine group bradycardia (HR <45 beats/min) was observed in 2 patients and emesis was observed in 2 patients. In the fentanyl group emesis was observed in 3 patients bradycardia in 2 patients vomiting in 1 patient and shivering in I patient vertigo was reported in I patient. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of adverse events between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The findings in the present study suggest that dexmedetomidine 0.5 mu g/kg IV administered before extubation was more effective in attenuating airway reflex responses to tracheal extubation and maintaining hemodynamic stability without prolonging recovery compared with fentanyl 1 mu g/kg IV in these patients undergoing rhinoplasty.

Background: Suspension sutures are commonly used in numerous cosmetic surgical procedures. Several authors have described the use of such sutures as a part of classical rhinoplasty. On the other hand it is not uncommon to see patients seeking nasal surgery for only a minimal hump deformity combined with an underrotated underprojecting tip which does not necessarily require all components of rhinoplasty. With the benefit of the suture suspension technique described here such simple tip deformities can be reshaped percutaneously via minimal incisions. Objective: In this study the author describes an original technique based on the philosophy of vertical suspension lifts achieving the suspension of the nasal tip with a percutaneous purse-string suture applied through small access punctures. Patients and Methods: Between December 2005 and December 2008 86 patients were selected to undergo rhinoplasty using the author's shuttle lifting technique. The procedure was performed with a double-sided needle or shuttle smoothly anchoring the lower lateral cartilages in a vertical direction to the glabellar periosteum excluding the skin envelope. Results: Mean follow-up was 13 months with a range of eight to 24 months. Outcomes were satisfactory in all but 12 cases of which seven found the result inadequate two of those patients underwent a definitive rhinoplasty operation. Five patients requested that the suture be detached because of an overexaggerated appearance. Operative time was less than 15 minutes in all patients with an uneventful rapid recovery. Conclusions: As a minimally invasive nasal reshaping procedure shuttle lifting is a good choice to achieve long-lasting satisfactory results in selected patients with minimal hump deformity and an underrotated tip. The significance of this technique lies in the fact that it is one of very few office-based minimally invasive alternatives for aesthetic nasal surgery with a recovery period of two to three days.;2010
Background: The aim of this study was to compare the techniques used for resection of the long side of the base and the top of the bone based on the patient's perspective surgeon's approach aesthetic results complications and need for secondary surgery in patients with asymmetric nasal bones. This study also aimed to determine the perspective of another plastic surgeon who did not perform rhinoplasty in comparison with the perspective of the primary plastic surgeon. Methods: One hundred sixty-six patients with nasal bone asymmetry between 2010 and 2015 were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 those treated with wedge resection of the bony nasal pyramid from the base of the nasal bone and group 2 those treated with an oblique hump resection. Three different plastic surgeons and plastic surgery nurses who had no information regarding the randomization patients and primary plastic surgeon evaluated the surgical results. Results: The mean secondary surgery rate was significantly greater in group 2 than in group 1. The mean satisfaction ratio was significantly decreased with different plastic surgeons than with the primary plastic surgeon. Base nasal bone resection was more successful than oblique hump resection in patients with greater than or equal to 0.5-cm nasal bone asymmetry. Conclusions: Surgeons who did not perform the rhinoplasties can evaluate the results differently from the primary surgeon. Performing base bone resection may reduce the secondary surgery rate in patients with greater than or equal to 0.5-cm nasal bone asymmetry.;2017
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different nose types on the perception of facial aesthetics following camouflage treatment and orthognathic surgery for skeletal class II female patients. Methods: A pre-treatment profile photograph of a skeletal class II adult patient was selected from the department archive. Two constructed photographs were created to represent orthognathic surgery and camouflage treatments with the aid of computer software. A total of 18 constructed images was composed using three profiles (pretreatment post-camouflage and post-orthognathic surgery) and six nose types. These photographs were shown to the three groups (orthodontists plastic surgeons and lay people) and they were asked to assign an attractiveness score to each photo ranging from 0 to 100 with 0 indicating the least attractive and 100 indicating the most attractive. Results: For the convex nose profiles anterior movement of the mandible obtained by orthognathic surgery did not result in a significant change in the scores given by the lay people. When surgical or camouflage treatment was not implemented and instead just rhinoplasty was performed for these profiles there was a significant increase in the aesthetic scores given by all groups. For the straight nose profiles orthognathic surgery increased the attractiveness scores given by all groups. Furthermore for all the profiles extraction treatment did not affect the aesthetic scores given by any of the groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions: The lay people perceived that having a convex-bridged nose was a bigger problem than having a retrognathic profile. Overall in terms of skeletal and dental orthodontic treatments nose shape should be considered during the treatment planning process.;2019
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lateral osteotomy of septorhinoplasty on nasolacrimal duct functions by dacryoscintigraphy. Methods: The study group comprised 60 nasolacrmal systems of 30 consecutive patients who underwent septorhinoplasty. Dacryoscintigraphy images were taken in the preoperative period and postoperative 1st week and 3rd month. After Tc-99m pertechnetate instillation dynamic images were obtained every 15 seconds. For cases of normal drainage the study was terminated after 10 minutes but when obstruction was suspected external ocular massage and rapid nasal inspiration were applied and the test was extended for an additional 10 minutes. Systems were classified either as passage without massage (normal nasolacrimal test) passage with massage (physiological obstruction) or presac or postsac obstruction (partial or complete obstruction) according to test results. Transit time was determined for cases with normal test or physiological obstruction. Results: In the preoperative period eight systems (two presac and six postsac) had obstruction. There were a total of 11 (18.3%) additional systems with obstruction. (4 presac and 7 postsac) in the 1st postoperative week and patient symptoms were not in complete agreement with the test results in this period. By the 3rd month nine systems (three presac and six post sac) had obstruction. Transit time was prolonged in both the postoperative 1st week and the postoperative 3rd month tests compared with the preoperative tests (p = 0.000 and p = 0.023 respectively). Conclusion: We did not encounter any permanent obstructions after lateral osteotomy of rhinoplasty. Temporary obstructions in the 1st postoperative week improved to normal preoperative status by the postoperative 3rd month.;2005
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the dose-related effectiveness of steroids on periorbital edema ecchymosis and intraoperative bleeding in patients who underwent open rhinoplasty with osteotomy. Methods: Forty patients were divided into three groups: those in group 1 (n = 15) were given a single dose of 1-mg/kg intravenous (i.v.) methylprednisolone those in group 2 (n = 15) were given a single dose of 3-mg/kg i.v. methylprednisolone preoperatively and group 3 (n = 10) was the control group. Eyelid edema and periorbital soft-tissue ecchymosis were evaluated separately using a scale of 0-4. Results: In groups using the steroid preoperatively periorbital edema and ecchymosis were significantly lower compared with the control group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were seen clinically or statistically in preventing or reducing either the periorbital ecchymosis or the periorbital edema between groups 1 and 2. Also there was no significant difference among the groups in terms of bleeding (p > 0.05). No complications with regard to the operation or steroid use were observed. Conclusion: Our results support that steroids significantly decrease periorbital ecchymosis and periorbital edema in open rhinoplasty with osteotomy. Additionally our results suggest that if the dose of steroids is adjusted according to body weight there is no significant benefit in a single dose of 3 mg/kg of methylprednisolone over a lower dose of 1 mg/kg and there is no need for higher doses of methylprednisolone administration.

Background: The authors present the results of an experimental study in which four different techniques were used for the correction of concave rabbit auricular cartilage. Methods: Sixteen New Zealand adult male rabbits were used in the study. Butyl cyanoacrylate-aided cartilage graft fixation and butyl cyanoacrylate-aided bone graft fixation and scoring technique alone or combined with butyl cyanoacrylate application were performed to correct the concavity of rabbit auricular cartilage. Results: Angle measurements showed that all four techniques were efficient for correction of the cartilage concavities. However the mean postsacrifice angles of the graft fixation groups were significantly higher than those of the other study groups reflecting the fact that graft fixation with butyl cyanoacrylate application was more efficient for preserving the final cartilage shape. Furthermore in the ninth month graft fixation groups had the lowest chondrocyte densities the highest degree of inflammation the highest degree of foreign body reaction and the highest butyl cyanoacrylate density. Conclusions: Fibrosis or chondrocyte proliferation on scoring incision lines is not an associated feature of this technique. When the incision depths were standardized the scoring technique provided efficacy similar to that of the scoring incisions combined with butyl cyanoacrylate application for correction of the cartilage concavity. The scoring incision plus butyl cyanoacrylate group showed less toxicity than the graft fixation groups because of rapid removal of toxic breakdown products. Graft fixation techniques were superior to other corrective procedures with regard to preservation of the final cartilage shape. Although they resulted in greater toxicity the cartilage correction was not affected unfavorably.;2017
Background: The current literature on rhinoplasty focuses mainly on the nasal profile (sagittal plane) however the nose is a three-dimensional structure and alignment of the nose in consideration of other aspects is important to achieve an aesthetic result. The author aimed to introduce the fix down concept which includes fix down technique and the adjunct maneuvers for achieving alignment of the nose in three anatomical planes and improving the results of rhinoplasty in terms of symmetry. Methods: Between March of 2017 and December of 2017 a total of 102 patients (78 women and 24 men) 13 revision and 89 primary cases underwent septorhinoplasty with the fix down concept. The noses were evaluated in coronal sagittal and axial planes and classified according to their deformities. Results: The functional and aesthetic results were satisfactory for the patients examiners and surgeon. No revisions were necessary during the follow-up period. In addition to the fix down technique ethmoid bone grafting (16 patients) fix up technique (eight patients) dissection of the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle (14 patients) plication of this muscle (four patients) superior-based transposition flap (39 patients) rim grafts (17 patients) mucosa grafts (12 patients) double-layer grafts (nine patients) maxillary deepening (five patients) maxillary augmentation with cartilage/bone grafts (21 patients) and supratip onlay grafts (seven patients) were used as adjunctive maneuvers to achieve symmetry in the frontal base and profile views. Conclusion: The presented fix down concept will help to provide three-dimensional symmetric noses for rhinosurgeons.;2020
Background: The current study aimed to translate the Utrecht Questionnaire for Outcome Assessment in Aesthetic Rhinoplasty (OAR) into the Turkish language then validate the new version (T-OAR) for use in Turkish patients. Methods: Thirty-five cases that knew how to write and read in the Turkish language undergoing primary RP were included in the study. Seventy-four healthy volunteer cases that did not need functional or aesthetical RP were included in the control group. Statistical analysis was performed to assess internal consistency test-retest reliability discriminant validity and responsiveness. Results: VAS was used in the study group. There was a recovery on the nasal view in the postoperative period (8.8 +/- 0.84) compared with the preoperative period (2.6 +/- 1.2) (p=0.0001). Scores of E1-E5 questions and total T-OAR scores in the study group were higher than those of the control group (all p values were < 0.05). Scores of E1-E5 questions and total T-OAR scores were lower in the postoperative period than those in the preoperative period in the study group (all p scores were < 0.05). Significant differences were not found in E1-E5 scores and total T-OAR scores (all p values were >0.05). The internal consistency of T-OAR was high. Cronbach's alpha value was 0.928 in the preoperative period and 0.834 in the postoperative period. Conclusion: The T-OAR questionnaire is a valid and reliable questionnaire evaluating body appearance and discomfort associated with nasal appearance in Turkish patients.;2019
Background: The early postoperative period can be distressing for the patients undergoing rhinoplasty since edema and ecchymosis are common complications. Objectives: To analyze the effects of the vibration and pressure treatments in the early postoperative period of rhinoplasty. Methods: Sixty patients who had undergone rhinoplasty were randomized into 3 groups: group 1 (control group n = 20) received classic nasal casting group 2 (n = 20) received nasal cast with an elastic bandage to hold it on the face and group 3 (n = 20) received vibration treatment in addition to that in group 2 following the rhinoplasty. They were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 3 and 7 days in a prospective study. The postoperative edema and ecchymosis were scored by 2 independent surgeons. The postoperative pain was measured using the visual analog scale and the necessity of anti-inflammatory medication (and the dose needed) and the cast comfort was questioned. The sebaceous activity of the nose skin was examined. A preoperative and postoperative seventh day sonographic study was performed to evaluate the tissue edema objectively. Results: The pressure treatment decreased the edema and ecchymosis significantly compared with the control group. The vibration treatment minimized edema ecchymosis sebaceous activity of the nose skin pain score and the need for anti-inflammatory medication and increased the cast comfort significantly compared with the other groups (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Rapid regression of edema and ecchymosis may be achieved using the vibrating nasal cast technique that may minimize patient discomfort pain and sebaceous activity following rhinoplasty.;2020
Background: The effect of a columellar strut graft on final nasal tip position has been a subject of ongoing debate. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze a series of 100 consecutive primary rhinoplasty cases performed without the use of columellar strut grafts with a specific focus directed toward comparing preoperative morphed and actual postoperative changes in nasal tip position. Methods: Data were collected from patient charts and digital images of 100 consecutive primary open rhinoplasty patients. Preoperative morphed and actual postoperative digital images were quantitatively analyzed using image-processing software to compare various anatomical features including nasal tip projection nasolabial angle and Goode ratio. Patient satisfaction regarding long-term postoperative results was also surveyed. Results: Primary rhinoplasty did not demonstrate a universal trend toward either an increase or a decrease in nasal tip projection. The planned changes in nasal tip projection nasal tip rotation and nasal profile proportions were obtained with statistically significant accuracy without the use of columellar strut grafts. The overall incidence of columellar contour irregularities was 3 percent. Conclusion: In primary open approach rhinoplasty if native anatomical support structures of the nasal tip are preserved or reconstructed preoperative goals regarding nasal tip projection nasal profile proportions and columellar integrity can be consistently achieved without using columellar strut grafts.;2015
Background: The harvesting of septal cartilage following mucoperichondrial flap elevation has almost become a standard step in rhinoplasty. However the strength of the remaining septum has not yet been evaluated. In the current experimental study of a rabbit rhinoplasty model the remaining septum following a graft harvest was analyzed both biomechanically and pathologically. Methods: Forty New Zealand rabbits were classified into four equal groups. Group 1 consisted of the animals in which unilateral elevation of the mucoperichondrial flaps was undertaken before the graft harvest group 2 consisted of the animals in which bilateral elevation was undertaken group 3 included the animals where the septum was exposed and left untouched after a bilateral mucosal flap elevation and group 4 was designated as the control group. Specimens were analyzed under light microscopy for multiple parameters. Biomechanical analyses were performed with a universal testing device at the Department of Engineering Biomechanical Laboratories Istanbul Technical University. Results: Biomechanical analysis in terms of maximum tension revealed significant results among the groups (p = 0.008). Although insignificant results were observed overall using a pathologic analysis the amount of chondrocytes was lower in group 2 than in group 1 (p = 0.099). The amounts of matrix collagen (p = 0.184) and fibrosis were (p = 0.749) higher in group 2 than in group 1. Conclusions: From these data the authors conclude that mucoperichondrium integrity plays a crucial role in the biomechanical strength of the septum. More sophisticated studies with further pathologic analysis are required to determine the exact mechanism of strength loss observed with mucoperichondrial flap elevation.;2016
Background: The hypoplastic weak lateral crus of the nose may cause concave alar rim deformity and in severe cases even alar rim collapse. These deformities may lead to both aesthetic disfigurement and functional impairment of the nose. Methods: The cephalic part of the lateral crus was folded and fixed to reinforce the lateral crus. The study included 17 women and 15 men with a median age of 24 years. The average follow-up period was 12 months. For 23 patients the described technique was used to treat concave alar rim deformity whereas for 5 patients who had thick and sebaceous skin it was used to prevent weakness of the alar rim. The remaining 4 patients underwent surgery for correction of a collapsed alar valve. Results: Satisfactory results were achieved without any complications. Conclusions: Turn-in folding of the cephalic portion of lateral crus not only functionally supports the lateral crus but also provides aesthetic improvement of the nasal tip as successfully as cephalic excision of the lateral crura.;2007
Background: The long nose with an inferiorly rotated tip commonly results from a discrepancy between tip support and the downward forces of long septum long upper lateral cartilage and elongated lower lateral cartilage. Although many techniques have been described for surgical correction very few studies were designed to include patient-reported outcomes. Objective: The purpose of this study was to introduce our current management of long nose with drooping tips as well as to present the patient-reported outcomes of our case series of endonasal rhinoplasties. Methods: This study prospectively analyzed 121 patients who underwent rhinoplasty for the correction of long nose with drooping tips. Study participants completed both a baseline questionnaire before the rhinoplasty operation and a postsurgical patient questionnaire 12 months following the operation including the European QOL Questionnaire and Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation Questionnaire. Results: Mean values corresponding to the European QOL Questionnaire visual analog scale score significantly increased after surgery compared with baseline (P < 0.01). Mean values corresponding to self-care (P < 0.01) usual activities (P < 0.05) discomfort (P < 0.01) and anxiety (P < 0.01) showed significant decrease after surgery. A general and significant improvement of the mean Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation Questionnaire scores by rhinoplasty increased from 20.14 +/- 7.38 to 82.05 +/- 12.8 (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Resection of the caudal portion of upper lateral cartilage may correct aesthetic problems in patients with long nose with a drooping tip in which a reduction in the width and the length of middle third of the nose is required. This study suggested an efficient method for aesthetic correction of long nose with the improved patient-reported outcomes.;2013
Background: The medial crura are almost always supported in tip surgery using columellar strut graft placement or tongue-in-groove suturing to the caudal septum. In this study the authors present a modified tongue-in-groove (called flexible tongue-in-groove) technique. Methods: A total of 237 patients who underwent open rhinoplasty between January of 2016 and June of 2018 were included in this retrospective study. The patients were divided into three main groups: (1) flexible tongue-in-groove (2) classic tongue-in-groove and (3) columellar strut. Using standardized preoperative and postoperative (1- 6- and 12-month) lateral view photographs the nasolabial angle and Goode ratio were measured for nasal tip rotation and projection respectively. Results: Flexible tongue-in-groove (n = 53) and classic tongue-in-groove (n = 107) techniques showed a significantly smaller decrease in the nasolabial angle from month 1 to month 12 than did the columellar strut technique (n = 77) (p < 0.05). These statistically significant differences were not found when the time intervals were narrowed (p > 0.05). Flexible and classic tongue-in-groove techniques showed significantly higher Goode ratios than did the columellar strut technique at 1 6 and 12 months (p < 0.05 for all). In various analyses using the nasolabial angle and Goode ratio no statistically significant difference was found between flexible and classic tongue-in-groove techniques (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Flexible and classic tongue-in-groove techniques provide more durable results in nasolabial angle and Goode ratio measurements than does the columellar strut technique in primary open-approach rhinoplasty. The flexible tongue-in-groove technique is as robust as the classic tongue-in-groove technique in appropriate cases.;2021
Background: The nasal tip position and shape is critical to the overall view of the external nose and is significant in planning rhinoplasty procedures. This study was designed to review our experience in nasal tip surgery and to describe our own version of the suture technique in patients having endonasal rhinoplasty. Methods: The technique is typically used in combination with other septorhinoplasty maneuvers to achieve the desired functional and cosmetic result. A telephone survey is designed aiming to give general information about the technique's outcomes. Results: Our technique reduces excess columellar show and provides adjustable controlled nasal tip rotation and projection. The survey conducted among patients followed > 1 year revealed that most patients (84 of 96) were very to completely satisfied with the appearance and symmetry of their nose. Of these 84 patients 48 were very satisfied and 36 were completely satisfied with the result. Two patients who required revision surgery were somewhat and moderately satisfied. Conclusion: We present this technique to share our experience in modifying the widely accepted tongue-in-groove technique in septorhinoplasty. The figure eight-shaped suture which avoids making the nose too stiff is the main difference of our method. (Am J Rhinol Allergy 25 429-431 2011 doi: 10.2500/ajra.2011.25.3678);2011
Background: The nose is an important part of the face and plays a significant role in interpersonal communication and self-esteem. Dorsal preservation techniques such as the push-down and let-down techniques are employed for dorsal hump reductions. Objectives: In this study several approaches were defined in which the let-down and push-down techniques were applied depending on the patients' needs. Methods: The records of 64 patients were assessed retrospectively. The patients who underwent either the push-down or let-down technique for hump reduction and who were eligible for these new approaches were included. In this research the distal part of the septum remained intact after both the push-down and let-down techniques. Patients were assessed before and 1 year after surgery employing the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE). Results: The follow-up period ranged from 16 to 25 months (median of 19.2 months). The median ROE score before surgery was 61.6 (minimum: 58 maximum: 64) and increased to 92.2 (minimum: 82 maximum: 96) points 12 months after surgery. This increase in the ROE score was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The excellent satisfaction rate was 93.75% according to the ROE scale. Conclusions: These approaches for the let-down and push-down techniques will lead to better results and present different choices to surgeons. The present study is also the first to the author's knowledge to demonstrate leaving behind an intact area of the distal septum in the push-down and let-down techniques.;2021
Background: The plunging-tip deformity has been attributed to the combined actions of nasal base muscles. However there are no quantitative data in the literature to discuss the effect of muscle transections on the clinical outcome. Objectives: This study was designed to assess the actions of the nasal tip nasal base and upper lip in patients with plunging-tip deformity and to compare their preoperative and postoperative activities following multiple myotomies. Methods: Patients were treated for nasal base animation deformity by the transection of the depressor septi nasalis myrtiformis nasalis and levator labii superior alaeque nasi muscles. The profile views of preoperative and 12 months postoperative photographs were selected for measurements. Rest and smile images were overlaid to achieve alignment and movements were measured with reference to the Frankfurt horizontal plane. Results: Twenty-seven (27) patients were included in the study. Movements of the nasal tip and nasal base were significantly reduced postoperatively. The upper lip shortened significantly in smile poses postoperatively compared with preoperative measurements. The change in the tip angle during animation significantly decreased in the postoperative measurements. Conclusions: Movements of the nasal tip and the alar base contributed significantly to the hyperdynamic nasal tip deformity. Transection of the nasal base muscles is an effective treatment method with a weaker recovery of the muscle function in the long term. Dynamic upper lip shortening is an unexpected finding following surgery and should be investigated further.;2018
Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the warping angle of the costal cartilage in vivo. Methods: A nasal framework reconstruction with a rib graft was performed in a total of 130 patients. After the cartilage specimens were prepared the remaining grafts were used for study. The angle of warping in all grafts was measured at 0 30 and 60 minutes after 24 hours and after 1 week. Eight subgroups of graft thicknesses from central and peripheral groups determined according to the perichondral distance of the grafts were evaluated and the warping angles of 48 osteochondral and chondral grafts were measured individually. Three-way analysis of variance was used to compare the change in warping over time to detect differences in the grafts. Results: Significant differences were not observed in the 1-to 3-mm-thick grafts of peripheral and central origin before 30 minutes (p > 0.05) although significant differences were observed in these groups for all time points after 30 minutes (p < 0.05). In central and peripheral grafts thicker than 4 mm a significant warping angle was not observed (p > 0.05). In central origin grafts thinner than 1 mm significant differences were not observed in the warping angle (p > 0.05) although they were observed in the same grafts of peripheral origin (p < 0.05). Peripheral origin grafts thicker than 1 mm showed warping in the direction of the perichondrium (p < 0.05) whereas central origin grafts thinner than 1 mm showed warping angle irregularities. Conclusion: Interlocking stresses are very important in rib grafts when balanced cross-sectional carving occurs from the peripheral to the central areas.;2018
Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of local arnica and mucopolysaccharide polysulfate treatment on the regression of postoperative edema and ecchymosis in patients who have undergone open technique rhinoplasty. Method: One hundred eight patients were included in the study. Participants were randomized into three groups all of whom had undergone rhinoplasty. Group 1 (n = 36) received postoperative arnica cream treatment and group 2 (n = 36) received postoperative mucopolysaccharide polysulfate cream treatment. Group 3 (n = 36 control group) consisted of patients who received no postoperative local treatments. Patients were evaluated for 24 hours on days 2 5 7 and 10 after the operation. For the evaluation of postoperative edema and ecchymosis a scale ranging from 0 to 4 was used and the groups were compared. Results: In groups 1 and 2 postoperative ecchymosis was significantly less than in the control group during postoperative days 1 5 and 7 (p < 0.005). The regression of the edema was also more rapid in groups 1 and 2 than in the control group during evaluations on postoperative days 1 5 and 7 (p < 0.005). Neither edema nor ecchymosis was significantly different between groups 1 and 2 (p > 0.005). Conclusions: The authors' results suggest that a rapid regression of edema and ecchymosis may be achieved by local treatments of arnica and mucopolysaccharide polysulfate cream. In addition there are no significant differences between these two treatment regimens. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic II.;2016
Background: The Suction Above Cuff Endotracheal Tube (SACETT) has a dorsal port above the cuff designed to enable the continuous or intermittent suctioning of secretions from the subglottic space. Thus it facilitates the suctioning of excessive secretions above the cuff and around the glottis. Objectives: In this study we investigated the effect of the using the SACETT on laryngospasm and postoperative complications in rhinoplasty operations. Methods: This randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled 132 patients undergoing rhinoplasty. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: Suction above Cuff Endotracheal Tube (n=66 Group SA) and classic endotracheal tube (n=66 Group C). Complications following general anesthesia were statistically analyzed among the two groups. Results: The incidence of postoperative laryngospasm (p=0.02) and respiratory complications was found to be lower in Group SA than in Group C. In addition the incidence of agitation (p=0.035) postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (p=0.041) which required antiemetic drug administration swallowing difficulty (p=0.012) and sore throat (p=0.027) were found to be lower in Group SA than in Group C. Conclusion: We suggest that using the SACETT in rhinoplasty reduces the incidence of postoperative respiratory complications as well as the incidence of agitation sore throat swallowing difficulty and PONV.;2019
Background: The upper limit of rhinoplasty age increases as the concept of old age shifts forward. Rhinoplasty operations of this era have their own characteristics. The aim of this study is to point out these characteristic features and propose solutions to the problems observed in our series. Materials and Methods: Between 2014 and 2018 32 primary rhinoplasties were performed on patients over 55 years of age. A comprehensive preoperative evaluation was done in all cases. Wider skin undermining was a prerequisite to overcome skin redundancy. Proper elevation of the droopy nose was the primary goal. Placement of a wide and homogeneously crushed cartilage graft over the lower and upper lateral cartilages was applied in all patients for structural support in addition to standard measures. In patients with extreme droopiness a deep temporal or rectus fascial sling was applied between the columella and the nasal dorsum to support tip elevation. Results: The follow-up period was 6 months-4 years. All of the patients were satisfied with the postoperative results except for one case having dorsal irregularities and one case with postoperative relapse of the droopiness. Revisional operations of these patients were performed with the utilization of deep temporal fascia. A pulmonary embolus was encountered in one patient in 56 years of age at the 39(th)-postoperative day. She was hospitalized and an anticoagulant treatment was applied. Conclusion: The most important problem in this age group is the droopiness of the tip. The use of a wide and homogeneously crushed septal cartilage graft over both the upper and lower lateral cartilages and autologous fascial sling rising and stabilizing the tip may help to prevent its relapse.;2020
Background: There are instances where small or large pockets are filled with diced cartilage in the nose without use of wrapping materials. For this purpose 1-cc commercial syringes were used. The obtained results were partial and incomplete. For better and improved results the author designed new syringes with two different sizes which compress the diced cartilage for injection. Methods: The author presents his experience accrued over the past 12 years with 2366 primary 749 secondary 67 cleft lip and nose and a total of 3182 rhinoplasties using his new syringe design which compresses diced cartilage and injects the diced cartilages as a conglutinate mass simulating carved costal cartilage but a malleable one. Results: In 3125 patients the take of cartilage graft was complete (98.2 percent) and a smooth surface was obtained giving them a natural appearance. In 21 patients (0.65 percent) there was partial resorption of cartilage. Correction was performed with touch-up surgery by reinjection of a small amount of diced cartilage. In 36 patients (1.13 percent) there was overcorrection that 1 year later was treated by simple rasping. Conclusions: Compared with diced cartilage wrapped with Surgicel or fascia the amount of injected cartilage graft is predictable because it consists purely of cartilage. The injected diced cartilage because it is compressed and becomes a conglutinated mass resembles a wood chip and simulates carved cartilage. It is superior to carved cartilage in that it is moldable time saving and gives a good result with no late show or warping. The injection takes only a few minutes.;2017
Background: There are many variables that influence nose tip harmony. Even in a rhinoplasty that appears successful in profile one may see nostril asymmetries alar retractions or irregularities in the soft triangle and patients express their dissatisfaction with these simple deformities. Objectives: In this study we define the ratio of caudal and cephalic excess of the lower lateral cartilage. We evaluate whether it is possible to eliminate nostril asymmetries and alar retractions by means of supporting the facet polygon with the help of a lower lateral cartilage auto-rim flap a technique we have developed in our rhinoplasties. Methods: The auto-rim flap was used successively on 498 primary rhinoplasty patients on whom the same surgeon operated between May 2013 and June 2015 performing marginal incisions. Results: Of the 498 patients in the series only 1 of the first 10 required a revision due to tip asymmetry related to the auto-rim flap. A minimal nostril asymmetry that did not require intervention occurred in 10 patients. In none of the patients could an increased alar retraction be seen postoperatively. All patients exhibited alar cartilage in the anatomically correct position. Conclusions: With the auto-rim flap technique a part of the caudal excess of the alar cartilage remains as a flap in the facet region therefore there is no need in the cephalic region to perform more of an excision than what is strictly necessary.;2017
BACKGROUND: There are various complications that can occur in septorhinoplasty most of which are related to postoperative failure to achieve the desired aesthetic result. However there are also many other complications including postoperative bleeding which is one of the most common nonaesthetic-related complications. OBJECTIVE: The present study was a prospective analysis involving a total of 750 septorhinoplasty patients and included individuals who experienced massive bleeding after postoperative day 8. RESULTS: The incidence of bleeding was 2% among all patients. One percent of cases with bleeding occurred between postoperative days 8 and 14. None of the patients exhibited an abnormality in preoperative or postoperative coagulation tests. Mean blood loss was approximately 1 unit. In all patients clots in the nose were cleaned bleeding was subsequently controlled by placement of a polyvinyl alcohol sponge tampon soaked in adrenalin and tranexamic acid and intravenous administration of 250 mg tranexamic acid in isotonic saline solution. This treatment was sufficient for all cases. None of the patients expereinced recurrent bleeding nor did they require a blood transfusion. CONCLUSION: Late bleeding in septorhinoplasty is rare. It may be prevented by completely filling the nasal cavity so that there is no dead space between the septal mucosal membranes and the drainage opening. If bleeding occurs it can be treated by placement of a tampon soaked in adrenalin and tranexamic acid plus intravenous administration of 250 mg tranexamic acid.;2016
Background: This article aims to present and discuss 53 patients who received a new identity because of major changes to the face after treatment with bimaxillary osteotomy concomitant maxillomalar augmentation genioplasty and rhinoplastic procedures for their complex dentofacial skeletal deformity and class 3 malocclusion. Methods: During a 12-year period (January 1993 to April 2005) more than 500 patients with dentofacial deformities and malocclusions have undergone orthognathic surgery performed by a team consisting of the same plastic surgeons and orthodontists. Among this group 53 patients (30 women and 23 men) underwent surgery for both aesthetic and functional concerns. The mean patient age was 20.4 years (range 17-28 years). All the patients were treated with bimaxillary osteotomy concomitant maxillomalar augmentation osseous genioplasty and rhinoplastic procedures in the same session. The patients were followed 12 to 44 months by the plastic surgeon and at least 1 year by the orthodontist. Results: There was no orthognathic relapse or other major complications requiring reoperation. There was prolonged nerve anesthesia or hypoesthesia that resolved within 6 months for 4 patients (7.5%) a short period of anesthesia or hypoesthesia that resolved within 4 weeks for 11 patients (20.7%) a wide alar base in 3 patients and a slight deviation of the cartilage septum in 2 patients. Conclusion: In one session five different procedures can be performed without any problem each of which can produce major changes to the face while maintaining the whole facial harmony. The authors determined that these dramatic positive outcomes for the combined procedure can easily be tolerated and accepted by all their patients. However the patients have had difficulty with their family or friends accepting their new appearance and even have had to change their photos on identification cards. This is encouraging for the management of new patients in the future.;2007
Background: This is the third survey exploring the quality of cosmetic training in plastic surgery residency. We focused on determining: (1) the applied modalities and extent of resident exposure and (2) resident confidence in performing variable cosmetic procedures. Objectives: To analyze trends in resident exposure and confidence in aesthetic plastic surgery procedures from the standpoint of program directors (PDs) and residents. Methods: The survey was developed and e-mailed to 424 residents enrolled in the ASAPS Residents Program and 95 PDs. Both independent and integrated programs were included. The questions were posed in a five-point ranking format. Univariate statistical analysis was used to examine all aspects. The results were analyzed in relation to our previous surveys in 2008 and 2011. Results: Thirty-three PDs (34.7%) and 224 (52.8%) residents responded. Residents felt most confident with abdominoplasty breast reduction and augmentation-mammaplasty. Facial aesthetic procedures especially rhinoplasty and facelift were perceived as challenging. The three most preferred modalities of aesthetic education were in descending order residents' clinic staff cosmetic patients and cadaver dissections. Both residents and PDs felt a need for more training especially in facial procedures. Only 31.5% of residents who planned to focus on cosmetic surgery felt ideally prepared integrating cosmetic surgery into their practice (compared to 50% in previous surveys). Conclusions: Despite improvements observed from 2008 to 2011 published surveys there are still challenges to be met especially in facial cosmetic procedures. It is suggested that resident clinics and cadaver courses be universally adopted by all training programs.;2017
Background: This study investigated the effectiveness of makeup camouflage procedures for patients who have experienced social problems because undesirable ecchymoses and edemas after aesthetic surgery The impacts of camouflage procedures for such patients also were studied. Methods: For this study 46 rhinoplasty patients were divided into two groups: postoperative camouflage makeup was used for 23 patients whereas the other 23 patients were assessed as the control group Additionally 18 blepharoplasty patients also were divided into two similar camouflage and control groups. Results: The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory test given to the patients postoperatively indicated that postoperative makeup provided positive effects for patients. Conclusion: The current clinical study investigated the effects of cosmetics on the psychological state of patients during the postoperative period and included the application of camouflage makeup for postrhinoplasty and postblepharoplasty patients with edemas and ecchymoses. Psychologically the patients felt better.;2005
Background: Traumatic nasal deformities have a wide spectrum of presentations which further complicates their management and preoperative planning. Although many methods and algorithms have been proposed for management of specific posttraumatic nasal deformities such as twisted deviated saddle or short nose these algorithms usually focus on a specific deformity in isolation from the remainder of the nose. Objectives: The aim of this study is to present an algorithm for traumatic nasal deformities and to evaluate the functional and aesthetic outcomes of this new algorithm by a preoperative and postoperative quality-of-life questionnaire. Methods: Patients with traumatic nasal deformity were operated on according to our surgical algorithm. Preoperative and postoperative Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) scores which is a rhinoplasty outcome survey were evaluated. Results: A total of 120 patients were included in the study. The mean preoperative ROE score was 3.3 +/- 1.9 and mean postoperative ROE score was 20.4 +/- 3.2. There was a statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative ROE scores (P < 0.001). There was a negative mild to moderate statistically significant correlation between preoperative scores and benefit (difference between postoperative and preoperative scores) (r = -0.465 P < 0.001) which means patients with lower scores had more improvement from the surgery. During the follow-up period relapse of deviation hypertrophic inferior turbinate and intranasal synechia were found in 9% (n = 11) 6.6% (n = 8) and 3.3% (n = 4) of patients respectively. Conclusions: In this study a comprehensive surgical algorithm applicable to all traumatic nasal deformities is suggested and the results of 120 patients with traumatic nasal deformities are presented.;2018
Background:Misshapen or weak lateral crura can cause an inward collapse of the lateral crus observed on deep inspiration. The lateral crural strut graft is a popular technique for reinforcing lateral crura. Failure to stabilize the graft properly can however result in graft displacement postoperatively and an accompanying aesthetic deformity.Objectives:The authors discuss lateral crus reinforcement with the sandwiched lateral crural reinforcement (SLCR) graft.Methods:An SLCR graft was placed in 30 nonconsecutive primary open-approach rhinoplasty procedures by the senior author (.K.) between February 2010 and May 2012. Cephalic excess of the lateral crura was incised and placed under the lateral crura the lateral crural strut grafts were placed between the 2 cartilages and the cephalic edges of both the superior and inferior lateral crura segments were sutured together.Results:Of the 30 patients there were 5 men and 25 women ranging in age from 22 to 45 years (median 35 years). Half (50%) of the patients received the SLCR graft for external valve collapse in 30% of the patients it was placed to support the lateral crura after correcting cephalic malpositioning and 20% had an SLCR graft placed for lateral crural reinforcement after deformity secondary to dome-shaping sutures. No graft displacement or tip disfigurement was observed in the follow-up period (mean 24 months).Conclusions:The SLCR graft technique represents a powerful tool for reinforcing lateral crura without discarding the cephalic portion of the cartilage thus securing a stable graft pocket while minimizing any postoperative structural dislocation.Level of Evidence: 4<inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink xlink:href=10.1177_1090820X14523021-img1.tif xlink:type=simple></inline-graphic;2014
BackgroundA good understanding of nasal tip support mechanisms is essential for achieving successful and functional rhinoplasty results. The loss of nasal tip support resulting from different maneuvers adopted during rhinoplasty and how this loss is affected by reconstructive applications should be known. This study evaluated and compared changes in nasal tip support perioperatively after different techniques were used during septorhinoplasty.MethodsPatients who underwent primary open rhinoplasty between January 2018 and March 2018 in a tertiary medical center were included in this prospective blind case series. Nasal tip resistance measurements were taken after perioperative maneuvers by creating enough force to achieve 1mm 2mm and 3mm of displacement at the tip region. Measurements were obtained during six different stages using a Newton meter: preoperatively after caudal septal resection after skin flap elevation after the columellar strut or tongue-in-groove procedure after tip suturing and postoperatively. Our hypothesis was that during septorhinoplasty each maneuver used changes the tip support intraoperatively. The predictor variables were the different rhinoplasty techniques used. The outcome variable was nasal tip resistance to compression intraoperatively and immediate postoperatively. Appropriate statistics were computed and a p<0.05 value was considered significant.ResultsTen of the 15 patients were female and 5 were male. The patient age ranged from 19 to 40 (mean 24.84.9). The tongue-in-groove technique was applied in 5 of the patients while columellar strut grafting was performed in 10. The application of columellar strut grafting did not create a significant increase in nasal tip support (p>0.05). An increase in nasal tip support was observed at each stage (85% 53% 35%) after application of the tongue-in-groove technique (p<0.05).ConclusionsA novel and reproducible technique for digitally evaluating manual force is presented for determining changes in nasal tip support with different maneuvers applied in living patients undergoing rhinoplasty. No significant difference was noted between the preoperative and postoperative measurements for columellar strut grafting. The tongue-in-groove technique is an important maneuver that has a significant effect on nasal tip support. According to our data the interdomal and intercrural ligaments the medial crus-septum connections and the connections between alar cartilage and overlying skin and muscle tissue are important structures for tip support.Level of Evidence IV This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

BackgroundPharyngeal packing (PP) is commonly performed to reduce the incidence of perioperative blood ingestion (PBI) in nasal surgery (NS) and thus the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). This study examined the effects of PP on the perioperative gastric volume (GV) and PONV in patients undergoing NS by ultrasound assessment.MethodsPatients undergoing elective NS [septoplasty septo-rhinoplasty (SRP) and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)] were randomised to receive or not receive PP. In the PP group pharyngeal packs were placed after the orotracheal intubation. Ultrasound assessments were performed for all patients preoperatively (before the anaesthesia induction) and postoperatively (before the extubation). The antero-posterior (AP) and cranio-caudal (CC) antral diameters antral cross-sectional area (ACSA) and total GV were calculated. PONV incidence and severity were rated. These variables were compared between timepoints and groups and in the subgroup analyses according to the surgery type. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess correlations between the variables.ResultsAP and CC diameters and ACSAs were greater postoperatively than preoperatively in the PP and non-PP groups (n=44 each all p<0.05). Postoperative AP and CC diameters and the ACSA were greater in the non-PP than in the PP group (all p<0.05). Postoperative AP diameters were greater than preoperatively in patients undergoing SRP and FESS and the postoperative CC diameter and ACSA were greater than preoperatively in patients undergoing SRP (all p<0.05). Surgery duration was correlated positively with postoperative AP diameter (r=0.380 p<0.05) CC diameter (r=0.291 p<0.05) and ACSA (r=0.369 p<0.05). Patients who underwent septoplasty surgery PP was decreased PONV incidence and severity at the first four hours postoperatively (p<0.05).ConclusionsThe study findings indicate that PP reduces the increase in the perioperative GV due to PBI in an elective NS. It is therefore a useful and safe means of reducing the risk of perioperative pulmonary aspiration in such surgeries.Trial registrationAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCT) ACTRN12619000487112 25/03/2019 Trial registration retrospectively registered.;2019
Because of physiologic changes with advancing age as well as previously traumatized and then healed tissues secondary rhinoplasty for a middle-aged patient is a challenging procedure. Depending on both factors changes in the midvault can cause a functional airway disorder and the nose also may need a complete correction for cosmetic purposes. To achieve aesthetic and functional outcomes augmentation rhinoplasty using a combination of triple cartilage grafts namely spreader columellar and dorsal onlays was performed for 12 patients. Sufficient nasal airways with satisfactory appearance were achieved for I I of 12 patients. Only one patient had improved but still insufficient nasal function with a good aesthetic result. Augmentation rhinoplasty using a combination of triple cartilage grafts for middle-aged patients could be considered an effective procedure for improving the patient's nasal airway and appearance.;2005
Because rhinoplastic surgery predominantly deals with the osseocartilaginous skeleton droopy noses with thick skin remain a problem to be solved. In these noses neglecting excess skin can impair long-lasting and complete correction of the nasal deformity. As these noses already require redundant dorsal skin resection surgical manipulations can be executed entirely through the dorsal skin excision window instead of the transcolumellar approach. The wide-open dorsal approach rhinoplasty (WoDAR) was developed to allow removal of excess dorsal skin and reconstruction of the nasal osseocartilaginous framework through the excised dorsal skin avoiding a transcolumellar incision. Nine male patients with thick skin and significantly ptotic noses were operated with WoDAR. The cosmetic appearance of the noses was evaluated by the patients before and after the operation using a visual analog scale (VAS). The nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) scale was evaluated individually preoperatively and postoperatively. The nasolabial angle (NLA) was measured preoperatively at the third twelfth and twenty-fourth months postoperatively. Dorsal scars were evaluated by means of the Stony Brook's scar evaluation scale (SBSES). Patients (mean age: 51.4 +/- A 4.8 years) were followed for an average duration of 20.6 +/- A 8.4 months. Cosmetic evaluation revealed that the mean patient preoperative VAS score was 23.3 +/- A 25.6 whereas the postoperative VAS score was 92.6 +/- A 14.8. Preoperative and postoperative NOSE scores were 79.5 +/- A 16.5 and 11.5 +/- A 11.5 respectively. The mean preoperative NLA was 72.9 +/- A 2.9A degrees and at the third and twelfth month postoperatively was 92 +/- A 6.5 and 91 +/- A 5.4. The NLA measurements of all four patients followed for 24 months revealed less than 2A degrees derotation compared to third postoperative month. The mean SBSES score was 4.1 +/- A 0.8 out of 5. WoDAR allowed esthetically and functionally pleasing outcomes. This advantageous technique can be regarded as a surgical alternative for carefully selected aged patients with severely ptotic thick-skinned noses who might otherwise end up with unsatisfying results both for surgeon and patients.

Being aware of the morphologic differences in the nasal anatomy between men and women during the cosmetic rhinoplasty is essential because feminization of a male nose is not a very rare complication. Although there is no difference in the techniques of male and female rhinoplasty the anthropometric differences have to be considered. This morphometric study evaluated the nasal shapes in both sexes and the related differences in the nostril forms. The nostril forms were separated into 4 main groups such as teardrop heart shaped round and triangular. In this landmark-based morphometric study significant relations of nostril forms to the nasal shape frontonasal and nasolabial angles were found. The results of this study should make us think about these relations of nostril forms to the nasal shapes and should be a basement for further clinical studies enhancing the plans of the corrective surgery.;2008
Binder syndrome is an uncommon disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by hypoplasia of the nose and maxilla and altered morphology of the associated soft tissue. We report a 19-year-old Binder syndrome patient with short-nose deformity and anterior nasal spine agenesis. We present a surgical technique for nasal spine agenesis treatment. We used a titanium screw without a graft which supported the nasal tip and increased tip projection. As there is good soft-tissue coverage over the screw infection or extrusion was not encountered and the patient had no complaints 1 year after surgery.;2008
Branchial cleft cysts are benign masses of the head and neck. Etiopathogenesis is unclear and many factors such as inflammatory mechanisms can play a role. The aim of our study is to investigate the predictive value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and mean platelet volume (MPV) which are hematologic inflammatory markers in branchial cleft cyst (BCC). The records of 27 patients who were operated with the diagnosis of BCC in the ENT clinic between January 2011 and March 2020 and 27 healty subjects were retrospectively reviewed. The control group consisted age and sex-matched subjects scheduled for rhinoplasty. Neutrophil lymphocyte platelet and MPV values were recorded from the complete blood count samples for all participants. The statistical relationship for NLR PLR and MPV values between the patient and the control groups was investigated. The NLR values of the patients were significantly lower than the healthy controls (p:0.007). But no statistically significant correlation was found for PLR (p:0.586) and MPV(p:0.676) values between the groups. This is the first study to evaluate the significance of NLR PLR and MPV in branchial cleft cyst. Decreased NLR may be used as a predictive marker for BCC. But PLR ande MPV should not be used to predict branchial cleft cyst.;2021
Cartilage created by tissue engineering is a promising new development in facial reconstructive surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the histological results of implantation of synthetic polymer scaffold with chondrocytes differentiated from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Adipose tissue obtained from Wistar albino rats was dissociated incubated and placed in culture medium. After a sufficient level of stem cell proliferation the differentiation phase was started. Cells were collected on the 7th and 21st day of culture for chondrogenic characterization. After the 21st day of the differentiation phase of chondrocytes they were transferred onto poly(dl-lactide-epsilon-caprolactone) synthetic polymer and culture continued for 24 hours. The scaffold with chondrocytes was then implanted into a subcutaneous area of skin on the back of the neck of the rat. Six weeks after implantation all rats were sacrificed and the implantation areas were analyzed. Chondrocytes derived from adipogenic mesenchymal stem cells were stained positively with collagen II aggrecan and Sox-9 after the differentiation stages. Histological examination of the excised material showed that chondrocytes were present and the scaffold had been completely absorbed. The results of this study indicate that the differentiation method from mesenchymal stem cells to chondrogenic lineage was straightforward and scaffold with cells was easily accessible. This technique may be a good option for cartilage tissue engineering.;2019
Cartilage grafts are commonly used in nasal surgery for structural and/or esthetic purposes. The viability of cartilage grafts has been investigated in many forms since the use of cartilage grafts in surgical procedures. The objective of this study was to investigate the viability of minced cartilage grafts and whether there is a difference between grafts wrapped in Surgicel(A (R)) Original and Surgicel Fibrillar. A total of ten New Zealand rabbits were used for the study. Cartilage grafts were harvested from one side ear. Four groups were formed. Group 1: minced cartilage graft wrapped in Surgicel Fibrillar Group 2: minced cartilage graft wrapped in Surgicel Original Group 3: bare minced cartilage graft and Group 4: bare diced cartilage graft. Four small subcutaneous pockets were made in the backs of the rabbits and the grafts were placed in these pockets. All of the rabbits were sacrificed at the end of 3 months and the samples were collected. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) toluidin blue safranin-O masson trichrome and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemical. All specimens were assessed histopathologically under a light microscope. There was no statistically significant difference between the Surgicel Fibrillar and Surgicel Original groups with respect to any of the parameters. Bone formation calcification inflammation fibrosis and basophilia were similar in all groups with no significant difference among them. In the Surgicel Fibrillar and Surgicel Original groups a heavy chondrocyte nucleus loss accompanied by a minimal peripheral proliferation was observed. The viability of bare minced cartilage grafts was found to be similar to that of bare diced cartilage in this study. Minced cartilage grafts can be used in the correction of minor dorsal defects and irregularities in persons with thin nasal skins especially in primary and revision rhinoplasty. Although there is no statistically significant difference between the Surgicel Fibrillary and Surgicel Original groups we think that if it is necessary to use oxidized regenerated cellulose it should be in the fibrillar form.;2016
Cartilage grafts are the most commonly used grafts for structural and aesthetic purposes. This study aimed to compare the viability of diced cartilage grafts wrapped in fascia with diced cartilage grafts wrapped in perichondrium. Approximately 2 x 2 cm cartilage grafts were harvested from the ears of seven New Zealand rabbits diced to approximately 1-mm cubes and then wrapped in perichondrium harvested from the ears or muscle fascia harvested from the right rear leg of the same rabbits. The wrapped grafts were then weighed and implanted into two paravertebral subcutaneous cavities created on the shaved backs of the donor rabbits. After 3 months the rabbits were sacrificed and the grafts were removed weighed and examined histopathologically. We found no statistically significant difference in the weights of the two graft types before and after embedding. The mean chondrocyte viability was 87.14 % in the perichondrium-wrapped cartilage grafts and 41.43 % in the fascia-wrapped grafts which was determined to be statistically significant. Overall our findings show that cartilage grafts wrapped in perichondrium led to higher chondrocyte viability and graft survival rates as compared with grafts wrapped in fascia. This method may be used as an alternative in clinical practice to provide patients requiring cartilage grafts with positive long-term effects lower morbidity and lower costs associated with the procedure.;2014
Cartilage grafts are used routinely in rhinoplasty but are they necessary? Can we support the normal anatomy by preserving and transposing the adjacent tissues? In this study we hypothesize that during rhinoplasty cartilage flaps can give adequate support and may decrease the need for cartilage grafts. Included in this study were 147 patients who underwent an open rhinoplasty technique under general anesthesia between January 2010 and May 2012. Mean operative time was 73 min (range = 44-120 min). After dissection and septoplasty (if needed) we performed dorsal bone and septal reductions. Following reduction upper lateral cartilage superior segments were preserved and turned inward as cartilage flaps to replace the spreader grafts. Lower lateral cartilage cranial parts were not excised and were slid over the caudal part to replace the alar strut grafts. Cartilage from the caudal nasal septum was not excised instead lower lateral cartilages were cephaloposteriorly displaced with a tongue-in-groove technique to support the nasal tip. Mean follow-up time was 19.6 months (6-30 months). All patients but 12 were satisfied or completely satisfied with the results. Among the 12 unsatisfied patients four complained of a one-sided inverted-V deformity (secondary spreader grafts were added) three had supratip deformity (secondary additional dorsal septal excisions) two demanded extra tip definition (secondary tipoplasty) two were unhappy with the bone symmetry (secondary osteotomies) and one complained of hanging columella (secondary excision from the caudal septum). Cartilage flaps have some advantages over cartilage grafts. First graft harvest is not needed in the former second because flaps are a part of the normal anatomy they provide a good tissue match making fixation easier. However the tongue-in-groove technique cannot be used in patients who do not need caudal excision and cartilage flaps can be inadequate in some patients who may need additional grafts.

Cartilage grafts have great value in augmentation rhinoplasty. For most surgeons an autogenous cartilage graft is the first choice in rhinoplasty because of its resistance to infection and resorption. On the other hand an allogenous cartilage graft might be preferred over an autogenous graft to avoid additional morbidity and lengthened operating time. Allogenous cartilage grafts not only have the advantage of averting donor site morbidity but also are resistant to infection resembling autogenous cartilage grafts. The authors present their experience with 41 patients who underwent augmentation rhinoplasty using 22 autogenous and 19 allogenous cartilage grafts between June 1994 and August 2004. For evaluation of adequate augmentation rates photographic analyses were performed on preoperative early postoperative and late postoperative photographs from all the patients. To assess patient satisfaction the Facial Appearance Sorting Test (FAST) was applied preoperatively and late postoperatively in both groups. These results were compared and it was concluded that in terms of resorption there was no difference in the early and late postoperative follow-up data between allogenous and autogenous cartilage grafts. Evaluation of the preoperative and early postoperative photographic outcomes showed statistically significant differences with respect to adequate augmentation rates between the two groups. The FAST scores showed statistically significant differences between preoperative and late postoperative outcomes. There were no infections in the two groups of patients.;2008
Cartilage is commonly grafted during primary and secondary rhinoplasties as a means of addressing both functional and esthetic issues. Generally such grafts are taken from the nasal septum but auricular conchae or ribs may serve as donor sites if needed. However the latter often entail considerable morbidity and graft mismatch. To circumvent these drawbacks use of implants or processed cartilage (allogenic or xenogenic in origin) has been proposed. Herein the isogenic transfer of nasal septal cartilage between identical twins is reported.;2015
Cephalic trimming of the lower lateral cartilage (LLC) of the nose is often performed to refine a broad nasal tip in the horizontal dimension. The focus of cephalic trimming remains the preservation of the width of the lateral crura and the cartilage remnant at the cephalic end of the LLC is usually left intact which leads to inadequate cephalic trimming. The authors suggest that cephalic trimming should continue all the way to the cephalic end of the LLC and no remnant cartilage should be left in the scroll area. This would make it possible to reduce the bulk of the nasal tip in an acceptable manner. Trimming of the whole cephalic side of the LLC would disrupt the scroll area allowing authors to assess rhinoplasty as a 2-stage surgical procedure: that is nasal tip and middle vault. In conclusion complete cephalic trimming without leaving any remnant cartilage in the scroll area is necessary for adequate nasal tip refinement and disruption of the scroll area allows the rhinoplasty to be compartmentalized to achieve more desirable results in the middle vault and the nasal tip.;2016
Cleft lip nose rhinoplasty is a challenging procedure because of the different presentation and severity of the deformity. Due to this presentation type there is still no standard procedure correcting all the components of the deformity although a number of techniques have been published in literature. In this study the effectiveness of the combination of open rhinoplasty and the Dibbel technique with nasal sill augmentation was evaluated. We hereby report our experience with 7 patients who had unilateral cleft lip nose deformity with slumped lower lateral cartilage and underprojected and deformed dome operated on between September 2010 and April 2013 by 1 surgeon. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 24.5 years (18-38 years) and the patients were followed up for an average of 18.5 months (6-31 months). All patients were operated on with open rhinoplasty and Dibbel technique combination with nasal sill augmentation. Frontal lateral oblique and basilar photographs were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively for each patient. Nasal projection columella height nasolabial angle nasal sill symmetry and base width were measured on the photographs for comparison of preoperative and postoperative results. All patients' medial and lateral cantus distances were used for photographic standardization. The results demonstrated that there was a statistically significant increase in nasal projection (2.13 +/- 0.28mm preoperatively versus 2.31 +/- 0.08mm postoperatively P = 0.018) columella height (1.07 +/- 0.25mm preoperatively versus 1.21 +/- 0.18mm postoperatively P = 0.028) nostril apex height (1.11 +/- 0.15mm preoperatively versus 1.22 +/- 0.11mm postoperatively P< 0.028) nasolabial angle (77.71 +/- 8.74mm preoperatively versus 91.33 +/- 6.49mm postoperatively P< 0.05) and nasal sill symmetry (0.42 +/- 0.15mm preoperatively versus 0.27 +/- 0.07mm postoperatively P< 0.05) and a significant decrease of alar width (2.35 +/- 0.44mm versus 2.16 +/- 0.32mm postoperatively P = 0.018) on the affected side in response to surgery. The results of this study demonstrated that the Dibbel technique and open rhinoplasty combination with nasal sill augmentation is an effective and safe method for the correction of cleft lip nose deformity in respect to nasal symmetry.;2015
Combined cosmetic surgeries are advantageous to patients requiring only 1 anesthesia administration and the loss of fewer working days. There is no previous study reporting on a submuscular implant placement with the simultaneous reconstruction of a nose deformity using a rib graft. Reconstructions of nose deformities through a rib graft augmentation mammoplasty and augmentation mastopexy were performed on 4 female patients (who were 19 23 24 and 27 years old) between 2006 and 2016. The patients were taken for operations under general anesthesia. First the rib graft was taken and the breast implant was placed to prevent contamination. An inframammary incision was made the skin and the subcutaneous layers were passed and the pectoral muscle fascia was accessed for the rib graft in all 3 patients. After the perichondrium was dissected an osteochondral graft was harvested at full thickness. The remaining sharp edges were rasped to avoid damaging the silicone. The perichondrium and the periosteum were sutured edge-to-edge and the donor area was closed. The harvested grafts were used to produce a spreader graft a nasal valve graft an onlay graft and an L-strut graft. In the early period no seroma hematoma or infections were experienced. There were no ruptures leakages capsules or deformities during the 2- to 10-year follow-up. Primary and secondary rhinoplasties requiring a rib graft can be safely performed simultaneously with a breast implant provided that the rib stumps are closed with a thick protective layer.;2020
Comprehensive knowledge of nasal anatomy is essential for obtaining aesthetically and functionally pleasing results in rhinoplasty. In this study the authors described the anatomy histology and clinical relevance of the interdomal region keystone and scroll complex. The current study examined these areas in 26 fresh cadaver heads. All cadavers were fresh and no conservation or freezing processes were applied. All dissections were performed by the first author. It was determined that the structure that connected the middle crura in the interdomal region actually came together in the transverse plane and contained abundant capillaries within. It was observed that chondroblasts with high regenerative potential were present in the keystone area and there was very tight attachment between periosteum and perichondrium. The scroll complex was found to be more flexible and thin and had fewer regenerative cells compared to the keystone region. With its unique anatomy and histology the keystone acts as a transition area between the flexible and fixed units of the nose. The scroll complex should be taken into consideration during rhinoplasty because of its effects on fixation of the skin in the lateral supratip area and functional effects on internal and external nasal valves. The interdomal ligament in contrast acts as a transition between both middle crura rather than a real ligament.;2020
Conchal cartilage and temporal fascia grafts are useful materials for secondary rhinoplasty cases. Generally surgeons require to access autologous grafts fast and effortlessly. Harvesting 2 different types of graft such as cartilage and fascia however are associated with limitations such as additional surgery time extra incisions and postoperative additional distortions at the graft-host interface. The authors evolved a modified single incision that would harvest conchal cartilage and temporal fascia simultaneously by using 4mm endoscope and 3mm angled phaco slit knife.;2015
Congenital anatomic deformities or acquired weakness of the lateral crura of the lower lateral cartilages after rhinoplasty could cause alar rim deformities. As lower lateral cartilages are the structural cornerstone of the ala and tip support deformities and weakness of the alar cartilages might lead to both functional and esthetic problems. In this article we are introducing sliding alar cartilage flap as a new technique to reshape and support nasal tip. One hundred sixty consecutive patients between 18 and 55 years of age (mean age: 27.51) were included in the Study between January 2007 and May 2008. Of the total number of patients 60 were male and 100 of them were female. None of the patients had rhinoplasty procedure including lower lateral cartilage excision previously. Sliding alar cartilage technique was used in an open rhinoplasty approach to shape the nasal tip in all patients. This technique necessitates about 2 to 3 minutes for suturing and undermining the alar cartilages. The follow-up period was between 4 and 18 months. In no patients any revision related to the sliding alar cartilage technique was required. Revision was applied in 3 patients due to thick nasal tip skin and in one patient due to unpleasant columellar scar. In this article we are presenting the sliding alar cartilage flap as a new technique for creating natural looking nasal tip. This technique shapes and supports nasal tip by spontaneous sliding of the cephalic portion of the lower lateral cartilage beneath the caudal alar cartilage with minimal manipulation without any cartilage resection or cartilage grafting.;2009
Congenital anomalies of the nasal septum except septal deviation constitute a small portion of all congenital nasal anomalies. Congenital isolated absence of the membranous septum has not been reported in the literature before. We present a man who has congenital defect of membranous septum and who underwent an augmentation rhinoplasty with costal cartilaginous graft for his flattened nose.;2013
Congenital isolated anomalies of nasal cartilages are very rare and the etiology is still not fully understood. Although congenital defects of the lower lateral cartilage are usually associated with functional or major cosmetic problems they may also occasionally be presented as asymptomatic and incidental. Although their superiority to each other is not well known several methods have previously been described for reconstruction of the defect with autologous cartilage grafts or allogenic grafts. With proper intraoperative planning satisfactory results can be achieved in rhinoplasty operation in such cases. In this article we aimed to present a case of congenital unilateral isolated total lower lateral cartilage absence in a patient without any functional complaints and the reconstruction of it with autogenous cartilage graft.;2020
Congenital traumatic or developmental bony vault deformities may require additional interventions rather than classical osteotomies to correct the surface structure or angulations of the nasal bones in rhinoplasty. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of the additional osteotomies applied for the correction of the nasal vault asymmetries retrospectively. Twenty-one patients among 512 primary rhinoplasty cases between 2011 and 2016 with bony vault asymmetries were included in the study. Three patients had bilateral convex 6 patients had unilateral convex and 7 patients had unilateral concave surface deformities. Five patients had concave deformity on one side and convex deformity on the other side. Double-layer lateral osteotomies and caudal transverse osteotomies were conducted for the correction of the severe surface anatomy deformities of the nasal bones. The caudal transverse osteotomy was delicately performed with a special osteotome which was designed to protect inner periosteum and mucosa of the nasal bone and to prevent uncontrolled fracture formation with thinned edge. Twenty patients (95.2%) had favorable results with restoration of a symmetric bony and cartilaginous nasal vault configuration. None of the bone fragments showed any rotation or malposition. One (4.8%) patient with a crooked nose had suboptimal dorsal geometry without requiring revisional surgery at the level of the cartilaginous nasal vault. The author described the morphology clinical relevance and correction methods of the nasal vault and the changes that occur in this area during rhinoplasty in patients with concave convex or combined three-dimensional nasal bone deformities.;2019
Correction of major saddle nose deformities is one of the greatest challenges in nasal surgery. Here a new approach for the correction of major saddle nose deformities in which the missing parts of the nasal skeleton are replaced with their anatomic replicas sculptured from an autogenous osteocartilagineous rib graft is presented. Since 1998 this new technique has been used in 17 patients (11 females and 6 males) with major saddle nose deformities. The age range was between 19 and 37 years. The etiology of saddle nose deformity was iatrogenic in I I and traumatic in 2 patients. In the remaining 4 patients saddle nose was a part of ethnic facial features. During a mean follow-up of 2 years the sculptured nasal frame maintained its form and resistance. There was no patient with recurrent nasal collapse or airway obstruction. The nasal tip was naturally mobile in all patients. Replacing the missing parts of the nasal skeleton with their anatomic replicas created from autogenous tissues this new technique restores all anatomic and functional features of the nose. It efficiently corrects saddle nose deformity and eliminates associated functional deficiencies.;2008
Correction of the crooked nose is one of the most challenging procedures in rhinoplasty. The goals of the surgery are creation of a rigid and straight cartilaginous L-strut correction of the deviated bony structures and improvement of the nasal airway. Curvatures of the dorsal septum can be corrected with several techniques. Spreader grafts cartilage batten grafts or ethmoid bone grafts can be utilized for internal stenting to straighten the dorsal deviations. The surgical treatment for a deformed caudal septum with the most predictable and successful outcome is resection and replacement with a straight septal cartilage graft. In severe deviations of septum cartilage involving both dorsal and caudal portions of the L-strut extracorporeal reconstruction of the septal cartilage may be the required method. For correction of the deviated bony pyramid several osteotomy methods can be employed. Medial osteotomy low-to-low or low-to-high internal lateral osteotomy double-level lateral osteotomies and external lateral osteotomy are the options depending on the deformity. Dorsal onlay grafts can provide camouflage for any residual asymmetries after septal reconstruction or can be applied for dorsal augmentation.;2011
Correction of the crooked or deviated nose a complex cosmetic and functional problem is a big challenge for the rhinoplasty surgeon. Although corrections using a wide range of surgical techniques to straighten the nose and maximize nasal function have been proposed recurrence is very common because of cartilage memory and scar contracture. Therefore to prevent recurrence and to maintain the correction of the septum a permanent support that is stable and strong with the ability to maintain its given shape after placement on one or both sides of the septum is needed. For this purpose the authors planned to use a pair of custom-made high-density porous polyethylene (HDPP) extended spreader grafts. In this study the concept and technique of HDPP composed of a nonresorbable alloplastic material for correction of the crooked nose and the authors' experience using it are presented. Currently HDPP is readily available on the market as a thin plain sheet (0.85 x 38 x 50 mm) that can be cut to an appropriate size for spreader grafts. Ingrowths of fibrous tissue inside and around HDPP stabilize the upper lateral cartilages and septum in their new corrected position and maintain the corrected/straightened position. This material was used in 20 patients with crooked noses (9 with C-type and 11 with S-type noses). During a mean follow-up period of 18 months (range 8-30 months) there were no complications recurrences or extrusions. Functional evaluation was performed using a visual analog scale before surgery and 6 months after surgery. Patients were asked to score their nasal breathing on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. The mean preoperative value was 32.50% +/- 11.18% and the postoperative value was 88.75% +/- 8.71%. In conclusion the use of custom-made HDPP extended spreader grafts is a safe effective reliable and permanent method for correction of the crooked nose. In the long term the authors believe that custom-made HDPP extended spreader grafts provide functional recovery and increased strength against further trauma or forces of scar contracture and have the ability to prevent recurrence attributable to cartilage memory.;2006
Correction of the crooked or deviated nose a complex cosmetic and functional problem is a challenge for the rhinoplasty surgeon. Although corrections using a wide range of surgical techniques to straighten the nose and maximize nasal function have been proposed recurrence is very common because of cartilage memory and scar contracture. Therefore to prevent recurrence and to maintain the correction of the septum a stable strong and permanent support is needed with the ability to maintain its given shape after placement on one or both sides of the septum. For this purpose the author planned:to use a personally-shaped graft (EMSEN) with high-density porous polyethylene (Medpor Porex Surgical Inc. Newnan GA). In this study the concept and technique of Medpor composed of a nonresorbable alloplastic material for correction of the crooked nose and the authors' experience using it are presented. Currently Medpor is readily available on the market as a thin plain sheet (0.85 x 38 x 50 mm) that can be cut to an appropriate size for our (EMSEN) grafts. Ingrowths of fibrous tissue inside and around Medpor stabilize the upper lateral cartilages and septum in their new corrected position and maintain the corrected/straightened position. This material was used in 18 patients with crooked noses (7 with C-type and 11 with S-type noses). During a mean follow-up period of 20 months (range 10-50 months) there were no complications recurrences or extrusions. Functional evaluation was performed using a visual analog scale before surgery and 6 months after surgery. Patients were asked to score their nasal breathing on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. The mean preoperative value was 17.78% +/- 1.23% (range 15-25%) and the postoperative value was 86.67% +/- 1.21% (range 80-95%). In conclusion the use of EMSEN with Medpor grafts is a safe effective reliable and permanent method for correction of the crooked nose. In the long term the authors believe that EMSEN grafts provide functional recovery and increased strength against further trauma or forces of scar contracture and have the ability to prevent recurrence attributable to cartilage memory.;2008
Cosmetic outcome of the columellar incision closure in external rhinoplasty patients has been a subject of discussion. This study was conducted to assess whether tissue adhesives provide an alternative option for sutureless closure of columellar skin incisions for cases utilizing open technique rhinoplastic surgery. One hundred and one patients undergoing external rhinoplasty were randomized to either topical application of butylcyanoacrylate or polypropylene sutures for columellar skin closure. The majority of tension on the wound edges was taken up using 5-0 chromic catgut. Cosmetic outcomes were evaluated by two otolaryngologists independently using visual analogue and Hollander wound evaluation scales in a blinded manner. There was no statistically significant difference in cosmesis between the surgeons' evaluation scores for either type or repair of the columellar incision. Since the tissue adhesive forms its own protective barrier post-operative care is simplified. Closure with adhesives eliminates the need for post-operative suture removal requiring an extra visit that should lead to more efficient use of physician and patient time. Butylcyanoacrylate performs cosmetically as well as standard suture closure of columellar skin incision used for external rhinoplasty.;2001
Crooked nose deformity is a complex anatomical deformity therefore repair remains a challenge. Here we introduce a new technique for crooked nose deformity repair. Twenty-two patients underwent intraoperative evaluations and measurements followed by surgery using the open rhinoplasty technique. Our method involves three major steps. First is the creation of an asymmetric medial oblique osteotomy using piezoelectric ultrasonic surgery and double lateral osteotomies wherein the asymmetric bony ascending part of the maxillary bone at the base of the nasal vault is fractured pushed in and delivered to the face. Second is septoplasty with L-strut preservation. The L-strut is removed as a 1-cm block caudally from the septal stump of the keystone area. A (or double) fabricated batten cartilage graft is placed on the concave side of the deviation and sutured to cover the septal stump. The L-strut is then replaced and sutured on the batten graft redirecting the septum toward the midline. Third is an overlapping cruroplasty on the side of the long asymmetrical lower lateral cartilage to equalize both wings and correct tip deviation. Our new technique was effective for the treatment of crooked nose deformity. Our technique of K-stone batten plasty with delivery to the face and overlapping cruroplasty may be an effective surgical method for crooked nose deformity.

Crooked nose deformity is one of the most difficult issues to correct by rhinoplasty as it can result in undesired late sequelae. Revision rates are often high and numerous operational techniques have been tested. This study describes a crooked nose rhinoplasty technique that reduces the need for a double osteotomy in the long nasal bone. This study included 26 patients with an I-shaped crooked nose deformity. In the surgical correction of the crooked nose deformity previously defined techniques were applied to the cartilage identically. However the traditional double osteotomy of the long nasal bone was not performed. Instead the bone protruding laterally from the long nasal bone was narrowed by rasping with a file or burr and this section was delivered to the maxilla accordingly. Angle values were measured preoperatively and postoperatively. Two lines were used to measure the angle: The first was drawn from the midpoint of the glabella to the midpoint of the upper lip while the second representing the nasal dorsal axis consisted of both the osseous and cartilaginous parts from the nasion to the anterior nasal spine. The angle between these two lines was taken as the angle of deviation from the median line. Postoperatively patients' angle values were significantly smaller than preoperatively. After 1 year no persistence was observed. In crooked nose deformity surgery the osteoplasty technique applied to the lateral protrusion of the long nasal bone described here was as successful as a double osteotomy. Thus certain complications of a double osteotomy can be avoided. In addition as no greenstick fractures were induced the long-term persistence risk was also reduced.

Crooked nose is mostly characterized by a deviation of both the bone and the cartilaginous parts of the nose. In order to obtain proper functional and improved esthetic results both of these parts have to be corrected. The objective of this study is to evaluate the esthetical and the functional outcomes following correction procedures of the bone pyramid through internal microperforating technique and the cartilaginous part through subtotal septal reconstruction. The medical records of 158 patients who have undergone through primary septorhinoplasty for crooked nose treatment during the period of 21 June 2016 and 31 July 2017 have been reviewed. Functional results have been evaluated using the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scores and the esthetical results through Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) scores. The observation times have been arranged preoperatively as 6months-1year (group 1) and 1-2years (group 2). Septorhinoplasty procedure has been performed on 158 patients with crooked noses. Out of this number 104 of the patients (65.8%) were women and 54 were men (34.2%). The average age of the patients was 31.59 (9.3%) all of who have undergone this procedure. There was a significant improvement (P<0.001) in the NOSE and the ROE scores of group 1 and group 2 which was statistically significant. There was no difference between group 1 and group 2. In crooked nose treatment correction of the deviated bone pyramid using internal microperforating osteotomy and correction of the severely deviated septum using subtotal septal reconstruction yield improved functional and esthetic results.Level of Evidence: Level V therapeutic study.;2019
Crushed cartilage is used in rhinoplasties and crushing carry the risk of devitalization. The most infero-posterior part of the septal cartilage has a rough surface compared with the smooth surface of the remaining parts. This cartilage may be more convenient for crushing with lesser pressure requirements increasing the viability. Twenty-six patients underwent septorhinoplasty and the infero-posterior part of the septal cartilage was harvested. The rough cartilage was utilized in nine patients (excluded from the study). Seventeen patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 28 (19-37y). Two pairs of grafts were utilized for histological study. In fifteen patients crushing experiment was performed. The smooth-surfaced cartilages were the control group the rough-surfaced cartilages were the study group. For each case grafts were reduced to the same dimensions and placed over millimetric-paper and photographed. The grafts were crushed simultaneously. The crushed cartilages were also placed on millimetric-paper and photographed. The data were evaluated statistically. The mean surface increment ratio was 2.26 +/- 0.28 for the control and 2.94 +/- 0.25 for the study group. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.0048). In two specimen after applying hematoxylin & eosin stain the extracellular matrix of the rough cartilage specimen stained darker due to more abundant proteoglycan content. The rough septal cartilage widens more compared with the smooth cartilage under the same crushing pressure. Thus the rough cartilage requires lesser pressure for widening which may increase the viability. The rough septal cartilage contains more proteoglycan which may explain its softness.;2020
Currently clinicians better understand the functional and aesthetic consequences of a cephalic malpositioned lateral crus of the lower lateral cartilage which was identified 30 years ago. Functionally cephalic malpositioning causes alar support deficiency which results in external valve insufficiency. Cosmetically it causes alae nasi retraction alar bracket deformity boxiness and underprojection of the nasal tip. The stair-step technique defined by Boccieri and Raimondi is an effective repositioning technique for the repair of this deformity. The strengthened stair-step technique a combination of the lateral crural-rim graft and the stair-step technique is described in this article. In this study designed as a prospective case series the strengthened stair-step technique was performed for 62 patients (43 women and 19 men mean age 27.3 years) between November 2009 and December 2012. Because 12 patients did not attend follow-up visits regularly their outcomes could not be evaluated. These patients were excluded from the study. Pre- and postoperative photos of all the patients were taken. Aesthetic evaluations showed that six patients were not satisfied with their results four patients had complaints about the nasal tip (1 had asymmetry and 3 had alar stiffness and/or thickness) and two patients had nasal dorsum complaints. Functional evaluation showed that four patients had slight dissatisfaction with their breathing. They reported continuing collapse in the valve area with inspiration. The remaining patients were satisfied with their results. The strengthened stair-step technique is a safe and effective technique for correcting not only lateral crus cephalic malpositioning but also alar rim retraction and external valve collapse.;2014
Defects in the soft tissues of the nose are usually reconstructed with skin grafts or frontal flaps. However skin grafts may cause scar tissue and changes in colour. Frontal flaps however may be thicker than normal skin and may give unsatisfactory results. Nasalis musculocutaneous V-Y advancement flaps avoid these disadvantages. We suggest an algorithmic approach for the use of these flaps in the reconstruction of small to medium defects in the soft tissues of various regions of the nose. The pedicles of these flaps are the dorsal and lateral nasal arteries. This approach provides a simple safe and reliable reconstruction for small and medium defects in the soft tissues of the nose.;2006
Deformities following primary rhinoplasty may be located at different anatomical regions related to the primary operation. Osseocartilaginous vault deformities such as open roof deformity over-resected bony and cartilaginous dorsum excessive width of the middle vault inverted-V deformity and middle vault collapse are the most frequent ones. Stair-step deformity combined with middle vault problems is uncommon. Patients with these deformities not only have poor aesthetic results but also have moderate or severe respiratory problems due to the severity of the deformity. Spreader grafts onlay grafts and biomaterials can be used to correct these deformities. We preferred to use the spreader-splay graft combination for severe osseocartilaginous vault deformities. In this paper we present 3 cases. Two cases had severe open roof deformity middle vault collapse and over resection of the osseocartilaginous hump along with severe respiratory problems. The Spreader-splay graft combination was used along with lateral osteotomy and medialization of nasal bones to treat these patients. One patient had a very severe stair-step deformity due to over resection of the hump and excessive infracturing of nasal bones along with severe respiratory problems due to collapse of the middle vault. This deformity was corrected with proper outfracturing along the old osteotomy site and the use of spreader-splay graft combination. All patients had good aesthetic and functional outcome after the surgery. In conclusion the spreader-splay graft combination provides a good anatomical restoration to obtain a better respiratory function and aesthetic outcome on severe osseocartilaginous vault deformities following rhinoplasty.;2003
Despite the many methods described for correction of the deviated nose it still continues to be one of the most challenging problems in rhinoplasty. It is obvious from the literature that the deformities present in the deviated nose can be quite different from patient to patient and that there is no one method that should be used for every deviated nose. Although unilateral osteotomy technique is not a new concept so far it has not received the interest of plastic surgeons. Shorter operation time lessened surgical trauma to the nose lessened intraoperative bleeding lessened postoperative edema and lessened recurrence of the deviation are distinct features of the unilateral osteotomy technique that should be considered when planning surgery on such a complex deformity. We present our experiences with unilateral osteotomy and recommend it for patients who have a deviation related to only one side of the nose.;2002
Diced cartilage grafts are important in rhinoplasty for raising the dorsum and eliminating dorsal irregularities. The most common problems with the use of diced cartilage are wrapping and cartilage resorption. To histopathologically investigate and compare the viability of diced cartilage grafts wrapped with concentrated growth factor fascia and fenestrated fascia or blood glue. Cartilage grafts were harvested from the ears of 10 New Zealand White rabbits and diced into 0.5 to 1 mm(3) pieces. The grafts were divided into five groups for comparison: (1) bare diced cartilage (2) diced cartilage wrapped with fascia (3) diced cartilage wrapped with fenestrated fascia (4) diced cartilage wrapped with concentrated growth factor (CGF) and (5) diced cartilage wrapped with blood glue. Each of the five grafts was autologously implanted into a subcutaneous pocket in the back of each rabbit. Three months later the rabbits were sacrificed and the implants were harvested and examined histopathologically. Nucleus loss calcification inflammation and giant cell formation differed significantly between the CGF group and both fascia groups. Chondrocyte proliferation was the highest in the CGF group. Nucleus loss rates were similar between the fascia and fenestrated fascia groups. Our findings suggest that CGF improves the viability of diced cartilage grafts while fascia hampers it. Punching holes in the fascia does not improve diced cartilage graft viability and neither does blood glue wrapping.;2016
Diced cartilage is one of the most widely used camouflage technique in rhinoplasty. Its variable resorption rate creates issues in postoperative time period. Platelet-rich fibrin is an autologous concentrated blood derivative containing growth factors that accelerate tissue healing. The authors evaluate the effect of injectable platelet-rich fibrin (I-PRF) on the viability of diced cartilage which has been used for dorsum camouflage in rhinoplasty. Forty patients were randomly divided into two groups based on dorsal camouflage grafts: diced cartilage with I-PRF (study group) and diced cartilage without I-PRF (control group). Cartilage graft thickness was measured by linear superficial tissue ultrasound at the postoperative first week and the third month in both groups. The mean cartilage graft thickness loss between the first-week and third-month ultrasound measurements was 0.58 +/- 0.21mm in the study group and 0.82 +/- 0.35mm in the control group. There was significant volume loss in the control group. I-PRF was successful in reducing the resorption rate of diced cartilage on nasal dorsum by either increasing the viability or keeping its form. Sticky cartilage is an easily applicable and reliable technique that may be used to camouflage dorsal irregularities in rhinoplasty.;2019
Diced cartilage may be wrapped with synthetic or biological materials before grafting to a recipient site. These materials have unique advantages and disadvantages and a gold standard is not available. The authors investigated the effects of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) on the survival of cartilage grafts in a rabbit model. In this experimental study diced cartilage pieces from the ears of 9 male rabbits were left unwrapped or were wrapped with PRF oxidized regenerated cellulose or fascia. Specimens then were placed into subcutaneous pockets prepared on the backs of the rabbits. The animals were sacrificed 2 months after the procedure and the grafts were excised for macroscopic and histopathologic examination. The cartilage graft wrapped with PRF showed superior viability compared with the cartilage graft wrapped with oxidized regenerated cellulose. No significant differences were found among the other groups. The groups were not significantly different in terms of rates of inflammation fibrosis or vascularization. PRF enhances the viability of diced cartilage grafts and should be considered an appropriate biological wrapping material for cartilage grafting.;2016
Dome division or vertical dome division (VDD) is a tip plasty technique that is effective when applied appropriately to suitable patients. For 15 years we have used VDD and made modifications as needed. In classical VDD the dome area is cut and left to heal but experience shows that additional components are needed to complement dome division such as sutures or grafts. In this study we retrospectively analysed our rhinoplasty patients in whom we used vertical alar resection (VAR) to assess the advantages and disadvantages of this technique. To our knowledge this is one of the most exhaustive studies of VDD including over 3000 patients. This retrospective case series reviewed the charts of 3965 patients who underwent VAR between 2000 and 2015. All patients were operated on by the senior surgeon. Dome division was used for various reasons including a deformed tip area in revision rhinoplasties droopy nose wide tip pinched nose tip asymmetry and overprojected nasal tip. Patients were excluded if they had septal deviation that enabled tip rotation or a dorsum problem that caused tip asymmetry. The study included 3965 patients (3172 women and 793 men) who underwent open rhinoplasty from 2000 to 2015. The mean patient age was 28.3 years (range 18-50 years). The mean clinical follow-up duration was 11.2 years. In conclusion this technique is capable of modifying all parameters of the nasal tip (projection rotation and volume) as required at the same time addressing many tip problems.;2018
Dorsal hump reduction almost always breaks the internal nasal valve and nasal obstruction is likely to occur postoperatively unless reconstructed. One hundred eighty patients were operated using both open and closed rhinoplasty approaches. Upper lateral cartilages were metriculously separated from their junction with septum. Following bony and septal cartilaginous hump removal. Upper lateral cartilages were folded inward. Either transcartilaginous horizontal mattress/simple Sutures or perichondrial sutures were used depending of the desired width of the middle vault and the necessity for a splay-graft effect. In 7 patients unilateral. and in 1 patient bilateral nasal synechia occurred and they were all treated under local anesthesia. All patients but 9 stated significantly improved nasal breathing. There was no inverted-V deformity or middle-vault narrowing observed. This technique is simple and physiologic might be applicable for almost all primary rhinoplasty patients. Although it is possible with closed rhinoplasty approaches it is easier with an open approach.;2008
Dorsal hump reduction is one of most commonly performed operations among Caucasian patients because of their nose anatomy. Dorsal preservation techniques in hump reduction are highly favorable and recent studies have focused on dorsal preservation techniques. In the present research the authors describe novel approaches for the push-down and let-down techniques in which the cartilage is totally preserved. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria the records of 48 patients were assessed (40 females and 8 males). Twenty-seven partial modificated push-down and 21 partial let-down techniques were performed. Participants completed the ROE questionnaire before surgery and at their 1-year follow-up control. The ROE scores before and 1 year after surgery were compared. The median ROE score was 60.0 points before surgery and 93.6 points 1 year after surgery. The ROE score was increased significantly (P < 0.001). A total of 92% of the included patients reported excellent satisfaction with the surgical outcome (ROE score > 85). The present study is the first to show total cartilage preservation with let-down and push-down techniques. These approaches are easy to perform and will lead to better cosmetic results in clinical settings.;2021
Dorsal irregularity after hump reduction is one of the most annoying problems in aesthetic nasal surgery. Spreader grafts cartilaginous autogenous thin (CATS) grafts Skoog-type dorsal grafts cartilage grafts bone grafts fascia grafts dermal grafts and nonbiologic products such as silicon and polytetrafluoroethylene are used to overcome this problem. In cases managed with spreader flaps rather than graft procedures problems may persist in the area of the nasal bones whereas irregularities in the cartilage dorsum can be minimized. More specifically the surgically treated surface of the dorsum's upper third and the rhinion area [nasal bone and upper lateral cartilage (ULC) junction] which has the thinnest nasal soft tissue present the greatest challenge for hiding irregularities and call for special attention. The ULC has a cephalic extension with varying lengths under the nasal bone. When these pieces of cartilage are protected during hump excision and sutured to each other a strong smooth and a single-unit structure can be obtained. This technique was applied to 76 patients between 2009 and 2010. Manual examination during the postoperative period showed no irregularities in 60 patients. In the remaining 16 patients minimal irregularities in the bony region were encountered. In 4 of these patients the irregularities were visible in the profile view and in the remaining 12 patients they were felt only by manual examination. The bridging suture technique using cephalic extensions of the ULC is an improvement of the spreader flap technique to obtain a straight smooth and single-unit dorsum in rhinoplasty patients.

During rhinoplasty the most stressful areas of the nasal cartilaginous septum are at the key area and anterior nasal spine. A stable fixation of the caudal septum to respond to these stresses is of utmost importance. The prerequisite for a successful fixation is a well-prepared recipient bed for caudal septum and suture fixation. The bed can be opened by using scissors osteotome or powered instrumentation. Simple or multiple sutures passing from the bone and/or surrounding soft tissues are used for fixation. At the key area if a complete separation of the L-strut occurs it should be sutured to nasal bones and upper lateral cartilages. The septum should be supported by splinting spreader grafts to increase stability. To prevent dorsal irregularities a dorsal onlay camouflage graft should be used. The best way is to take cautions to prevent such a mishap. That is why a dorsal segment of 12 to 15mm should be preserved at least at the key area and part of the mucoperichondrium should stay attached to the septum.;2016
During septorhinoplasty procedures lacrimal drainage systems are susceptible to injury because of the close relationship of the nasal bones. Most of the injuries to the system remain asymptomatic. Here we report a case of septorhinoplasty which was complicated by acute dacryocystitis postoperatively. The patient was treated successfully with appropriate medical therapy.;2010
Edema and ecchymosis are common complications of rhinoplasty. Modifications to osteotomy may reduce edema and ecchymosis and ameliorate postoperative discomfort in patients who undergo rhinoplasty. The authors performed osteotomy with conventional instruments or with an ultrasonic device and compared these methods with respect to the severities of ecchymosis and edema in the early postoperative period. Fifty-six patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty with medial oblique low-to-high internal osteotomy performed conventionally or with an ultrasonic device were evaluated in a prospective study. Photographs of the patients on postoperative days 3 and 7 were scored for ecchymosis and edema by 2 physicians who did not perform the operations and were blinded to the osteotomy procedure. Ecchymosis scores on postoperative days 3 and 7 and edema scores on postoperative day 3 were significantly higher for the 22 patients who underwent conventional osteotomy than for the 34 patients who underwent ultrasonic osteotomy as scored by both examiners. Edema scores on postoperative day 7 were significantly higher for conventional than for ultrasonic osteotomy as assessed by 1 examiner but were not significantly different as determined by the other examiner. The results of this comparative study suggest that rhinoplasty with ultrasonic osteotomy is associated with less edema and ecchymosis in the early postoperative period than is rhinoplasty with conventional osteotomy.;2016
Eight patients with microgenia have undergone augmentation with diced nasal cartilage. Cartilage grafts were harvested from the nose during rhinoplasty. These grafts were cut into 0.5 to 1.0 mm pieces using a #11 blade and were wrapped in one layer of Surgicel (oxidized regenerated cellulose). This cartilage mass was inserted into the chin pocket. All patients underwent clinical evaluation magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photography. These investigations showed that diced cartilage grafts maintained 75% of their dimensions at six months after implantation. The follow-up period was 12 months and the aesthetic results were satisfactory.;1998
Even a mild degree of postoperative deviation of the nasal dorsum and/or columella from the midsagittal plane could be enough to displease a patient. Postoperative judgment of the nasal dorsum and the columellar positioning on the midsagittal plane is somewhat of a subjective decision determined by the surgeons' naked eye. Most innovations tend to evolve from necessities. The risk and reality of misjudging the positioning for both the nasal dorsum and/or the columella led me to develop a device for the objective measurement of the midsagittal axis of the nose. I have called it the rhinoplasty setsquare device. This device is made from 316 quality stainless chrome. It is completely sterilizable. It consists of 4 main parts. During the finishing touches of the operation the correct placement of the rhinoplasty setsquare device will provide the surgeon with an objective decision that will help make the positioning of the nasal dorsum and the columella more precise. When I conducted my research on literature and device catalogs for possible devices designed for measurement in rhinoplasty operations I ran into devices such as the Castroviejo caliper calibrated lateral cuts stabilizer Joseph measuring rod and Thorpe Marchac caliper. All of them are unique in their function and design. However as far as I could see there is no device similar in form and function to my rhinoplasty setsquare device. I have been using this device for 8 months for all my rhinoplasty patients. I am more confident now in my postoperative results due to its objective measurement of the midsagittal line.;2017
Excessive surgical removal or traumatic loss of the tissues supporting the nasal roof can result in the saddle nose deformity. It involves both cartilage and bone deficiencies. Two main resources are used to reconstruct this difficult deformity: autogenous bone and cartilage grafts and alloplastic materials. This study presents the reconstruction of the dorsum septum internal nasal valve and anterior structures and the tip of the nose using a block of molded autogenous bone graft. We called it the sail graft because it looks like a sail from a lateral view. The mast of the sail is oriented in a superior-to-inferior direction beginning in the frontonasal region to the tip of the nose to form a straight well-rounded dorsum. The longest postoperative follow-up of 13 cases is now 10 years the median follow-up is 2 years. The results have been satisfactory.;2012
External nasal deviation is caused primarily by severely a deformed septum. The nose functions as a whole composed of the septum valve systems and mucosal structures. Patients with severely deviated septums also have deformed nasal valve systems. Extracorporeal septoplasty is advocated for an extremely deviated nasal septum. Nasal valve dysfunctions can be resolved successfully with spreader grafts. Application of extracorporeal septoplasty in combination with spreader grafts in patients with nasal valve dysfunction not only enables nasal respiration but also supports aesthetic appearance. The 19 patients in our study had undergone aesthetic rhinoplasty and presented with breathing problems and septal deviations. The patients were treated with extracorporeal septoplasty and spreader grafts. The patients were followed with clinical measures and computed tomographic scanning. No complications such as relapse perforation or saddling were encountered during follow-up. Aesthetically and functionally satisfactory results were obtained.;2016
Following rhinoplasty the cross-sectional parts of the nose may be significantly reduced and nasal air movement and olfaction may be altered. Studies on olfactory function after surgical procedures are quite limited and have largely focused on sinus surgery or septoplasty. The objective of this study is to assess the consequences of spreader grafts on olfactory function. This prospective study was conducted at the GaziosmanpaAYa Taksim Education and Research Hospital Department of Otolaryngology from January 2014 to June 2015. In total 68 patients who had undergone an open-technique septorhinoplasty were included. In 35 patients bilateral spreader grafts were included with the open septorhinoplasty (group 1) and 33 patients underwent open septorhinoplasties without spreader grafts (group 2). The age and gender distributions of the patients in the two groups did not differ (p > 0.05). Preoperative threshold discrimination and identification values in both groups did not differ (p > 0.05). In groups 1 and 2 postoperative threshold values were significantly higher than preoperative values (p < 0.05). The change in threshold discrimination and identification level was significantly higher postoperatively versus preoperatively in group 1 (p < 0.05) however the changes in discrimination and identification values did not significantly differ between in group 2 (p > 0.05). Our study demonstrates the superior widening effect of spreader grafts over the nasal valve and favorable results in olfactory function in primary septorhinoplasty patients.;2016
For most surgeons nasal septal cartilage is the first choice in septoplasty. However when this source is depleted an alloplastic implant material might be preferable over other autogenous donor sites in order to avoid additional scars. morbidity and lengthened operating time. In the alloplastic spectrum irradiated costal cartilage (ICC) has certain advantages. Herein we present our results with ICC in a wide range of septorhinoplasties to show its versatility and reliability. Sixty-five patients were included in the study. There were 42 male and 23 female patients. According to the indications there were four groups of patients: (I) secondary septorhinoplasty (n = 24) (II) traumatic deformity (n = 21) (III) primary septorhinoplasty (n = 13): (IV) deformity due to previous septal surgery (n = 7). The mean follow-up period was 33 months. No significant resorption was detected in any of the patients. Minor complications developed in four cases (6%) including deformity in the dorsal graft excessive graft length and erythematous nasal tips. Aesthetic and functional results were satisfactory in the remaining cases. The low incidence of major complications and the versatility of ICC make it a safe and reliable source of cartilage graft for both primary and secondary septorhinoplasties when autogenous septal cartilage is either insufficient or unsuitable.;2003
Frontonasal dysplasia (FND) is a congenital malformation characterized by hypertelorism broad nasion with a midline cleft in the bony dorsum midline defect of the frontal bone absence of the nasal tip and deformities in the nasal alar region. The clinician should be aware of the mild forms of FND. We presented absence of crista galli in a mild case of FND. Computed tomography scanning should assess the facial bones nose and paranasal structures. If a surgical correction is planned this complete work-up prevents unexpected complications and complements the evaluation of paranasal deformities.

Functional disorders due to alar valve collapse and cosmetic unsatisfactory results can be seen after rhinoplasty operation in some patients. Because of overresection of the upper and lower lateral cartilages nasal lateral walls may collapse during inspiration pressing against the septum and obstructing airway. On the other hand. overresection may result in several cosmetic deformities. Fourteen patients presenting with nasal deformation and functional insufficiency were treated using thin sheet porous polyethylene (Medpor). Cottle sign was positive in all patients. On examination collapse during inspiration depression at the supratip area and asymmetry were common findings. Saddle shaped implants 1.2 x 40 mm in dimension were introduced into pouches prepared via bilateral rim incision. After suturing incisions bandage and cast were applied. In the mean 14-month follow-up period 1 implant malposition was seen in a patient because of larger planning the pocket that was corrected by a subsequent shaving of the implant. Asymmetries of the noses were totally corrected. No exposition was found. Alar collapse and respiration impairment had disappeared in all patients: Although autologous tissue is known as the best material Medpor can be used safely regarding its low complication rate because. of its porotic architecture and low morbidity in donors. Medpor implant provides functional improvement by its strength body. Its smooth surface helps to correct the asymmetry by filling the defects. Using a saddle shape enabled us to treat different components of the postrhinoplasty deformity with a single implant.;2008
Hypothesis: This study was conducted to compare diced cartilage grafts wrapped in fascia and diced cartilage grafts wrapped in surgicell with respect to their resorption. Study Design: Experimental study. Methods: Eight male Wistar Albino rats were used. After general anesthesia two different subcutaneous pockets (upper and lower pocket) were prepared in the rat's abdomen. Surgicell-wrapped homograft that was taken from the ear was placed into the upper subcutaneous pocket. Fascia-wrapped homograft which was taken from the ear was placed into the lower subcutaneous pocket. All the rats were killed at the end of 2 months and the samples were collected to be examined histopathologically. Cartilage mass foreign body reaction fibrosis chronic inflammation and vascularization were researched. Results: Diced cartilage wrapped surgicell stained negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Diced cartilage wrapped in fascia stained positive for GFAP. There was a significant difference between two groups with respect to fibrosis chronic inflammation and cartilage mass. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding vascularization. Conclusions: This study suggests that diced cartilage graft wrapped in surgicell was absorbed whereas diced cartilage graft wrapped in fascia was not.;2005
IMPORTANCE Knowing the operation plan is important for rhinoplasty surgeons to prevent unpredictable results. OBJECTIVES To investigate the frequency of alar base resection in patients with different skin thickness who underwent lateral crural repositioning and lateral crural strut graft and to evaluate the results in the context of the current literature. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective case series study included 621 patients who underwent primary open septorhinoplasty by the same surgeon between January 1 2012 and June 30 2015. From the surgical notes operation type (lateral crural repositioning [LCrep] with lateral crural strut grafting [LCSG] and with or without alar base resection) and skin type were recorded. Study participants' skin types were determined intraoperatively and divided into 3 groups: (1) thick skin (the tip definition was limited by skin thickness and subcutaneous tissue) (2) thin skin (the tip cartilage was visible and could be observed despite overlying soft tissue and skin) and (3) normal skin (the tip cartilage during the procedure had no effect on the tip definition). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The rate of alar base resection according to the type of operation performed and patient skin thickness. RESULTS Of the 621 patients in the study 95 (15.3%) were men and 526 (84.7%) were women. Lateral crural repositioning with LCSG was performed in 319 surgical procedures (51.4%) and alar base reduction was performed in 329 (53.0%). The rate of alar base resection differed significantly on the basis of whether LCrep with LCSG was performed (odds ratio [OR] 1.82 95% CI 1.32-2.50 P<.001). In patients with thin skin there was no significant difference in the incidence of alar base resection associated with LCrep with LCSG (OR 2.034 95% CI 0.912-4.539 P=.08). In patients with thick skin a significant difference in the frequency of alar base resection was associated with the application of LCrep with LCSG (OR 1.995 95% CI 1.228-3.241 P=.005). In patients with normal skin LCrep with LCSG had no significant association with the frequency of alar base resection (OR 1.557 95% CI 0.930-2.607 P=.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The necessity of alar base reduction after LCrep with LCSG is greater in patients with thick skin than in patients with thin and normal skin. This study is the first to our knowledge to examine this topic in rhinoplasty.;2017
IMPORTANCE Performing an open-approach extracorporeal septoplasty (OAES) without simultaneous rhinoplasty could have adverse effects. We sought to understand the effects of OAES without simultaneous rhinoplasty on nasal tip projection and rotation in patients with severe septal deviation. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the outcomes of OAES without simultaneous rhinoplasty in terms of nasal tip projection and rotation using objective measurements. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study was conducted at a training and research hospital using medical records of 32 adult patients who underwent OAES without simultaneous rhinoplasty between April 10 2012 and June 12 2015. Patients who underwent endonasal septoplasty revision septal surgery septorhinoplasty open-approach septoplasty with nasal tip plasty or open-approach septoplasty without removal of the entire septal cartilage were excluded from the study. Postoperative photographs of the patients were taken at a mean (range) time of 16.4 (6-36) months after surgery. Nasolabial angle (NLA) nasofacial angle (NFA) and projection index (PI) were measured by the same surgeon on preoperative and postoperative lateral images. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Projection index was measured using the Goode method NLA and NFA were measured drawing lines between specific facial points according to the literature. All measurements were compared statistically. RESULTS Thirty-two adult patients (26 men and 6 women between ages 20 and 57 years) with severe septal deviation and underwent OAES without simultaneous rhinoplasty were included in the study. The postoperative values of NLA and NFA were observed to be decreased in all patients (100%). The PI was also determined to be decreased in 27 patients (84.6%) whereas it remained unchanged in 5 patients (15.4%). The overall postoperative mean values of NLA NFA and PI were found to be lower compared with preoperative mean values and the difference between them were determined to be statistically significant (NLA: 95% CI 0.40-2.55 P = .005 NFA: 95% CI 0.48-2.06 P = .003 and PI: 95% CI 0.004-0.015 P = .002). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study reveals that the nasal tip lost height from facial plane and rotated caudally in most patients who underwent OAES without simultaneous rhinoplasty. Patients demanding only relief of nasal obstruction and scheduled for OAES have to be informed about the potential cosmetic alterations when a simultaneous rhinoplasty is not requested.;2016
IMPORTANCE Postoperative pain at the donor site is a common morbidity following autologous costal cartilage grafting. OBJECTIVE To evaluate postoperative pain at the donor site after the use of a muscle-sparing costal cartilage harvesting technique compared with a muscle-cutting technique using electrocautery. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Designed as a controlled trial without randomization this prospective comparative cohort study was conducted between January 1 2016 and March 31 2017. Participants included 20 patients who underwent rhinoplasty for various cosmetic and functional complaints from January 1 2016 to February 28 2017. Of the 20 patients 1 was excluded owing to an infection that developed on postoperative day (POD) 7. Patients were grouped by the rib harvesting technique used that was either a muscle-sparing technique (n = 11) or a muscle-cutting technique (n = 8). Skin incisions for both groups were carried out with a blade. Transection of muscle fascia and muscle fibers was performed with monopolar electrocautery in the muscle-cutting technique group. Blunt dissection with a hemostat was performed in the muscle-sparing technique group. All other surgical techniques were identical. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Postoperative pain was assessed with visual analog scale scores for resting pain and movement pain. Eight pain measurements were noted at the sixth postoperative hour and on PODs 1 2 3 7 15 30 and 45. During the hospital stay the postoperative need for analgesics was recorded daily as the number of analgesic infusion vials used. RESULTS The 19 patients in the study included 11 women and 8 men whose mean age (SD) was 33.2 (10.3) years The mean (SD) visual pain analog scale scores for resting pain and movement pain were consistently higher in the muscle-cutting technique group than in the muscle-sparing technique group. This difference was statistically significant on PODs 2 3 and 15 for resting pain and on PODs 2 3 7 15 30 and 45 for movement pain. The mean postoperative need for analgesic infusion vials during hospital stay was higher in the muscle-cutting technique group and the difference was statistically significant on POD 2 (1.9 [0.6] vials vs 1.0 [0.9] vials P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Both resting and movement pain at the donor site was significantly reduced in the muscle-sparing technique group during the postoperative period findings that align with anecdotal reports in the literature. Routine use of the muscle-sparing technique in autologous costal cartilage harvesting is recommended to reduce postoperative pain.;2018
IMPORTANCE The saddle nose deformity is one of the most challenging problems in nasal surgery with a less predictable and reproducible result than other nasal procedures. The main feature of this deformity is loss of septal support with both functional and aesthetic implications. Most reports on saddle nose have focused on aesthetic improvement and neglected the reestablishment of septal support to improve airway. OBJECTIVES To explain how the Cakmak algorithm an algorithm that describes various fixation techniques and grafts in different types of saddle nose deformities aids in identifying saddle nose reconstructions that restore supportive nasal framework and provide the aesthetic improvements typically associated with procedures to correct saddle nose deformities. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This algorithm presents septal support reconstruction of patients with saddle nose deformity based on the experience of the senior author in 206 patients with saddle nose deformity. Preoperative examination intraoperative assessment reconstruction techniques graft materials and patient evaluation of aesthetic success were documented and 4 different types of saddle nose deformities were defined. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Cakmak algorithm classifies varying degrees of saddle nose deformity from type 0 to type 4 and helps identify the most appropriate surgical procedure to restore the supportive nasal framework and aesthetic dorsum. RESULTS Among the 206 patients 110 women and 96 men mean (range) age was 39.7 years (15-68 years) and mean (range) of follow-up was 32 months (6-148 months). All but 12 patients had a history of previous nasal surgeries. Application of the Cakmak algorithm resulted in 36 patients categorized with type 0 saddle nose deformities 79 type 1 50 type 2 20 type 3a 7 type 3b and 14 type 4. Postoperative photographs showed improvement of deformities and patient surveys revealed aesthetic improvement in 201 patients and improvement in nasal breathing in 195 patients. Three patients developed postoperative infection and 21 patients underwent revision septal surgery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The goal of saddle nose reconstruction should be not only to restore an aesthetic dorsum but also to restore the supportive nasal framework. The surgeon should provide more projected and strengthened septal support before augmentation of saddle nose deformity to improve breathing and achieve a stable long-term result. The Cakmak algorithm is a mechanism that helps surgeons identify the most effective way to maximize septal support and aesthetic appeal.;2015
IMPORTANCE Thin or cephalically malpositioned lateral crura cause nasal obstruction by depressing nasal valves and decrease patient satisfaction with rhinoplasty as a result of nostril asymmetry and alar collapse. OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the aesthetic and functional efficacy of lateral crural repositioning with lateral strut grafting in patients with cephalic malposition of the lateral crura undergoing primary septorhinoplasty. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We prospectively selected 80 patients with lateral crural malposition who underwent primary septorhinoplasty performed by the same surgeon from December 1 2013 through May 30 2014. The surgeon measured the angle between the lateral crura and midline intraoperatively with a goniometer to confirm malposition (angle <= 30 degrees). Data analysis was performed from March 13 to 23 2015. INTERVENTION All the patients underwent primary rhinoplasty with the open approach. Lateral crural repositioning with lateral crural strut graft was used in all selected patients. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Preoperative and 6-and approximately 12-month postoperative scores on the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale (range 0-20 decreased scores indicate improved functional results) and the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation (ROE) questionnaire (range 0-24 increased scores indicate improved aesthetic results). RESULTS Seventy-five of 80 patients were confirmed to have cephalic malposition intraoperatively. Four patients were excluded owing to selection of different surgical techniques leaving 71 patients for analysis. The mean (SD) and median postoperative NOSE scores at 6 months (3.18 [3.12] and 2.0) and 12 months (0.39 [1.07] and 0) showed significant improvement compared with the preoperative scores (6.96 [5.10] and 7.0) (P<.01 for each comparison). The mean (SD) and median postoperative ROE scores also showed significant improvement at 6 months (21.06 [3.82] and 23.0) and 12 months (23.12 [2.09] and 24.0) compared with preoperative scores (7.03 [3.70] and 6.0) (P =.001). However the changes from preoperative to 12-month postoperative scores (mean [SD] and median) were not significantly different between patients with normal (NOSE scores 8.41 [4.59] and 90 to 0.28 [0.79] and 0 respectively ROE scores 6.97 [3.24] and 6.0 to 23.31 [1.91] and 24.0 respectively) and thin (NOSE score 6.59 [5.09] and 8.0 to 0.11 [0.33] and 0 respectively ROE scores 7.76 [3.82] and 7.0 to 23.29 [1.72] and 24.0 respectively) skin types and those with thick skin types (NOSE scores 5.52 [5.42] and 4.0 to 0.72 [1.54] and 0 respectively ROE scores 6.60 [4.16] and 6.0 to 22.80 [2.53] and 24.0 respectively) (P >.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Lateral crural repositioning is a useful and versatile technique to achieve successful functional and aesthetic results in a 1-year follow-up. We detected no significant difference by skin type in improvement of nasal function and aesthetic satisfaction.;2015
Importance: Autogenous rib cartilage is widely used in the septorhinoplasty cases with major structural grafting requirements. However there is a risk of warping over time. Objective: To introduce a novel method for carving costal cartilage grafts to obtain straight grafts of varying thicknesses and to eliminate the risk of warping. Design: Between 2007 and 2011 a total of 43 consecutive patients underwent septorhinoplasty using autogenous costal cartilage grafts carved by the oblique split method (OSM). Setting: The Ankara Training and Research Referral Hospital Ankara Turkey. Participants: The study included 43 patients with saddle nose deformity and revisional rhinoplasty with a depleted source. All patients were followed-up for a period ranging from 12 to 37 months (mean 19.2 months) after surgery. Interventions: All patients underwent open or closed septorhinoplasty. Autogenous costal cartilage was carved with the OSM to obtain grafts suitable for use as columellar strut dorsal onlay L-strut lateral crural strut caudal extension and tip or speader grafts in selected cases. Main Outcome Measures: Patients were evaluated by inspection palpation and photographic documentation before surgery. Inspection palpation and photographic documentation were carried out every 6 months and 12 months after surgery and once a year thereafter. Results: Patient satisfaction in terms of form and function was achieved in 41 patients (95%). Two patients required reoperation for further tip projection (n=1) and alar batten graft displacement (n=1). No complication was observed as a result of graft warping resorption or fracture. Conclusions and Relevance: The OSM provides straight costal cartilage grafts of varying thicknesses without the risk of warping. Because they strictly preserve their straight form the grafts may safely be modified into rectangular shape or carved asymmetrically and/or have their edges beveled. Current data from this study suggest that the OSM offers a flexible and reliable reconstructive option for the rhinoplasty surgeon.;2013
Importance: Using asymmetric dorsal preservation (ADP) (pushdown technique for deviated side and letdown technique to the contralateral nondeviated side) is an alternative surgical method to correct osseocartilaginous deviation in crooked nose deformity. Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate whether ADP rhinoplasty is a good method to address I-shaped crookedness in comparison with conventional midvault deconstructing/reconstructing rhinoplasty. Design Setting and Participants: This study was conducted between June 2017 and August 2019. Twenty-two consecutive patients' I-shaped crookedness was addressed with either ADP (n = 10) or conventional midvault techniques (n = 12). Patients were followed up at least for 6 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pre- and postoperative frontal photographs and digital screen protractor was utilized for measurement of crookedness in a single-blinded manner. Surgical success were calculated and compared. Results: In ADP group mean angle of deviation was 10.2 +/- 3.7 degrees and 0.5 +/- 1.0 degrees pre- and postoperatively respectively. In control group mean angle of deviation was 9.5 +/- 1.8 degrees and 0.3 +/- 0.9 degrees pre- and postoperatively respectively. Change in angle was statistically significant for both groups. Postoperative calculated mean success rate was 96.3 +/- 7.9% and 97.5 +/- 8.5% for dorsal preservation and control group respectively. Eight out of 10 patients in dorsal preservation group and 11 out of 12 patients in the control group achieved the ideal angle of 0 degrees hence had 100% postoperative surgical success. Conclusions and Relevance: Utilization of dorsal preservation principles for correction of I-shaped crookedness presents as a promising and practical surgical alternative approach that should be in every rhinoplasty surgeon's armamentarium.;2020
Importance:Numerous techniques have been described on the correction of nasal septum in crooked nose or badly deviated septum. To our knowledge no previous study has been published solely on the value of using an L-strut graft for straightening the nasal septum. Objective:To investigate the use of L-strut graft technique for septal reconstruction in patients with a crooked nose or badly deviated septum. Design:A retrospective study was performed in patients with crooked nose or badly deviated septum who underwent correction by using an L-strut graft from the 1st of January 2000 to 1st of May 2019 at a tertiary referral center and a private hospital by the senior author. Intervention:All patients with crooked noses or badly deviated septums who underwent L-strut graft repair were taken into the study group. Main Outcomes and Measures:Straightening the deviated septum was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were getting rid of crookedness: mean deviation angles and distances from the midline in perioperative/postoperative pictures in three main landmarks: rhinion supratip and tip and resolution of presenting symptoms of nasal obstruction. Results:One hundred nineteen patients were included: 65 men and 54 women (mean age 30.7 years). Septorhinoplasty was performed in 71 and septoplasty in 48 cases. The material for L-strut graft was cartilaginous in 100 bony cartilaginous in 11 and bony in 8 patients. The pictures of 21 rhinoplasty patients (10 women and 11 men mean age 33.48 years) were uploaded into Rhinobase 1.1 for measurements. There was a decrease in the mean and median values in all measurements from the midline between pre- and postoperative measurements. Conclusions:In selected cases of crooked and traumatic noses the L-strut graft can be helpful to splint and correct the deviated L-strut framework and it can act as a caudal septal extension graft to support the tip.;2021
Improvement of the harmony between facial subunits is the ultimate goal of orthognathic surgery and surgeons must accurately make soft tissue projections for planned bony movements. Yet few studies have examined the effects' of orthognathic surgery on aesthetic parameters of nasolabial area on a thorough basis. This retrospective study included 61 patients that underwent orthognathic surgery. Demographic data evaluation period and surgical details were analyzed. Superficial topographical analysis of intercanthal distance alar width nasal height nasal length nasal tip protrusion upper lip height nasal bone angle supratip break angle nasal dorsum angle nasal tip angle columellar-lobular angle columellar-labial angle upper lip angle and tip-to-midline angle was recorded before and after surgery. Postoperative changes in these parameters and their correlation to maxillary movements were analyzed. Alar width upper lip height columellar-labial angle supratip break angle nasal dorsum angle and upper lip angle increased postsurgery whereas tip-to-midline angle decreased. Upper lip height and columellar-labial angle were significantly correlated with clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation and anterior re-positioning. Columellar-labial angle increased 2 degrees for each 1 mm of anterior movement and decreased 4 degrees for each 1 mm of counter-clockwise rotation. Novel parameters such as columellar-lobular angle and tip-to-midline angle were not associated with any maxillary movement postsurgery. Orthognathic surgery primarily affected the lower third of the nose and changed alar width upper lip height supratip break angle nasal dorsum angle columellar-labial angle upper lip angle and tip-to-midline angle in this region however only columellar-labial angle and upper lip height were found to be correlated solely with maxillary movements.;2020
In addition to precautions taken with perioperative surgical techniques nasal packing and external nasal splinting are frequently employed to ensure the stability of the nasal bones following osteotomies performed during rhinoplasty. However despite these precautions nasal bone fragments generally caused by trauma or healing problems can approach the midline progress in a posterior direction and heal with malunion in an infractured manner. Since cavities on the infractured side can result in asymmetries and/or airway narrowing revision osteotomy is required to correct these problems. Subsequent potential recurrent infractures caused by nasal fragments can easily be prevented with late-absorbed sutures passing through the neighboring holes and opening near the osteotomy lines. This technique would be useful for both primary and secondary rhinoplasty but especially in secondary rhinoplasty operations.;2021
In both primary and secondary rhinoplasty establishment or refinement of nasal dorsal aesthetic lines is of paramount importance. Many different techniques used to create a cosmetically acceptable nasal dorsum have been published. The material to be used in nasal dorsal contouring should create a harmonic contour and should be easily shaped long-lasting and resistant to infection. Resection of the hump yields an osseocartilaginous complex as a single unit when an osteotome is used. Use of a rasp gives a good amount of fragmented material comprising bone cartilage soft tissues and blood. The authors used this material as a paste graft to refine the nasal dorsum in rhinoplasty and retrospectively evaluated the outcomes. A retrospective chart review of 77 patients who underwent this procedure between 2003 and 2009 was performed. The follow-up period ranged from 22 to 40 months (median 28 months). The postoperative evaluations included clinical examination and digital photographic documentation. The satisfaction of each patient was assessed with a questionnaire completed at the 12th postoperative month. The described graft which combines the advantages of cartilage and bone was shown to be clinically durable. This combination also results in an ideal texture and consistency for molding due to its diced form. The texture of this graft enables the surgeon to give a final shape to the nasal dorsum bimanually. In this study a paste graft was shown to be a versatile and reliable composite material for nasal dorsal contouring and refinement.

In modern rhinoplasty septal cartilage is the most commonly used graft material. It is a big challenge if septal cartilage is insufficient. We present an alternative technique named the rabbit flap created from the cephalic portion of the lower lateral cartilage to show its effectiveness on nasolabial angle nasal axis deviation and nasal dorsal line. An alternative flap called a rabbit flap is constituted from the cephalic portion of the lower lateral cartilage (LLC). The key for this flap's success is in not cutting the connection between the lateral and medial crus of the alar cartilage. The flap is rotated and placed between the upper lateral cartilage and the septum to ensure a spreader graft effect it can also be moved forward and backward to adjust the nasal tip rotation. Patients whose minimum width of LLC was 12 mm were included in this study. We subjectively evaluated the results of this technique for 24 patients who completed the rhinoplasty outcomes evaluation (ROE) questionnaire and objectively by measuring the nasal axis and nasolabial angles in the preoperative and postoperative first-year periods. There were significant improvements in ROE nasal axis deviation and nasolabial angle scores when preoperative and postoperative first-year controls were compared (p < 0.001). We also observed no complications. With this technique we can correct both a nasal tip rotation and a mild nasal axis deviation. Moreover we can achieve a proper nasal dorsal line and prevent an inverted V deformity. By expanding the internal nasal valve a functionally effective surgery can be performed. However the LLC must be strong enough to avoid alar collapse. In light of our results we believe that the technique we call the rabbit flap can be used as an alternative rhinoplasty technique.

In most rhinoplasty procedures osteotomies are usually required. The osteotomy areas are innervated by sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR) is clinically defined as the sudden onset of parasympathetic activity during stimulation of the trigeminal nerve. When an osteotomy is performed or external pressure is applied over the nasal bone the infraorbital nerve may send signals via this nerve. The aim of this prospective study is to determine the blood pressure changes and occurrence of TCR during rhinoplasty. one hundred and eight patients were enrolled into the study. Lidocaine and adrenaline combination (LAC) was injected only into the left lateral osteotomy sites. All patients underwent median right-side then left-side lateral osteotomies and nasal pyramid infracture. The haemodynamic changes were recorded. A 10% or more decrease in the heart rate from baseline was considered a TCR. TCR was detected in nine patients following lateral osteotomies and nasal pyramid infracture procedures (8.3%). The authors determined that LAC injection prior to osteotomy did not prevent TCR. Manipulation at or near the infraorbital nerve during rhinoplasty may cause TCR even if local anaesthetic infiltration is used.;2012
In nose surgery carved or crushed cartilage used as a graft has some disadvantages chiefly that it may be perceptible through the nasal skin after tissue resolution is complete. To overcome these problems and to obtain a smoother surface the authors initiated the use of Surgicel-wrapped diced cartilage. This innovative technique has been used by the authors on 2365 patients over the past 10 years: in 165 patients with traumatic nasal deformity in 350 patients with postrhinoplasty deformity and in 1850 patients during primary rhinoplasty. The highlights of the surgical procedure include harvested cartilage (septal alar conchal and sometimes costal) cut in pieces of 0.5 to 1 mm using a no. 11 blade. The fine-textured cartilage mass is then wrapped in one layer of Surgicel and moistened with an antibiotic (rifamycin). The graft is then molded into a cylindrical form and inserted under the dorsal nasal skin. In the lateral wall. and tip of the nose some overcorrection is performed depending on the type of deformity. When the mucosal stitching is complete this graft can be externally molded like plasticine under the dorsal skin. In cases of mild-to-moderate nasal depression septal and conchal cartilages are used in the same manner to augment the nasal dorsum with consistently effective and durable results. In cases with more severe defects of the nose costal cartilage is necessary to correct both the length of the nose and the projection of the columella. In patients with recurrent deviation of the nasal bridge this technique provided a simple solution to the problem. After overexcision of the dorsal part of deviated septal cartilage and insertion of Surgicel-wrapped diced cartilage a straight nose was obtained in all patients with no recurrence (follow-up of 1 to 10 years). The technique also proved to be highly effective in primary rhinoplasties to camouflage bone irregularities after hump removal in patients with thin nasal skin and/or in cases when excessive hump removal was performed. As a complication in six patients early postoperative swelling was more than usual. In 16 patients overcorrection was persistent owing to fibrosis and in 11 patients resorption was excessive beyond the expected amount. A histologic evaluation was possible in 16 patients 3 6 and 12 months postoperatively by removing thin slices of excess cartilage from the dorsum of the nose during touch-up surgery. This graft showed a mosaic-type alignment of graft cartilage with fibrous tissue connection among the fragments. In conclusion this type of graft is very easy to apply because a plasticine-like material is obtained that can be molded with the fingers giving a smooth surface with desirable form and long-lasting results in all cases. The favorable results obtained by this technique have led the authors to use Surgicel-wrapped diced cartilage routinely in all types of rhinoplasty.;2000
In order to evaluate the effects of lateral osteotomies performed during rhinoplastic surgery on the lacrimal drainage system a new technique for imaging the lacrimal passages Active Transport Dacryocystography was applied in a total of 16 patients. In all cases free passage of contrast media from the punctum to the inferior meatus was observed. We did not record any pathologic alteration such as mucosal edema or discontinuity of the bony structure that would have resulted in nasolacrimal obstruction.;1996
In recent years there is an increasing trend to use health-related quality of life questionnaires after surgical procedures. The idea is to prove the success of an operation by objectively measurable parameters. Rhinoplasty is by far the most frequently performed surgery of facial plastic surgery. One of the most difficult parts of rhinoplasty is to measure the outcomes after surgery. Rhinoplasty is a unique operation because the surgeon affects three aspects: shape function and psychology of the patient. In an ideal world the surgeon should have objective means of screening that cover these three aspects before and after surgery to measure outcomes. The goal of this article is to review these tools and compare them.;2019
In rhinoplasties a spreader flap is a widely used alternative to dorsal reconstruction with spreader grafts however it has a limited ability to provide sufficient nasal dorsal width. The upper lateral cartilage (ULC) thickness is four times thinner than a spreader graft. This report presents an accordion suture technique for the ULC that involves simple sutures which fix each ULC (3 times folded) to the septum. We performed this technique in 64 primary rhinoplasties and the patients were followed up for approximately 18 months. The patients completed a questionnaire 12 months postoperatively and reported marked satisfaction with the aesthetics and function. Furthermore rhinomanometric analysis showed that nasal airway resistance (NAR) decreased significantly in the postoperative period. (C) 2015 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

In rhinoplasty patients radix position profoundly impacts the appearance of the nasal profile by influencing dorsal length contour angulation and height. The authors wanted to introduce a new perspective to radix and decided to focus on subcutaneous tissues especially procerus muscle. Actually resection of procerus and corrugator supercilii is a part of browlift and endoscopic facelift techniques with which the authors are already familiar. In this short report and video the authors wanted to present a new technique to lower radix area. This technique is based on face anatomy and muscles under radix area and takes its roots from facelift techniques. Before introducing the authors' technique the authors wanted to show the effect of soft tissues on radix with lateral nasal x-rays. With this maneuver the soft tissue thickness of radix area is thinned.;2017
In septorhinoplasty one of the most critical points is to reestablish the support for the nasal tip damaged by surgery. This can be achieved by suturing the nasal structures to each other. We describe our incision and suturing technique for closed rhinoplasty which provides wide exposure and adequate nasal tip support.;2008
In severe nasal deformities the original cartilages are removed or they become unusable because of previous operations. Costal cartilage (CC) is one of the most important tools for the replacement of deficient nasal osteocartilaginous framework. In 4 secondary and 1 tertiary rhinoplasty cases with severe deformities of medial and lateral crura of the lower lateral cartilages we have prepared a long strut graft from a CC and then split the graft tip 5-6 mm vertically into 2 equal halves to create a gamma (gamma)-shaped strut graft. We have sutured the base of this graft to the nasal spine and/or the bases of the medial crural remnants. Then we have prepared lateral crural grafts and secured the grafts over lateral crural remnants. Then we curved the split tip winglets of the gamma-shaped strut graft to both sides and sutured them to lateral crural grafts in order to create a new dome. Splitting of the CC strut graft reduces the need for extensive suturing at the tip obtains smoother contours and ensures graft economy and provides an original and stable dome shape. The bending capacity of the CC is limited in middle-aged patients. Costal allografts from a young cadaver can be a good alternative. gamma-shaped costal crural graft is useful for medial crural and domal monobloc reconstruction in secondary and tertiary cases.;2017
In the past decade. the number of patients demanding rhinoplasty has increased and this has increased the use of grafts. Although different materials are used as grafts cartilage is the most popular one. In secondary rhinoplasties the need for cartilage is very frequent The most suitable cartilage grafts are the ones extracted during primary rhinoplasty. These grafts are disposed of after the operation and in a secondary operation grafts are obtained from a new donor site. In our department the surplus cartilages obtained during primary rhinoplasties of the patients who are thought to be probable secondary rhinoplasty candidates are stored in a postauricular pocket after their volumes are measured and marked down. In the secondary operations the volume of the grafts are measured again and the grafts are used. We have found out that there is no significant difference between the initial and secondary volumes of lower lateral cartilages (3.6% of initial volume is lost) but the difference between the initial and secondary volumes of septal cartilages is significant (6.9% of initial volume is lost) and the stored cartilages are sufficient qualitatively and quantitatively for the secondary rhinoplasties.;2002
In this paper we are presenting the first case of accidental orbital emphysema as a complication of rhinoplasty operation published in the literature. We have reviewed the literature for orbital-periorbital complications due to rhinoplasty operations and discussed the treatment choices for orbital emphysema.;2010
In this study the psychological effects of single-dose corticosteroids administered to patients who had undergone rhinoplasty were assessed. A total of 30 rhinoplasty patients were included in the study and were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Preoperatively patients completed the Bech Rafaelsen Mania Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. Dexamethasone 10 mg was given intravenously just before surgery to the first group but no medication was administered to the second group. On the first postoperative day patients were seen again and the Bech Rafaelsen Mania Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory were again completed. Periorbital edema and ecchymosis were graded and psychological well-being was measured on a standard visual analog scale. All patients and physicians were blinded to treatment until the end of the study. Results show that administration of a single-dose of dexamethasone 10 mg caused neither euphoria nor depression. No significant differences were observed between steroid and control groups in terms of patients' psychological well-being. With single-dose dexamethasone periorbital edema was significantly reduced on the first 2 postoperative days and upper eyelid ecchymosis was significantly decreased only on the first postoperative day. However preoperative steroid administration had no influence on ecchymosis of the lower eyelid. The authors conclude that single-dose dexamethasone 10 mg can be used safely to reduce periorbital edema and ecchymosis in rhinoplasty patients.;2006
In two cases of LeFort II fracture exploration of the infraorbital area showed two distinct infraorbital foramina and correspondingly two separate infraorbital nerves. This variation of the infraorbital nerve was unilateral in one case and bilateral in the other. Sensory evaluation one month following the surgery using a local anesthetic agent showed that the two nerves each have a different dermatome. The relevant literature was reviewed and the importance of the variation especially in local infiltration anesthesia e.g. for rhinoplasty is emphasized.;1998
Inroduction: Nasal septal deviation results from irregular development of the nasomaxillary complex and trauma. Treatment of nasal septal deviation in pediatric patients is one of the biggest challenges in rhinology. Surgery may alter craniofacial growth patterns and so it may be indicated only in the selected cases. The use of external nasal dilators is a relatively new treatment modality in nasal obstruction. Objective: This study was performed to assess the efficacy of external nasal dilator in pediatric nasal septal deviation patients. Methods: Seventy-six children who were diagnosed with nasal septal deviation at our outpatient clinic were included in the study. The patients were divided into 2 groups: the external nasal dilator group was composed of 48 children that had used an external nasal dilator for at least 1 month and still been using while the control group was comprised of 28 children that had not received any treatment and had not used an external nasal dilator. The parents of the children were asked to complete the obstructive sleep apnea 18 questionnaire. In addition the external nasal dilator group was asked to complete the questionnaire after stopping external nasal dilator use for 2 weeks and the control group also repeated the obstructive sleep apnea 18 questionnaire. Results: The obstructive sleep apnea 18 questionnaire results were significantly different between the external nasal dilator group and the control group at the beginning of the study (i.e. when patients in the external nasal dilator group were still using their dilators P=0.000). On the other hand there was no difference between the 2 groups after the patients in the external nasal dilator group had stopped using their external nasal dilator (P=0.670). Conclusion: External nasal dilator use relieved nasal septal deviation which narrows the nasal valve. The results of this study suggest that external nasal dilator could be used in patients that are not candidates for septoplasty. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2014
INTRODUCTION: Epinephrine containing local anesthetics are used hemostasis in many cases. Otolaryngologists typically selected to decrease bleeding in surgery field for operations such as especially FESS (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery) septoplasty septorhinoplasty. In addition to known adverse effects of this local anesthetics agents they have rare complications too. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We presented intracranial hemorrhagic infarction in a 41-year-old male patient after using lidocaine with epinephrine for local anesthesia on nasal mucosa. DISCUSSION: There are some publications like this case in the literature. In our case a hemorrhagic infarction developed after giving the adrenaline/lidocaine infiltration to make up a local anesthesia in the mucosa of the septum. There is not any reported case like this in the literature. CONCLUSION: We want to emphasize that all surgeons especially the ENT surgeons should be careful while using local anesthetic medicines which contains adrenaline for rare complication of intracranial hemorrhagic infarction. Another fact is that the patients must sign an informed consent form including those situations even for all minor surgical procedures to avoid a medicolegal problem. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Introduction Derotation of the nasal tip with narrow nasolabial angle is a common nasal deformity that leads to a long nose appearance named drooping nose. In these patients there are various techniques described to fix droopy tip and to achieve a desirable nasal tip rotation such as caudal septal extension graft extended columellar strut graft tongue in groove columellar strut graft and tip rotation sutures. This study aimed to evaluate changes in nasal tip support after modified tongue-in-groove technique (auto-septal projection graft). Materials and Methods Forty-two patients who underwent a primary open approach septorhinoplasty using the modified tongue-in-groove technique between June 2017 and March 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Postoperative and preoperative photographs were analyzed and nasolabial angle and the nasal tip projection ratio were recorded and compared before and average of 17.3 months after the surgery. Results Forty-two patients (33 female and 9 male) were included the study. The mean nasolabial angle was 85.7 degrees preoperatively and 99.3 degrees postoperatively. The nasal tip projection ratio was 0.60 preoperatively and 0.64 postoperatively. Both the tip rotation and the tip projection increased significantly after the modified tongue in groove (p<0.05). Conclusion It seems that modified tongue-in-groove method (auto-septal projection graft) is an effective technique in maintaining tip projection and rotation in rhinoplasty and safe method to correct droopy nasal tip in selected cases.;2021
Introduction Nasal dorsum irregularities after rhinoplasty are still one of the most common complaints among both surgeons and patients. In this study we used a new cross-linked hyaluronan (NCH) gel and blood mixture as the stabilisation scaffold. Diced cartilage combined with the NCH gel and blood mixture was used for nasal dorsum camouflage. Patients and Methods Fifty-two thin-skinned patients (29 females and 23 males) underwent primary rhinoplasty including nasal dorsum enhancement with diced cartilage combined with the NCH gel and blood mixture. The cartilage tissue was diced into small pieces then 1 cc NCH gel and blood were added into diced cartilage. The mixture was delivered onto the nasal dorsum via dorsal retractor. Results After 1 year of follow-up there were no irregularities in the nasal dorsum area observed nor any displacement or absorbance of the camouflage material. No complications occurred. Conclusion The use of diced cartilage combined with the NCH gel and blood is an effective simple and safe method for nasal dorsum camouflage in thin-skinned patients in rhinoplasty. The NCH gel within the mixed graft also reduces adhesions at the osteotomy lines.;2019
Introduction Rhinoplasty is one of the most common aesthetic surgeries and dorsal hump reduction surgery is the most commonly applied type of surgery in Western countries. Every patient should be considered challenging based on the negative outcomes of this surgical procedure. Thus aesthetic and plastic surgeons attempt to provide the safest and best resulting rhinoplasty techniques. Objectives While performing dorsal preservation techniques in patients who had hump deformity but did not have septal deviation deviation occurs due to surgery. In the present research the author defines new suturing techniques for overcoming deviation associated with dorsal preservation surgeries. Methods Data from patients who underwent dorsal preservation rhinoplasty for the nasal hump were evaluated. Patients who had nasal hump deformities without nasal deviation deformities were included. Following these inclusion and exclusion criteria the records of 43 patients were assessed. All patients included in the study completed the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation questionnaire before surgery and at their one-year follow-up appointment. New suturing approaches such as 8 shaped and loop sutures were assessed. Results The median Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation score before surgery was 60.6. The median score after one year of surgery was 90.8. The Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation score significantly increased after surgery (p<0.001). Patient satisfaction was excellent in 90.47% of the included patients. Conclusions These 8 suturing approaches present surgeons overcoming the possibility of deviation which is associated with dorsal preservation techniques such as push-down and let-down procedures in non-deviated noses. Further studies are needed to confirm the preliminary results of the present research.;2021
Introduction Rhinoplasty surgeons often find that despite their best efforts to straighten the nose patients often continue to perceive their nose as deviated and this perception is particularly prevalent in patients with concurrent facial asymmetry. The aims of this study were to determine whether facial asymmetry influences the satisfaction of rhinoplasty patients and whether there is a difference in postoperative happiness between patients with and without facial asymmetry. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study we reviewed the charts and photographs of patients who underwent rhinoplasty between 2016 and 2018. Patient photographs were analysed 30 patients with facial asymmetry and 30 patients with symmetric faces were randomly selected for the study. The preoperative and postoperative rhinoplasty outcome evaluation (ROE) and standardized cosmesis and health nasal outcomes survey (SCHNOS) scores were compared between the two groups. Results The mean preoperative symmetry scores of the group with facial asymmetry were significantly higher than those of the group with symmetric faces. The magnitude of increase in the average ROE score from pre- to postoperatively was significantly larger in the group with symmetric faces than in the group with facial asymmetry. The magnitude of decrease in the mean SCHNOS score from pre- to postoperatively was significantly larger in the group with symmetric faces than in the group with facial asymmetry (p: 0.006). Conclusion It is important to clearly evaluate patients with facial asymmetries before surgery to increase their postoperative satisfaction and outcomes and make their expectations more realistic.;2021
Introduction The nasal septum plays an important role in nasal form and function. In this study we describe a novel alternative septoplasty approach that results in an aesthetically acceptable dorsal profile and improves airway function in patients with a crooked nose. Patients and Methods This study enrolled 26 patients who presented with crooked noses between 2012 and 2017. All patients underwent open rhinoplasty under general anesthesia. During correction of the cartilaginous part a dorsal strip from the deviated septum was prepared and inverted in a 180 degrees fashion to exert a counter-force to correct the remaining septum and fixed by suturation. This maneuver allowed application of the maximum possible force in the opposite direction to reset the deviation by its own force. Results The approach was used successfully in 26 patients with severe nasal septal deviations in the caudal septum and dorsal angulation of the nasal shape. There was no case of hematoma synechia septal perforation dorsal irregularity or saddle deformity. Temporary nasal obstruction occurred in 4 patients but improved in all of them by the third postoperative month. One patient had a recurrence of the septal deviation dorsal angulation and persistent nasal obstruction which were treated by revision nasal valve surgery 14 months postoperatively. There was no subsequent recurrence during the long-term follow-up. The improvement between the preoperative and postoperative 12-month deviation angle measurements Nasal Obstruction and Septoplasty Effectiveness (NOSE) scores were significant (P < 0.05) Improvement in the NOSE score correlated strongly and significantly with deviation angle changes and patient satisfaction. Conclusion Our counter-autografting technique in septoplasty is safe and effective in the correction of severe dorsal and/or caudal deviations as long as the severely angulated cartilage septum remains in one piece after careful dissection.;2020
Introduction: Although cartilage grafts are frequently used for structural integrity and volume restoration one of the main concerns dealing with cartilage grafting is gradual volume loss and unpredictable viability rates of cartilage grafts. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a well known platelet concentrate reported to enhance cartilage repair and stimulates chondrocyte proliferation and matrix biosynthesis. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of subcutaneous PRP injection on improving the viability of cartilage grafts. Materials and Methods: Six circular cartilage grafts were obtained from auricular cartilages of 6 New Zealand white rabbits. Cartilage grafts were prepared in 3 forms: block crushed and crushed/wrapped with Surgicel (Surgical Ethicon Somerville NJ). Grafts were placed to 6 dorsal subcutaneous pockets and pockets were closed. Autologous PRP was prepared and injected subcutaneously into the pockets of experiment groups. At the end of 8 weeks cartilage grafts were removed. Cartilage mass reduction rates were measured. Resorption rates of cartilage grafts and formation of fibroelastic and bone tissue were microscopically evaluated. Results: All of the cartilage grafts lost significant weight. Viability scores of block cartilages were higher than crushed cartilages. Although less weight loss rates and higher histopathologic scores were obtained in subcutaneously PRP injected cartilage graft groups these results were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Although our study gives a new insight about increasing the viability of cartilage grafts the subcutaneous PRP injection did not result in improving the viability of cartilage grafts in this experimental design.;2015
Introduction: Crooked or deviated nose is a deviation of the nose from the straight vertical position of the face. Extensive pneumatization of the middle turbinate also called concha bullosa or bullous middle turbinate (BMT) is known to be one of the possible etiologic factors in nasal obstruction recurrent sinusitis and headache. There is no study concerning a link between BMT and crooked nose. Objective: To investigate the association between crooked nose and the presence of a BMT. Methods: A total of 199 patients who underwent open septorhinoplasty were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative paranasal Computerized Tomography (CT) findings preoperative photodocumentation and anterior rhinoscopic examination findings were documented. Of the 199 patients 169 were found to meet the criteria and were included in the study. CT scans were examined to note the presence of BMT inferior turbinate hypertrophy and septum deviation (SD). SDs and crooked noses were classified. Results: Ninety-four of 169 patients (56%) presented a crooked nose deformity and seventy-five of 169 patients (44%) presented a straight nose. While 49 (52%) crooked nose patients had a bulbous and extensive BMT 20 patients with straight nose (26.6%) had a BMT. A statistically significant relationship was found between the presence of crooked nose and BMT regardless of the side of the disease (p = 0.011). Conclusion: This study revealed a link between crooked nose and BMT. (C) 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.;2017
Introduction: Following nasal hump removal during septorhinoplasty the middle vault should be Lateral nasal reconstructed to avoid functional and esthetic problems. Middle vault reconstruction however may result in widening of the middle vault and may need a camouflage graft to cover dorsal irregularities. Objective: To present the results of reconstructing the middle vault with a technique that covers Covering the nasal dorsum with upper lateral cartilage from the viewpoint of patient satisfaction. Methods: Retrospective study of patients who underwent septorhinoplasty that included nasal dorsum closure with upper lateral cartilage from December 1 2014 to January 31 2016. Those with postoperative follow-up of less than 3 months were excluded. The final study group included 39 patients. The same surgeon performed all septorhinoplasties. The dorsum was closed using an upper lateral closing technique that approximated upper lateral cartilages to each other over the septum. Postoperative patient satisfaction was determined using a visual analog scale and the rhinoplasty outcomes evaluation questionnaire. The questionnaire evaluates patient esthetic and functional satisfaction with the operated nose. High scores indicate improved esthetic results. Results: No dorsal irregularities were seen at postoperative follow-up evaluation of the patients. For esthetic nasal appearance the median visual analogue scale scores was 86% and the mean for the questionnaire was 77.03%. Conclusion: The natural dome-shaped anatomy of the nasal dorsum was achieved by approximating the upper lateral cartilages to each other. Closing the dorsum with this technique also covers any dorsal irregularities and results in a smooth dorsum. Patients expressed satisfaction with the esthetic and functional aspects of the smooth attractive nasal dorsum. (C) 2017 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial.

Introduction: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiotibromas are highly vascular non-encapsulated tumours affecting predominantly young males. These lesions are benign histologically but they may become life-threatening with excessive bleeding or intracranial extension. Material and methods: The surgical approaches to 22 male patients with nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are reviewed. A modification of midfacial degloving performed without rhinoplasty incisions and lateral osteotomies is described. Results: The patients' ages ranged between 9 and 26 years (mean 14.9). Three stage I tumours 8 stage II tumours 6 stage III tumours and 5 stage IV tumours were included into this study. All stage I lesions and one stage II lesion were treated via transnasal endoscopic approach. A modified midfacial degloving approach was used for the removal of seven other stage II lesions all six stage III lesions and three stage IV lesions. A combined midfacial degloving-infratemporal fossa Fisch C-transcranial approach was the route chosen for the remaining two stage IV lesions. The complications encountered in the postoperative course include temporary facial palsy in one patient (following a Fisch C infratemporal resection) mild crusting in the nasal cavity in 8 patients and facial paraesthesia in 6 patients whose tumours were resected via midfacial degloving and rupture of the subpetrous part of the internal carotid artery in one patient. Conclusion: The suggested treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma consists of an endoscopic transnasal approach for early stage lesions and a modified midfacial degloving for almost all of the advanced lesions. The latter approach is very useful considering surgical exposure duration of surgery cosmetic outcome and morbidity. It can be combined with an infratemporal approach or craniotomy if necessary.

Introduction: Lateral osteotomy is mainly performed either endonasally or percutaneously in rhinoplasty which is a frequently performed operation for the correction of nasal deformities. Both techniques have both advantages and disadvantages relative to each other. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the histopathological effects of endonasal and percutaneous osteotomy techniques performed in rhinoplasty on bone healing and nasal stability in an experimental animal model. Methods: Eight one year-old New Zealand white rabbits were included. Xylazine hydrocloride and intramuscular ketamine anesthesia were administered to the rabbits. Endonasal osteotomy (8 bones) was performed in Group 1 (n = 4) and percutaneous osteotomy (8 bones) in Group 2 (n = 4). One month later the rabbits were sacrificed. Bone healing of the rabbits was staged according to the bone healing score of Huddleston et al. In both groups nasal bone integrity was assessed subjectively. Results: In the percutaneous osteotomy group Grade 1 bone healing was observed in two samples (25%) Grade 2 bone healing in two samples (25%) Grade 3 bone healing in four samples (50%). In the endonasal osteotomy group Grade 1 bone healing was observed in 6 samples (75%) and Grade 2 bone healing was observed in 2 samples (25%). In the percutaneous group fibrous tissue was observed in 2 predominantly fibrous tissue and a lesser amount of cartilage was observed in 2 and an equal amount of fibrous tissue and cartilage was observed in 4 samples. In the endonasal group fibrous tissue was observed in 6 samples and predominantly fibrous tissue with a lesser amount of cartilage was observed in 2 samples. In both groups when manual force was applied to the nasal bones subjectively the same resistance was observed. Conclusion: Percutaneous lateral osteotomy technique was found to result in less bone and periost trauma and better bone healing compared to the endonasal osteotomy technique.

Introduction: Modern rhinoplasty has an aesthetic and a functional component that cannot be separated. Functional rhinoplasty generally concentrates on optimizing nasal airflow. Numerous techniques have been described for correction of each pathology. There seems to be a consensus on the benefit of surgery to patients with nasal obstruction. Present study aimed to determine if specific airway pathologies have differential effects on patient complaints and techniques addressing them have differential effects on perceived benefit from surgery. Patients/Method: The records of 300 patients complaining nasal obstruction and had computerized tomography (CT) between April 2015 and April 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Based on surgical notes surgical techniques used for each patient were recorded. A survey using Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale is done by phone. After descriptive statistics preoperative complaint-diagnosed pathology and postoperative relief-treated pathology relationships were evaluated. Results: Preoperative and postoperative NOSE scores showed statistically significant difference (P<0.001). The CT analysis showed that septal deviation rate among patients complaining nasal obstruction is 85% internal valve insufficiency rate is 34.4% mild and severe inferior turbinate hypertrophy was 71% and 6% respectively. Bullous and total concha bullosa of middle turbinate was 17.3%. Nearly 90% of patients had 2 or more types of pathology in CT analysis. Preoperative and postoperative NOSE scores showed no statistically significant relationship with singular intranasal pathologies and techniques used for correcting them respectively. Conclusion: Despite general fall in NOSE scores in the whole study group treatment of a specific pathology does not change NOSE score more than a patient who already does not have the pathology. None of the pathologies or treatments addressing them have a dominating effect on preoperative complaints or obtained relief after the surgery. So success of functional rhinoplasty cannot rely on correction of a specific pathology. A comprehensive analysis and correction of every pathology is paramount.;2019
Introduction: Open rhinoplasty involving columellar incision has gained popularity since the 1930s. Many surgical incision techniques have been employed to obtain better results in terms of postoperative scarring. This study evaluated and compared the results of absorbable and non-absorbable sutures used in open technique rhinoplasty assessed scar properties regardless of the techniques used from the perspectives of patients and surgeons. Objective: This study evaluated and compared the results of absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures used in open technique rhinoplasty from the perspectives of patients and surgeons. Material and Methods: Study population included 70 patients who underwent primary open rhinoplasty between 2013 and 2018. Rhinoplasty Operations were performed in 2 different centers by a total of 2 rhinoplasty surgeons. Both surgeons used suture materials which can be used for columellar closure regardless of patients' skin characteristics. Columellar scars were assessed at an outpatient clinic at least 6 months postoperatively. Patients who could not come to the clinic were excluded from the study. Columellar Scars were assessed using the Turkish Patient Observer Scar Assessment Questionnaire. Patients were also asked to complete a Scar Assessment Analysis Questionnaire at the outpatient clinic and were photographed from the front basal and right and left oblique sides. Three surgeons who were not part of the research team but routinely performed rhinoplasty completed the Observer Scar Assessment Questionnaire by examining patients in person at the clinic as well as their photographs. Results: Observer Scar Assessment Questionnaire results for the Vicryl group surgeons ranked pigmentation of the scar as the best criterion (3.34 +/- 0.97) and irregularity of the scar as the worst (3.82 +/- 1.01). For the Prolene group surgeons ranked irregularity as the best criterion (3.30 +/- 0.97) and stiffness as the worst (3.54 +/- 0.94). Although there was no statistically significant result between the two groups in the criteria the mean scores of the Prolene group were less than the Vicryl group. (3.36 +/- 0.46 3.50 +/- 0.65 respectively). Scar Assessment Analysis Questionnaire Results patients in both the Vicryl and Prolene groups ranked pain as the least important factor (mean 2.9 +/- 1.11 and 3.33 +/- 1.35 respectively). The Prolene group scored lower than the Vcryl group in terms of overall scarring (3.49 +/- 0.72 3.66 +/- 1.37 respectively P > 005). Conclusions: Absorbable sutures are a convenient alternative to nonabsorbable sutures Level IV: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention such as case studies. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.;2021
Introduction: Preoperative anxiety is a common problem before anesthesia. Pharmacologic agents or non-pharmacologic methods are widely used to reduce preoperative anxiety. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of aromatherapy with rose oil on preoperative anxiety. Methods: This study was a prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients (n = 99) were randomized as the control group (group C) the sham group (group S) and the rose oil group (group R). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Questionnaire of Spielberger (STAI-S) was used to determine anxiety levels. The first STAI-S (Q_1) was administered in the otorhinolaryngology clinic in the morning on the day of the operation. Group C received no intervention. In group S a mixture (distilled water/ethyl alcohol) and in group R a mixture (distilled water/ethyl alcohol/0.2 mL rose oil (Rosa damascena Mill.)) was used with the ultrasonic aroma diffuser. Aromatherapy was applied by an ultrasonic nebulizer for 15 min before patients went to the operating room for surgery in group S and group R.In the operating room the second STAI-S (Q_2) were recorded. Results: There was no statistical significant difference between the groups at baseline in terms of Q_1 scores but when the second STAI-S was administered after the intervention there was a significant difference in Q_2 scores (43.15 +/- 7.55 36.03 +/- 9.60 respectively 95% CI 38.39-43.12 P = .004) between group C and R. Conclusions: The application of rose oil aromatherapy by inhalation reduced the scores of preoperative anxiety of patients undergoing septorhinoplasty/rhinoplasty.;2019
Introduction: Rhinoplasty constitutes an example wherein the various types of filling materials are used for nasal dorsal deformities. In this study we took the advantage of a simplified procedure and used fibrin isolated from the coagulated peripheral blood of the experimental animal. Durability and viability of diced autologous cartilage grafts adhered to each other and formed using fibrin extracts were assessed experimentally in a rabbit model. Subjects and Methods: Diced cartilage graft (Group 1) block cartilage (Group 2) and fibrin adhered 0.5 mm diced cartilage graft (Group 3) were placed into subcutaneous pockets in the frontoparietal region of the same experimental animal. The grafts were excised at the end of 16 weeks. The excised grafts were macroscopically evaluated and the final volumes and weights were measured. These measurements were compared to the initial values before implantation. Finally the specimens were evaluated the histopathological examination. Results: In Group 1 165% increase in weight and 56% increase in volume in Group 2 131% increase in weight and 81% increase in volume finally in Group 3 184% increase in weight and 68% increase in volume were seen. Although histological examination did not reveal any difference with regard to chondroid matrix score metachromasia vascularization fibrosis and inflammation we observed significantly higher cartilage proliferation score in Group 3. Conclusion: The results indicate that these grafts can be used efficiently particularly in rhinoplasty procedures to correct nasal deformities.;2021
Introduction: Rhinoplasty is one of the most common aesthetic procedures performed by plastic surgeons all over the world. In recent years a non-surgical nose job has become the preferred option for most patients and specialists. Minimally invasive techniques already result in high satisfaction rates. Moreover patients do not need anesthesia and there is no post-operative recovery period. Methods: Between January 2016 and January 2017 35 patients (33 female 2 male) that had undergone nonsurgical rhinoplasty with dermal fillers were included in the study. Clinical and demographic features of the patients our technique satisfaction rates and complications were discussed. Results: We recorded an extremely high satisfaction rate and did not observe any complications. All of the patients returned to their normal daily activities immediately after the procedure. Conclusion: Non-surgical nose augmentation with dermal fillers is an easy safe and comfortable technique. It appears that dermatologists need to assume a more active role in rhinoplasty.;2017
Introduction: Septal deviation is a common disease seen in daily otorhinolaryngology practice and septoplasty is a commonly performed surgical procedure. Caudal septum deviation is also a challenging pathology for ear nose and throat specialists. Many techniques are defined for caudal septal deviation. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of caudal septal extension graft (CSEG) application in patients who underwent endonasal septoplasty for a short and deviated nasal septum. Methods: Forty patients with nasal septal deviation short nasal septum and weak nasal tip support who underwent endonasal septoplasty with or without CSEG placement between August 2012 and June 2013 were enrolled in this study. Twenty patients underwent endonasal septoplasty with CSEG placement. The rest of the group who rejected auricular or costal cartilage harvest for CSEG placement underwent only endonasal septoplasty without any additional intervention. Using the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaires pre- and post-operative acoustic rhinometer measurements were evaluated to assess the effect of CESG placement on nasal obstruction. Results: In the control group preoperative and postoperative minimal cross-sectional areas (MCA1) were 0.44 +/- 0.10 cm(2) and 0.60 +/- 0.11 cm(2) respectively (p < 0.001). In the study group pre- and postoperative MCA1 values were 0.45 +/- 0.16 cm(2) and 0.67 +/- 0.16 cm(2) respectively (p < 0.01). In the control group the nasal cavity volume (VOL1) value was 1.71 +/- 0.21 mL preoperatively and 1.94 +/- 0.17 mL postoperatively (p < 0.001). In the study group pre- and postoperative VOL1s were 1.72 +/- 0.15 mL and 1.97 +/- 0.12 mL respectively (p < 0.001). Statistical analysis of postoperative MCA1 and VOL1 values in the study and the control groups could not detect any significant intergroup difference (p = 0.093 and 0.432 respectively). In the study group mean nasolabial angles were 78.15 +/- 4.26 and 90.70 +/- 2.38 respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Endonasal septoplasty with CESG placement is an effective surgical procedure with minimal complication rate for subjects who have a deviated short nasal septum and weak nasal tip support.

Introduction: Since the age at which rhinoplasty is frequently performed is also the age at which acne is frequently seen a person may be a candidate for both this surgery and isotretinoin therapy. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of oral isotretinoin on bone healing in rabbit rhinoplasty model. Methods: Twelve one-year-old New Zealand white rabbits (3-4 g all male) were included in the study. The animals were divided into two groups as experimental (n=6) and control group (n=6). One mg/kg oral isotretinoin and olive oil mixture was given each day orally to the experimental group starting from the surgery day. Lateral nasal osteotomy was performed starting from the distal end of the nasal bone. The rabbits were sacrificed 4 weeks later and the nasal bone specimens were sent for histopathological examination to evaluate bone healing between the groups. Bone healing was classified according to the grading described by Huddleston. Results: Grade 1 bone healing was observed in four samples (66.7%) and grade 2 healing was observed in two samples (33.3%) in the study group. In the control group three samples (50%) had grade 2 bone healing and the other three samples (50%) had grade 3 bone healing. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (p=0.027). Conclusion: Bone healing was found to be slower in the isotretinoin group than in the untreated group. Although there are studies in the literature reporting that isotretinoin has a positive effect on bone healing we observed opposite results. Therefore we think that more experimental and clinical studies are needed to clarify this effect.;2019
Introduction: Success and satisfactory results in rhinoplasty are established not only with flawless surgery but also with meticulous perioperative care. Pain stays at the centre of these circumstances. Besides several contributing perioperative factors such as periorbital edema and ecchymosis play key role on the patients' comfort. Methods: Septorhinoplasty was carried out in 50 patients between February and May 2014 under general anesthesia. Local anesthesia with lidocaine and adrenaline combination was done prior to incision. Following the procedure silicone gel packs were applied. One periorbital region was cooled after surgery whereas the opposite site was left uncooled. Periorbital edema-ecchmosis and pain intensity were graded and noted 1 hour 1 day 3 days 1 week and 1 month after surgery. Results: Cold application seriously reduced postoperative edema and ecchymosis at the first week (p=0.001 for the first 3 days and p=0.006 at first week). Pain was reduced with cooling not on the first hour (p>0.05) but on the forthcoming days throughout the first week (p<0.005). Operation time revealed that primary cases were carried out quicker than revisional surgery. Moreover pain scores were found lower in primary cases than revisions especially in the first 3 days. These finding were approved statistically. Conclusion: Cooling of the periorbital region reduces edema and ecchymosis as well as pain however 3 days of use is enough after rhinoplasty. One hour after surgery cooling does not affect the pain but reduce edema and ecchymosis.;2016
Introduction: The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of local administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) through lateral osteotomy line on postoperative periorbital edema and ecchymosis. Material-Method: Thirty patients underwent open technical septorhinoplasty were included. Before lateral osteotomies the surgeon opened narrow subperiosteal tunnels on the both sides. After lateral osteotomies the surgeon irrigated TXA into the right tunnel with the broken tip of the injection and the same amount of saline into the left tunnel. The patient's photographs were taken on the first third and seventh postoperative days. Periorbital edema and ecchymoses were evaluated by the blinded author. The statistical differences between the 2 sides were analyzed. Results: Lower Eyelid Edema values were significantly lower in the TXA(+) group than the TXA(-) group on the third day (P = 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the sides in terms of lower eyelid edema values on the first and seventh days (P = 0.065 P = 0.317). Upper and lower eyelid ecchymosis values were significantly lower in TXA(+) group than TXA(-) group on the first third and seventh days (P < 0.05). Upper eyelid edema values were found to be significantly lower in the TXA(+) group than the TXA(-) group on the first and third days (P = 0.002 P = 0.005). There was no statistically significant between the sides in terms of upper eyelid edema (P = 0.315) on the seventh day. Conclusions: It was observed in the present study that local administration of TXA in septorhinoplasty was effective in reducing postoperative periorbital edema and ecchymosis.;2021
Introduction: The aim of this study is to compare the functional aspects of open technique (OTS) and endonasal septoplasty (ENS) in difficult septal deviation cases''. Methods: 60 patients with severe nasal obstruction from S-shaped deformities multiple deformities high deviations etc. were included in the study. The OTS was used in 30 patients and the ENS was performed in 30 patients. The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale was administered preoperatively and at first month following surgery. Patients were also evaluated for pain postoperatively with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Results: The mean NOSE score was decreased 62.5-11.0 in the OTS group and 61.3-21.33 in the ENS group. Improvement of the symptoms following the two surgical techniques is similar and no statistically significant difference was found between both techniques. Also there was no statistically significant difference in postoperative pain between the OTS and ENS groups evaluated by VAS. Conclusion: ENS is as successful as the OTS in management difficult septal deviation cases. In patients with severe septal deformities type of the surgical technique should be selected according to the surgeon's experience and the patient's preference.

Introduction: The most difficult aspect of radix lowering is determining the maximum amount of bone that can be removed with osteotomes here we describe use of a radix saw which is a new tool for determining this amount. Objective: In this study we describe use of a radix saw which is a new tool to reduce the radix. Methods: The medical charts of 96 patients undergoing surgery to lower a high radix between 2016 and 2017 were assessed retrospectively. All operations were performed by the senior surgeon. Outcomes were assessed by comparing preoperative photographs with the most recent follow-up photographs (minimum of 6 months postoperatively). The photographs were all taken using the same imaging settings and with consistent subject distance and angulation. The photographs were subsequently analysed by authors. Results: The study population consisted of 96 patients (70 women 26 men) who underwent rhinoplasty between 2016 and 2017. The mean age of the patients was 28.8 years (range: 18-50 years) and the mean clinical follow-up period was 1.8 years. No patient required revision surgery due to radix problems and there were no cases with unwanted bone fragments or radix asymmetry. The swelling and oedema seen immediately after surgery subsided after an average of 7-10 days. Conclusion: In conclusion a radix saw can be used for rhinoplasty requiring delicate bone removal in patients with a high radix. Level IV: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention such as case studies. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.

Introduction: The objective of rhinoplasty is to provide predictable changes in the nasal contours and improve nasal functions. Nasal osteotomy is a frequently used correction technique in rhinoplasty. However the optimal osteotomy technique and approach remain a matter of dispute. Methods: In this study 24 patients who underwent primary septorhinoplasty and 24 patients who underwent paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) due to various causes were retrospectively assessed. Operated patients completing a minimum postoperative follow-up duration of 1 year were invited to the study center. Informed consent form was signed and a CT of the nasal bone in the axial plane was performed. These recorded values were compared with their preoperative results and with non-surgical patients. Results: Comparison of data between postoperative and nonsurgical cases showed that there was a significant reduction in the ventral width of operated patients (p=0.022) whereas no significant difference was observed in the dorsal width despite bilateral spreader grafts (p=0.108). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the dorsal width in patients undergoing bilateral osteotomy and bilateral spreader grafts was not significantly different from those in non-operated subjects. Also contrary to what one may expect spreader grafts are not associated with an increased dorsal width.;2021
Introduction: There is no consensus on duration of the nasal splint after nasal septum surgeries. The pressure of nasal splint on the mucosa may cause tissue necrosis and nasal septum perforation. Objectives: To investigate the histopathological changes of the nasal mucosa caused by nasal splints in a rabbit model. Methods: No splint was used in group A. Bilateral silicone nasal splints were placed for five ten and 15 days in groups B C and D respectively. Biopsy of the nasal mucosa was performed after removal of splint. Histopathologic evaluations were performed. The severity and depth of the inflammation were scored. Results: Group A had a normal histological appearance. Comparison of the results of groups B C and D with group A demonstrated statistically significant differences with regards to the severity of histopathological findings. There was no statistically significant difference between groups B and C. There were statistically significant differences between the groups B and D and also between groups C and D. Conclusions: Longer duration of nasal splint had a higher risk for septal perforation. Therefore removal of the splint as soon as possible may be helpful for preventing potential perforations.

Introduction: We aimed at comparing nasal tip projection and nasolabial angle changes following primary open rhinoplasty with short-floating columellar strut graft and suture techniques. Methods: Participants were divided into two groups depending on the type of technique employed. In the first group short-floating columellar strut grafts were employed. The second group involved those who underwent suture techniques only. Results: We included 119 patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty in the study. The mean value of preoperative nasolabial angle measurement was 92.77 +/- 8.5 degrees and 92.14 +/- 6.7 degrees in groups 1 and 2 respectively. Postoperative nasolabial angle measurement in group 1 was 107.2 104.3 and 101.3 degrees in the 1st 3rd and 5th postoperative year respectively. Postoperative nasolabial angle measurement in group 2 was 107.4 104 and 102.2 degrees in the 1st 3rd and 5th postoperative year respectively. The mean value of preoperative nasal tip projection was 0.605 +/- 0.07 and 0.653 +/- 0.08 in groups 1 and 2 respectively. Postoperative nasal tip projection measurement in group 1 was 0.636 0.632 and 0.627 in the 1st 3rd and 5th postoperative year respectively. Postoperative nasal tip projection measurement in group 2 was 0.656 0.634 and 0.632 in the 1st 3rd and 5th postoperative year respectively. Conclusion: Suture techniques were efficient than columellar strut grafts in maintaining the nasolabial angle but not the nasal tip projection when.;2021
Introduction:Persistent nasal obstruction at internal nasal valve was a common problem seen after septoplasty and submucous resection the 2 methods used for surgical treatment for deviation of nasal septum during the first half of twentieth century. The authors performed cartilage-grafting technique and retrospectively analyzed the patients after 12 months with Nasal Obstruction and Septoplasty Effectiveness scale to emphasize persistent nasal obstruction.Methods:In this study 115 (65 male 50 female) patients operated between 2008 and 2013 who underwent revision septoplasty and complaints were evaluated with Nasal Obstruction and Septoplasty Effectiveness scale. The surgical technique was used in 32 (27.8%) of the patients open and in 83 (72.2%) closed approach. Wilcoxon sign test is used for the statistical analysis. Postoperative values were statistically significant compared with preoperative ones (P<0.05).Discussion:Septoplasty and submucous resection described by Cottle and Killian are similar techniques but a septoplasty often includes less cartilage resection and septal cartilage modification or placement of a cartilage graft instead of resection. Most important disadvantage of these techniques is to be deficient in the correction of the caudal and/or dorsal deviations. In authors' experience these classical septoplasty techniques are not suitable for columellar and dorsal deviations and especially in revision surgery an internal nasal valve correction with cartilage grafts is a necessary alternative technique.;2016
Introduction:The first and one of the most important steps in facial plastic surgery is accurate preoperative facial analysis and recording of data that may help the surgeon to check the outcomes of his/her techniques promoting a surgeon's professional development. Objective:To evaluate the esthetic outcomes of external septorhinoplasty relevant to ethnic facial harmony and to investigate the relationship of the columellar incision scar with the type of skin and columellar incision type in a Turkish population. Methods: In total 28 consecutive adult male patients with a mean age of 32.14 +/- 10.66 years (range: 18-61 years) were included the study. Primary outcomes were preoperative and postoperative photogrammetric facial analyses of the patients including measurement of nasofrontal angle nasolabial angle and nasal projection ratios (Gode) assessed according to the data derived from the Rhinobase program. Results were compared to facial proportions of the Turkish population. Columellar incision scar scores related to the Fitzpatrick skin type classification of the patients and columellar incision types used for the external approach were secondary outcomes of the study. Results: Mean preoperative and postoperative nasofrontal angles were 148.04 degrees +/- 8.18 degrees and 144.50 degrees +/- 7.15 degrees respectively while mean preoperative and postoperative nasolabial angles were 87.59 degrees +/- 14.01 degrees and 98.50 degrees +/- 9.71 degrees respectively. Mean preoperative and postoperative nasal tip projection ratios were 0.56 +/- 0.05 and 0.60 +/- 0.06 respectively. The differences between pre- and postoperative measurements were all significantly different and were in accordance with Turkish nasal harmony. Columellar inverted V incisions were performed in 15 (53.6%) patients while V incisions were used in 13 (46.4%) patients. Fitzpatrick skin Type 4 was seen in 46.42% of the patients Fitzpatrick Type 3 in 46.42% and Fitzpatrick Type 2 in 7.14% of the patients. No significant difference was seen between columellar scar scores according to skin type and columellar incision type used for external septorhinoplasty. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that outcomes for nasofrontal angle nasolabial angle and nasal tip projection ratios analyzed using the Rhinobase program in patients who underwent external septorhinoplasty were similar to reference values for the Turkish population.

IntroductionFormation of less periorbital ecchymosis in post-operative period of rhinoplasty is a popular trend. We present the use of instantly crystallizing supercooled serum physiologic solution for periorbital cooling.Physics of SupercoolingThere are circumstances in which water temperature drops below its freezing point but no phase transition happens while water remains in the liquid phase. This is called supercooling. Pure water can be supercooled below the freezing temperature without transforming into ice. Tap water will not supercool because it contains impurities that serveas nucleation sitesfor crystallization. For freezer temperatures in the range of -4 degrees C -6 degrees C and -8 degrees C nucleation was not observed and pure water remained in the supercooled condition for a long time.Description of the TechniqueSterile serum physiologic solution at +5 degrees C can be supercooled in the freezer at -14 degrees C only between the 257 and 277min time interval. But when it is supercooled in the freezer at -8 degrees C it is possible to save it in liquid form for at least 7days as we have observed in our trials.Clinical Use and DiscussionIt is easily possible to transform this supercooled liquid sterile serum physiologic within a few seconds into moldable snow-like ice that can be used safely and more nicely rather than solid ice for periorbital cooling in rhinoplasty operations. Its sterile inner bag is held tight and struck over the sterile nurse table and it crystallizes within a few seconds. For frozen solutions tearing of the inner plastic bag and extracting the ice and then crushing of big masses of ice to small pieces is exhaustive and a time-consuming process. The temperature of the supercooled fluid will be zero at the moment of nucleation with no risk of frostbite. The crystallized serum physiologic solution preserves its ice-gel form for nearly 25min.ConclusionThe instant crystallization of supercooled liquid serum physiologic solution can be applied as a tissue cooling method in rhinoplasty and in several other surgical procedures.Level of Evidence IVThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Joseph's rhinoplasty operation with minor modifications was performed on 20 patients for aesthetic reasons. Various tests of the patient breathing though the nose were carried out both in the preoperative period and 10 30 and 90 days after surgery. Respiratory-function test results improved in the majority of patients after rhinoplasty. FVC increased in 65% of the cases at day 10 in 85% at day 30 and in 75% at day 90. FEV1 increased in 65% of the cases at day 10 in 65% at day 30 and in 70% at day 90. FEV1/FVC increased in 60% of the cases at day 10 in 65% at day 30 and in 70% at day 90. The only statistically significant increase when compared with preoperative values was the increase in the values of FEV 1/FVC at the 30th postoperative day. Decreases in respiratory function test values were insignificant in most of the patients. FEV1/FVC x 100 decreases of more than 10% were seen in three patients indicating increased nasal resistance at the 90th postoperative day. However the lowest value was 50.4 and none of the patients reported subjective nasal obstruction. In conclusion it was observed in this study that properly executed cosmetic rhinoplasty did not have any significant negative effects on respiratory functions in most patients and improved respiratory functions in most.;2001
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is a rare disease with autosomal recessive inheritance. It is characterized by papulonodular skin lesions which are painless but cosmetically unacceptable and often disturb normal joint function. The nose chin ears scalp back and knees are the most common affected sites. In some cases gingival. hypertrophy flexion contractures of the large joints osteolytic bone lesions and stunted growth may be associated with skin lesions. We report a 9-year-old girt presented with a soft painless stow growing tumoral mass on the supratip of her nose. The lesion was totally excised with open rhinoplasty approach and histopathological diagnosis was JHF. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2003
Knowledge of age-related nasal region measurements in Anatolian men growth changes between adult and old age. The nose plays a critical role in determining the external appearance of an individual. Craniofacial anthropometry has been commonly used in forensic anthropology and medicine. A total of 300 men (100 between 20-40 years 100 between 40-60 years and 100 60-up years) were measured using a photographic technic from the Image J program. From the landmarks 13 linear distances and 3 angles were calculated and averaged for age groups. The means of nasal bridge lengths of three age groups were 60.30 63.43 and 64.63 mm respectively. The average nasal tip protrusions of three groups were 24.31 26.69 and 27.53 mm respectively. Nasolabial angle nasal bridge length and tip protrusion anatomic and morphologic nose width and root width were statistically different between the three age groups (p < 0.05). Results collected in this study could serve as a data bank for nasal anthropometry during aging and development. The assessment of teratogenic-induced traumas craniofacial alteration facial reconstruction aging of dead person and personal identification may be assisted by age data from Anatolian men from age data banks.

Lateral osteotomy is a particular step in rhinoplasty that aims to close an open roof deformity after hump reduction narrow the lateral walls of the nose and symmetrically align the nasal bony framework in cases with asymmetry. When the only reason for performing lateral osteotomy is to close an open roof this can be avoided by using auto spreader flaps. In component hump reduction the entire length of the upper lateral cartilage is preserved including the portion under the nasal bone bilaterally. The basic principles involve suturing the flaps in the midline with a modified technique and supporting the lateral nasal walls with onlay cartilage grafts. This method was used for 34 patients. The lack of lateral wall support was obvious in one of the patients. With precise indications and a well-designed surgery can be achieved. Further studies with more patients and a longer follow-up period are needed to determine the accuracy of this philosophy.

Let-down technique in which high septal strip resection is performed and conventional rhinoplasty using autospreader flaps were compared regarding nasal functions with Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) quality-of-life scale questionnaires. A total of 54 patients who were included in the study were divided into two groups: group 1 (autospreader group n =27) and group 2 (let-down group n =27). Open technical septorhinoplasty operation using an autospreader flap was performed in group 1. Let-down rhinoplasty was applied in group 2. NOSE and SNOT-22 scales were filled for the groups in the preoperative and postoperative periods and were compared. Postoperative values were found to be significantly lower than preoperative values in both groups ( p <0.001). When the groups were compared in between no significant difference was seen according to the scales ( p >0.05). There was also no significant difference between the groups regarding age and gender. Although there was no significant difference between the two techniques both NOSE and SNOT-22 quality-of-life scales have shown improvement both in conventional rhinoplasty with autospreader flap and let-down technique.;2021
Lips are an important unit of the lower face. In the literatures not so many augmentation methods are seen except the fat graft filler material alloplastic prosthesis fascia grafts. Each one has both advantages and disadvantages. The most valuable method for lip augmentation should be minimally invasive low cost and resistant to resorption. The authors are presenting different and novel graft material for lip augmentation. The method has some important advantages such as both long lasting result and no cost and not any donor area morbidity.;2021
Major surgical procedures can be performed safely for hemophiliacs provided the clotting factors are adequate. However rhinoplasty an elective facial procedure has not yet been evaluated in this group of patients. The authors present a hemophilia A patient who underwent rhinoplasty for cosmetic reasons.;2007
Malposition of the lower lateral cartilage (LLC) is a relatively common anatomical variation described as any displacement of the lateral crura from the usual parallel direction with the nostril rims. Cephalic malpositioned LLC has the following characteristics: abnormal axes of the lateral crura bulbous and broad nasal tip parenthesis deformity long alar creases alar wall hollows nostril deformities and incompetence of the external valve. Numerous techniques were founded to correct this aesthetic and functional unpleasant variation although all of them have some limitations. The authors described and evaluated the efficacy of the oblique turnover flap (OTOF) technique in the management of cephalic malposition of LLC (CMLLC). The advantages of this technique are: it does not need any additional grafting it is quick and safe to perform it has stable results. In the present study 24 primary rhinoplasties using OTOF technique were performed between January 2014 and September 2016. There were 21 females (87.5%) and 3 males (12.5%) with age ranging from 23 to 46 years. The mean follow-up period was 12.1 months (range: 8-28 months). All patients were treated by the senior author (A. G.) in the RinoIstanbul Clinic. Three parameters were measured and compared pre-and postoperatively using a t-test and a p value criteria of 0.05. The difference was found to be statistically significant: the angle between the central axis of the lateral crura and the septum on each side satisfaction scale rating of the patients' nasal tip appearance and the satisfaction scale rating of patients' nose breathing. The angle of the central axis of lateral cruras to themidline significantly increased themean satisfactory scale ratings of nasal tip appearance and breathing quality were also significantly improved. OTOF is a quick useful efficient technique for repositioning and flattening of the lateral cruras of CMLLC with a good predictable and stable long-term results in our hands if used on right candidates.;2017
Maxillonasal dysplasia (Binder's syndrome) is a congenital malformation characterized by an extremely flat and retruded nose. This report describes an 18-year-old woman with maxillonasal dysplasia (Binder's syndrome). The septal deficiencies and maxillary retrusion of the patient were corrected by using an L-shaped implant and a crescent-shaped high-density porous polyethylene implant through the oral vestibular sulcus via an external rhinoplasty approach. After the operation the tip of the nose had moved 5.5 mm anteriorly in the sagittal plane and 11.9 mm coronally in the vertical plane. Also the nasolabial angle had increased after the surgery. Follow-up evaluation at 24 months showed good correction of the nasal and midface projection. High-density porous polyethylene implants are a good alternative for patients with Binder's syndrome especially those who will not accept costal cartilage grafts or orthognathic surgery and who have tendency for hypertrophic scarring.;2009
Mentoplasty is often a complimentary procedure to rhinoplasty. At least 25% of all rhinoplasty patients may need a chin implant to balance facial features better. Augmentation mentoplasty using alloplastic implants such as silicone rubber or other materials provides a simple approach to the treatment of the hypoplastic chin. Although these types of implants are readily available in developed countries there are parts of the world where they are unavailable or quite expensive. The authors have developed a chin implant made of wire that is available throughout the world and is custom designed to the mentum of the patient after a cephalometric evaluation. This technique has been used in 125 patients along with rhinoplasty over the last 20 years at our institution. In an initial series of 8 patients the prosthesis became displaced and was removed in 2 patients. Since then a new radiographic technique has been developed to demonstrate the shape of the mentum before surgery and new bone formation after surgery. By using this special radiographic technique it was possible to detect four types of mentum before surgery and to construct a custom-design wire cage according to this shape. The prosthesis is constructed by an orthodontist according to the cephalometric measurements and shape of the mentum. By using the buccal approach a pocket is prepared subperiosteally and a wire cage is inserted. In the last 20 cases the wire cage was filled with diced cartilage wrapped with Surgicel. The results were esthetically satisfactory in most patients. After the shape of the wire prosthesis was modified to conform to the shape of the underlying bone better no displacement of the prosthesis has been experienced. In 3 patients it was necessary to remove the prosthesis when new tissue formation began to fill the prosthesis. These specimens were examined histologically and the regenerating tissue was found to be connective tissue with a thin layer of bone formation. Most patients could be followed up for only 3 to 12 years. In all patients the results have been consistent and the procedure has been safe.;2003
Multiple techniques and a variety of materials used for grafting have been described and applied over the years. Silicone implants are one of the most widely used alloplastic materials in Asian rhinoplasty however there are several complications. The authors report a case of an Asian woman who presented with implant rejection after 25 years later as a late complication of rhinoplasty. The patient was underwent revision augmentation rhinoplasty and stayed uneventful for 6 months as she was satisfied with aesthetic results and nasal airflow. The silicone implants are still going to be the most popular grafts in Asian augmentation rhinoplasty even so the long term complications must be kept in mind.;2019
Nasal augmentation required following a trauma or a rhinoplasty operation poses a challenging problem to many plastic surgeons. Currently allografts and autologous tissues are used for nasal augmentation however an ideal technique has not yet been described. Although preferred for augmentation of different parts of the body pure dermal graft use has not been described for nasal augmentation. The authors performed nasal augmentation using a dermal graft in 90 patients in their hospital between 1994 and 2000 and they followed up the patients for 6 months to 8 years. In this article the early and late results of dermal grafts for nasal augmentation are presented and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed with a review of the literature. It was concluded that the easily obtained dermal graft could be an appropriate alternative in nasal augmentation though it has not been used widely for this purpose.;2003
Nasal deformities affecting the bone and lower two-thirds of the nose due to the loss of septal height and tip support are defined as saddle-nose deformity. Reconstruction of a saddle-nose deformity essentially necessitates structural grafting. This article presents an alternative approach for correction of saddle-nose deformity using a microplate and costal cartilage. The results are compared with those of the previously applied costal cartilage repair methods. Between 2004 and 2013 16 patients were treated with costal cartilage autografts. Of these 16 patients 7 were treated with a microplate and costal cartilage autograft combination 4 were treated with a costal cartilage autograft and Kirschner (K)-wire and 5 were treated with onlay costal cartilage grafts. The mean follow-up periods were 16 months for group treated with microplate-adapted autologous costal cartilage 12 months for the group treated with K-wire and autologous costal cartilage and 16 months for the group treated with onlay costal cartilage. The patients treated with K-wire inserted cartilages and the patients treated onlay dorsal costal cartilages encountered complications such as extrusion of the wire and warping respectively. The seven patients treated with microplate and dorsal onlay costal cartilage graft did not experience any infection warping or extrusion complication. The warping tendency of the costal cartilage autograft can be efficiently prevented without a prominent complication risk by using microplate-adapted costal cartilage grafts.

Nasal dermoid cysts are one of the most frequent congenital pathologic lesions of the nasal area. These lesions may have intracranial extensions without any clinical evidence which can be explained by the pathophysiologic development of the lesion thought to be related to a delay or pause during the separation period of the dura and skin during embryogenesis. This factor is independent from the location and size of the lesion and may lead surgeons to misdiagnoses or inadequate treatments. In this article 2 cases of nasal dermoid cysts localized at the tip of the nose are presented. Although these lesions can be seen anywhere from the root to the columella nasal tip location is rare in previously published series. In the cases presented in this study both patients are school-aged and are faced with social and psychologic problems as their friends call them witch nose in reference to the lesion at the tip of the nose. Vertical tip incision for complete excision of these lesions was performed after accurate radiologic imaging of the brain and possible intracranial extension. No complications or recurrence was seen in either patient. Although the treatment of dermoid cysts is surgical operative planning should be made after complete physical and radiologic examinations. As the lesion may lead to psychologic and social problems because of its appearance especially in children therapy should not be delayed.;2011
Nasal dermoid sinus cyst is a rare congenital midline anomaly. The embryological origin is different from the dermoid cysts seen in other parts of the face. Nasal dermoid sinus cysts constitute 1% to 3% of all dermoid cysts and 11% to 12% of head and neck dermoid cysts. While most lesions are detected in the first 3 years in some cases they may not be noticed until later years. Delay in diagnosis increases recurrent infections airway obstruction and intracranial complications. The authors present a 34-year-old patient with a broad nasal dermoid cyst who had previously undergone external rhinoplasty for a nasal dermoid cyst but relapsed after 5 months.;2020
Nasal dorsal irregularities are troublesome for both patient and surgeon especially in patients with thin nasal dorsal skin. Many types of grafts have been used for nasal contouring however in this article we report the use of fascia lata (FL) graft for dorsal contouring and camouflage in 63 patients who underwent rhinoplasty between May 2004 and December 2005. There were 26 male and 37 female patients with ages ranging from 18 to 43 years (mean age: 28.7). Of the 63 patients 49 underwent primary rhinoplasty while 14 were secondary cases. An informed consent was obtained from all patients for the use of FL graft. The graft was harvested from the right lateral thigh. A simple method was used to place the graft over the nasal dorsum. Postoperative follow-up period was between 14 and 26 months (mean: 20). Clinical evaluation was made by inspection palpation and photographic documentation. In addition a questionnaire related to patient satisfaction and donor-site morbidity was sent to patients 1 year after surgery. All patients had satisfactory aesthetic results and no apparent irregularities were observed over the nasal dorsum. The questionnaire results showed that all patients but one were satisfied with surgery and were not concerned about donor-site scar however one patient had a donor-site morbidity. This study conclusively shows that TLF graft is a reliable simple method for camouflaging any postoperative dorsal irregularities particularly in patients with thin nasal skin.

Nasal dorsal irregularity is a common postrhinoplasty complication in spite of meticulous smoothing. Utilization of the dermocartilaginous ligament in 2 different fashions for different purposes was described before. A novel utilization of the dermocartilaginous ligament as a flattened and pedicled flap from the cephalic attachment for nasal dorsal irregularities was presented in this article. This surgical technique was applied in 11 cases. Eight of them had thin skin 2 had skin with medium thickness and 1 had thick skin. They were followed on an average for 27 months (between 6 and 37 months). All of the patients had satisfactory esthetic results. and there was no apparent irregularities observed over the nasal dorsum. No complications such as infection or hematoma occurred during the early or late follow-up periods. Instead of discarding the dermocartilaginous ligament it can be used adjunctively to conceal the nasal dorsal irregularities to attain a smoother dorsal nasal surface by increasing soft tissue cushion over the osseocartilaginous dorsum. Transposing of the dermocartilaginous ligament also relieves dynamic drooping of the nasal tip shortening of the upper lip and undesirable gingival display.;2018
Nasal edema and volume changes are unavoidable processes during the healing period after rhinoplasty. Various applications were reported regarding the prevention of early edema however the literature shows no Study focused on the Course of the nasal edema and volume changes up-to-date. We aimed to study the nasal volume changes during the first year of postoperative healing period and to form a recovery and volume change diagram with the obtained data. We prepared standard frames and nasal molds of 7 rhinoplasty patients at regular time intervals (preoperative period and at the postoperative 1st 2nd 4th 8th 12th 24th and 52nd weeks). Plaster nasal models were created by using these molds. Volumes of models were measured by computed tomographic scanning and three-dimensional image processing programs. According to our results the nasal edema reaches its maximum level at the postoperative fourth week and then rapidly decreases until its minimum level at the eighth week. In contrast with the general opinion the nasal volume begins to increase smoothly reaching to a level minimally below the preoperative value by the end of the first year.;2009
Nasal hump removal and modification is a commonly performed procedure in rhinoplasty. The spreader flap is most commonly used in the reconstruction technique and involves suturing the medial end of the upper lateral cartilage (ULC) onto the septum. In this study author presents a new hump removal technique that includes a novel procedure for hump reinsertion and suturing that is easy and comfortable to apply in hump removal operations. The records of the patients were assessed retrospectively from private practice. Patients who had undergone hump removal operations using a hump reinsertion graft were included. In total 54 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and their records were assessed. The hump was divided into 3 parts longitudinally. The septum which is a part of the nasal hump was prepared as a strut graft and the ULCs were prepared as spreader grafts. A novel suturing technique was used while the spreader grafts were fixed. This technique was used if the ULC was larger than 3 mm. The patients were evaluated using the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) 12 months after surgery. The initial median ROE score was 40.5 after surgery it increased to 88.5. The ROE score changed significantly (P < .001). The postoperative results were satisfactory. After assessments no asymmetry or functional problems were found in all participants. This technique allows for closed rhinoplasty without the need for an additional graft from the septum enhancing the prevention of displacement and improving functionality.;2020
Nasal obstruction can be due to internal and external valve problems that can be seen before and after rhinoplasty. The main scope of this article is to concentrate on surgical solutions to these problems. To overcome nasal obstruction at the internal valve spreader grafts spreader flaps upper lateral splay graft butterfly graft flaring suture M-plasty Z-plasty and suspension sutures have been described. The management of the external valve problems is possible by using lateral crural dissection and repositioning lateral crural strut grafts alar battens lateral crural turn-in flap alar rim grafts and various other methods. It is not easy to decide which techniques would work best in every case. After a thorough examination and analysis the underlying cause of the nasal obstruction can be understood and one or multiple procedures can be chosen according to each individual problem.;2011
Nasal osteotomies are the most important cause of periorbital edema and ecchymosis. Injection of lidocaine and adrenaline is recommended to reduce bleeding. Whilst the lidocaine and adrenaline combination (LAC) is claimed to reduce postoperative ecchymosis and edema this effect remains to be proven conclusively. This study on 48 patients was designed to investigate the effects of LAC injection on postoperative edema/ecchymosis in rhinoplasty. LAC was applied at a random side prior to the lateral osteotomy. The opposite side was used as a control. The relationship between edema/ecchymosis and the degree of LAC on the injected and uninjected sides was evaluated on the first third and seventh day postoperatively. The relationships between edema and ecchymosis with operation time and intraoperative systolic blood pressure were also evaluated. Bleeding was reduced on the side treated with LAC (p = 0.050). The degrees of edema/ecchymosis increased with increases in the duration of operation and the systolic blood pressure on the first postoperative day for the LAC-applied side (p < 0.05). This correlation was not observed on the opposite side (p > 0.05). Application of LAC reduces bleeding during rhinoplasty and pain control postoperatively but reduced edema and ecchymosis should not be expected following LAC application.;2011
Nasal skin quality is an essential indicator of rhinoplasty outcomes. The objective of this study was to collect data on the nasal skin thickness of randomly selected Turkish men and women. The study involved 50 male and 50 female subjects. We measured the nasal dorsal skin thickness by pinching the sides of the nose upwards to produce a skinfold and then measuring the thickness of this skinfold with a Castroviejo caliper [A&A Almecon Instruments]. We also measured the thickness of the right and left alar walls with the same caliper. In the male subjects the mean nasal dorsal thickness and the mean overall right and left alar wall thicknesses were 4.02 +/- A 0.71 3.99 +/- A 0.69 3.98 +/- A 0.69 and 4.00 +/- A 0.69 mm respectively. The corresponding values in the female subjects were 3.38 +/- A 0.56 3.45 +/- A 0.66 3.43 +/- A 0.67 and 3.46 +/- A 0.65 mm. In Turkish men a nasal dorsum measuring greater than 4 mm can be considered thick. In Turkish women the mean nasal dorsal and alar wall thicknesses were 3.38 and 3.45 mm respectively. Values greater than these are considered thick. Either nasal dorsal thickness or alar wall thickness may be measured in men but both must be measured in women scheduled to undergo rhinoplasty. Dark nasal skin and oily nasal skin tend to be thicker.;2013
Nasal tip deficiency can be congenital or secondary to previous nasal surgeries. Underdeveloped medial crura usually present with underprojected tip and lack of tip definition. Weakness or malposition of lateral crura causes alar rim retraction and lateral nasal wall weakness. Structural grafting of alar cartilages strengthens the tip framework reinforces the disrupted support mechanisms and controls the position of the nasal tip. In secondary cases anatomic reconstruction of the weakened or interrupted alar cartilages and reconstitution of a stable nasal tip tripod must be the goal for a predictable outcome.;2016
Nasal tip management is the most important and challenging part of rhinoplasty surgery. For nasal tip management optimal nasal tip projection and rotation must be maintained. For this reason several methods have been developed to obtain optimal results. In this article we share with the rhinoplasty surgeons how we use cartilage grafts for nasal tip projection nasal tip shaping and maintaining natural and symmetric appearance and avoid visible cartilage problem by using a simple and easily applicable method. After performing standard open rhinoplasty techniques we used the cephalic portion of the lower lateral cartilages to overgraft the already placed numerous layers of shield or onlay grafts. All the cartilage grafts are sutured in their place to prevent malpositions or undesired angularities. We operated on 1480 patients between September of 2002 and September of 2009 for rhinoplasty. Ages of the patients range from 18 to 58 years with nasal tip ptosis. We performed 1235 primary rhinoplasties and 245 secondary rhinoplasties. Of 365 patients who were followed up regularly 330 (approximately 90%) were operated on according to this technique and were included in the study. By using such an overgrafting technique for nasal tip we obtained satisfactory results both by the patients and by the surgeons. Satisfactory results and being a facilitating method for shaping of nasal tip are the advantages of this technique.;2011
Nasal tip sculpturing is the most challenging aspect of rhinoplasty. It is principally performed by the reduction or increment of the nasal tip characteristics with sutures or grafts using endonasal or external approach. In endonasal approach although most of the key structural mechanisms of the nasal tip can be preserved the transfer of nasal tip sutures which are used for contouring the alar cartilages and/or graft stabilization from 1 nasal cavity to another has several difficulties such as time loss need for extensive dissection or injuring the soft tissue and alar cartilages. In the current article we aimed to represent our surgical technique that facilitates suture contouring using a suction tube during the transfer of nasal tip sutures in endonasal rhinoplasty.;2012
Nasal tip support is critical to achieve a lasting result in rhinoplasty. In this article the authors compared the effects of strut grafts (SG) and caudal septum-based nasal tip supporting techniques (CSB-T) in terms of reaching the desired tip projection. Included in this study were 40 patients (24 women and 16 men) who underwent primary open rhinoplasty via transcolumellar incision between January and June 2012. To achieve a good nasal projection SG and CSB-T were used for 15 and 25 of these patients respectively. Certain anatomic landmarks were identified on preoperative simulative and 1-year follow-up photos. With these landmarks certain angular and proportional values were calculated. In the SG the authors found no statistically significant difference in between simulative goals and postoperative results regarding bending angle. Postoperative nasolabial angle (NLA) tip angle subnasal-tip/subnasal-radix (SnT/SnR) ratios were significantly lower than the simulation values radix angle and supratip index values were significantly higher. In the CSB-T group the authors found no statistically significant difference in between preoperative values and postoperative results regarding NLA tip angle bending angle (SnT/SnR) ratio values. Postoperative supratip index and radix angle measurements were found to be significantly higher than the simulation values. With these findings the authors concluded that CSB-T support is superior than the SG for supporting the nasal tip in noses that also need shortening in caudal length. In noses that do not need caudal shortening nasal tip projection can again be supported by the caudal septum by just forming a bridge between lower lateral cartilage and quadrangular septum using a wider SG that mimics septal extension grafts.;2017
Nasal tip surgery is one of the most important parts of rhinoplasty to achieve an attractive nose. There are numerous techniques focusing on the correction of nasal tip rotation and projection. In this article a new cartilage support derived from the cephalic border of lower lateral cartilages is used for the adjustment of tip rotation and projection whereas improving supratip fullness is presented. Bilaterally harvested cartilage extensions are resembled as bird's wings and dedicated to the wings that were created by the world's first scientist who flew from one continent to another: Hezarfen Ahmed Celebi. Thirty-two patients who underwent open-approach rhinoplasty operation including the abovementioned method were evaluated retrospectively. After performing conventional steps of open approach rhinoplasty a wing is created by making a cephalic incision parallel to the lateral crural axis leaving the medial attachment intact and then undermined. Then the cartilage is turned over the midline bilaterally as it acts like a curb by pulling or releasing the wings to adjust to the desired tip rotation and projection and sutured to the repaired upper lateral cartilage roof. Other 2 types of using these wings were asymmetric suturing one of the wings to help in the redirection of deviated nasal tip (n = 12) and suturing each other at midline to support the overlying skin like a tent with supratip deficiency (n = 7). The authors presented here both esthetic and functional outcomes of Hezarfen wings' method that was used for both nasal tip adjustments and supratip support.;2014
Nasolabial angle (NLA) and nasal tip projection (NTP) play an important role in aesthetic nose surgery. Little deviations can determine success and failure. The goal of this study was to analyze the immediate effect of different steps of open rhinoplasty on NLA and NTP. In this prospective single-blind study 50 consecutive rhinoplasty cases were considered. The study consisted of 38 women and 12 men. The mean age was 28 years ranging from 17 to 37 years. A standard life-size photograph was taken in each step of a classic open rhinoplasty during surgery. Nasolabial angle and NTP were measured and analyzed. Nasolabial angle: average increase after skeletonization (2.26 degrees) strut insertion (4 degrees) and tip spanning (0.17 degrees) whereas cephalic resection caused a decrease (1.9 degrees). Nasal tip projection: average increase after skeletonization (0.1 mm) strut insertion (0.31 mm) and tip spanning (0.84 mm) whereas cephalic resection caused a decrease (0.53 mm). Whereas strut insertion caused the highest mean increase in NLA tip spanning was the most effective regarding change of NTP. Expectably cephalic resection was associated with decrease in NLA and NTP.;2014
Nasolacrimal duct injury is a rare complication of rhinoplasty. Detailed regional anatomy knowledge is mandatory to avoid this complication. To display a reference line to protect the nasolacrimal duct from injury during lateral osteotomy dacryocystography images of 10 patients who underwent rhinoplasty surgery at the authors' clinic were obtained. Lateral osteotomy lines and a line from the medial canthus to the alar groove were marked with radio-opaque wires before procedures. Horizontal and sagittal distances from these lines to the nasolacrimal duct were measured at the beginning midpoint and end of the nasolacrimal duct. No sign of nasolacrimal duct injury was observed postoperatively. The mean horizontal distances from the osteotomy lines to the nasolacrimal duct entrance midpoint and exit were respectively 0.23 +/- A 0.12 cm 0.25 +/- A 0.11 cm and 0.24 +/- A 0.11 cm and the mean sagittal distances were respectively 0.61 +/- A 0.21 cm 1.96 +/- A 0.28 cm and 2.38 +/- A 0.32 cm. The mean horizontal distances from the medial canthus-alar groove line to the nasolacrimal duct entrance midpoint and exit were respectively 0.57 +/- A 0.1 cm 0.51 +/- A 0.1 cm and 0.46 +/- A 0.13 cm and the mean sagittal distances were 0.91 +/- A 0.27 cm 1.34 +/- A 0.27 cm and 1.79 +/- A 0.3 cm. The osteotomy lines and the nasolacrimal duct were closest in the medial canthal region. The imaginary line from the medial canthus to the junction of the alar wings and cheek was always lateral and anterior to the nasolacrimal duct. Considering the three-dimensional shape of the nose especially its projection placement of lateral osteotomies medial to the medial canthus-alar groove line would decrease the risk of nasolacrimal duct injury.

Nasomaxillary depression which may be seen with major saddle nose deformities especially as a sequel to childhood nasal trauma generally is overlooked during management of the saddle nose. To handle both the saddle nose deformity and nasomaxillary depression the authors used a one-stage intraoral and external open rhinoplasty approach for 12 patients. Lateral nasal osteotomies and correction of midface retrusion with crescent-shaped autogenous rib cartilage grafts were performed through two bilateral intraoral gingivobuccal incisions. The external open rhinoplasty approach was used for the correction of the saddle nose deformities. The mean follow-up period after the surgery was 2 years (range 1-3.5 years). The correction of nasal tip depression resulting from midface retrusion was evaluated by lateral cephalometric radiographs. The mean movement of the nasal tip anteriorly in the sagittal plane 1 year after the operation was 5.5 mm (range 4-7 mm). The functional and aesthetic results were satisfactory for all the patients. As the findings show the intraoral part of the approach provides a route for the placement of cartilage grafts to correct the depressed nasal tip augment the paranasal area and provide support to the lateral alar bases and the controlled low-to-low lateral osteotomies. The external part of the approach provides correction of the saddle nose deformity.;2010
Negative pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE) is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that typically occurs in response to an upper airway obstruction where patients generate high negative intrathoracic pressures leading to a pulmonary edema especially in the postoperative period. Here we report a case of NPPE following general anesthesia that can easily be misdiagnosed as COVID-19 both radiologically and clinically during this pandemic. Twenty-year-old male was presented with sudden onset respiratory distress tachypnea and cyanosis just after the rhinoplasty surgery under general anesthesia. Chest radiography and thoracic computed tomography scans revealed the bilateral patchy alveolar opacities with decreased vascular clarity that looks similar to COVID-19 radiology. Negative pressure pulmonary edema is a sudden onset and life-threatening complication following general anesthesia particularly after head and neck surgery in young healthy individuals. It is a clinical condition that cannot be diagnosed unless it comes to mind. While both NPPE and COVID-19 cause hypoxemia and respiratory distress as well as ground-glass opacities in the chest computed tomography those opacities in NPPE appear mostly in central areas whereas those opacities are mostly seen in peripheral areas in COVID-19. Furthermore while NPPE cause decreased vascular clarity COVID-19 causes vascular dilatations in the areas of opacities. Those differences together with medical history of the patient is crucial to differentiate these 2 similar identities. Negative pressure pulmonary edema requires an immediate recognition and intervention therefore we would like to raise the awareness of clinicians for such condition to avoid possible mistakes during the pandemic situation.;2021
No surgical procedure is free of complications however some of these complications are unintentional. Plastic surgeons may be unfamiliar with certain complications after rhinoplasty operations. In this study we aimed to present four unintentional complications that have occurred in our patients and review the literature related to these complications. In this study we conducted a review of 1400 patients who were operated on from 2007 to 2015. The medical recordings of all patients were investigated. Four patients with unintentional complications after rhinoplasty operations are presented and the related literature was reviewed. Cases 1 and 2: These patients included a 26-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man who developed herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections after a primary septorhinoplasty. Case 3: This was a 25-year-old woman who developed periorbital emphysema after a primary rhinoplasty operation. Case 4: This was a 22-year-old woman who developed a second-degree burn on the nasal dorsum. All patients healed without sequel or scars. Many unexpected complications have been reported in the literature. Some of these complications include bleeding disorders allergic reactions dermatitis visual loss gastric bleeding benign paroxysmal positional vertigo false aneurysm after rhinoplasty pneumocephalus Tapia's syndrome cavernous sinus syndrome and skin reactions to prolene. Meticulous patient histories consistent surgical routines careful radiologic examinations and frequent patient visits can help surgeons control these types of complications.

Nostril stenosis is an uncommon deformity with a variable aetiology. It may be either congenital or acquired. The causes of the acquired form includes trauma infection and iatrogenic injury to the vestibular skin. Previous surgery including septoplasty and rhinoplasty overzealous use of chemicals laser electrocauterization and traumatic placement of nasal packing to control epistaxis contribute significantly to the development of vestibular stenosis. Electrocauterization for inferior concha hypertrophy is a simple procedure and is frequently used in otolaryngeology-head and neck surgery. If enough attention is not paid during the operation it may cause severe nasal obstruction and an aesthetic deformity which cannot be repaired easily. Various techniques have been described for repair of this stenotic segment but correction is difficult due to tendency of wound-contracture and recurrence. We present a case of a 58-year-old male patient complaining of nasal obstruction and an aesthetic deformity who had sought treatment for stenosis of the left nostril of 6 months duration. Previously the patient had undergone septoplasty and electrocauterization for inferior turbinate hypertrophy.;2010
Nowadays rhinoplasty is one of the most popular surgical procedures. Dorsal contour irregularities caused by various maneuvers such as hump resection are a major concern in patients who have undergone rhinoplasty. The most common graft used in this case is dorsal onlay graft which is made from sliced and crushed cartilage. Ear nose and throat specialists usually use Swester table (mayo desk) for preparing the graft if there is no other steril metal instrument. Crushed cartilage is done on a sterile gauze or on the tables' cover as a result cartilage may be contaminated with particules from the tables' cover and sterile gauze. The authors recommend using the steril pack of a new sterilized surgical instrument opened on the table for the slicing or crushing process. In this way the cartilage can be spared from contamination and the loss of some cartilage to the table during slicing or crushing can be prevented.;2018
Numerous materials have been used for the correction and prevention of dorsal nasal irregularities. Experimental and clinical studies have been useful but have provided insufficient results for several reasons including the impossibility of obtaining pathologic specimens from aesthetic patients and imprecise experimental models. In this study an experimental model for rhinoplasty is used for the comparative evaluation of solvent-dehydrated pericardium acellular dermal matrix and autogenous ear cartilage as onlay grafts for the prevention and correction of nasal dorsal irregularities. We used an experimental rabbit rhinoplasty model that has a human nose-like osteocartilaginous junction. Thus our goal is to get a more realistic idea about the features of these three materials. Thirty New Zealand rabbits weighing 2100-2550 g were used. The noses of the rabbits were evaluated with computerized tomographic measurements pinch tests were performed for skin properties and all were photographed before the surgical procedures. They were divided into three groups: Autogenous cartilage grafts were applied after the rhinoplasty operation in group 1 acellular dermal matrixes were used after the rhinoplasty in group 2 and pericardium allografts were used after the rhinoplasty in group 3. The rabbits were followed up for 4 months before they were evaluated by photography computerized tomography and pinch tests for the skin properties of the nose. Then they were killed for histopathologic evaluation. Adhesion and resorption rates of the onlay grafts were observed and subdermal thickness measurements were made to determine the fate of the grafts as well as their effects on the overlying skin. The major advantages of the allografts used in groups 2 and 3 are the ease of obtaining them without any donor site morbidity shorter operative procedures and lower distortion rates due to lack of cartilage memory. The results of this study conform to those of previous reports and demonstrate that the used allografts had no adverse effects such as ulceration or extrusion. The evaluation of the internal nasal valve angles before and after the surgical interventions showed that cartilage grafts created a spreader effect as expected but acellular dermis and solvent-dehydrated pericardium did not. Despite a moderate graft reaction pericardium or acellular dermis remained intact. None of the materials caused adhesion to the overlying skin. The results of this experimental study showed that acellular dermis (AlloDerm(A (R))) or solvent-dehydrated pericardium (Tutogen) may be used successfully as an onlay graft for dorsal nasal problems compared to autogenous cartilage which is commonly used for this purpose. There has been more cartilage resorption than thought. This should be considered when overcorrection is performed.;2012
OBJECTIVE: Augmentation mentoplasty is a common procedure applied especially in conjunction with rhinoplasty. Although various materials have been used autogenous nasal hump tissue has not been studied in a big series of patients. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the use of autogenous nasal hump in chin augmentation. TUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: University hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The osteocartilaginous mentoplasty procedure was performed in 124 patients along with rhinoplasty in a series of 218 patients who had undergone combined rhinoplasty and mentoplasty with various techniques. The median follow-up was 58 months (range 12-120 months) over a 10-year period. The procedure commenced under general anesthesia for all patients with large humps and poor chin projection. During the rhinoplasty procedure the osteocartilaginous nasal hump was removed tailored to achieve an anatomic mental form and inserted into the mental pocket through a submental or an intraoral incision. RESULTS: Infection was detected in five patients two of whom required graft removal. All other patients recovered normally along an almost painless process without displacements or any other complaints. CONCLUSION: Nasal hump in reduction rhinoplasty is a useful alternative for augmentation mentoplasty on patients with large humps and poor chin projection. It also avoids all the disadvantages of alloplastic materials and eases integration compared with other alternatives in selected cases.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this presentation is to show that the sublabial transseptal transsphenoidal approach to pituitary adenomas is the least invasive anatomic route with the lowest postoperative complication rates. PATIENTS and METHOD: This study was based on a retrospective analysis of 276 patients with a diagnosis of pituitary adenoma who were surgically treated via the sublabial transsphenoidal route. RESULTS: The overall complication rate of the presented series was 14.8%. The recurrence rate was 14.1% there were no deaths or intranasal complications in this series. Postoperative rhinological complications such as septal perforation synechiae and mucosal tear which impaired nasal function occur rarely with this approach compared to other approaches. CONCLUSION: Besides the technical advantages of this approach performance of the initial phase of the operation by an otorhinolaryngologic surgeon is the basis of the low intranasal complication rate in our series.;2008
OBJECTIVES: Cartilage grafts have been commonly used in plastic and reconstructive surgery applications for many different goals such as auricular reconstruction and rhinoplasty. The use of autologous cartilage is ideal for many reasons. An attempt was made to produce an experimental animal model to test the efficacy of otogenic Surgicel-wrapped sliced cartilage. METHODS: In this experimental study cartilage grafts were harvested from rabbits' ears. These grafts were cut in pieces of 0.5 mm to 1 mm using a no. 11 blade. This cartilage mass was wrapped in one layer of Surgicel (oxidized regenerated cellulose) and inserted in the chin of the rabbits. MR analyses were made at 1 week and 6 months and histological analyses were made at 6 months. RESULTS: Cartilage grafts maintained approximately 80% of their dimensions in MRI. The proportion of necrosis was between 30% and 50% and the proportion of resorption was approximately 20% in the histological studies.;2004
OBJECTIVES: Rhinoplastic surgery is performed for the improvement in the appearance of the nose but it should not cause any detrimental effect on the intrinsic muscles. This study was conducted to evaluate the influence of the external rhinoplasty on intrinsic nasal muscles. METHODS: Twenty-one patients were operated on by external septorhinoplasty. Functions of the nasal muscles were assessed by electromyography in response to voluntary nasal movements in patients before and after surgery. RESULTS: Postoperative electromyographic activities of the muscles were significantly less than preoperative measurements for all movements. CONCLUSION: Influence of the surgical incisions alterations of the sites of origin and/or insertion of the muscles and the postoperative healing process can be incriminated for the decreased muscular activity. Nasal muscle function requires a better appreciation and respect for the achievement of the best aesthetic and functional results. The nasal valve reconstructive procedures should be applied routinely to compensate for this inevitable muscular involvement.;2001
Objective Postoperative comfort of the patients undergoing rhinoplasty might be poor because of edema and ecchymosis caused by lateral osteotomy. In this animal experiment we aimed at performing a quantitative assessment of effects of hyaluronic acid usage on healing process of lateral osteotomy. Methods Fourteen New Zealand rabbits with a weight of 2000-2500 kg and an age of 8-12 weeks were included. Under anesthesia nasal dorsums were exposed with midline incision and lateral osteotomies on both sides were performed using a 2 mm chisel. A hyaluronic acid-based mesh (Hyalonect(R)) (1 x 1 cm) was embedded on the left osteotomy areas of all rabbits. Right osteotomy areas were left blank as control group. Collagen density and capillary development were quantitatively compared. Results Convergence of fracture lines was observed in 6 (60%) of 10 samples from Hyalonect(R) group while was observed in 4 (40%) of 10 samples from control group. Although a higher rate of convergence was seen in the Hyalonect(R) group (60% vs 40%) the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.5). Median collagen score was 2 (1-3) in the Hyalonect(R) group and 1 (1-2) in the control group. Median capillary count value was 4 (1-23) in the Hyalonect(R) group and 3 (1-17) in the control group. Both collagen score and capillary count values were significantly greater in the in the Hyalonect(R) group compared with the control group (p = 0.023 and p = 0.019 respectively). Conclusion The effects of hyaluronic acid-based meshes on the bone healing process of the lateral osteotomy area might be investigated furthermore on more comprehensive studies as a material facilitating collagen organization and capillary development.;2021
Objective The crooked nose is still a challenging deformity for rhinoplasty surgeons although a significant number of correction methods have previously been described. The aim of this study is to present a new technique that the authors have used to correct the crooked nose in selected patients. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was carried out on 53 patients who underwent open technique rhinoplasty due to crooked nose. Pictures were taken from five different angles using digital cameras and recorded pre- and postoperatively. Patients who have a minimum follow-up period of 12 months are included in the study. Results Fifty-three patients who have I-shaped and C-shaped crooked nose were enrolled in this study. The mean ages were 27.4 years. The mean follow-up period of the patients was 19.1 months. Patients who have I-shaped and C-shaped crooked nose deviation angle values were calculated preoperatively as 7.1 +/- 2.1 and 163.4 +/- 3.6 respectively. Postoperatively deviation angle values were 0.75 +/- 0.83 and 177.9 +/- 3.1. Postoperative deviation angles were significantly lower than preoperative angles on patients who have I-shaped crooked noses (p < 0.001). On patients who have C-shaped crooked nose postoperative deviation angles were significantly higher than preoperative angles (p < 0.001). Conclusions This unique study shows that the combined use of one-sided spreader flap and asymmetric spreader grafts is a very good choice for satisfactory long-term outcome and durable correction of crooked nose deformity.;2021
Objective The present study was intended to compare the body image self-esteem temperament and character traits of a group of patients who applied for aesthetic rhinoplasty with healthy controls subjects. Methods Thirty patients who applied the Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery Clinic at the Firat University Hospital for aesthetic surgery were included in the present study. In addition thirty healthy individuals who met the study criteria and were matched the patient group by age and gender were included in the study as the healthy control group. Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) body image (BI) scale The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and sociodemographic data form were applied to patient and control groups. Results The patients with aesthetic rhinoplasty had higher body image (BI) scores compared to the control group (t = 2.828 p = .006) and had higher novelty seeking (NS) (p = .038) and lower harm avoidance (HA) scores for temperament dimensions. The outcomes of the correlation analysis yielded a positive correlation between the RSES and BP scores and the HA temperament subscale scores were positively correlated with RSES (r = 0.389 p = .033) and BP (r = 0.461 p = .010) scores. In addition a negative correlation (r = -0.496 p = .005) was determined between the RSES scores and self-directedness (SD) which is a character subdimension. Conclusion The present study established that there existed differences in the aesthetic rhinoplasty patient group in terms of body image self-esteem temperament and character traits. The differences in temperament traits could indicate that the condition is hereditary. Determining such differences was considered significant for both identifying patients as candidates for surgery and predicting the level of satisfaction from surgery. In order to obtain better results it is required to perform longitudinal studies with larger sample.;2019
Objective This study was performed on fresh frozen cadavers to investigate the role of angular artery damage. Methods Lateral osteotomies ('high-low-high' method) were carried out bilaterally with a 4 mm guarded lateral osteotome after the creation of a subperiosteal tunnel. Following completion of the lateral osteotomy a skin incision was made in the midline dorsum. The dermis and subcutaneous tissues were carefully dissected taking care not to damage the angular artery. Overlying tissues were cut and retracted to show the course of the angular artery. Results The angular artery was not damaged in any of the cadavers. The angular artery was always lateral to the lateral osteotomy line. Conclusion The high-low-high lateral osteotomy does not damage or traumatise the angular artery. The ecchymosis and oedema are related to other factors.;2020
Objective To analyse and compare the patient satisfaction and quality of life in patients with and without deviated nose deformity who underwent rhinoplasty. Design Prospective beforeafter trial. Setting Tertiary referral centre. Participants A total of 191 patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty between 2006 and 2009 were included. The study population was separated into two groups: non-deviated (patients with an external nasal deformity of less than 50) and deviated nose (patients with an external nasal deformity of more than 50). Main Outcome Measures The angles of deviations were measured from the pre- and postoperative photographs by an image analysis software program. Patient satisfaction and quality of life were measured by Rhinoplasty outcome evaluation and European Quality of Life-5 Dimension questionnaires before and after surgery. Results Eighty-one cases had deviated nose deformity on the other hand 110 cases had nasal deformities other than deviated nose deformity. The objective analysis of surgical outcome demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the favour of postoperative results in both non-deviated (P=0.0004) and deviated (P=0.0002) nose groups. In addition Rhinoplasty outcome evaluation and European Quality of Life-5 Dimension questionnaires demonstrated remarkable improvement in both non-deviated and deviated nose groups after rhinoplasty. However the comparison of pre- and postoperative change between non-deviated and deviated nose groups demonstrated statistically significant differences in almost all questions (except family and friends' satisfaction with appearance P=0.069) and total score (P<0.001) of Rhinoplasty outcome evaluation questionnaire European Quality of Life-5 Dimension index (P<0.001) European Quality of Life-5 Dimension visual analogue scale (P=0.036) and living quality index (P<0.001) with lower scores in deviated nose group. Conclusion Rhinoplasty can provide an objective improvement high satisfaction and positive impact on quality of life. However the degree of satisfaction and improvement in quality of life in patients with deviated nose deformity are less than patients with non-deviated nose deformity.;2013
Objective We aimed to investigate the relationship between the number of visits to different physicians and postoperative satisfaction in patients undergoing primary septorhinoplasty by using the ROE survey. Methods Patients for whom we performed septorhinoplasty in the last 3 years were examined. Patients who visited 3 different physicians (including us) before the surgery were allocated to group 1. Patients who visited >= 4 physicians comprised group 2. We randomized 50 patients in each group. Rhinoplasty outcome evaluation (ROE) was performed twice for the preoperative evaluation and to determine the satisfaction in postoperative 6th month. Results Preoperative and postoperative ROE values were significantly lower in group 2 (p < 0.001). ROE values after surgery were 82% in group 1 and 68.92% in group 2. Conclusion We think that it is more appropriate for patients who visit many surgeons to be evaluated more carefully and to be psychologically examined.;2019
Objective. The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of septal cartilage (SC) and costal cartilage (CC) grafts harvested from different ribs and to find at which level CC has characteristics closest to SC. Study Design. Experimental cadaver study. Setting. Istanbul Training and Research Hospital. Material and Method. Cartilage grafts were harvested from the 6th 7th and 8th ribs and the SC of 10 fresh cadavers. Shaped cartilage grafts were subjected to a bending test. Results were measured and the force-deflection curve was plotted. Flexural strength (sigma(f)) and flexural modulus of elasticity (E-f) were determined. Fractured surfaces were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results. According to F-max it was determined that ribs 6 7 and 8 have significantly more durability compared with the SC (Ps = .030 .004 and .001). With regard to deflection there was no significant difference between the SC and the 6th and 7th ribs and between the 6th and 7th ribs (Ps = 1.000 .088 and .306) while a significant difference was found between the SC and the 8th rib (P = .001). According to sf no differences were seen between the 6th and 7th rib (P = .782) while difference was detected between the 6th and 8th and the 7th and 8th ribs (p = .001). Similar trends were established in E-f values as in sigma(f). These results were confirmed by SEM images. Conclusion. The 7th CC can be used as autograft because it shows similar properties to SC. However the 6th CC is preferred if more flexibility is desired and the 8th CC is preferred where more strength is needed.;2012
Objective. The basic aim of this study was to minimize intraoperative bleeding postoperative eyelid edema and periorbital ecchymosis and to reduce morbidity with a combination of cold saline-soaked gauze compression and intraoperative single-dose corticosteroids. Study Design. The study was designed as a prospective double-blind randomized controlled study. Three hundred patients who underwent septorhinoplasty were included. Setting. A tertiary referral hospital in Turkey. Subjects and Methods. Three hundred patients undergoing septorhinoplasty were divided into 2 groups. A single dose of 10 mg dexamethasone was intravenously administered in all cases at the beginning of the operation. In the study group the nasal dorsum was continuously compressed with cold saline-soaked gauze during the operation. In the control group the nasal dorsum was compressed with dry gauze continuously during surgery. The operation time and amount of bleeding were recorded during surgery. Degree of eyelid edema and periorbital soft tissue ecchymosis was recorded at 24 hours and on postoperative days 2 3 5 and 7 by 2 investigators. Results. The operation time was significantly shorter in the study group than in the control group. Eyelid edema and periorbital ecchymosis were significantly decreased in the study group at the following postoperative days 1 3 5 and 7 (P < .05). Conclusion. Bleeding edema and ecchymosis are the main morbidities of rhinoplasty. It is highly probable that cold compression and intraoperative corticosteroids have synergistic effects on these morbidities especially by the intraoperative control of bleeding.;2011
Objective/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to assess the tissue response to Gore-Tex (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) in rats and compare the results of surgical placement modalities. Study Design: Prospective animal study. Materials and Methods: Experiments were performed in 18 young Sprague-Dawley rats that were divided into 3 groups. Gore-Tex patches were implanted subcutaneously over the periosteum in the first group and under the periosteum in the other groups. Gore-Tex was immersed in an antibiotic-containing solution in the third group. All animals were killed 4 weeks after the procedure. The tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain and evaluated using a light microscope. Results: The Gore-Tex patches were displaced and not observed at the originally implanted sites in the first group. The Gore-Tex patches were observed at the originally implanted sites in the other groups. In group 1 edema and inflammation were prominent. In the second group ossification was detected in 5 rats and foreign-body reaction and edema were identified in 1 rat. In the third group all of the rats were found to have developed ossification but no inflammatory reactions were observed. Conclusions: The results suggest that implanting synthetic graft materials immersed in an antibiotic solution at the subperiosteal plane provides better stabilization and low complication rates.;2013
Objective/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to determine the reliability and feasibility ofmodified splay graft technique in the surgical correction of internal nasal valve (INV) incompetence and nasal valve collapse. Study Design: Eleven patients operated with the diagnosis of INV incompetence were followed for 6 to 30 months after operation. Methods: Between 2004 and 2007 11 patients with the complaint of shortness of breath and in whom nasal valve incompetence was detected and who were positive for Cottle and modified Cottle tests were operated. In the operation splay graft was used endonasally with the technique we describe. Before and at least 6 months after the operation patients were evaluated with acoustic rhinometry linear symptom scale and nasal obstruction symptom evaluation scale in addition to endoscopic examination and the results were compared. Results: In 10 of 11 (90.9%) patients operated with modified splay graft technique marked improvement was observed in INV region with endoscopic examination and acoustic rhinometry. In the evaluation made with linear symptom scale and nasal obstruction symptom evaluation scale partial improvement was seen in nasal obstruction in one patient and marked improvement in 10 patients. No complications developed. Conclusions: Modified splay technique is an effective graft method that can be easily applied and has minimal complications and morbidity.;2008
Objective: Although posterior epistaxis is rarely seen it is an important medical problem that both decreases the quality of life of the patient and causes difficulties in the management for otorhinolaryngologists. In this study we aimed to present the results of 30 patients who underwent transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) for posterior epistaxis in our department. Methods: The records of 30 patients who underwent TESPAL from January 2014 to April 2016 were analyzed retrospectively and the relationship between perioperative factors and need for revision surgery was assessed. Results: The success rate of TESPAL in posterior epistaxis was 90%. There was no relationship between surgical failure and antiaggregant use (p=0.224) anticoagulant use (p=0.534) hypertension (p=0.564) previous nasal surgery (p=0.279) and bilateral TESPAL application (p=0.279). TESPAL was seen to be effective in cases with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease pregnancy and uncontrollable epistaxis after rhinoplasty surgery. Mortality was seen in one of our patients not related to endoscopic ligation in the follow-up period. Conclusion: TESPAL is an effective method in the treatment of posterior epistaxis. Hypertension antiaggregant or anticoagulant use bilateral sphenopalatine artery ligation and previous nasal surgery do not seem to be factors leading to surgical failure.;2016
Objective: Anxiety and depressive disorders can be widespread among patients who are being treated in surgical clinics and they can affect operation outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the level of their anxiety and depression in the preoperative period and the pain level in the postoperative period in rhinoplasty and septoplasty patients. Material and methods: This study included 57 (51.8%) patients (rhinoplasty group) with external nasal deformity and 53 (48.2%) patients (septoplasty group) with septum deviation. These patients filled out the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale sociodemographic data evaluation form before the surgery. Pain severity was rated by Visual Analogue Scale on the 1st postoperative day and before being discharged from the hospital by the patients. Results: The mean depression score of all patients was 6.35 +/- 3.52 (range 1-15). The mean depression scores were 6.31 +/- 3.8 (range 1-15) in the rhinoplasty group and 6.37 +/- 3.2 (range 1-14) in the septoplasty group. There was no significant difference between the depression scores of two groups (t=0.091 p=0.927 P>0.05). The mean anxiety score of all patients was 6.5 +/- 3.38 (range 0-16). The mean anxiety scores were 6.73 +/- 3.34 (range 0-16) in the rhinoplasty group and 6.24 +/- 3.44 (range 0-16) in the septoplasty group. There was no significant difference between the anxiety scores of two groups (t=0.75 p=0.049 P>0.05). There was minimum positive correlation between the anxiety and depression level of the all subjects and 1st postoperative day Visual Analogue Scale score (r=0.05 p>0.05). There was a minimum positive correlation between the anxiety and depression level of the all subjects and before being discharged from the hospital Visual Analogue Scale score (r=0.06 p>0.05). But these correlations were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The result of this study in this patient group showed that the presence of anxiety and depression preoperatively in septoplasty and rhinoplasty patients had not affected the pain level postoperatively.;2012
Objective: Deviated nose is a challenge for rhinoplasty surgeons. We applied a new technique to correct nasal bone asymmetry in selected patients. We assessed the efficacy of the technique and discussed the surgical outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 29 patients with deviated nose who received unilateral osteotomy alone or unilateral osteotomy with camouflage graft placement to the other side of the nose. Preoperative and postoperative photographs were studied to evaluate the outcomes. Results: Twenty-nine unilateral osteotomies were done. Camouflage grafting was performed to 20 of the 29 patients. Nasal humps were removed in all patients. No postoperative complications occurred during the follow-up period. Twenty-six of 29 deviated noses were corrected with unilateral osteotomy. Conclusions: The unilateral osteotomy technique seems to be a useful method for correcting deviated nose.;2010
Objective: In this study the authors aimed to compare the nasal physiology and nasal cavity volume with three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) 1 year after the operation with the values before the operation to investigate the possible narrowing and loss of function in the nasal cavity after septorhinoplasty (SRP) operation. Methods: Of 415 patients who had a primary SRP operation 28 patients who met the criteria were included in the study. Nasal cavity volumes of patients with postoperative CTs were measured three-dimensionally after a mean 13 months and objective rhinologic measurements (rhinomanometry acoustic rhinometry and peak nasal inspiratory flow [PNIF]) and subjective assessment methods (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation [NOSE]) were performed. Results: The mean postoperative VAS and PNIF values of the patients were significantly higher than the mean preoperative values. The mean postoperative NOSE value of the patients was significantly lower than the mean preoperative values. Although the mean MCA-1 and MCA-2 levels of the patients increased postoperatively the increase was not significant. Although the postoperative mean values of VOL-1 and VOL-2 increased compared with the preoperative values the increase was not significant. In the CT measurements of the patients the nasal cavity volumes were significantly higher than the preoperative values. Conclusion: Nasal cavity volumes in patients undergoing SRP were compared with 3D-CT for the first time in the literature and a significant increase in nasal volume was observed in the postoperative first year. This finding suggests that the correction of intranasal problems leads to an increase in the nasal volume in SRP operations although nasal osteotomy is performed.;2019
Objective: Isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy is a rare complication of long lasting operations under general anesthesia like cosmetic surgeries and orthopedic operations caused by the use of laryngeal mask or intubation tube. In this case report we discuss the probable causes and treatment methods of this complication in the light of the current literature. Case: In this study we present a 35-year old patient who developed isolated left hypoglossal nerve palsy right after septorhinoplasty. The patient received B vitamin complex and a gradual tapering dose of oral methylprednisolone treatment of 1mg/kg and his tongue movements completely recovered after three months. Conclusion: Hypoglossal nerve palsy is the consequence of neuropraxia caused by compression of the nerve in between the intubation tube or its cuff and the hyoid bone or cervical vertebra. In this case report we evaluated factors that increase the complication rate such as the use of nitrous oxide during the surgery the malposition of the intubation tube or the laryngeal mask. Precautions such as using adequate size intubation tubes gentle intubation of the patient without trauma proper positioning of the intubation tube avoiding long-time hyperextension of the position of the head of the patient and checking intracuff pressure continuously with a manometer would help to prevent these kind of complications.;2017
Objective: Local flaps have been preferred frequently for the reconstruction of face defects because of good color and tissue texture matching. Forehead flap is also a local flap that is used to repair facial defects. Material and Methods: In this study the outcomes of patients who were reconstructed with forehead flap during an 8-year period (1994-2002) were presented and advantages and disadvantages of the forehead flap were discussed. Thirty-two cases (18 women and 14 men) with ages ranging between 24-71 years (mean 53.9 years) were included in this study. Localization of the reconstructed defects were the nose (19 patients) the medial cantus (11 patients) the orbit (1 patient) and the infraorbital region (1 patient). The defect size was between 1 x 1.5-6 x 8 cm. Outcomes were assessed by a questionnaire that was performed both by patients and by two different surgeons. Results: Follow-up duration ranged between 8 to 24 months and there was no complication except marginal necrosis in 1 patient. Donor area appearance was assessed as perfect for %66.7 of surgeons but %66.6 of patients was assessed as acceptable. Conclusion: Reconstruction of facial defects is more critical than other body regions regarding anatomical functional and aesthetical results. Forehead flap can be used for appropriate facial tissue defects with great safety and patient satisfaction.;2008
Objective: Nasal valve area is an important functional part of nose and there are several different methods that have been used to enlarge that area for a better breathing function. In this study the authors aimed to study the efficacy of a new spreader graft modification that was crafted in a triangular shape to enlarge nasal valve area. Methods: Twenty-two patients who underwent rhinoplasty operation with this new technique composed the study group. Average age of patients was 21.4 +/- 2.1 13 of them were men (59%) and 9 of them were women (41%). Same surgeon operated all 22 patients with the same technique that included usage of modified triangular spreader graft. Surgical outcomes were assessed by visual analog scale and nasal obstruction symptom evaluation scale preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Results: None of the patients had complications or aesthetic deformities according to surgeon after surgery. Average of nasal obstruction symptom evaluation scale score was 64.3 before surgery which reduced to 17.9 at postoperative third month. Also average visual analog scale score was 2.6 before surgery and it was 8.1 3 months after surgery indicating a better breathing sensation (P<0.001). Conclusions: Modified triangular spreader graft usage is a safe and effective method to enlarge nasal valve area with satisfactory aesthetic outcomes and good functional results because of its compatibility with anatomic position of nasal valve area.;2016
Objective: Osteotomy is a critical step of rhinoplasty. Various osteotomy techniques have been developed to reduce postoperative edema and ecchymosis and achieve optimal aesthetic results. In this study we aimed to compare the early and long-term effects of piezoelectric surgery with conventional osteotomy. Methods: In this prospective study 72 rhinoplasty patients were randomly divided into 2 groups according to osteotomy technique used either conventional osteotomy or piezosurgery. These 2 groups were compared for postoperative edema ecchymosis and pain on the first and seventh postoperative days. The sinonasal outcome test-22 (SNOT-22) peak nasal flowmetry and Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center test were applied to all patients before and 8 weeks after surgery. Results: The study consisted of 72 patients 42 of whom were female and 30 were male. The mean age was 28.1 +/- 6.5 (range 18-49 years). On the first postoperative day edema and ecchymosis were significantly less in the piezosurgery group (P < 0.001). VAS results showed that only the piezosurgery group experienced less pain on the first postoperative day (P < 0.001). Nasal airflow of the patients was evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively nasal airflow decreased postoperatively in both groups but this decrease was not statistically significant and no significant difference was found between the groups. The preoperative and postoperative comparison of odor functions was similar in both groups after the operation and there was no significant difference between the groups. Conclusion: Piezosurgery in the early period after rhinoplasty has been shown to decrease eyelid edema periorbital ecchymosis and pain compared to conventional osteotomy techniques. However the superiority of piezosurgery in terms of nasal airflow olfactory functions and quality of life were not found in the long term.;2020
Objective: Periorbital ecchymosis and edema are common after septorhinoplasty surgery. This study aimed to compare internal and external lateral nasal osteotomies performed in septorhinoplasty in terms of postoperative ecchymosis and edema. Methods: Patients who underwent septorhinoplasty between January 2020 and July 2020 in our clinic were included in the study. In all patients right lateral nasal osteotomies were performed endonasally and left lateral nasal osteotomies externally. The postoperative 1st 7th and 14th day ecchymosis and edema scores of all patients were calculated separately for the two groups and compared. Results: A total of 60 patients (29 females 31 males) were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 33.88 +/- 10.30 years. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of the postoperative periorbital ecchymosis scores on the first day and the first and second weeks (0.314 0.344 and 0.468 respectively). There was also no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the postoperative periorbital edema scores on the first day and at the first and second weeks (0.272 0.359 and 0313 respectively). Conclusion: The results obtained from this study showed no significant difference in the periorbital ecchymosis and edema scores between the patients who had undergone septorhinoplasty with internal or external lateral osteotomies. Further multicenter studies are recommended to verify the findings of this study with a larger sample size.;2020
Objective: Quality of life (QOL) assessment in patients with nasal obstruction has not been well studied. The main objectives of this study were to determine the QOL of patients after septorhinoplasty to measure the efficacy of septorhinoplasty with a validated quality-of-life instrument - the Nasal Obstructive Symptoms Evaluation (NOSE) scale - and with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) QOL scores comprising patient assessments of nasal function. Patients and methods: The patient population consisted of a consecutive series of 50 patients who underwent septorhinoplasty at the ages of 18 to 48 years between 2009 and 2011.Quality of life was assessed with the NOSE scale (pre- and postoperatively) and with GBI scores (postoperatively). Demographic data along with patient assessments of nasal obstruction with a linear analogue scale were recorded. Results: The mean patient age was 28.3 +/- 14.6 years (age range 18-48 years). Twenty-eight patients were male (56%) and 22 (44%) were women. Evaluation of each of the 5 items on the NOSE scale individually revealed that patients experienced improvement in all areas. In this study there was a statistically significant fall in all five parameters (p = 0.000 <0.05). The mean total GBI score was 34.89 +/- 22.53 and the mean general subscale score was 38.25 +/- 24.31. The mean social support score was 19.67 +/- 33.79 and the mean physical health score was 36.67 +/- 27.97. Each patient had improved QOL scores on the GBI and NOSE scales (P<0.05). Conclusions: This study found improved QOL after rhinoplasty in Turkish adult patients. With proper pre-operative assessment and selection excellent functional and psychosocial outcomes can be expected. NOSE and GBI are valuable tools for the assessment of benefit from nasal septal surgery for nasal obstruction and may be applicable in clinical practice.;2013
Objective: Rhinoplasty is a common procedure performed in plastic surgery. Postoperative pain edema and periorbital ecchymosis are the most common acute complications of this surgical procedure. In this study we aimed to evaluate the postoperative pain and analgesic consumption after rhinoplasty of patients who had bilateral supraorbital and infraorbital nerve block. Methods: Eighty-four patients who underwent rhinoplasty under general anesthesia between 17 and 41 years of age and who underwent intravenous patient-controlled morphine analgesia for postoperative analgesia were included in this study. The cases were divided into two groups: bilateral supra-infraorbital block with intravenous analgesic (Group B) and only intravenous analgesic (Group C). Demographic data hemodynamic data operation time visual analog scale values patient-controlled analgesia device data complaints of nausea-vomiting and antiemetic drug use were recorded. Results: The hemodynamic data of the cases included in this study were similar (P > .05). When compared with Group C postoperative 1st 6th and 24th hour visual analog scale (VAS) scores were found to be significantly lower in Group B (P < .05). Morphine consumption at the end of the postoperative 24 hours was found to be significantly lower in Group B compared with Group C (P < .05). Conclusion: In this study which cases undergoing bilateral supraorbital-infraorbital nerve block and IV morphine was used for postoperative analgesia after rhinoplasty significant reductions were achieved in the postoperative VAS values and analgesic consumption of the cases where the block was used.;2021
Objective: Rhinoplasty is a very common surgical procedure that is performed throughout the world as well as in our country for aesthetic concerns nasal obstruction or both. However functional results still remain subjective and compared to the vast number of operations studies about functional results in the literature are very limited. The aim of this study is to evaluate respiratory functions after corrective rhinoplasty and to find the benefits both numerically and statistically. Material and Methods: Thirty patients who were admitted to our department with nasal obstruction based on the statements of the patients were included in the study. Patients who were admitted only for aesthetic considerations were excluded from the study. These patients were preoperatively evaluated with radiographic and endoscopic imaging preoperative nasal resistance and nasal airway cross-sectional area values were measured and recorded with acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry devices. Then patients were operated by open rhinoplasty technique and measurements were repeated at three months and one year postoperative follow-ups. Results: As a result of measurements made with rhinomanometry one year after the surgery a decrease in resistance value was observed in 20 patients and an increase in minimal cross-sectional area measured with acoustic rhinometry was observed in 24 patients. The values measured by both methods were found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: As a result of our study we advocate performing both functional and aesthetic rhinoplasty operations instead of functional or aesthetic purposes alone.;2017
Objective: Rhinoplasty is the most common facial plastic surgery procedure. The appearance of the face must be considered as a whole to achieve the best results but assessment of the chin is often overlooked. The aim of this paper was to determine the need for mentoplasty after rhinoplasty. Methods: Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems San Jose CA) was used to analyze 200 consecutive rhinoplasty patients 170 of whom were included in this study. We used Silver and Agarwal's method for assessment of the chin. Results: A total of 170 profile photographs were analyzed. Of these patients 58.2% (n=99) had normal chins 40% (n=68) had small chins (microgenia) and 1.8% (n=3) had over-projection. There were no statistically significant differences between men and women. Conclusion: Chin projection is an important component of facial euphony. Approximately half of the rhinoplasty patients we assessed would also benefit from mentoplasty. Surgeons that perform rhinoplasty should discuss mentoplasty with their patients to achieve the best results.;2014
Objective: Spontaneous cartilage regeneration is poor after a cartilage defect occurs by trauma surgical and other reasons. Importance of producing chondrocytes from stem cells and using tissues to repair a defect is getting popular. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of injectable cartilage produced by chondrocytes differentiated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells and chondrocyte cells isolated directly from cartilage tissue. Methods: Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from rat adipose tissue and characterized by cell-surface markers. Then they were differentiated to chondrocyte cells. The function of differentiated chondrocyte cells was compared with chondrocyte cells directly isolated from cartilage tissue in terms of collagen and glycosaminoglycan secretion. Then both chondrocyte cell types were injected to rats' left ears in liquid and gel form and histologic evaluation was done 3 weeks after the injection. Results: Adipose-derived stem cells were strongly positive for the CD44 and CD73 mesenchymal markers. Differentiated chondrocyte cells and chondrocyte cells directly isolated from cartilage tissue had relative collagen and glycosaminoglycan secretion results. However histologic evaluations did not show any cartilage formation after both chondrocyte cell types were injected to rats. Conclusions: Strong CD44- and CD73-positive expression indicated that adipose-derived cells had the stem cell characters. Collagen and glycosaminoglycan secretion results demonstrated that adipose-derived stem cells were successfully differentiated to chondrocyte cells.;2013
Objective: The achievement of consistently superior results in rhinoplasty is difficult. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of anchoring the columellar strut graft to the thread of the lateral crural steal for nasal tip projection and rotation. Study Design: A retrospective case-control study. Methods: Two groups were created which consisted of patients who had a history of low nasal tip deformity according to the type of nasal tip surgery in rhinoplasty. In group 1 the lateral crural steal technique with the strut graft was used whereas in group 2 a new technique in which the strut graft was anchored to the thread of the lateral crural steal was used. Patients with low nasal tip deformity due to intrinsic factors such as long lateral crura were included. The effects of the 2 different surgical approaches on facial parameters (the nasolabial angle nasofacial angle and Goode ratio) were statistically compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student t test as applicable. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled: half of them were included in group 1 and the other half in group 2. Average postoperative increases of the nasolabial angle score were 10.9 +/- 4.728 and 18.76 +/- 6.30 degrees in groups 1 and 2 respectively (P<0.001). Average improvements of the nasofacial angle were 2.33 +/- 2.12 degrees and 3.50 +/- 2.44 degrees in groups 1 and 2 respectively (P = 0.053). Average postoperative increases of the Goode ratio were 0.02 +/- 0.02 in group 1 and 0.04 +/- 0.03 in group 2 (P = 0.028). Conclusion: The new technique provided a prominent nasal cephalic rotation with a strong effect on the nasolabial angle and a partial effect on nasal projection.;2019
Objective: The aim of this study is to compare the postoperative correction rates in the follow-up after simultaneous cleft lip nose (CLN) repair with cleft lip repair using either interdomal suture or crescentic skin excision. Material and Methods: Eighty-three unilateral cleft lip patients were operated using modified Millard rotation advancement technique for cleft lip repair and simultaneous cleft lip repair using either interdomal suture or crescentic skin excision. The evaluation of the patients was made using routine standardized preoperative and early and later postoperative caudal nasal photographs. The distance between the nasal base and the most projectile point of the nostril was measured and the ratio of the cleft side to the non-cleft side was calculated. Results: The highest rate was calculated in the early postoperative period in the crescentic skin excision group (1.07 +/- 0.29). The ratio was found to be 0.87 +/- 0.22 in patients with interdomal suture placement. The lowest rate was observed in patients who did not have any nasal reshaping procedure other than a standard cleft lip repair (0.71 +/- 0.16). The highest rate of recurrence was observed among the patients who had crescentic skin excision (0.39 +/- 0.16). When recurrence rates were compared a significant difference was observed in the crescentic skin excision group compared to the interdomal suture placed patients (p= 0.005). Conclusion: The simultaneous primary rhinoplasty approach with cleft lip repair appears to be necessary for CLN repair in the long term. Although crescentic skin excision and placement of interdomal suture for this purpose achieve symmetry with the noncleft side and successful results in the early postoperative period the probability of recurrence should always be taken in consideration. If either of these two techniques is to be preferred for CLN repair then overcorrection should always be taken in consideration.;2017
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare periorbital edema and ecchymosis seen after closed (endonasal) and open (external) septorhinoplasty (SRP). Methods: In total 50 patients undergoing hump extraction and osteotomies were allocated to 2 groups. Group 1 consisted of 25 patients who underwent closed SRP. Group 2 consisted of 25 patients who underwent open SRP. Operation time amount of intraoperative bleeding and complications were recorded. Scoring of eyelid edema and periorbital ecchymosis was evaluated on the first third and seventh postoperative days using a scale of 0 to 4 by the first author. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of age sex or operation time. No significant difference was observed clinically or statistically in the scores of periorbital edema or ecchymosis between groups 1 and 2 on the first third and seventh postoperative days (P > 0.05). Conclusions: The authors observed no clinically or statistically significant difference in comparing periorbital edema and ecchymosis seen after closed and open SRP.;2015
Objective: The aim of this study was to define the desired profile measurements in patients who demand rhinoplasty and to assess the needs of extra profile surgeries in these patients. Material and Methods: Overall 100 patients (60 women 40 men) demanding rhinoplasty between January and December 2013 were included in this study. Standard profile photos were taken. Rhinoplasty and extra profile surgeries were simulated in those photos with both patient and surgeon decisions. These simulated photos were assumed as the desired profile view. In those photos some angles or measurements were calculated to understand the desired proportions on the profile view. Then these desired proportions were compared with the universal ideal proportions to understand the needs of extra profile surgeries in those patients. Results: It has been found that 43% of women and 27.5% of men would benefit from fat injections to the forehead. Sagittal lowering of the nasion was necessary in 25% of both men and women. Respectively in women and men demands in nasolabial angle increase were 85% and 75% projection increase according to Goode ratio were 35% and 32% according to Baum ratio 80 and 75%. Lower chins vertical height was longer than the nose in 18% and 17% nose was longer than the lower chin in 17% and 7.5% in women and men respectively. Lower 2/3rds of the chin was longer than normal in 21% of the patients in both women and men. In two different proportions the chin was found to be retruded in 23%-36% and 30%-35% and protruded in 23%-26% and 25%-30% in women and men respectively. Conclusion: Personal demands may vary from the universal ideals. Therefore pre-surgical simulations become necessary to assess the extra surgery needs in patients demanding rhinoplasty. These simulations may help the surgeon to personalize the surgery according to the patients demand and patient satisfaction may increase as a result this approach.;2016
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate different determinants of the patient's psychosocial functioning that might possibly affect the outcome of rhinoplastic surgery. Materials and Methods: Forty-one patients undergoing rhinoplasty consecutively admitted to and operated upon at the Department of Otolaryngology Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital Turkey were studied with regard to their psychological characteristics. Results: In the patient group Liebowitz anxiety Liebowitz/avoidance and Liebowitz/total scores were significantly higher than the control group (p<0.001). No significant differences were found between the patient and control groups according to Rosenberg self-esteem scale and The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. In the Quality of Life SF-36 results significant differences were found between the patient and control groups apart from SF-36 scores of pain (p<0.05) vitality (p<0.05) social functioning (p<0.05) and emotional role difficulties (p<0.05). Conclusion: Patient selection must be done very carefully to obviate not only physical but also psychological postoperative complications. The SF-36 questionnaire may be of value in screening-patients for psychological problems prior to rhinoplasty.;2016
Objective: The authors aimed to investigate the effect of spreader grafts on nasal function in septorhinoplasty (SRP). Methods: A prospective randomized double-blind study was conducted. Thirty patients who underwent SRP operation between October 2011 and January 2013 were divided into 2 equal groups randomly. Fifteen patients underwent SRP surgery without spreader graft technique (Group I) and 15 patients underwent SRP surgery with spreader grafts (Group II). Preoperative and postoperative evaluation included visual analog score (VAS) and acoustic rhinometry test. Results: Visual analog scores and acoustic rhinometry measurements of Group I and Group II patients were compared. Statistically significant difference was found for VAS scores of both the sides of the nasal cavity (both before and after topical decongestion) (P< 0.05) except for the VAS on the right side of the nasal cavity before decongestion (P> 0.05). On acoustic rhinometry test the difference was statistically significant for minimal cross-sectional area (MCA) and volumetric values (VOL)-MCA1 MCA2 VOL1 VOL2 values on the left side of the nasal cavity (both before and after topical decongestion) (P< 0.05) but not on the right side of the nasal cavity (P> 0.05). Conclusions: Performing spreader graft technique in SRP surgery can prevent the narrowing of the internal nasal valve area after surgery and maintain adequate airway for respiration.;2017
Objective: The goal of this review is to discuss possible underlying psychopathological situations in patients requesting surgical cosmetic rhinoplasty operation and to examine potential problems that might arise. Subjects and Methods: An extensive search was conducted through PubMed Ambase and PsychInfo by using related keywords in English like rhinoplasty and psychiatric comorbidities rhinoplasty and psychopathology. Results: Patients who demand cosmetic rhinoplasty operation appealed to the surgeon since they wanted to feel better about themselves after the surgery. Indeed some long-term studies determined that such a situation can take place at high rates. However some studies reported the possibility of serious psychological disorders after such surgical operations. Studies relating to the analysis of psychopathologic symptoms are quite limited. Research has shown that psychopathologic evaluation conducted preoperatively is especially important to identify serious psychopathologies such as personality disorders and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Conclusions: Exclusion of patients possessing serious psychopathologies from operations provides better results in the long term. The lack of sufficient research in this area necessitates new and comprehensive studies.;2012
Objective: The indications management and results are discussed in 45 patients who underwent the concurrent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and rhinoplasty. Study Design: Retrospective clinical study. Patients and Methods: There were 27 women and 18 men with a mean age of 28 years. 28 patients had chronic rhinosinusitis and 17 patients had nasal polyposis refractory to medical therapy underwent the combined procedure by the same otolaryngologist. Results: A review of our 45 combined procedure performed between 2000 and 2005. There were no lifethreatening severe complications noted in this population. The patients were also satisfied with the aesthetic outcome. Conclusion: Combined rhinoplasty and endoscopic sinus surgery can be performed safely cost-effectively and with perfect results in selected patients.;2008
Objective: The purpose of this study is to analyse the development of rhinoplasty studies between 1980 and 2017 through bibliometric analyses. Background: Rhinoplasty is one of the major operations in plastic surgery it is popular and the number of operations has been increasing every day. However the literature has only one study which investigated the development of rhinoplasty. Therefore the present study on rhinoplasty is believed to shed light to plastic surgery studies. Methods: Bibliometric analyses were performed by retrieving all the publications in Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics' WoS) database between 1980 and 2017 using the 'Rhinoplasty' keyword. Results: The number of publications found using the Rhinoplasty keyword was 2977. Of all these publications 2261 (75.9%) were articles. The highest number of publications was in the year 2016 with 237 publications (10.5%). With 911 publications (40.3%) the USA was the most productive country. The top two active authors who produced most publications about rhinoplasty were Rohrich R.J. (64-2.8%) and Guyuron B. (45-1.2%). The journals which made the greatest contribution to the literature were Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery with 426 publications (18.8%) and Aesthetic Plastic Surgery with 314 publications (13.9%). Conclusion: The number of studies on rhinoplasty has been increasing every day. Result of this first comprehensive bibliometric study showed that the USA was the most active country and it was followed by Turkey which indicates the contribution of the developing countries to rhinoplasty.;2019
Objective: The purpose of this study was to present the placement technique of Gore-Tex implants for nasal augmentation. Methods: The study group comprised 32 patients of various nasal deformities who underwent consecutive rhinoplasty via open approach with Gore-Tex implant material for dorsal augmentation. A pocket is made subperiostally at the nasal dorsum. The implant is rinsed in antibiotic solution and placed in position. Complications due to Gore-Tex were observed during the follow-up period. Results: There were 12 men and 20 women. The mean age was 28.4 years. There were 9 primary rhinoplasty and 23 revision rhinoplasty. Patients were followed up postoperatively for 12 to 24 months. During the postoperative follow-up period no complications were encountered in this series of patients. The implants were stable and immobile under the skin. Conclusions: In the cases of nasal dorsum augmentation Gore-Tex can be a suitable graft material. We recommend implanting graft materials at subperiosteal plane to provide better stabilization and low complication rates.;2012
Objective: The study was conducted to determine the effect of cold application in the early postoperative period for pain and bleeding in patients who had septoplasty to correct septum deviation. Design: Randomized controlled experimental study Setting: This study was conducted at Ear Nose and Throat Clinic Research and Application Hospital of Duzce University Turkey. Subjects: The study was conducted on 60 patients. One half of the patients were included in the experiment group (n = 30) and the other half in the control group (n = 30). Interventions: Data collection was achieved using a form for patients' identifying information and the Post-Operative Pain Intensity Assessment Scale and Post-Operative Grading Scale for assessments of bleeding. Main outcome measures: Post-Operative Pain Intensity Assessment Scale and Post-Operative Grading Scale for assessments of bleeding Result: Cold application was shown to be effective in reducing pain that developed in the early postoperative period (p < 0.05). The degree of bleeding was found to be lower in the experiment group in comparison with the control group (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Applying cold in the early postoperative period to patients who had septoplasty to correct septum deviation is recommended to reduce operation-related pain and bleeding in the postoperative period.;2018
Objective: This paper presents a novel method for spreader graft placement without dorsum resection in patients who have a deviated septum with a narrow internal nasal valve angle. Methods: A Killian incision was used for the endonasal septoplasty and all spreader grafts were harvested from excised deviated septal cartilages. Procedures were conducted under general anaesthesia at the same centre by the same surgical team that performed the endonasal procedure. Successful placement of spreader grafts was achieved endonasally. Conclusion: Although the endonasal placement of spreader grafts seems to be more difficult than placement conducted by an open approach technique an endonasal procedure has many advantages. Our technique provides surgeons with the opportunity to shorten operation time obtain autologous septal graft material and secure the columellar architecture. Surgeons familiar with the classical (endonasal) septoplasty procedure can easily apply this technique to widen a narrow internal nasal valve angle without corrupting nasal integrity.;2015
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of rhinoplasty on subjective and objective assessment of nasal patency in patients who underwent rhinoplasty for cosmetic reasons only. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Design: Prospective clinical study. Subject and Methods: A total of 50 adult patients who underwent rhinoplasty were included in the study. Preoperative and postoperative photographs of the nasal profile (frontal lateral and oblique) were obtained. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for the subjective evaluation of nasal obstruction (0 being the minimum 10 being the maximum amount of nasal patency). Objective evaluation of nasal obstruction was performed with a peak nasal inspiratory flowmeter (PNIF). Results: Preoperative mean VAS scores and PNIF values of the patients were 7.36 +/- 0.83 and 115.10 +/- 17.45 respectively. Postoperative mean VAS scores and PNIF values of the patients were 7.42 +/- 0.73 and 115.30 +/- 16.7 respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between any of the pre- and postoperative subjective and objective parameters (P>.05). Conclusion: Reduction rhinoplasty has been shown not to reduce nasal patency.;2014
Objective: This study aims to interrogate the relationship between patient stress and the levels of acute phase proteins (APP) in rhinoplasty. Methods: Twenty-six primary rhinoplasty patients were asked about the most stressful step of the rhinoplasty process which were (1) deciding on the operation (2) waiting in the preoperative room (3) the first few postoperative hours and (4) withdrawing the nasal pack in order beginning from the most stressful one preoperatively and then postoperatively. C-reactive protein (CRP) alfa-1-acide glycoprotein (AAG) ceruloplasmin (CER) haptoglobulin (HPT) and alfa-1-antitrypsin (AT) have been studied in blood to detect a relation between the patient stress and the levels of APP. Results: Preoperatively the imagined most stressful step was Step 4 (61.53 %). Postoperatively the declared most stressful step was Step 3 (50 %). The blood levels of APP matched with the imagined rather than the declared stress. Conclusion: Patient stress could be a preoperative issue which should be eliminated preoperatively. Detailed description of the surgery and some pharmaceutics can inhibit the negative effects of the stressors and have a contribution to patient comfort. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: This study was designed to explore the impact of medial osteotomy on olfactory function. Methods: This nonrandomized prospective study included 60 adult patients who underwent open technique septoplasty (group 1) rhinoplasty with only lateral osteotomy (group 2) and septorhinoplasty with medial and lateral osteotomies (group 3). Olfactory functions were evaluated by using the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test. The CCCRC test includes the butanol threshold test and smell identification test using common smells. The butanol threshold test and smell identification test scores of each group were recorded preoperatively and at 1st and 4th months and compared. Results: Each group is consisted of 20 patients. The preoperative smell identification test and butanol threshold test scores were similar in each group. The smell identification test butanol threshold test and CCCRC olfactory test scores of the 1st month were statistically significantly low in group 3. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups at 4th month postoperatively. Conclusion: The present study is the first analysis of the effect of medial osteotomy on olfactory function. Medial osteotomy may decrease the olfactory function in early time but afterwards olfaction could recover at preoperative levels.;2019
Objective: This study was designed to investigate the effects of open technique rhinoplasty on facial nerve terminal branches more concerned with mimicry via electroneurography (ENoG). Methods: Twenty patients ages between 24 and 36 years were included in the study. Five nasal mimicry muscles were used to evaluate axonal loss of the facial nerve: bilateral transverse nasal levator labii superioris alaeque nasi (LLSAN) and procerus muscles of all patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperative third month by ENoG. The patients that have abnormalities regarding the amplitude and latency at third month were reevaluated at sixth month postoperatively. Results: Mean latencies of the facial nerve were calculated to be increased for all muscles at third postoperative month but this increase was significant only for left LLSAN (P = 0.002). Amplitudes of the facial nerve decreased in all of the groups but this decrease was not significant (P > 0.05). Two patients with exceptionally long latency facial nerve response of transverse nasal muscle and 11 muscle recordings with abnormal low amplitudes of the facial nerve at the third month was reevaluated at sixth postoperative month and the values were improved. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that facial nerve integrity is minimally affected after rhinoplasty yet all affected muscles were recovered on the long term.;2015
Objective: This study was performed to evaluate the effect of inferior turbinate reduction on nasal function. Materials and Methods: A total of 32 patients who underwent septorhinoplasty (SRP) operation were included in the study and assigned into 2 groups as group I who received inferior turbinate reduction during SRP operation consisted of 17 patients and the group II who consisted of 15 patients without inferior turbinate reduction. For 2 groups before and after surgery visual analogue score and findings of the acoustic rhinometry were recorded both before and after decongestion of the nasal mucosa. Results: Postoperative mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores revealed a statistically significant reduction compared with preoperative values on right and left side of the nasal cavity both before and after topical decongestion in group I (P<0.005). Also in group II the differences of VAS scores for both sides before and after topical decongestion were statistically significant (P<0.05). Postoperatively the increase of the volume measurements at the level of pyriform sinus (VOL2) value on the right side of the nasal cavity before and after decongestion and volume measurements at the level of the nasal valve (VOL1) values on both sides after topical decongestion were found to be statistically significant in group I. When the VAS scores and acoustic rhinometry measurements of group I and group II patients were compared the difference for before and after topical decongestion postoperative mean MCA1 (minimal cross-sectional area at the level of the nasal valve) values for left side and right side of nasal cavity were higher in group I than group II and these differences were statistically significant (P<0.005). Conclusions: As a result in the SRP operations turbinoplasty should be implemented by taking into account the function as well as aesthetic concern. Similar results were obtained in other studies that were carried on.;2018
Objective: To assess approaches and experiences of otorhinolaryngologists in facial plastic and nasal surgery. Methods: In total 234 surgeons (191 males and 43 females average age 37.22 +/- 8.4 years age range 26-63 years) were included. All participants were given a questionnaire comprising 22 multiple choice and closed-ended questions. All responses to the questionnaires were analyzed. Results: Of 234 participants 42 (17.9%) were residents and 192 (82.1%) were specialists in otorhinolaryngology. The most challenging cases in rhinoplasty were crooked nose (33.8%) ideal nasal dorsum (18.8%) revision cases (13.2%) and skin deformities (11.1%). The photodocumentation rate by surgeons before and after procedures of facial plastic surgery was 86.3% whereas the intraoperative photodocumentation rate by surgeons was 47%. The most common facial plastic surgery procedures other than rhinoplasty were otoplasty (68.4%) filler-Botox-fat injections (20.5%) and mentoplasty (18.4%). Conclusion: This survey study is quite important because it assesses approaches of otorhinolaryngologists in facial plastic surgery. Although this study provides more valuable data for determining the current status further studies with larger number of surgeons are required.;2017
Objective: To assess the clinical outcome of crushed cartilage grafts used to conceal contour irregularities in rhinoplasty. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 462 patients in whom crushed autogenous cartilage grafts were used selected from a total of 669 patients in whom rhinoplasty procedures were performed at our institution between June 1 1999 and June 1 2006. The grafts were used as slightly moderately significantly or severely crushed. Results: Eight hundred nine cartilage grafts (41 slightly crushed grafts [5%] 650 moderately crushed grafts [80%] and 118 significantly crushed grafts [15%]) were used in 462 patients. Resorption occurred in 11 of the 462 patients (2.4%). All of the resorbed grafts (6 moderately crushed grafts and 5 significantly crushed grafts) had been placed in the dorsal area. The resorption rate of those grafts was lower in the moderately crushed cartilage grafts ( 6 of 284 grafts [2.1%]) than in the significantly crushed grafts (5 of 38 grafts [13.1%]). There was no resorption of slightly crushed grafts. Conclusions: The degree of crushing applied is important for long-term clinical outcome of autogenous crushed cartilage grafts. Slight or moderate crushing of cartilage creates an outstanding graft material for concealing irregularities and provides both excellent long-term clinical outcome and predictable esthetic results.;2007
Objective: To classify shapes of the nasal bones in the Turkish population and comparatively evaluate the sizes of nasal bone and piriform apertures. Methods: Two-and three-dimensional paranasal sinus computed tomography images of 363 patients were evaluated. Upper intermediate and inferior thickness of bilateral nasal bones and thickness of medial and lateral osteotomy line were measured. The shapes of the nasal bones were classified. Results: The mean thickness of nasal bone in the study participants was 1.99 +/- 0.40 mm the mean thickness at the level of medial osteotomy line was 1.99 +/- 0.40 mm the mean thickness at the level of lateral osteotomy line was 1.75 +/- 0.30 mm the mean length of nasal bone was 1.75 +/- 0.30 mm maximum width and height of piriform aperture were 23.41 +/- 2.68 and 36.76 +/- 7.06 mm respectively. When the patients were classified according to the type of nasal bone 26.7% had type A 10.5% had type B 19.6% had type D and 15.4% had type E nasal bone. Conclusion: The results of the current study provide information about morphological characteristics of nasal bone and piriform aperture in the Turkish population and would therefore reduce postoperative complications after reconstructive surgery and contribute otolaryngology and anthropology.;2017
Objective: To compare the patient-reported outcomes among patients with nasal obstruction undergoing two rhinoplasty techniques to a control group. Methods: Prospective longitudinal study in a university-based tertiary care medical center. All patients undergoing functional septorhinoplasty for correction of lateral wall insufficiency between October 2015 and March 2019 were included n = 704 mean age (standard deviation) 39.0 (15.4) years 52.7% females. Patients completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and FACE-Q subscales pre- and postoperatively. Patients were divided into three cohorts: spreader and lateral crural strut (LCS) grafts (n = 141) spreader and alar rim (AR) grafts (n = 104) and the control spreader grafts alone (n = 218). Results: The median NOSE scores at last postoperative visit were improved from baseline (p < 0.001) for all cohorts. The FACE-Q nasal satisfaction median scores also improved postoperatively in all cohorts AR LCS and spreader respectively (p = 0.001 p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001). Conclusions: There was no detectable difference in the improved subjective nasal function nor adverse aesthetic outcomes in the patients with lateral wall insufficiency treated with functional rhinoplasty techniques in this study.;2021
Objective: To compare various graft materials in the rabbit model including autologous cartilage dermal tissue fat and AlloDerm ( a cadaver-derived material). Methods: Twenty-five New Zealand white rabbits were used. Equally sized autogenous ( fat fascia cartilage and dermal) grafts and AlloDerm were implanted into subcutaneous dorsal pockets on the rabbits. Animals were killed 1 2 3 and 4 months after surgery. The grafts were examined microscopically for thickness resorption fibrosis neovascularization inflammation eosinophilia and the presence of multinucleated giant cells or microcysts. Results: The cartilage grafts revealed excellent viability with no resorption. The fascial grafts showed negligible volume loss. The dermal grafts developed epidermoid cysts. The AlloDerm grafts demonstrated graft thickening at 1 month and total resorption at 3 and 4 months. The fat grafts demonstrated 30% to 60% partial resorption. Conclusions: The major disadvantage of using an autogenous fat graft was partial resorption whereas cyst formation was observed with dermal grafts. AlloDerm caused tissue reaction and resorption. The best graft material was cartilage with a low absorption rate good biocompatibility and minimal tissue reaction or fibrosis followed by fascia with a minimal shrinkage capacity and tissue reaction.;2008
Objective: To evaluate long-term results of septal bone grafting and to show sustainable viability of bone grafts with objective parameters such as computed tomography. Methods: Nasal septal bones were used as splinting grafts during septo/rhinoplasty operations in 27 patients (Male = 16 Female = 11) between 2009 and 2013. Of these only the 21 patients who were monitored long-term and who had computed tomography (CT) records were included in this investigation. The average duration of monitoring for the patients reported here was 17(12-37 months) months. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: pregnancy morbid obesity uncontrolled diabetes long-term oral steroid or chemotherapeutic agent use inflammatory systemic or immunodeficiency disease or acute local infections at the operative site. Bone graft positions lengths and respective resorption were evaluated and compared pre-postoperatively for each patient. Results: Bone grafts retained 90% of their lengths in 14 of the 21(66.6%) patients. In other cases control computed sinus tomography showed four bone grafts at 80% two grafts with 70% and one graft retained 60% of the original lengths. None of the grafts showed resorption less than 50%. Conclusion: Bone grafts are reliable grafts and can be used as an alternative to cartilage grafts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Objective: To evaluate our outcomes of augmentation mentoplasty with solid silicone in patients with retrognathia. Methods: In total 17 patients (14 females 3 males average age 30.2 years range 24-37 years) who underwent augmentation mentoplasty with solid silicone combined by septorhinoplasty were included in this study. Submental or gingivobuccal incision was performed in all the patients. The post-operative results of the augmentation mentoplasty were evaluated with reference to 3 criteria i.e. patient satisfaction physician aesthetic evaluation and complications. The evaluation of the surgical results was formulated by adding scores from all 3 criteria. Results: The mean follow-up was 18.5 months with the shortest and the longest being 4 and 33 months respectively. Gingivolabial incision was performed in 4 patients (23.5%) and submental incision was performed in 13 patients (76.5%) respectively. There were no permanent complications in any patient. Overall 15 patients (88.2%) were extremely pleased with the procedure. In total 16 patients (94.12%) showed a significant improvement after augmentation mentoplasty with solid silicone according to the aesthetic evaluation by the physician. Revision mentoplasty was not performed in any patient. Conclusion: Augmentation mentoplasty with solid silicone is a safe and effective means of creating a beautiful and balanced facial profile by producing alterations in the chin morphology with excellent and stable long-term results. Increased experience in augmentation mentoplasty will contribute to the further development of this surgery.;2018
Objective: To evaluate patient satisfaction according to demographic characteristics using the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaire. Methods: In this retrospective observational study a total of 60 patients that underwent septorhinoplasty were evaluated. The ROE questionnaire was administered to evaluate patient satisfaction after septorhinoplasty. Results: There were 24 (40%) males and 36 (60%) females in the study. The mean age of the patients was 32.5 years. In the whole sample the mean postoperative ROE score was 87.9. It was observed that the mean postoperative ROE score of the patients aged 30 and below was lower compared to the >30 age group (p < 0.001). Furthermore the mean postoperative ROE score was significantly higher in male patients than in females (p = 0.019). Conclusion: We conclude that the ROE questionnaire is a simple and useful tool for evaluating septorhinoplasty outcomes. Demographic characteristics such as male gender and age > 30 are factors that positively affect the satisfaction of patients with septorhinoplasty.;2020
Objective: To evaluate the effect on snoring of structural nasal valve dilatation with butterfly spreader grafts in patients with nasal valve insufficiency. Design: Retrospective medical chart review and telephone follow-up mean +/- SD follow-up time 20.7 +/- 11.34 months (range 3-48 months). Settings: Tertiary care referral center. Subjects: A total of 37 snoring patients with nasal valve insufficiency who underwent nasal valve dilatation with a butterfly spreader graft. Interventions: The conchal cartilage butterfly graft technique was performed during rhinoplasty through either an external or endonasal approach. Main Outcome Measure: To establish through a retrospective review that butterfly graft conchal cartilage nasal reconstruction is effective in reducing snoring. Results: After surgery 30 patients (81%) had significant improvement in breathing 5 (14%) had slight improvement and 2 (5%) had no benefit in breathing. Snoring stopped completely in 11 (30%) of the patients after surgery. The improvement in snoring was significant in 13 patients (35%) and slight in 3 (8%). Twenty-six patients (70%) reported tiredness and grogginess on awakening before the surgery. Surgery significantly improved patients' tiredness and grogginess on awakening in 15 cases (58%) slightly improved them in 5 (19%) and did not change the patients' tiredness and grogginess in 6 cases (23%). Conclusion: The conchal cartilage butterfly graft yields successful results not only in breathing but also in snoring symptoms in patients with nasal valve insufficiency.;2004
Objective: To get the desired outcome and minimize the complications in rhinoplasty it is essential that the anatomy of the nose be precisely known and an appropriate surgical technique should be chosen for the existing problem in a given patient. Preoperative assessment in rhinoplasty is usually based on a physical examination and photographs of the patient. To date there has been no objective diagnostic test for nose anomalies such as bulbous nasal tip. Methods: In this study we measured the interdomal distance and size of the interdomal fat pad using USG in a total of 40 rhinoplasty patients. Open rhinoplasty was performed in all patients. Also interdomal fat pad was dissected and excised in all patients. The size of the specimens was determined and their histopathological diagnoses were made. All the cases were evaluated in the 6th month after the operations. Reviewing of the literature was performed. Results: Before the operation six patients had been diagnosed as bulbous nasal tip clinically. In the patients with bulbous nose both interdomal distance and interdomal fat pad proportions were found to be larger than normal. In the cases in which tip refinement had been performed the interdomal distance was measured as zero. Conclusions: Joseph in 1931 used the profilometer Webster et al. in 1977 used the projectometer in the evaluation of the nose. The evaluation of the anatomical structure of the nose has been the topic of many anthropometric studies and advanced and highly detailed studies with 3 dimensional facial plaster models digitizer or laser surface scanners have appeared the literature. Tasman and Helbig used the ultrasonography in the evaluation of the nasal tip area. Evaluation of the interdomal space by using USG is quite simple cheap and easily applicable. In addition interdomal fat pad can be visualized and an objective criterion can be obtained for bulbous nose by measuring the interdomal distance on USG. Since the excision of interdomal fat pad could only be achieved by open rhinoplasty and that tip refinement is required in order to correct the increased interdomal distance pre-operative interdomal USG will guide the surgeon and provide objective criteria in determination of the operative technique in bulbous nose. This is the first study to show interdomal fat pad by a diagnostic test and it can be concluded that interdomal fat pad excision is necessary for the prevention of supratip.;2005
Objective: To investigate how different degrees of crushing affect the viability of human nasal septum chondrocytes in adherent cell cultures. Methods: Cartilage grafts were harvested from the nasal septa of 15 patients who underwent submucosal. resection. Five cartilage pieces were prepared from each specimen as follows: the cartilage was left intact slightly crushed moderately crushed significantly crushed or severely crushed. Chondrocytes were isolated for trypan blue dye exclusion testing and the numbers of viable cells were determined at 1 23 and 10 days after culturing. Comparisons were made among the groups. Results: The day I viability rates for the intact slightly crushed moderately crushed significantly crushed and severely crushed cartilage preparations were 96% 92% 82% 72% and 54% respectively. The corresponding rates on day 10 were 93% 90% 84% 75% and 68%. Conclusions: The viability and proliferative capacity of crushed human septal cartilage depend on the degree of crushing sustained. Slightly or moderately crushed cartilage grafts show good chondrocyte viability and proliferation and are valuable for fashioning soft nasal contours filling defects and concealing dorsal irregularities. However significant or severe crushing reduces chondrocyte viability and proliferation and may result in unpredictable degrees of graft volume loss.;2005
Objective: To investigate the effects of dicing and different degrees of crushing on cartilage graft viability and outcome in rhinoplasty. Methods: Cartilage was harvested from both ears of 29 rabbits. For each animal 6 cartilage pieces were prepared as follows and inserted into the paraspinal subcutaneous tissue: (1) left intact (2) diced to approximately 1 X 1-min pieces and then wrapped in oxidized regenerated cellulose (3) slightly crushed (4) moderately crushed (5) significantly crushed and (6) severely crushed. Animals were killed at 25 and 10 months and graft specimens were microscopically examined. Results: As crushing intensity rose cartilage viability decreased and more cartilage tissue was transformed to connective tissue. The intact and slightly crushed grafts showed significant chondrocyte proliferation. This decreased as crushing intensity increased and the severely crushed and diced cellulose-wrapped grafts exhibited almost no peripheral chondrocyte proliferation. Conclusions: Slight crushing of a cartilage graft can produce outstanding graft material that forms softer nasal contours and fills defects well. However severe crushing of cartilage grafts results in extensive necrosis and eventual reduction in graft volume. The use of oxidized regenerated cellulose to wrap diced cartilage grafts also tends to reduce clinical predictability owing to negative effects on cartilage viability and regeneration.;2005
Objective: To use the trimmed cartilage as a support material for both internal and external valves. Methods: The lateral crural turn-in flap (LCTF) technique is simply to make cephalic trimming of the lateral crura and turn it into a pocket created under the remaining lateral crus. Twenty-four patients with lateral crura wider than 12 mm and in whom this technique was applied took part in this study. The trimmed cartilage was used to reshape and/or support the lateral crus and the internal valve by keeping the scroll intact. The support and suspension of the lateral crura sandwich helped not only to prevent stenosis of the internal valve angle but also to widen it in some cases. Results: The LCTF has been used in 24 patients to reshape and/or add structure to the lateral crus with great success. The internal valve was also kept open by keeping the scroll area intact especially in 1 patient with concave lateral crura in whom this technique helped to widen the internal valve angle. Conclusions: This study shows that the LCTF can be used to reshape and add structure to the lateral crus and to suspend the internal valve. Although it is a powerful technique by itself in functional rhinoplasty it should be combined with other methods such as spreader flaps/grafts or alar battens to obtain the maximum functional result.;2012
Objective: Understanding the postoperative dynamics of the nasal soft-tissue envelope (NSTE) is necessary to obtain the desired cosmetic results after rhinoplasty. This study was conducted to determine the changes of NSTE thickness and its effects on periorbital edema and ecchymosis following rhinoplasty. Methods: Thirty-five patients who underwent rhinoplasty were included in the study. Nasal skin and subcutaneous tissue thickness at the tip supratip rhinion and nasion were measured using ultrasonography preoperatively and at the postoperative 3rd and 10th months. Periorbital edema and ecchymosis were evaluated at postoperative days 1 3 and 7. The patients were categorized as the thick NSTE group (n = 17) and the thin NSTE group (n = 18) according to the preoperative median NSTE thickness. Results: In the thin NSTE group supratip skin subcutaneous tissue and total NSTE thickness were lowest on the preoperative day but no statistically significant difference was found for the thick NSTE group. In the thin NSTE group total NSTE thickness of the rhinion was highest at the postoperative 3rd month but in the thick NSTE group there was no statistically significant difference between postoperative 3rd and 10th months. In both groups total NSTE thickness of the nasion was highest at the postoperative 3rd month and lowest at the postoperative 10th month. Conclusions: Supratip fullness occurs more prominent in patients with thin NSTE. Postoperative edema in the rhinion is greater in patients with thin NSTE for the early postoperative period but it lasts longer in patients with thick NSTE. Soft-tissue envelope atrophy at the nasion occurs in both groups in the late postoperative period. Periorbital edema and ecchymosis severity are not affected by NSTE thickness.;2021
Objective: We aimed to assess the effect of additional local anesthesia on postoperative pain levels which made at the end of the rhinoplasty operation. Material and Method: Sixty-six patients who had open technique rhinoplasty operation included in this study. Patients were operated under general anesthesia. Additional local anesthesia was applied at the end of the operation. Patient's pain level was evaluated with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at preoperative intravenous catheterization recovery room postoperative 1st 2rsd 4th 6th 12th 18th 24th hours and compared with the group who had no additional local anesthesia. Result: The highest pain levels were at the catheterization 1st and 2rsd hours. There was a significant difference between 1st and 2nd hours pain level between groups. First and 2nd hour pain levels were significantly lower in the additional local anesthesia group. Conclusion: Additional local anesthesia decreases the early postoperative pain levels and this possibly increases the patient satisfaction.;2016
Objective: We present our experience with a conservative costal harvesting to be used for patients undergoing secondary septorhinoplasty. Methods: Sixty-five patients who underwent revision septorhinoplasty requiring autogenous costal cartilage harvest performed by the senior author from 2005 to 2011 have been included in this retrospective study. Assessment of the outcomes includes harvesting time incision size availability of graft material and postoperative complications. Results: The mean operation time was 25 minutes. The incisions varied from 3 to 4 cm. Sufficient cartilage volume was harvested for the targeted purpose in all cases. No wound infection developed. One patient had pleural damage and no more major complications were noted. The patients suffered from mild pain. Postoperative scar was minimal. No deformity was observed in the donor site on postoperative analysis. Conclusions: The described technique is very safe and minimizes donor-site morbidity. In addition it allows the acquisition of nonepithelialized dermal graft and muscle fascia for soft tissue reconstruction.;2013
Objective:To compare the objective and subjective findings between patients who underwent nasal tip augmentation surgery via two different methods using autogenous auricular conchal cartilage.Materials and Methods:This study included the data of 21 patients who underwent nasal tip augmentation surgery. The patients were randomly divided in two groups according to the technique used to form a double layer columellar strut graft either face to face (group 1) and back to back (group 2). All patients were assessed via nasal obstruction symptom evaluation scale (NOSE) and via acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry at preoperative and postoperative 1st and 6th months.Results:There was statistically significant improvement in symptom score in both patient groups with no difference inbetween. Total nasal resistance decreased nonsignificantly at the end of 6th month in both groups 13.1Pa/cm(3) to 8.6Pa/cm(3) and 10.3Pa/cm(3) to 9.5Pa/cm(3) respectively. There was no significant increment in MCA values for both groups except left MCA1.Conclusions:We achieved good results in tip augmentation via both techniques. An autogenous conchal cartilage is a good alternative to replace lacking caudal septal cartilage. It provides safe and stable support to the nasal tip. However further comprehensive studies with larger sample size and long follow-up are required to elucidate any difference between these two techniques.;2015
Objectives Correction of crooked nose with long-term functional and aesthetic success remains a great challenge for rhinoplasty surgeons. The aim of this study was to present the aesthetic and functional results of the cross-spreader graft technique applied for the correction of I-shaped crooked nose. Methods A retrospective examination was made of 25 patients applied with open technique rhinoplasty using cross-spreader graft for the correction of I-shaped crooked nose between March 2016 and June 2019. The functional results of the patients were evaluated using the Nasal Obstruction Symptoms Evaluation scale. The Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation was used to evaluate the subjective aesthetic results and the external nose deviation angle was measured from the frontal aspect to evaluate the objective aesthetic results. Results Evaluation was made of 25 patients comprising 11 males and 14 females with a mean age of 26.64 +/- 7.08 years. The post-operative mean NOSE and ROE scores were significantly improved compared to the preoperative values (p<0.001). A statistically significant improvement was determined in the deviation angle values from preoperative to postoperative (p<0.001). Conclusion According to the current study functional and aesthetic results of the cross-spreader graft technique applied for the correction of I-shaped crooked nose this new technique appears to be an effective method for the treatment of I-shaped crooked nose deformity.;2021
Objectives The aim of this study was to observe the effect of the triamcinolone acetonide injections in thick skinned patients with ultrasonographic measurements and to compare these results with the postoperative nasal skin thickness of patients that were not injected with steroids. Methods A prospective study was planned with 42 thick nasal skinned rhinoplasty candidates in our clinic. Skin thickness of specific points along nose was measured and documented. On the 10th day after surgery triamcinolone acetonide injections were performed into the supratip region of 21 patients in the study group. No injections were made for the control group. Nasal ultrasonographic measurements were repeated 40 days after the surgery for all 42 patients by the same radiologist and results were evaluated. Results Seventeen women (40.5%) and 25 men (59.5%) were included in the study. Patients' ages ranged from 18 to 53 with an average age of 27.9. In study group all injections sites showed thinning on the 40th day after surgery. These findings were statistically significant at B (rhinion) D (middle of supratip) and G (middle of the tip). In the control group all injection sites except A (nasion) displayed thickening on the 40th day after surgery. These findings were statistically significant at B (rhinion) D (middle of supratip) H (left side of the tip) and J (left alar region). Conclusion Triamcinolone acetonide injections are effective in the prevention of edema and provide thinning of the post-rhinoplasty skin envelope.;2021
Objectives To investigate the causes of columellar scar formation in a Turkish population in relation to nasal skin thickness texture and type and discuss possible solutions for better results. Study Design Prospective clinical study. Setting Otorhinolaryngology department of a tertiary hospital. Methods The preoperative dermal thickness of 50 consecutive patients undergoing external approach septorhinoplasty was measured (using a 14 MHz ultrasound probe) at the midportion of the right and left nostril tip supratip and columella. Surgery was performed using a middle columellar gullwing incision. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 6 months after surgery. Assessment of the columellar scar was performed according to the Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale modified for columellar scars. The mean values of skin thickness measurements skin type (according to the Fitzpatrick skin classification scale) skin texture (oily combination normal dry and sensitive types) smoking habit and patient gender were recorded and compared with the columellar incision scar scores. Results There was no statistically significant difference in healing between the skin thickness of the tip supratip left nostril right nostril columella and mean skin thickness values skin types (Fitzpatrick 2 3 4 5) skin textures and smoking with regard to columellar scar formation (P > .05). However men healed significantly better than women (P < .05). Conclusions The columellar incision heals independently of the influence of skin thickness texture Fitzpatrick skin types 2 3 4 and 5 and smoking. Male gender seems to be a significant factor in healing.;2013
Objectives/Hypothesis: Numerous methods are used in the correction of deviated septal cartilage. One of these methods is to perform partial-thickness incisions (scoring) on the concave side of the deviated cartilage. In this retrospective report we present a series of patients who were treated by filling the scoring incision gaps with cyanoacrylate-based tissue adhesives to increase the effectiveness of scoring incisions and to maintain stability of the corrected concave cartilage segments. Study Design: A retrospective clinical study presenting a patient group who was treated using a new surgical method for septal deviation. Methods: Twenty-three patients with septum deviation and nasal deformity underwent surgery with the open rhinoplasty approach. Intra- or extracorporeal scoring incisions were performed on the concave side of the deviated septal cartilage and cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives were applied to the incisions of the corrected cartilage. After polymerization and hardening of the cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive the operation continued in the normal manner. Preoperative and postoperative clinical results and computed tomography images of the patients were assessed. Results: With a mean 24-month follow-up all patients with respiratory complaints related to deviated septum reported improvement in nose breathing. Clinical and radiologic observations showed that the corrected septum was stable in its new position. There were no complications arising from the use of cyanoacrylate. Conclusions: Cyanoacrylate is an effective instant safe method of treatment in correcting deviated septal cartilage with scoring incisions and filling the gaps of the incisions.;2011
Objectives/HypothesisDiced cartilage grafts are frequently used especially in rhinoplasty. The effect of sildenafil on the viability of diced cartilage grafts was investigated in this study. Study DesignAnimal experiment. MethodsAn approximate 2 x 2-cm cartilage graft was taken from the ears of 14 New Zealand rabbits diced to approximately 1-mm(3) dimensions then wrapped in muscle fascia taken from the right rear leg. These were then weighed and placed in prepared cavities on the backs of the rabbits. The animals were separated into two groups and although no procedure was applied to the control group a daily dose of 10 mg/kg sildenafil was administered orally to the sildenafil group. After 3 months the rabbits were sacrificed and the grafts were removed weighed and examined histopathologically. ResultsNo statistically significant difference was observed between groups with respect to graft weight. Histopathologically graft tissue viability was 85% in the sildenafil group and 41.43% in the control group which was determined to be statistically significant. A lower resorption rate and higher basophilia rate was observed in the sildenafil group (P<.05) compared with the control group. No statistically significant differences were determined between the groups with respect to calcification bone metaplasia inflammation or fibrosis. ConclusionsIndependent of surgical technique sildenafil may be clinically useful as a medical agent to enhance graft viability. Level of EvidenceNA Laryngoscope 125:E168-E172 2015;2015
Objectives/HypothesisDorsal nasal irregularities after trauma and various procedures such as excessive nasal hump resection are major problems for patients who have undergone rhinoplasty. Many grafts have been described for the correction of dorsal nasal irregularities. In this study we used an injectable implant in combination with diced or block cartilage grafts to test the efficacy of injectable calcium hydroxylapatite on the survival of diced or block cartilage grafts. Study DesignProspective controlled parallel group animal study. MethodsFourteen New Zealand white rabbits were used. Block cartilage and diced cartilage grafts alone and in combination with injectable calcium hydroxylapatite were placed subcutaneously in the rabbits' dorsal thoracolumbar region. On the 90th day following surgery the graft areas were extracted immediately after the rabbits were sacrificed. Pathological examination was conducted on all specimens. ResultsThe pathologic and histochemical findings were compared between groups. There was chronic inflammation observed in all of the groups. However none of the groups had metaplastic bone formation or calcification. The group that received diced cartilage in combination with the injectable implant received the highest scores for peripheral chondrocyte proliferation matrix collagen elastic fiber and proteoglycan content (P <0.05). A comparison of the block and diced cartilage grafts revealed that peripheral chondrocyte proliferation was more pronounced in the diced cartilage grafts (P <0.05). ConclusionThe use of calcium hydroxylapatite in combination with diced cartilage grafts does not have any long-term negative effects on chondrocyte viability.;2013
Objectives/HypothesisIn septorhinoplasty septal auricular and costal cartilage are often used as autologous graft. Autologous grafts are preferred in nasal reconstruction. The aim of this study was to histopathologically examine the tissue compatibility and the effect on the stability and cartilage vitality of poly-p-dioxanone (PDS) plates. Study DesignTen adult New Zealand rabbits were used. MethodsTen New Zealand rabbits were used. Septal and auricular cartilage sections were removed one of the two cartilage grafts was left plain and the other was sutured to a PDS plate. Grafts were placed into the back of the rabbits. After 12 weeks the graft material was examined microscopically. ResultsThe specimens did not cause any significant foreign body reaction. Within 3 months a significant degree of color stability and stiffness was lost. Microscopically inflammation necrosis and cartilage cell degeneration scores were statistically significantly lower in the grafts using PDS (P < .05) and the vascularization collagen and cartilage proliferation scores were found to be statistically significantly higher (P < .05). No statistically significant difference was determined in respect of the bone proliferation scores (P > .05). ConclusionsThe use of PDS plates together with cartilage provided mechanical support to the graft. Therefore changes that disrupt the integrity of the graft such as inflammation necrosis and cartilage cell degeneration were reduced and changes that provide greater stability such as vascularization collagen and cartilage proliferation were increased.

Objectives/HypothesisSeptorhinoplasty is one of the most commonly performed plastic surgery procedures in the world. Studies on septorhinoplasty in the literature mainly focus on the surgical procedures and their outcomes but the general appearance of the nose and nasal skin following surgery is also very important. Study DesignCase-control study examining 30 septorhinoplasty patients and 20 septoplasty patients for postoperative skin conditions. ResultsThere were significant differences identified between the septorhinoplasty group and the septoplasty group with respect to their mean preoperative Global Acne Grading System Seborrheic Dermatitis Area Severity Index and visual analog scores (acne seborrhea and ecchymosis). ConclusionsThe aim of study was to identify and evaluate postoperative skin conditions among septorhinoplasty patients as well as the progression and duration of treatment of these conditions.

Objectives/HypothesisThe objective of this study was to compare the viability of cartilage grafts embedded in platelet-rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) wrapped with no material (bare diced cartilage grafts) oxidized methylcellulose (Surgicel) or acellular dermal tissue (AlloDerm). Study DesignExperimental study. MethodsIn this study six New Zealand rabbits were used. Cartilage grafts including perichondrium were excised from each ear and diced into 2-mm-by 2-mm pieces. There were four comparison groups: 1) group A diced cartilage (not wrapped with any material) 2) group B diced cartilage wrapped with AlloDerm 3) group C diced cartilage grafts wrapped with Surgicel and 4) group D diced cartilage wrapped with PRFM. Four cartilage grafts were implanted under the skin at the back of each rabbit. All rabbits were sacrificed at the end of 10 weeks. The cartilages were stained with hematoxylin-eosin Masson's Trichrome and Orcein. After that they were evaluated for the viability of chondrocytes collagen content fibrillar structure of matrix and changes in peripheral tissues. ResultsWhen the viability of chondrocytes the content of fiber in matrix and changes in peripheral tissues were compared the cartilage embedded in the PRFM group was statistically significantly higher than in the other groups (P<0.05). ConclusionWe concluded that PRFM has significant advantages in ensuring the chondrocyte viability of diced cartilage grafts. It is also biocompatible with relatively lesser inflammation and fibrosis.;2015
Objectives/HypothesisTo show and compare the long-term inflammatory responses to subdermal microdroplet injections of 1000 centistoke (cS) and 5000 cS liquid injectable silicone (LIS) and to assess the applicability of insulin pen as an alternative LIS delivery device in an animal model. Study DesignAnimal study. MethodsEighteen healthy adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Two graft recipient sites and four injection sites were prepared on each rat's back for: 1) autogenous auricular cartilage graft 2) silicone sheet 3) 1000 cS LIS injection with insulin syringe 4) 1000 cS LIS injection with insulin pen 5) 5000 cS LIS injection with insulin syringe and 6) 5000 cS LIS injection with insulin pen. The animals were followed up for 6 months and skin biopsies were examined for the evaluation of LIS microdroplets in situ and the degree of inflammatory tissue response. Immunohistochemistry was used for the examination of macrophages and the density of microvessels. ResultsBiopsies from 17 animals were assessed. There was no statistically significant difference among the groups in terms of the number of lymphocytes (P=0.081) macrophages (P=0.857) and neutrophils (P=0.995) the degree of vascular proliferation (P=0.698) and the mean LIS microdroplet diameter (P=0.540). Grossly there was no sign of granuloma formation in any of the specimens. ConclusionThere is a low-grade well-tolerated long-term inflammatory response to microdroplet injections of 1000 cS and 5000 cS LIS that is comparable to autogenous cartilage graft in rats. Standard dose delivery devices such as insulin pens can be used for controlled LIS injections. Level of EvidenceN/A. Laryngoscope 124:E425-E430 2014;2014
Objectives: Congenital choanal atresia (CCA) is a very rare abnormality of the nose but in the case of bilateral presence it becomes a life-threatening malformation. Various surgical treatment options such as transpalatal transseptal and open rhinoplasty techniques as well as the transnasal approach have been defined for the repair of CCA. In this study the authors intended to evaluate the outcomes of transnasal endoscopic surgery for CCA and stent implementation's impact on surgical success. Methods: Patients who were admitted to the Otorhinolaryngology Department of Gaziantep University and patients who had not undergone CCA surgery before were included in the study. Patients who underwent transnasal endoscopic choanal atresia surgery (TECAS) were advised to have regular nasal endoscopic examinations performed at check-ups after a 6-month follow-up period surgical results were evaluated concerning whether stenosis had occurred or not. Results: Of the 48 patients who underwent TECAS after a minimum 6-month follow-up period 34 of patients revealed no stenosis so the overall surgical success rate was 70.8%. Fourteen (29.2%) patients who underwent TECAS developed stenosis and required revision surgery. Conclusions: Transnasal endoscopic choanal atresia surgery is the most preferred approach for CCA repair and has many advantages such as excellent vision shorter operative time minimal bleeding and minimum complication. Despite advances in endovision systems and surgical instruments stenosis is the most challenging problem after TECAS so new treatment strategies should be developed to prevent stenosis.;2017
Objectives: Correcting crooked nose deformity is one of the most difficult procedure in rhinoplastic surgery. For that reason the authors have been designed an asymmetrically pressing nasal splint. In this prospective study the aim was to compare the effects of applying asymmetrically pressing nasal splint and normal symmetrically splint on the crooked nose. Methods: This study included 129 patients who were operated on for crooked nose deformity. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Normal symmetrically pressing nasal splint was applied to groups 1a (I type) and 1b (C type). Asymmetrically pressing nasal splint was applied to groups 2a (I type) and 2b (C type). All groups were compared according to deflection angle from the midline the percentage of postoperative improvement patient satisfaction with visual analog scale and complication rate. Results: I-type noses in both groups at postoperative angle values were reduced and C-type noses in both groups at postoperative angle values were increased significantly compared with preoperative values. I-type noses of group 2 at postoperative angle values compared with group 1 were reduced and C-type noses were increased in group 2 significantly. Patient satisfaction rate in group 2 were significantly better than in group 1. The closeness ratios to the ideal angles in group 1 were in good and moderate levels whereas in group 2 it was in excellent level. There was no significant difference in complication rate in both groups. Conclusions: Asymmetrically pressing splint (novel design) showed increasing success rate clearly in crooked nose surgery than in normal splints.;2015
Objectives: Correcting nasal dorsal deformities and irregularities often requires biological or alloplastic materials. In rhinoplasty a frequent postoperative problem is a rough and rigid nasal dorsum. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the feasibility of using diced cartilage grafts wrapped in amniotic membrane for soft tissue augmentation. Methods: Diced cartilage grafts wrapped with amniotic membrane were transplanted to a subcutaneous tunnel that was made in the back in 20 rats. After 2 months the histopathologic changes that occurred in the grafts were examined by light microscopy. Results: When the diced cartilage grafts wrapped in amniotic membrane were examined each graft displayed different viability rates. Conclusions: In soft tissue augmentation especially in the nasal dorsum amniotic membrane can be used to keep the diced cartilage viable and adjoined.;2013
Objectives: Septoplasty is the most frequently performed surgical procedure in patients with nasal obstruction. However nasal obstruction may persist or recur after septoplasty in some patients. In this study the authors aimed to determine the causes of nasal obstruction after septoplasty. Methods: Fifty consecutive patients who admitted to our clinic with the complaints of persistent or recurrent nasal obstruction after primary septoplasty and had revision surgery between 2011 and 2015 were included in this study. Demographic data and physical examination findings of the patients were recorded. Results: There were 33 men (66%) and 17 women (34%) with a mean age of 37.3 +/- 10.5 (range 21-57) years. Deviation of perpendicular plate of ethmoid bone (44%) inferior turbinate hypertrophy (36%) concha bullosa (26%) caudal septal deviation-nostril asymmetry (20%) and alar collapse (6%) were the pathologies that were unaddressed during primary surgery. The iatrogenic causes of nasal obstruction after septoplasty were collumellar retraction-nasal tip ptosis (46%) nasal synechiae (20%) nasal septal perforation (10%) and saddle-nose/flat nose deformity (10%). Conclusions: Iatrogenic deformities due to surgery and pathologies ignored during primary surgery may cause persistent/recurrent nasal obstruction after primary septoplasty. A detailed physical examination and objective tests showing the site of nasal obstruction an extensive surgical plan that covers all diagnosed pathologies and a careful postoperative care must be undertaken to prevent undesired postoperative results.;2016
Objectives: The act of securing the septum to the midline is very important for the success of the operation during septoplasty and septorhinoplasty operations. The authors' aim in this study is to open a hole in the anterior nasal spine with the Piezoelectric drilling hole technique so as to fix the septum to the midline with a suture passing through that hole. Methods: Patients with anterior segmental deviation on whom we performed septoplasty or closed technique septorhinoplasty were included in the study. The patients were divided into 2 groups as the Classic and Piezo Groups. A total of 63 patients were included in the study in the Classic Group we performed septum fixation with suture of the nasal spine to the mucoperiosteum in 27 patients whereas in the Piezo Group fixation was performed on 36 patients using the piezo-surgical suture through a nasal spinal opening. Patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively by VAS and NOSE scores and also by postoperative examinations. Results: Preoperative and postoperative VAS-NOSE scores were found to be statistically significantly different in both groups (P<0.0001 P<0.0001). Redeviation with no need for revision surgery was reported to develop in 1 patient of the classical group (3.7%). Conclusion: Piezoelectric drilling hole technique provides stronger fixation in the midline and prevents postoperative redeviation. Its most important superiority over the other methods used in fixing the septum to the nasal spine is its ability to provide adequate stabilization without damaging soft tissue.;2019
Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a novel method for internal nasal valve reconstruction that enables lateralization of the superior segment of upper lateral cartilages (ULC) from the septum to a greater extent than the spreader graft method with lateral wall support. Study Design: Prospective controlled study set at a tertiary medical center. Methods: The study group was composed of 19 consecutive patients with pure internal nasal valve dysfunction who underwent surgery with the presented technique. All patients completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation (ROE) tests preoperatively and at 12th month postoperative control to compare functional and aesthetic outcomes. Results: Based upon pre- and postoperative calculations made using NOSE scores there was significant improvement regarding nasal blockage or congestion troubled breathing and sleeping and air through nose during exercise respectively (P < .05). There were no aesthetic changes encountered by the patient when pre- and postoperative ROE scores were compared (P > .05). Conclusions: The H shape of the graft not only improves the graft stability on dorsal septum but also has the advantage of combining the spreader and the splay effects. Current data from this prospective study suggest that this technique may be used in the surgical treatment of internal nasal valve dysfunction.;2011
Objectives: The nasal tip is the most prominent part of the nose. The aim of this paper is to review nasal tip grafts with detailed explanation and figures. Methods: The authors searched PubMed Google Google Scholar and Proquest Central database of the Kirikkale University. Search was performed with the key words of nasal'' tip'' graft.'' The indications and grafting techniques were presented. Results: The external shape of the nasal tip is determined by the curves and contours of the lower lateral cartilages and their interactions with the surrounding tissues. Normative data exist regarding the ideal shape and shadowing of the nasal tip. The mainly used tip grafts in rhinoplasty are Floating graft (Goldman)'' Tip Onlay Graft'' Columellar Strut Graft'' Caudal Septal Extension Graft'' Shield Graft'' Alar batten onlay graft'' Lateral Crural Strut Grafts'' Alar rim grafts.'' Conclusion: When tip sutures are not enough cartilage tip grafts offer a versitile and effective way to change the nasal tip. While there has been a vast array of grafting techniques described this paper reviewed many of the most popular and useful grafts in modern use.;2018
Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the viability of diced/crushed cartilage grafts wrapped in esterified hyaluronic acid (HYAFF) and Oxidized regenerated cellulose (Surgicel) with respect to macroscopic and microscopic parameters. Study Design: Experimental study. Methods: A total of 10 New Zealand rabbits were acquired for the study. Cartilage grafts were harvested from both ears with the ventral and dorsal perichondrial layers dissected off. There were six comparison groups in this experimental study: 1) bare diced cartilage 2) diced cartilage wrapped in Surgicel 3) diced cartilage wrapped in HYAFF 4) bare crushed cartilage 5) crushed cartilage wrapped in Surgicel 6) crushed cartilage wrapped in HYAFF. Six cartilage grafts were inserted into the six subcutaneous pockets of the same animal. All the rabbits were sacrificed at the end of 2 months the samples were collected and the total specimen was examined histopathologically. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome stain and examined under light microscopy. Results: There was a significant difference among the bare diced cartilage the Surgicel and the HYAFF groups with respect to fibrosis chronic inflammation cartilage mass and vascularization. A significant difference was observed among the bare crushed cartilage Surgicel and HYAFF groups with respect to fibrosis chronic inflammation and cartilage mass. There was no significant difference among the three groups regarding vascularization. Conclusions: This study suggests that wrapping cartilage grafts with Surgicel grossly reduces cartilage viability and the regeneration potential of the chondrocytes leading to fibrosis formation. On the other hand hyaluronic acid promotes cartilage integrity and survival thus increasing clinical predictability and avoiding the need for overcorrection.;2007
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the advantages of endoscopic lateral osteotomy to evaluate the effects of the periosteal elevation on ecchymosis and to search the reasons for the ecchymosis and the intranasal mucosal tears. Methods: On a randomly chosen side a subperiosteal tunnel was elevated on the other side a subperiosteal tunnel was not elevated. Bilateral lateral osteotomies were performed. Internal nasal packing was not used. The post-operative care was similar for all patients. The patients were evaluated on the third post-operative day. The intranasal mucosal tears the lateral osteotomy cut on the periosteal elevation side were examined using endoscopes. The degree of ecchymosis was determined by 2 other surgeons who were unaware of the elevated side using the grading system adapted from Hoffman et al. Results: The intranasal mucosal injury was seen in 16 of non-elevated side whereas it was 14 on the periosteal elevated side. Endoscopy showed the perforating arteries and elevation of the periosteum caused rupture and oozing from these arteries which might be a cause for ecchymosis. Ecchymosis was more severe on the side with subperiosteal tunnel in 6 patients whereas only in 2 patients it was more severe on the side with no subperiosteal tunnel elevation while in 12 patients the degree of ecchymosis was the same on both sides. Conclusion: Endoscopy gives a great opportunity to visualize the lateral osteotomy site. Besides the lateral osteotomy cut the arteries and the intranasal mucosal injury can be visualized. Periost elevation increases the severity of ecchymosis due to the rupture of the perforating arteries not due to the trauma of the angular artery. Intramucosal tears do not increase the severity of the ecchymosis.;2021
Objectives: The success of rhinoplasty may be compromised with postoperative problems like rough and rigid nasal dorsum. Biological grafts or alloplastic materials are required to hurdle and correct nasal dorsal deformities and also irregularities. The purpose of this experimental study was to compare pure cartilage graft cartilage graft wrapped in amniotic membrane and diced cartilage grafts wrapped in amniotic membrane for soft tissue augmentation. Methods: All grafts were transplanted through a subcutaneous tunnel created in the nasal dorsum of 18 rats 6 in each group. After 3 months follow-up the histopathological changes in all groups were evaluated by light microscopy and volumetric measurements. Results: With regard to cartilage viability cartilage wrapped in amniotic membrane had a higher success rate than pure cartilage graft. Also a further increased success rate was found in the diced group. Conclusions: In the soft tissue augmentation after rhinoplasty surgery especially diced cartilage wrapped in amniotic membrane keeps the graft viable and adjoined.;2016
Objectives: This study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the new graft technique-modified one-piece nasal cap with alar strut graft in rhinoplasty both for aesthetical appearance and nasal functions. Methods: Forty-two patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty operation with the new graft technique were evaluated visually by photographing and functionally by the Cottle test and rhinomanometry measurement. Results: All of the patients had sufficient nasal vision also nasal valve angles became wider and Cottle tests were negative in all patients after surgery. Postoperative nasal airflow values (both left and right) were significantly higher and airway resistance (left right and total) values were significantly lower than preoperative values. Conclusion: With the new graft technique the authors obtained both satisfying aesthetic results and intended functional improvement. This technique may be an alternative to combination of multiple graft techniques with advantages of practical performing and less complication risks.;2021
Objectives: This study was performed to evaluate the biocompatibility and tensile strength of two new polymeric materials - a polyfluoro ether modified thermoplastic polyurethane urea and a polydimethyl silicone elastomer in an experimental rabbit model. Methods: The two polymers were implanted inside separate subperichondrial pockets created over the auricular cartilages of 12 rabbits. A control pocket received no implant. After 3 months the animals were painlessly sacrificed and each site was analyzed histologically for vascular congestion acute and chronic inflammation and fibrosis in the tissue surrounding the implant materials. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in vascular congestion fibrosis or acute or chronic inflammation between the control sites and either implant site. Conclusions: These results suggest that the polymers are well accepted by the tissue and remain stable during the entire study period and that they could be very suitable materials for use in nasal reconstruction.;2013
Objectives: To determine the biomechanical characteristics of septal cartilage (SC) and costal cartilage (CC) taken from fresh cadavers using tensile testing and to establish CC graft material of a suitable thickness (ie with tensile characteristics closest to those of SC). Methods: Grafts of varying thickness were harvested from the central part of the seventh-rib CC and SC of 18 fresh cadavers. Tensile testing was performed with a 0.5-kilonewton load calibrated at 7 mm/min. The results were shown as a force-elongation curve. Results: No significant difference according to tensile force was observed between the SC group and the 1.0-mm and 1.5-mm CC groups (P=.09 and P=.32 respectively). However a significant difference was observed between the SC group and the 2.0-mm CC group (P=.04). Although the strength value of the CC group was 5.03 MPa the modulus of elasticity was 1.33 MPa. In the SC group the strength value was 12.42 but the modulus of elasticity was 1.39 MPa. The strength value of the SC group was higher than that of the CC group (P=.001) but the modulus of elasticity value of the CC group was higher than that of the SC group (P=.001). Conclusions: From the standpoint of tensile testing for preparing columellar struts 1.0-mm and 1.5-mm CC have similar characteristics to SC and thus can be used instead of it. However it is important to determine the thickness of CC by considering the expected characteristics of the established material and the forces that affect the area in the nose where the graft will be placed.;2011
Objectives: To review nasal alar support mechanisms introduce the concept of tractional forces on the nasal ala and describe a reconstructive technique to correct nasal tip deformities associated with weakened tractional force on the nasal ala. D esign: Photographic study and retrospective medical chart review. Results: We noted that patients with weakened support at the dome of the lower lateral cartilage had lateral alar deformities. Strengthening the cartilaginous deficiency improved the nasal appearance and function in 90% of patients. Conclusions: Deformities of the nasal tip are among the most difficult to correct. Tractional forces provided by dome strength help to maintain the ala in its normal anatomical position. Structural tip grafts restore the tractional force and thereby help to correct the alar deformity.;2006
Objectives: We investigated the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the pathogenesis of sinonasal polyps. Methods: Adult patients (21 men 3 women) with nasal polyposis underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Nine adults without polyps (6 men) who underwent septoplasty and/or rhinoplasty served as controls. Polyp specimens came from three regions: the maxillary sinus (10) ethmoid sinus (14) and nasal cavity (10). Control group samples (9) came from the inferior turbinate. Specimens were evaluated in eight mucosal layers for count and distribution of inflammatory cells and iNOS expression. An iNOS positivity index (PI) was determined for the epithelium (E) subepithelial layer of the lamina propria (SE) and deep paraglandular layer of the mucosa (D). Results: Polymorphonuclear cell (PMNC) % values of the ethmoid and maxillary sinus and overall ethmoid sinus PI were significantly higher in the polyp group. Patients with longer polyp duration D-perivascular (D-pv) and a higher Brinkmann index had decreased ethmoid sinus D Pis. However in older patients and patients with longer polyp duration perivascular PIs increased in maxillary sinus SE and D respectively. Furthermore as PMNC % and iNOS-PMNC PI increased SE_glandular and epithelial_apical iNOS values decreased. In the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses iNOS_D_endothelial values increased but decreased in the nasal cavity. Conclusions: iNOS may play a role in sinonasal polyp pathogenesis especially in mucosal SE and D layers. Increased vascular permeability stromal edema inflammatory cell migration into the stroma of the mucosa and increased mucosal gland secretion may result in polyp formation.;2013
Objectives: We sought to analyze and compare the problems and technical difficulties related to surgical intervention patient satisfaction and quality of life after primary and secondary rhinoplasties. Methods: A total of 168 cases of rhinoplasty were grouped as primary or secondary according to the patient's history of rhinoplasty. The type of nasal deformity the surgical approach and the difficulty of the surgery were recorded. The levels of patient satisfaction and the quality of life were assessed before and after the operation with the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation (ROE) and European Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaires. A quantitative and statistical analysis was performed. Results: Thirty-three patients had secondary rhinoplasty. and 135 patients had primary rhinoplasty. Relatively high rates of saddle nose deformity crooked nose and tip asymmetry were observed in the secondary rhinoplasty group. The preoperative and postoperative scores on the ROE and EQ-5D questionnaires demonstrated statistically significant differences in both the primary and secondary rhinoplasty groups. The comparison of postoperative change between the primary and secondary rhinoplasty groups did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference. Conclusions: The surgical difficulty of secondary rhinoplasty is approximately twice that of primary rhinoplasty because of the high rate of major deformities. However the levels of patient satisfaction and improvements in quality of life are similar after primary and secondary rhinoplasties.;2012
Oculonasal synkinesis is the simultaneous contraction of the orbicularis oculi and the compressor narium minor muscles. The etiology of this phenomenon is still unclear congenital and traumatic reasons are considered to be responsible. Here we report a case of oculonasal synkinesis.

Oedema and ecchymose are frequent morbidities of septorhinoplasty a facial surgical procedure for reforming the shape and functions of the nose. Periorbital oedema (PO) and periorbital ecchymose (PE) are normal occurrences but are undesirable for patients undergoing the procedure for aesthetic purposes. The present study examined 65 patients who underwent open technique septorhinoplasty for aesthetic and functional complaints. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 patients underwent lateral osteotomy following tip plasty at the end of the surgical operation Group 2 patients underwent lateral osteotomy before tip plasty at the beginning of the surgical operation. Patients were followed on the postoperative first third and seventh days. PO and PE values of patients were scored from 0 to 4. The plastering time (Pt) was significantly shorter for Group I than Group II (p < 0.05). The total surgical time (T) showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). The PO value at the first third and seventh days was significantly smaller for Group I than Group II (p < 0.05). The PE value at the first third and seventh days was also significantly smaller for Group I than Group II (p < 0.05). The obtained data indicate that performing a lateral osteotomy in the final stages of surgery and subsequently applying a nasal plaster and splint as rapidly as possible decreases PO and PE in the postoperative period.;2016
One of the most important components of an attractive nasal tip is the cephalocaudally conical form of the dome at the sagittal plane. With respect to this fact the author tried to design a new forceps which holds the dome in a convex shape on a transverse plane and cephalocaudally conical in shape on the sagittal plane. Before grasping the dome in the desired position with Anais Cerci forceps some degree of lateral steal is suggested and can be performed to increase the tip rotation and projection. With the help of its specific shape and template forming function this novel instrument may also help to prevent the excess strain of transdomal suture which is crucially important to prevent the formation of pinching. This newly designed forceps can also help to provide the opportunity of the required acute angle between two domes. Slight oblique grasping of the dome reciprocally provides nice acute angle between 2 domes. Additionally this forceps may also help to provide formation of symmetrically and reciprocally designed dome curvatures. In several secondary rhinoplasty cases with highly destroyed lower lateral cartilages septal auricular or costal cartilages are used for alar reconstruction. Mimicking the lower lateral cartilage anatomy from a straight cartilage graft piece is not an easy way of restoration. In such cases Anais Cerci forceps may facilitate reshaping of the dome from an amorphous cartilage graft.;2020
Open and closed approaches for rhinoplasty have individual advantages and disadvantages however the resultant columellar scar of the open approach is directly considered as a disadvantage. This study focuses on the columellar scar awareness and its implications on overall satisfaction of the patients after open rhinoplasty. A total of 91 patients who have undergone open rhinoplasty were included in this study. A written questionnaire algorithm consisting of 4 sequential questions was applied. Except for the first question [Do you have any scar(s) caused by any trauma operation or any other reason on your face?] every question was answered on a scale from 1 to 5. The respondents were given the 25-question Modified Body Cathexis Scale (MBCS)and their scars graded using the Columellar Scar Assessment Scale (CSAS). The data were statistically interpreted. Of the 91 open rhinoplasty patients 12 of them responded with a yes to the first question reporting their columellar scars. There was no significant difference with regards to patient satisfaction regarding these patients (p > 0.05). However those who reported the scar yielded a significantly lower MBCS scores. 9 patients declared that they exerted effort to conceal their scars. Those who concealed their scars and those who did not yielded a significant difference in patient satisfaction. The CSAS scores of those who reported the columellar scar were significantly higher than those who did not. Our study suggests that MBSC can be a valuable tool for determining the impact of outcomes from the patient's standpoint and awareness of the columellar scar is not related to patient satisfaction but with bodily perception.;2017
Open technique septorhinoplasty (SRP) provides better surgical control and stronger anatomical assessment however one of its biggest disadvantages is postoperative columellar scar. In this study the authos aimed to compare the absorbable polyglactin 910 (PG) (Vicryl Rapide 6/0 Ethicon Inc.) and nonabsorbable polypropylene (PP) (Prolene 6/0 Ethicon Inc.) suture materials and their effects on the postoperative columellar scar. In this study 89 patients (61 females and 28 males) who underwent primary open technique SRP were included 42 patients were included in the PP group and 47 were included in the PG group. Sutures were removed in PP group on 7th postoperative day. Sutures were left to be absorbed in the PG group. Columellar scar was assessed with visual analog scale (VAS) subjectively and with the modified Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSES) objectively in 6th postoperative month. SBSES results in PG and PP groups were 3.88 +/- 0.80 and 3.67 +/- 0.80 respectively. There was no statistical significance between the two groups (p=0.352). VAS results in PG and PP groups were 8.04 +/- 0.91 and 7.71 +/- 0.85 respectively. There was no statistical significance between the two groups (p=0.200). No postoperative wound infection was seen in either of the groups. PG delivers good postoperative results in columellar scar. We recommend using PG for columellar incision closure since it provides less discomfort and anxiety for the patient and less office time for the surgeon during the suture removal.;2017
Orbital complications of rhinoplasty show a wide range from minor complications like periorbital edema and ecchymosis to severe complications like blindness. Also subconjunctival ecchymosis is one of the orbital complications due to rhinoplasty. A prospective Study was set out to assess the incidence and progresssion of subconjunctival ecchymosis and to find out mechanisms of this complication. The incidence of subconjunctival ecchymosis was found to be 19.1%. Typically it appeared unilaterally or bilaterally over the temporal subconjunctival area in the first two days after the operation. Complete resolution of subconjunctival ecchymosis took approximately 11 +/- 3 days. No other ocular symptoms were found. Subconjunctival ecchymosis only prolonged the recovery period of the patient from the rhinoplasty.;2001
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare hereditary disorder of collagen synthesis that results in weak bones that are easily fractured resulting in deformities. Osteogenesis imperfecta refers to a wide array of genetic disorders with variable phenotypic presentation. In general type I is the mildest form of disease types IV III and II respectively increase in severity. There is lack of knowledge about the feasibility of nasal surgery in patients with bony disorders in the literature. Although rhinoplasty is one of the most frequent procedures all over the world there are only very few case reports about OI patients undergoing rhinoplasty. The authors could find 2 old case reports published in 1965 and 1977. The only recent publication that could be found was published in 2000 but it was about a follow-up case that had been operated 15 years ago. A 24-year-old woman with OI who has been operated on because of severe airway obstruction and cosmetic reasons is presented. Open rhinoplasty was performed keeping in mind that bones and cartilages are more fragile and they heal late in OI. Therefore greenstick fractures were preferred instead of median osteotomies and cartilages were fixed to each other at multiple points with nonabsorbable sutures. There were no complications in the postoperative period and the patient was very satisfied with her breathing and appearance. Current literature is reviewed in accordance with our experience with this unique case. In conclusion good cosmetic and functional rhinoplasty results may be obtained in OI cases with careful case selection limited mobilization of the nasal bones and careful fixation of the nasal cartilages with nonabsorbable sutures.;2010
Osteomas are located mostly in the mandible followed by paranasal sinuses such as frontal sinuses ethmoid air cells maxillary sinuses and rarely based on nazal cavitiy or turbinate. The osteoma located on outside of nazal bone is extremely rare. The authors report an unusual patient of nasal bone osteoma associated with aesthetic problem on nasal dorsum. Outer side of nasal bone osteoma in large diameter causes aesthetic problems. The authors believe that open rhinoplasty approach is successful in this type of patients.;2017
Our aim for this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes in patients who underwent lateral osteotomy with a Piezosurgery device or a conventional osteotome in open-technique rhinoplasty. This cohort trial involved 65 patients (36 women and 29 men average age: 23.6 +/- 5.71 yr) whounderwent surgery between May 2015 and January 2016. Piezosurgery was used for lateral osteotomy in 32 patients whereas 33 patients underwent conventional external osteotomy. These 2 groups were compared for duration of surgery perioperative bleeding postoperative edema ecchymosis pain and patient satisfaction on the first and seventh postoperative days. The Piezosurgery group revealed significantly more favorable outcomes in terms of edema ecchymosis and hemorrhage on the first day postoperatively (p < 0.001 for all). Similarly edema (p = 0.005) and ecchymosis (p < 0.001) on the seventh postoperative day also were better in the Piezosurgery group. Hemorrhage was similar in both groups on the seventh postoperative day (p = 0.67). The Piezosurgery group not only experienced less pain on the first postoperative day (p < 0.001) but these patients also were more satisfied with their results on both the first and seventh postoperative days. Results of the present study imply that Piezosurgery may be a promising safe and effective method for lateral osteotomy a critical step in rhinoplasty. The time interval necessary for the learning curve is counteracted by the comfort and satisfaction of both patients and surgeons.;2017
Over the past 60 years many surgical techniques have been developed for the repair of nasoseptal perforations. This study describes a safe and practical technique involving the 5-layer repair of symptomatic nasoseptal perforations without mucosal flaps. The present study involved 23 patients (17 men and 6 women) who had symptomatic nasoseptal perforations in the Otorhinolaryngology and Head Neck Surgery Department of Haseki Research and Training Hospital. Patients were treated using the mucosal regeneration technique. Follow-up examinations were performed at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. The surgery was considered successful if total closure was achieved. Nasal mucosal physiology was also assessed preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively by measuring the nasal mucociliary clearance time by means of the saccharin test. The most common etiological factor was former nasal surgery (56.5%) followed by nasal trauma (26%). In 4 patients (17.5%) the perforations were idiopathic. The average preoperative perforation size was 1.74 +/- 0.87 cm. Total closure of the perforation was achieved in 21 patients (91.3%) and only 2 patients had subtotal healing. The mean preoperative mucociliary clearance time was 19.3 +/- 4.15 minutes which significantly improved to 12.4 +/- 3.53 minutes and 10.1 +/- 3.21 minutes at 3 and 6 postoperative months respectively. Mucosal regeneration technique with interpositional grafts can be used to safely and reliably repair medium-to-large nasoseptal perforations.;2014
Paget-Schroetter syndrome is a rare clinical condition characterized by subclavian vein thrombosis following repetitive upper extremity effort. In this case we presented a 35-year-old female patient who underwent septorhinoplasty in our clinic. A swelling of the left part of the neck extending to the clavicle was detected 4 hours after the operation. Computed tomography of the thorax revealed a pleural effusion at the base of the left lung and a computed tomography angiogram demonstrated a recanalized left subclavian vein thrombosis. History of the patient clarified that she had moved to another house and had lifted heavy furnitures 4 days before the surgery. The patient was diagnosed with Paget Schroetter syndrome followed by chylothorax. Paget-Schroetter syndrome followed by chylothorax could be presented after a surgical intervention of the head and neck. Early diagnosis is essential to reduce the risk of ongoing morbidity and mortality.;2021
Paramedian forehead flap is a workhorse for nasal reconstruction. However vascular complications may lead to flap failure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the blood flow objectively and determine the hemodynamic changes in paramedian forehead flap with respect to influential factors of age gender and smoking. Thirty patients who had paramedian forehead flap were followed up prospectively between 2010 and 2013. The blood flow was assessed by resistance index using Color Duplex-Doppler Ultrasonography. Resistance index was measured at the proximal and distal ends of each flap on the postoperative first day first week and second week. All data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows. Fifteen patients were female and the mean of age was 60.9 years. Our results demonstrated statistically significant differences with gradual decreases in resistance to blood flow when the resistance index values at the proximal and distal ends of paramedian forehead flap were compared (P<0.001 and P<0.001). Age gender and smoking did not have a negative impact on the resistance index values of paramedian forehead flap. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study in which resistance in blood flow and hemodynamic changes of paramedian forehead flap were objectively determined using Color Duplex-Doppler Ultrasonography. The resistance index gradually decreases although it is considerably high at the early postoperative interval. Age gender and smoking do not adversely influence the blood flow in a welldesigned paramedian forehead flap.;2018
Patient: Male 27 Final Diagnosis: Postoperatif healing Symptoms: Feeling of foreign body on the nasal tip Medication: - Clinical Procedure: Minor intervention and follow-ups Specialty: Otolaryngology Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Septorhinoplasty is a frequent surgical procedure used for both cosmetic and functional purposes. The technique varies from surgeon to surgeon and according to which suture material is used. While some surgeons prefer non-absorbable sutures others prefer sutures with delayed absorption. These materials sometimes protrude from the skin and they may cause skin reactions. While these reactions are common in the late period a skin reaction in the early period because of polydioxanone suture is extremely rare and to the best of our knowledge this is the first such reported case in the literature. Case Report: A 25-year-old male patient underwent endonasal septorhinoplasty procedure with endo-tracheal general anesthesia. We hereby present the skin reaction because of frequently used polydioxanone suture on the 24th postoperative day and the management of this patient. We cut the suture at skin level and prescribed antibiotherapy and we scheduled a follow-up for 10 days afterwards. The patient had no complaint and the control examination result was normal. Conclusions: When performing septorhinoplasty operations very rare complications of the procedure shouldn't be ignored and an informed consent must be obtained after explaining possible complications before the operation. This approach is important for increasing the patient compliance and proper follow-up for the patient. This way especially post-operative early complications as our case will be able to be solved with close follow-up and intervention before causing permanent damage. The relationship between patient who underwent rhinoplasty and the physician also has an important role on these follow-up visits.;2015
Patients perceive the pulling of a nasal splints as the most feared and stressful part of nasal surgery. Even the incisions made for alar base surgery can partly or entirely dehisce. So we have been using modified Doyle silicone splints. We compared the modified Doyle silicone splints with conventional Doyle silicone splint. Included in the study were 64 patients undergoing alar base surgery together with open septorhinoplasty. Group 1 (n = 32) patients received a conventional Doyle intranasal silicone splint and group 2 (n = 32) received modified splint that we call a hemi-split Doyle splint. The pain felt by the patients during the removal of the splints was recorded according to the visual analogue scale (VAS). On days two and four postoperatively the nasal stuffiness score (NOSE) was recorded. On day four postoperatively an intranasal examination was conducted to establish if dehiscence had occurred on the alar base incision line. In group 2 the pain scores during splints removal were significantly lower than those in group 1. Whereas no dehiscence on the alar base incision line was observed after tampon removal in group 2 the incision dehisced in eight patients in group 1. The NOSE scores on postoperative days two and four showed no difference between the groups. The hemi-split Doyle splint causes less pain during removal and particularly does not lead to dehiscence of incisions made during alar base surgery in rhinoplasty patients.;2017
Periorbital and subcutaneous emphysema after transnasal endoscopic surgery are rare. Periorbital emphysema has been reported after facial trauma dental interventions procedures such as endoscopic sinus surgery and rhinoplasty and due to medications such as systemic steroids. Although very rare it may require urgent intervention because of the risk of increased intraocular pressure and impaired blood supply to the globe. The otolaryngology department requested ophthalmology consultation for a 65-year-old male patient who had severe periorbital emphysema of the right eye the day after endoscopic nasal polypectomy due to severe coughing and straining. Crepitus was detected on skin palpation and immediate intervention was performed by passing a 21-gauge needle through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue of the upper and lower eyelids to evacuate the subcutaneous air. The patient's clinical symptoms resolved with no postoperative complications.;2019
Permanent correction of septal deformities is one of the most difficult and controversial subjects in aesthetic nasal surgery. The main reasons for failure in most of the corrective procedures are either not to weaken the septal cartilage enough to straighten it or to treat the septum too radically causing iatrogenic deformities or predisposing it to new deformities postoperatively. Our approach to correct septal deformities relies on the principle of strengthening/reinforcing the septal cartilage (with or without some weakening maneuvers to correct the deformities beforehand) with application of titanium hemoclips at some critical locations in septum. Eighty-seven patients operated on between 2007 and 2009 are included in this study. Thirty-six of these patients had combined septo-nasal deformities while the remaining 51 had solely septal deformities. In 30 patients with septo-nasal deformity the technique was proven to be successful. The remaining 6 patients of this group had axial nasal deformity (rather than intrinsic septal problems) and did not respond to our technique successfully. Within four years of follow up we did not encounter any recurrences infections ulcerations or exposure in the mucosa covering the titanium clips. None of the titanium clips were required to be removed for any reasons. (C) 2011 British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Photography for preoperative analysis and follow-up is indispensable for the facial plastic surgeon. The use of strobe flash units light-emitting diode (LED) lamps and their position related to axis of the patient can affect the nasal contours and nasal measurements. The aim of this study was to compare the rhinoplasty pictures taken under three different lighting settings and two different positioning at 30- and 45-degree angles and with direct measurements taken by caliper from the subjects. Standardized rhinoplasty pictures from 10 patients were taken in frontal view in a studio. These pictures were taken under three different lighting settings: built-in flash of the camera two strobe flashes and two LED continuous lights placed at 30 to 45 degree angles to the patient. All the pictures were uploaded to Rhinobase 2.0. In five subjects direct measurements were done by using a Vernier caliper and compared with the computer measurements. In this study when comparing the light sources and the angles without taking single flash into account no relation was found between strobe lights at 30 and 45 degrees and between LED lights at 30 and 45 degrees regarding tip width base bony width dorsum width interalar width and nasal length. However a statistically significant difference was found when the angle was changed from 30 to 45 degrees for tip width interalar width and nasal length. The use of two LED continuous lights or two strobe lights in a studio setting has given similar results. Changing the angles of the light sources from 30 to 45 degrees affected only the tip width and the interalar width otherwise the rest of the nasal measurements did not show any significant changes. The pictures taken at 45-degree angles to the subject showed the closest values to the direct measurements done on the patient;2021
Pilonidal sinuses are recurrent chronic inflammatory lesions which may occur due to penetration of hair particles into skin. Herein the authors report a pilonidal sinus case that is unusually seen on nasal dorsum and totally excised with the open technique rhinoplasty method. A 20-year-old male patient was admitted to the authors' outpatient clinic with complaints of dysmorphism and discharge from nasal dorsum. Physical examination revealed a swelling in nasal dorsum and hair-containing fistula. Excision was performed with an open rhinoplasty approach. Histo-pathology examination revealed pilonidal sinus. While pilonidal sinus is usually located in sacro-coccygeal region it may also be seen in atypical localizations like nasal dorsum. Although the prediagnosis of a hair-containing lesion usually includes dermoid cyst pilonidal sinus should also be considered and histo-pathological examination should certainly be performed. It is a problematic condition when it is symptomatic however management and treatment of the disease is easy when correct diagnosis is made.;2018
Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting is one of the most common problems after implementation of general anesthesia. The incidence can reach 80% in high-risk patients depending on the type of surgery. In our study we aimed to compare dexamethasone-dimenhydrinate and dexamethasone-ondansetron combinations in prevention of nausea and vomiting in postoperative patients. Sixty 18-65-year-olds ASAI-II females who underwent rhinoplasty were included in the study. Patients were randomly included in two groups: Dexamethasone-dimenhydrinate group (group DD) and dexamethasone-ondansetron group (group DO). All patients received dexamethasone 8 mg iv after endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia continuation was established with sevoflurane air-oxygen mixture and remifentanil infusion. At the 30th minute of the operation group DO received ondansetron 4 mg iv and group DD received dimenhydrinate 1 mg/kg iv. For postoperative analgesia tramadol (1.5 mg/kg) iv tenoksikam (20 mg) and afterward for postoperative patient-controlled tramadol was used. In the postoperative recovery room nausea and vomiting were evaluated at the 30th 60th 120th minutes and at the end of 24 h. Total amount of tramadol was recorded. All results were statistically evaluated. Demographics and Apfel risk scores of both groups were similar. Surgical operation duration (p = 0.038) and total preoperative remifentanil consumption were higher in group DD (p = 0.006). In group DO nausea at 30 and 60 min (p = 0.001 p = 0.007) retching at 30 and 60 min (p = 0.002 p = 0.006) were higher than group DD. The additional antiemetic need in group DO was significantly higher at 30 min (p = 0.001). Postoperative analgesic consumption was similar in both groups. Our study revealed that dexamethasone-dimenhydrinate combination was more effective than dexamethasone-ondansetron in prevention of nausea and vomiting after rhinoplasty operations.

Powered instruments have been introduced into otorhinolaryngology practice over the last decade. These instruments were accepted immediately by many institutions and continuing development has led to the current use of microdebriders in a variety of surgical procedures in otorhinolaryngology. In clinical rhinology they were first used in endoscopic sinus surgery to facilitate working on deep planes but have subsequently been adopted in various conditions. This article presents an evaluation of the use of microdebriders in common rhinological disorders.;2010
Preservation rhinoplasty is a new way to reshape the nose by preserving the dorsum nasal ligaments soft tissue envelope and muscles. This new concept provides the opportunity to achieve a more natural aesthetic and functional result. To achieve a good aesthetic and functional outcome while maintaining surgical safety knowledge of the relevant anatomy is key. This is especially true for the preservation rhinoplasty technique where a firm grasp of the anatomy of the nasal soft tissue and bony-cartilaginous framework is critical. The preservation technique is made more accessible by the open approach which provides an opportunity for the deformity to be clearly visualized from the tip of the nose and the dorsum. Furthermore tip plasty is easier to perform under direct vision which is an advantage of the open approach. The goal of this article is therefore to make clear all the important anatomical structures and their relevance to the surgical steps taken when performing the open preservation rhinoplasty technique.;2021
Prevention of unfavorable sequelae following humpectomy in reduction rhinoplasty by restoration of the middle nasal vault complex today has become imperative in the majority of patients with perhaps the exception of small humps. In general the techniques used for preservation and reconstruction of these important anatomical structures can be divided into two main categories: spreader graft and spreader flap techniques. Oversimplified spreader graft techniques require donor cartilage whereas spreader flap techniques use the excess height of the medial portion of the upper lateral cartilages in patients with a cartilaginous hump. In principle both donor cartilage and preserved upper lateral cartilages usually are positioned along both sides of the dorsal septum to provide natural and harmonious contours as well as to avoid functional impairment (valve collapse). However the considerable number of publications on this topic attests to existing downsides of both surgical principles. To overcome these shortcomings we illustrate additional modifications in the application of spreader grafts as well as spreader flaps. However the main goal of this article is to provide an algorithm helping to decide which technique is best suited to meet the requirements of each individual patient.;2016
Projection of the nasal tip is among the most important aspects of the nose. In this article a wide spectrum of techniques are presented that allow the rhinoplasty surgeon to decrease maintain or increase nasal tip projection. Rhinoplasty surgeons must be adept with suture techniques lower lateral cartilage overlay techniques and structural grafting to be able to achieve excellent long-term results.;2016
Purpose In this study we proposed a sliced-partial thickness cartilage graft for nasal contour restoration purposes and compared the long-term graft survival and histological changes of sliced crushed and intact cartilage grafts. Methods Nasal septal and auricular cartilage grafts were harvested from 8 rabbits. Sliced crushed or intact cartilage grafts were measured in thickness with a micrometer and re-implanted. 4 months later specimens were histologically evaluated and thickness were measured. Results Both nasal septal and auricular crushed cartilage lost significantly more chondrocytes than sliced samples together with fibrosis multiple fracture lines and even ossification. Sliced and intact cartilages were histologically similar except sliced cartilage had some minor changes limited to its cut surface. Sliced cartilages retained their thickness histology and structural properties in the long term similar to intact cartilages whereas -contrary to expectations- crushed specimens had significantly higher thickness measurements at the end of 4 months. Conclusion Sliced cartilage grafts prepared with an atraumatic cartilage slicer are an ideal camouflaging material with its uniform thickness and malleability. Crushed cartilages seemingly getting thicker without histological findings could be explained by lower than actual initial measurements due to its structural weakness and getting squeezed when the standard pressure of the micrometer was applied.;2021
Purpose It is important to reinforce nasal tip support for long-term satisfactory results. Two workhorses of tip support are strut grafting and the tongue-in-groove technique. Tongue-in-groove causes retraction and stiffness the strut causes loss of rotation and projection of tip. We introduced a novel technique that avoids these consequences. Methods Between February 2018-February 2019 40 female underwent primary rhinoplasty. Mean age: 27 years (18-41 years). Follow-up:1-2 years. In first group (20 patients) caudal septum was resected and strut was not fixated to caudal septum. In second group (20 patients) tongue-like extension (septal autoextension) was preserved at caudal septum and sutured to strut. Preoperative peroperative and postoperative images were compared. Results Tip projection ratio calculations nasolabial angle measurements were evaluated by statistical analyses. The change in projection ratios between peroperative period and 1-year postoperative period of strut-only group was higher than septal autoextension group (p = 0.001). This result indicates that nasal tip projection loss in strut-only group was higher compared to septal autoextension group. The change in nasolabial angle measurements from peroperative period to 1-year postoperative period differed significantly between two groups (p = 0.001). Significant difference was observed between 1-year postoperative nasolabial angle measurements of two groups (p = 0.006) septal autoextension group measurements were higher than strut-only group. These results showed that fixation of strut graft to the septal autoextension provides better preservation of the nasolabial angle and stabilization of nasal tip projection. Conclusion Fixation of septum and strut graft through septal autoextension provides satisfactory stabilization of tip projection and rotation without stiffness or rigidity.;2020
Purpose of review To review recent studies on nasal osseocartilaginous anatomy osteotomy techniques and contemporary methods of nasal bone reshaping carried out under direct vision. Recent findings Current cadaver studies on osseocartilaginous vault anatomy osteotomy techniques provide valuable information that can reduce outcome variability and increase reliability of osteotomies. Nevertheless osteotomes have limitations and contemporary approaches - namely piezoelectric instrumentations osteoectomy and osteotomy carried out under direct vision - can provide valuable solutions to certain shortcomings. Contrary to widespread understanding extended wide periosteal dissection is the common thread in newly introduced methods which claim enhanced control reduced soft tissue trauma and reproducible results. Comparative and cadaver studies show promising results regarding protection of underlying mucosa reduced comminuted fractures reduced postoperative ecchymosis and edema. Summary Improvements in nasal bone reshaping are promising for better esthetic and functional outcomes. Nevertheless these approaches need to be validated by randomized controlled trials and test of time before being incorporated in routine surgical practice.;2016
Purpose Rhinoplasty is one of the most common and challenging plastic surgery procedures. Facial analysis is a crucial step in planning. Utilizing three-dimensional (3D) model of a patient's face is an emerging way of performing facial analysis. This paper evaluates the agreement and reliability of facial measurements taken using a web app located at digitized-rhinoplasty.com that utilizes 3D models of the patient's face. Methods Eleven measurements were calculated on 16 human subjects. Three methods of measurements were performed: direct measurements on human subjects' faces measurements on 2D photographs and measurements on 3D models of face scans. The Bland-Altman plot is used for testing the agreement between the web app and the well-known Blender 3D modeling software. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability was calculated and compared for 2D and 3D methods using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) method. The statistical analysis methods were checked for the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions. Results The results indicate that the web app and Blender software show agreement within 95% confidence limits. The web app performs well in intra-rater and inter-rater reliability statistical analysis. The web app's reliability scores are consistently better than facial analysis software which was found highly reliable in a previous study. We also compare the methods of measurements in terms of time ease of use and cost. Conclusion The utilization of 3D computer modeling for facial analysis has its advantages and started to become more common due to recent advances in technology. The web app utilizes 3D face scans for pre-operative planning and post-operative evaluation of facial surgeries. The web app performs well in agreement and inter-/intra-reliability analysis and performs consistently better than software that works utilizing 2D photographs. The web app provides accurate repeatable affordable and fast facial measurements for facial analysis when compared to direct and 2D methods.;2021
Purpose Rhinoplasty is one of the most common and challenging plastic surgery procedures. The results of the operation have a significant impact on the facial appearance. The planning is critical for successful rhinoplasty surgery. In this paper we present a web application designed for preoperative rhinoplasty surgery planning. Methods The application uses the three-dimensional (3D) model of a patient's face and facilitates marking of an extensive number of facial features and auto-calculation of facial measurements to develop a numerical plan of the surgery. The web application includes definitions illustrations and formulas to describe the features and measurements. In addition to the existing measurements the user can calculate the distance between any two points the angle between any three points and the ratio of any two distances. We conducted a survey among experienced rhinoplasty surgeons to get feedback about the web application and to understand their attitude toward utilizing 3D models for preoperative planning. Results The web application can be accessed and used through any web browser at digitized-rhinoplasty.com. The web application was utilized in our tests and also by the survey participants. The users successfully marked the facial features on the 3D models and reviewed the auto-calculated measurements. The survey results show that the experienced surgeons who tried the web application found it useful for preoperative planning and they also think that utilizing 3D models is beneficial. Conclusions The web application introduced in this paper helps analyzing the patient's face in details utilizing 3D models and provides numeric outputs to be used in the rhinoplasty operation planning. The experienced rhinoplasty surgeons that participated to our survey agree that the web app would be a beneficial tool for rhinoplasty surgeons. We aim to further improve the web application with more functionality to help surgeons for preoperative planning of rhinoplasty.;2020
Purpose Septorhinoplasty is performed in combination with septoplasty and rhinoplasty operations and is characterized by severe postoperative pain. The aim of this study is to evaluate preemptive effects of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen and IV paracetamol on opioid consumption and pain scores after open septorhinoplasty. Methods The study included 150 patients who had undergone elective open septorhinoplasty. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups Group Control (Group C n = 50) received 100 ml saline solution Group Paracetamol (Group P n = 50) received 1000 mg IV paracetamol in 100 ml solution and Group Ibuprofen (Group I n = 50) received 800 mg IV ibuprofen in 100 ml saline before surgery. Postoperative analgesia was achieved by opioid administration via patient-controlled analgesia. Visual analog scores (VASs) postoperative opioid consumption additional analgesic requirements and side effects were recorded. Results Compared with Group C VASs in Group P and Group I were statistically lower at all time points (p < 0.05). VAS was lower in Group I than in Group P at postoperative 1st and 6th hours (p < 0.05). Opioid consumption in Group C was highest in all groups at all time periods (p < 0.05). At the 0-6 and 6-12 time intervals total opioid consumption was significantly lower in Group I compared to Group P (p < 0.05). Total opioid consumption was highest in Group C (p < 0.05). Conclusions This study has indicated that ibuprofen has more analgesic effect than paracetamol during first 12 h but there is a non-inferiority between ibuprofen and paracetamol after first 12 h.;2018
Purpose The aim of this study is to review the aesthetic and functional outcomes of septorhinoplasty using questionnaires that have never been collectively used as well as surgeons' evaluation. Materials and methods Our study was conducted prospectively among 100 patients who underwent septorhinoplasty operation. We evaluated the effects of septorhinoplasty's functional and aesthetic outcomes on patients' emotional status using a combination of NOSE ROE DAS-24 and GBI questionnaires as well as surgeons' evaluations. Results Our study did not detect any significant difference between preoperative and postoperative levels of patient satisfaction with regard to age sex and surgery type and the number of surgeries. Our study on the other hand revealed significantly higher postoperative GBI scores among patients with higher preoperative DAS-24 and NOSE scores. However we showed no significant difference between the preoperative ROE score and postoperative GBI score Conclusion This study demonstrated that septorhinoplasty can not only significantly alter a nose's functional and aesthetic appearance but it can also boost patient satisfaction.;2021
Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between preoperative patient expectation and postoperative patient expectation coverage rates and patient satisfaction. Methods 183 patients who underwent SRP for various reasons were divided into 6 groups according to surgical indication and the postoperative Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation Scale (ROE). The groups were evaluated in terms of preoperative expectation levels and postoperative expectation coverage rate. Results When the patients were evaluated in terms of preoperative expectation levels a significant difference was determined between the patients who underwent surgery for cosmetic reasons (86.15 +/- 8.61) and those with functional reasons (79.24 +/- 6.62) (p < 0.001). Similarly the lowest patient expectation coverage rates were in the patient group with cosmetic reasons for the operation. When patients were grouped according to the ROE scores in the postoperative period and surgical indication expectation was higher in the groups that were not satisfied with the results (Groups 2 4 and 6). The highest expectation levels among the groups were seen in the dissatisfied patients who had undergone surgery for cosmetic reasons (92.17 +/- 4.96). A strong positive correlation was found between expectation coverage rates and patient satisfaction (r 0.907 p < 0.001). Conclusion Determination and rationalization of the expectations of patients in the preoperative period is one of the factors that will increase the satisfaction of the patients about the surgical procedure.;2021
Purpose This study aimed to compare open technique rhinoplasty with spreader graft and Let Down rhinoplasty using Nasal Symptom Obstruction Evaluation (NOSE) Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Materials and methods A total of 50 patients were included in the study. Patients with a hump greater than 4 mm and mild septal deviation participated in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 26 patients who underwent Let Down rhinoplasty while Group 2 consisted of 24 patients who underwent open rhinoplasty with spreader graft. NOSE SNOT-22 and VAS scales were completed by both groups preoperatively and postoperatively. Results There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age and gender. Postoperative values of scales were significantly lower than preoperative values in Group 1 (p < 0.001). In Group 2 postoperative values were significantly lower than preoperative values (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups according to NOSE SNOT-22 and VAS scores. Conclusion According to the comparison of scale scores both Let Down rhinoplasty and open technique rhinoplasty using spreader graft improved nasal functional results such as nasal obstruction.;2021
Purpose. - Rhinoplasty is one of the most commonly performed aesthetic surgeries among patients who are admitted to plastic surgeons. Recent research has focused on dorsal preservation in hump reduction and consequently dorsal preservation techniques have become more popular. The current study aimed to revise the push down technique by adding ostectomy. Patients and methods. - In the present retrospective study data from patients who underwent rhinoplasty to fix a nasal hump were assessed. All patients were administered the push down technique with ostectomy. Following these inclusion and exclusion criteria the records of 52 patients were assessed (45 females and 7 males). The median age of the patients was 22.2 years. Patients were evaluated using the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation'' (ROE) questionnaire both before surgery and 12 months after surgery. The follow-up period ranged between 13 and 21 months (median of 15.1 months). Results. - Patients were evaluated before surgery and after one year of surgery by the ROE scale. The median of the ROE score before surgery was 63.4. The median score after one year of surgery was 91.6. Thus the ROE score significantly increased 12 months after surgery (P < 0.001). Conclusions. - This study was the first to demonstrate the benefits of performing the push down technique with ostectomy in terms of obtaining a wider nasal cavity. In addition it can be assumed that the disadvantage of using the push down technique can be overcome with ostectomy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.;2021
Purpose: Edema and ecchymosis are among the most important morbidities after rhinoplasty. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of hilotherapy application compared with traditional ice applications after rhinoplasty in terms of periorbital edema ecchymosis and pain. Patients and Methods: A total of 60 patients (35 women and 25 men) had undergone primary rhinoplasty with the same surgeon. In the postoperative period 30 patients in the study group received continuous cooling at 15 degrees C using Hilotherm (Hilotherm GmbH Argenbuhl-Eisenharz Germany) and 30 patients in the control group were treated with conventional cryotherapy with ice packs. Both treatments started within 45 minutes after the end of the surgery and were maintained for 24 hours. For the following 1 week the patients were examined for edema ecchymosis and pain. Results: When the postoperative periorbital region was evaluated for mean edema and mean ecchymosis for 7 days less edema and less ecchymosis were detected in the Hilotherm group compared with that observed in the ice pack group (P < .001). When the mean pain scores were compared both morning and evening for 7 days less pain had been recorded with Hilotherm application compared with ice application (P < .001). Conclusions: Hilotherapy is a useful method to prevent postoperative edema ecchymosis and pain compared with traditional ice application.

Purpose: In rhinoplasty it is important to maintain the desired tip projection and rotation. The aim of the present study was to compare the tongue-in-groove (TIG) method and the septocolumellar suture method with short and floating columellar strut methods over a six-month follow-up period. Methods: A total of 69 patients were evaluated. The TIG method was used on 39 patients (group 1 TIG group) and the remaining 30 patients received septocolumellar suture supported with short and floating columellar strut (group 2 suture + graft group). Standardized right profile images were taken preoperatively and 6 months after the operations. Goode's method and nasofacial angle were used to evaluate nasal tip projection and the nasolabial angle was measured to evaluate tip rotation. The outcomes of the 2 surgical approaches were compared and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Although nasal tip rotation in the postoperative sixth month was higher than that in the preoperative period in both groups (TIG: 96.8 degrees vs 108.2 degrees and suture + graft: 100.8 degrees vs 104.2 degrees respectively) this change was significant only in the TIG group (P <.001). Goode's ratio increased significantly in both groups compared with the postoperative period (TIG: 0.62 vs 0.57 and suture + graft: 0.62 vs 0.58 P <.001 and.047 respectively). On the other hand nasofacial angle decreased significantly in both groups compared with the postoperative period (TIG: 147.8 degrees vs 144.0 degrees and suture + graft: 149.1 degrees vs 146.3 degrees P <.001). Conclusions: As per the results of the present study both studied methods can be safely used in nasal tip surgery. Compared with the septocolumellar suture + columellar strut method the TIG method resulted in a higher rotation increase. Both methods led to significant increases in projection and these increases did not differ between the groups. (C) 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons;2021
Purpose: In the surgical treatment of saddle nose deformity (SND) costal cartilage is often used. However it can result in some potential complications such as resorption bending displacement and its appearance under the skin (silhouette deformity). We prepared a composite sandwich'' graft by camouflaging the costal cartilage underneath the dermal fat graft as a novel method and applied it on SNDs using the closed rhinoplasty technique to prevent or minimize these risks. Materials and Methods: The method was used for 21 patients (12 males and 9 females). Six anthropometric measurements including the nasal dorsum projection nasal supratip projection nasal tip projection nose length labiocolumellar angle and nasofrontal angle were taken using the ImageJ program (National Institutes of Health Bethesda MD) on preoperative and postoperative lateral photographs. The data were compared statistically. Results: The mean follow-up time was 29.95 months. No donor site complications developed. The sandwich grafts transferred to the nose were well tolerated in all patients. A partial graft failure and a mild bending which were treated conservatively without supplemental surgery developed in 1 patient each. No resorption migration bending or appearance under the skin of the sandwich grafts were seen in the remaining patients. A statistically significant difference was found in all anthropometric measurements from the preoperative and postoperative groups except for 2. Conclusions: The severity of the deformity should be exactly determined before surgery and cartilage grafts should be used accordingly for successful repair of SND. The sandwich technique as a practical effective and long-lasting treatment method could minimize the potential complications and risks of revision.

Purpose: Loss of vision is an extremely rare and unexpected complication following a routine uncomplicated nasal surgery. In majority of patients visual loss has attributed to retinal emboli which occur with retrograde flow of the intra-arterially injected agents into the nasal cavity or direct trauma to the optic nerve. In this report the authors present a patient with unilateral decreased vision due to branch retinal artery occlusion soon after a routine nasal surgery. Methods: Clinical report. Result: A 32-year-old female patient admitted to the author' clinic with the complaints of decreased visual acuity in the left eye. She stated that she had undergone rhinoplasty operation 1 week ago and vision loss started immediately after the surgery. In the ophthalmological examination the best corrected visual acuity with Snellen chart was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.3 in the left eye. In the fundoscopic examination of left eye there was a pale area in the inferior part of the macula. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed no evidence of nonperfusion in the right and left eyes and vascular structure was normal. On the optic coherence tomography hyperreflectivity and increased thickness were observed in the inner retinal layers of the left eye. In the visual field test there was a loss of the visual field which corresponds to the pale area on the left eye. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was recommended. The ophthalmologic examination carried out 2 months later revealed a best corrected visual acuity of the left eye 0.9. In the fundoscopy pale area was regressed in the left eye. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed a good perfusion. There was a little progression in the visual field test. Conclusion: Direct mechanical trauma and vasoplastic/embolic vascular events are thought to be possible mechanisms. The authors think in this case there was a retrograde flow of agents used during the surgery through ophthalmic artery to retinal arteries and vasospasm by epinephrin worsened the situation. Although rare retinal artery occlusion may develop after rhinoplasty vision loss as a result of a surgery if done for aesthetic purposes is not acceptable.;2019
Purpose: Nasal tip reconstruction is an important component in aesthetic rhinoplasty. Different congenital deformities or acquired disorders ( trauma infection operations) may affect the nasal tip structure. Additionally the natural appearance of the nasal tip projection can be lost after rhinoplasty. The lower lateral cartilages are the main structural component of the nasal alae and tip support. Any distortion or failure on the alar cartilages may lead to both functional and aesthetic problems. In this article the author presents a different method for nasal tip support. Patients and Methods: Between 2010 and 2014 a chart review was performed of 64 consecutive primary rhinoplasty patients (29 women 35 men). Postoperative follow-up period was at least 12 months. None of the patients were secondary patients or no nasal tip surgery was done previously. The patients with secondary rhinoplasty saddle deformity revision rhinoplasty cleft lip nose and crooked nose were excluded from the study. Results: The three-dimensional pyramid cartilage technique was used in all the patients with the open rhinoplasty approach to ensure the nasal tip projection. Average time was between 4 and 7 minutes for graft harvesting and suturing to the nasal tip in this technique. The follow-up period was between 12 and 48 months. There was a revision procedure in 4 patients because of the distortion of the tip graft and tearing of the graft material. The revision procedure was done for these patients. Discussion: In this article the author presents three-dimensional pyramid cartilage technique as a new and alternative technique for better projection of the nasal tip. This technique also provided the support to nasal tip using only 1 graft material with minimal manipulation with no donor area morbidity or another cartilage resection except the nasal septum.;2016
Purpose: Radical resections and invasive techniques have been mostly replaced with more conservative techniques. The aim of this study was to assess the objective and the subjective functional and aesthetic outcomes of transcutaneous suture tip plasty. Methods: A total of 20 patients were included in the study. Patients were treated with transcutaneous suture tip plasty. Functional results were assessed with pre- and postoperative 6-month Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) and acoustic rhinometry. The pre- and postoperative 6-month mean values of first minimal cross-sectional area (MCA1) second minimal cross-sectional area (MCA2) the distance from the tip of the probe to the first minimal cross-sectional area the distance from the tip of the probe to the second minimal cross sectional area nasal volume 1 and nasal volume 2 were measured. Facial analysis was made with the Rhinobase software designed for facial analysis. Results: The mean pre- and postoperative SNOT-22 scores were 25.55 +/- 6.64 and 15.70 +/- 8.11 respectively (P < .05). The mean pre- and postoperative nasolabial angles were 82.26 degrees +/- 5.69 degrees and 101.47 degrees +/- 7.70 degrees respectively (P < .05). The mean pre- and postoperative nasofrontal angles were 144.30 degrees +/- 3.81 degrees and 138.25 degrees +/- 3.26 degrees respectively (P < .05). The mean pre- and postoperative nasal length was 54.22 +/- 4.62 mm and 49.95 +/- 2.75 mm respectively (P < .05). The mean pre- and postoperative tip projection was 25.77 +/- 3.64 mm and 28.40 +/- 2.97 mm respectively (P < .05). Only postoperative MCA2 values on the right and left side were significantly different from preoperative MCA2 values (P < .05). None of the remaining postoperative acoustic rhinometry scores significantly differed from preoperative scores. Two patients (10%) required revision at around 1 month after surgery due to suture loosening and breakage. Conclusions: Especially in the era of minimal invasive surgery transcutaneous suspension tip plasty is promising with rapid and reliable functional and cosmetic results. Further studies with longer follow-up durations are needed to assess the long-term outcomes of this technique.;2019
Purpose: The aim in this study is to compare the functional results of open septorhinoplasty with and without osteotomies performed with the aim of increasing respiratory functions and healing the deformations in patients with traumatic nasal deformations. Material and Methods: In this prospective and clinical study 26 patients with traumatic nasal deformation who applied between 2007 and 2009 were analyzed. The physical examination medical photographies the findings of periorbital edema and ecchymosis and changes in respiratory behaviors before and after the operation were recorded. Evident irregularities of nasal dorsum septum deviation and respiratory distress were identified in all of the patients. Open septorhinoplasty with osteotomy (13 patients - 50 %) and without osteotomy (13 patients - 50 %) were applied to a total of 26 patients. Osteotomy decision was given according to nasal dorsal width and nasal height. All the patients were controlled in the in the first third sixth and twelfth months of the postoperative period to analyze the results. The data gathered through these cases were compared with the literature. Results: Functional improvements were observed after open septorhinoplasty operations in all patients. When the post-operative results of the open septorhinoplasty operations with and without osteotomy are compared it was observed that among the group of patients on which osteotomies were not practiced respiratory complaints improved better stricture in the nasal passage was not caused edema and ecchymosis in the postoperative period was lesser. Conclusion: In this study the attempt was to prove that although open septorhinoplasty operations are classically performed with osteotomy the operations without osteotomy has not cause stricture in the nasal passage it causes less edema and ecchymosis in the postoperative period compared to the group with osteotomy. It is an acceptable procedure for patients chosen in the preoperative period through a detailed preliminary work.;2015
Purpose: The aim of the study was to describe the average values of the nasal anthropometric measurements by using the landmark-based geometric morphometric technique in young male patients who applied for rhinoplasty in the Black Sea Region in Turkey. Materials and methods: The study group consisted of 110 healthy male patients all were born in the Black Sea Region Turkey. The landmark-based geometric morphometric technique was used to analyze the nasal shapes as described in the literature. The mean age was 29 years (ranging from 23 to 35). All patients underwent primary rhinoplasty in our clinic between 2006 and 2011 years. All data were obtained from standardized digital photographic images. Anterior and worm's eye view photos of the patients were analyzed by using standard anthropometric measurement methods. Results: The mean total length and nasal bridge length of the noses were 58.90 and 57.35 mm respectively. The mean nasal bridge width and the morphologic nose width were 32.65 and 35.50 mm respectively. The average width of the anatomic nose was 26.25 mm. The mean length and width of the ala were 22.72 and 4.73 mm respectively. The mean length and width of the columella were 11.35 and 5.20 mm respectively. The mean frontonasal angle was 137.88 degrees and the mean nasolabial angle was 87.34 degrees. Conclusion: Black Sea nose was characterized by being considerably longer than average in nasal length and columellar height. Also nasolabial angle was found to be more acute than average when compared to other noses. (C) 2012 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone with controlled hypotension on intraoperative bleeding and postoperative morbidity in rhinoplasty. Materials and methods: Sixty rhinoplasty patients required hump resection and lateral osteotomy were included in this study. The patients were randomized into four groups. In group I (n =15) a single dose of 10 mg/kg dexamethasone was intravenously administered at the beginning of the operation. In group II (n = 15) the patients were given 2 doses of 10 mg/kg intravenously dexamethasone at the beginning of the operation and 24 hours after the operation. In group III (n = 15) 3 doses of 10 mg/kg intravenously dexamethasone were given at the beginning of the operation before osteotomy and 24 hours after the operation. Group IV (n = 15) was assigned as control group and the patients were neither administered dexamethasone nor applied hypotension. All cases in groups I II and III were operated under controlled hypotension. Systolic arterial pressure was aimed to keep between 65 and 75 mmHg for controlled hypotensive anaesthesia. Controlled hypotension was achieved by a remifentanil infusion of 0.1-0.5 microg/kg/min following a bolus of 1 microg/kg. Degree of eyelid oedema and periorbital soft-tissue ecchymosis was evaluated separately using a scale of 0-4. Intraoperative blood loss was recorded for each patient. Patients were evaluated at 24 hours and postoperative days 2 5 7 and 10. Results: In groups I II and III intraoperative bleeding was more decreased and the operation time was significantly shorter compared with control group (P < 0.001). Eyelid oedema and periorbital ecchymosis were significantly decreased in groups I II and III at the following postoperative 7 and 10 days (P < 0.001). There was statistically significant difference between group III and other groups at the postoperative 5 and 7 days in lower eyelid oedema (P < 0.001) upper and lower eyelid ecchymosis (P < 0.001 and 0.004 respectively). There were no postoperative complications with using steroid In any of the groups. Conclusion: Three doses of dexamethasone with controlled hypotension considerably reduced postoperative morbidities of rhinoplasty with osteotomy as well as intraoperative bleeding. Thus in group III receiving 3 doses of steroid when compared to other groups more uneventful postoperative period were provided for surgeon and the patients.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of esmolol and dexmedetomidine to achieve controlled hypotension on cochlea by measuring otoacoustic emission and stapedius reflex. Methods: In this prospective double-blind pilot study patients scheduled for elective tympanoplasty rhinoplasty and endoscopic sinus surgery operation were randomly assigned to two groups and received either dexmedetomidine (n=23) or esmolol (n=24) during surgery to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure between 55 and 65 mmHg. Distortion product otoacoustic emission tests (DPOAE) were performed 24 hours before and after the operation and during surgery (in the 20th and 40th minutes of the operation). Results: In the intra-group comparison a statistically significant decrease was present at t20 (2000 and 4000 Hz frequency band) and t40 (1000 and 1500 Hz) according to the baseline value in the dexmedetomidine group (n=23) in the esmolol group (n=24) a statistically significant decrease (relative to the baseline value) was also detected at t20 and t40 for the 1000 Hz frequency band. No damage was found on stapes reflexes with the infusion of these drugs. Conclusions: Infusion of dexmedetomidine and esmolol decreased DPOAE levels during the operations but DPOAE levels returned to normal in the postoperative period and had no effect on stapes reflexes. Studies with larger groups of patients are needed to confirm these results in tympanoplasty and other surgeries.;2020
Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of traditional thermoplastic splints vs a 3D printed custom external nasal splint designed to apply pressure to the lateral osteotomy lines and neighboring periorbital region on edema and ecchymosis after rhinoplasty. Patients and Methods: Forty patients undergoing open rhinoplasty were included in this prospective randomized controlled study. The patients were divided into 2 groups. In the study group the new 3D printed custom external nasal splint was used. In the control group the thermoplastic external nasal splint was used. Periorbital edema and ecchymosis scores were assessed peroperative before external nasal splint application postoperatively at the 1st and 4th hours and 1st 2nd 5th 7th 10th and 15th days. Results: There were lower scores of ecchymosis and edema in the study group compared to the control group for all the follow-up controls. There was a significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to the occurrence of ecchymosis for all follow-up controls except for the first postoperative hour and the seventh postoperative day (P < .05). Comparison of the 2 groups with respect to the grade of edema showed a significant difference only in the first and fourth postoperative hours (P < .05). Conclusions: The study detected less edema and ecchymosis scores using this 3D custom external nasal splint thus creating a new area of use for 3D printers in the field of facial esthetic surgery. New thermoplastic splints of different shapes and sizes can be produced that can compress the osteotomy lines and the neighboring periorbital region.

Purpose: The study aim was to compare patient satisfaction levels among patient groups with nasal hump deformity (NHD) nasal axis deviation (NAD) and NHD plus NAD using the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation Questionnaire (ROEQ) pre-and postoperatively. Materials and Methods: Forty-seven patients were divided into the NHD (n = 16) NAD (n = 13) and NHD + NAD (n = 18) groups according to the patients' physical examination results. Deviation angles were measured using frontal views and the AutoCAD 2012 computer program. Levels of patient satisfaction were assessed by the ROEQ pre-and postoperatively. Results: The preoperative ROE scores were 6 in the NAD group and 4.9 in the NHD group. In the NAD + NHD group the preoperative ROE score was 6.6. The postoperative ROE scores were 17.4 21.4 and 19.1 respectively. The pre-and postoperative ROEQ scores were significantly different for all groups. The preoperative ROE score was 5.6 in women. The score was 18.6 at 6 months after surgery. In male patients the preoperative ROE score was 6.2. The score was 20.4 at 6 months after surgery. The preoperative ROE score was 6.3 in patients younger than 30 years the score was 19.4 in the postoperative period for this group. Preoperatively the ROE score was 5.2 for patients older than 30 years. Postoperatively the ROE score was 19.3 (P < .05). Conclusion: Patient satisfaction and quality of life should improve after rhinoplasty. Patient satisfaction ranged from high to low for patients with the NHD group the most satisfied followed by the NAD + NHD group and the NAD group.

Purpose: The study goal was to determine whether creating a subperiosteal tunnel before lateral osteotomy had an effect on postoperative periorbital edema ecchymosis and subconjunctival ecchymosis. Patients and Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients who underwent septorhinoplasty were included in the study. In all patients lateral osteotomies were carried out bilaterally after creating a subperiosteal tunnel on a randomly chosen side and without creating a subperiosteal tunnel on the other side. The patients were seen on the second postoperative day and a different surgeon who was unaware of the side with the periosteal tunnel determined the side of the face with more edema and ecchymosis. Subconjunctival ecchymosis was evaluated and recorded as well. Results: Creating subperiosteal tunnels before lateral osteotomy statistically increased periorbital ecchymosis. Although there was no statistically significant difference creating subperiosteal tunnels also increased development and severity of subconjunctival ecchymosis and edema. Conclusions: We suggest performing lateral osteotomy without creating subperiosteal tunnels. (c) 2005 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons;2005
Purpose: This randomized double-blind study was planned to evaluate the effect of perioperative magnesium sulfate with controlled hypotension on intraoperative bleeding postoperative ecchymosis and edema and side effects. Materials and method: Forty-nine patients undergoing open rhinoplasty were divided into two groupsmagnesium sulfate and control. The magnesium sulfate group received 30-50 mg.kg(-1) intravenously as a bolus before induction of anesthesia followed by 10-20 mg.kg(-1) h(-1) by continuous intravenous infusion during surgery. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 3 mg.kg(-1) fentanyl 15 mu g.kg(-1) and cisatracurium 0.6 mg.kg(-1). Mean arterial pressure was maintained at 50 to 60 mmHg under controlled hypotensive anesthesia with magnesium sulfate titration. Hemodynamic variables operational bleeding early postoperative side-effects and postoperative first- thirdand seventh-day ecchymosis and edema were compared between the groups. Ecchymosis and edema were evaluated using a graded scale from 0 to 4. Results: In the magnesium sulfate group mean arterial pressure decreased during most of the perioperative period. Intraoperative bleeding also decreased. A distinct reduction in ecchymosis and edema was observed in both the upper and lower eyelids on the first third and seventh days. Patients in the magnesium sulfate group also had a more peaceful postoperative course with less postoperative nausea vomiting and shivering. Conclusion: Magnesium sulfate with controlled hypotension can lower ecchymosis and edema of the upper and lower eyelids in rhinoplasty surgery by reducing bleeding.;2020
Purpose: We investigated the effect of osteotomy on the vestibular system in septorhinoplasty patients and determined the potential risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in these patients. Patients and Methods: In the present prospective study 47 primary septorhinoplasty patients were evaluated as the study group and 50 septoplasty patients as the control group. Osteotomy was performed in all septorhinoplasty patients. No hammer and osteotomes were used in the control group. All patients underwent static balance tests (tandem stance test 1-leg standing test and Romberg test) dynamic balance tests (tandem walking test and Fukuda test) positional balance tests (Dix-Hallpike test and supine roll test) head impulse test and the adult dizziness handicap inventory (ADHI) preoperatively and during the first postoperative week. Results: No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of the static balance tests dynamic balance tests positional balance tests or head impulse test results. The postoperative ADHI scores were significantly worse in the septorhinoplasty patient group than in the control group. Posterior semicircular canal BPPV was observed in 2 patients in the septorhinoplasty group but none in the control group. Conclusions: BPPV is one of the possible early postoperative complications of rhinoplasty. In patients with vertigo after rhinoplasty surgeons should evaluate the semicircular canals using the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll tests. To avoid the traumatic effect of osteotomy reflected on the inner ear attention should be given to the applied force and sharp osteotomes should be used.

PurposeTo assess the objective and subjective analysis of facet and infratip lobule in postoperative digital pictures of rhinoplasty patients and compare them with the people with good-looking noses. With the help of simple software that measures the brightness of the pixels we investigated the relation between light reflections and patient satisfaction.Methodsegardless of the technique forty patients who underwent external open approach rhinoplasty were selected randomly. Twenty participants with a good-looking nose without operation history were selected as the control group. Digital Color Meter (R) in MacOS X (R) was used for measuring the brightness of the facets and infratip lobule. As a subjective outcome measure the visual analog scale (VAS) was used and compared with brightness ratios.ResultsThe mean brightness ratios and VAS of operated noses were statistically low from the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between brightness ratios and VAS in all groups.ConclusionOur study presents the results of a simple method of measuring the light reflections of the nose tip. Noses with a good aesthetic outcome have more symmetric and subtle facets and infratip lobule. This method was feasible and its results were correlated with patients' aesthetic perceptions.Level of Evidence IVThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Recent trends in rhinoplasty techniques have focused on anatomic repair as well as respect and preservation of soft tissue integrity. In this article the authors describe the use of a perichondrial flap then discuss technical considerations and clinical perspectives of their advantages. A perichondrial flap helps to restore the stability of the upper lateral cartilage to achieve extra padding and to secure osteocartilagenous grafts. The method described has been used for 60 consecutive patients. The majority of these patients were satisfied with the results. To obtain detailed information about the perichondrial flap the authors performed an anatomic study of 13 cadavers. The average thickness of the perichondrium was 186 +/- 146.1 mu m (range 90-596 mu m). On the basis of the results it was concluded that elevation of the perichondrial flap with loupe magnification could improve the outcome of rhinoplasty.;2005
Reconstruction of nasal contour where skeletal support is deficient or absent has usually been achieved using autogenous bone. Membranous bone taken from the cranium is clearly superior to rib or iliac crest when used as autografting material to the craniofacial skeleton. Conventionally the bone graft is rigidly fixated to the recipient nasal bone with either metal plate-screw systems or Kirschner wires. Reported here are the results of a single biodegradable screw fixation of the split calvarial graft that is used for nasal reconstruction. Ten patients with moderate to severe saddle nose deformity underwent reconstruction using the open rhinoplasty approach. The graft was harvested from the outer cortex of the parietal bone shaped and secured in place with a single bioresorbable screw. No significant resorption has been observed in the grafts and a favorable aesthetic result was achieved in all of the cases. Described modification in fixation of the bone graft in nasal reconstruction avoids some of the disadvantages of permanent materials while preserving the advantages of rigid fixation.;2006
Reconstruction of the middle third of the nose is crucial and middle vault insufficiency is possible following dorsal reduction in a primary rhinoplasty unless additional surgical measures are taken. The aim of this study was to define a novel suturing technique autospreading spring flap for middle vault reconstruction by suturing only the medial aspect of both upper lateral cartilages with septal quadrangular cartilage in a unique mattress suture and to mimic the natural anatomical configuration of the upper lateral and septal cartilages. This technique is intended to create functionality with aesthetic dorsal lines. Fifteen volunteers with a significant osseocartilaginous dorsal hump underwent open rhinoplasty. The middle vault was reestablished using the ASSF technique that appositions only the medial part of the upper lateral cartilages and suturing it to the dorsal septal cartilage. Appearance of the nose before and after the operation was evaluated by the patients using a visual analog scale. Acoustic rhinometry (AR) was carried out preoperatively and postoperatively to determine nasal valve patency. Preoperative and postoperative symptoms were evaluated and compared using the nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) scale. Patients (mean age = 32.2 +/- A 6.3 years) were followed for a mean of 12.6 months. The preoperative NOSE score was 65.0 +/- A 13 and the postoperative NOSE score was 7.7 +/- A 10. Cosmetic evaluation revealed the mean patient preoperative VAS score was 32.5 +/- A 20 and the postoperative VAS score was 88 +/- A 9. AR revealed a mean minimal cross-sectional area of 1.56 cm(2) that increased to 2.16 cm(2) postoperatively. Intranasal total volume increased from 16.3 to 24.8 cm(3) postoperatively. The newly defined autospreading spring flap suturing technique is a reliable method for reconstructing the nasal dorsum after humpectomy and for preventing middle vault and nasal valve collapse. The outcome was satisfactory both aesthetically and functionally but long-term follow-up is required. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Research using animal models gives human trials hope for recovery in many fields of regenerative medicine although they are sometimes poor predictors for human experiences. Our goal was to investigate whether rat chondrocytes differentiated from adipose-derived stem cells could be transplanted using a new easily shaped bioactive glass scaffold and to show the immunohistochemical results. Intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal adipose tissue was extracted from 6 male Wistar albino type rats. The fatty tissue samples were fragmented and incubated. Chondrogenic differentiation was carried out and collagen type II bFGF and Sox-9 immunohistochemical characterization analysis was performed. Differentiated chondrocytes were implanted on 13-93B3 bioactive glass scaffolds and transplanted into the right ears of the rats. As control only the biomaterial was transplanted into the left ears of the rats. After 1 month the rats were sacrificed and transplantation areas were examined immunohistochemically. Histological examination of control samples from the left ears revealed that the biomaterial was covered with connective tissue its general structure was preserved and resorption of the scaffold had started. In specimens from the right ears the biomaterial was covered with connective tissue its structure was preserved cartilage cells were present around the biomaterial and the presence of cartilage tissue was demonstrated immunohistochemically. In conclusion 13-93B3 bioactive glass scaffold contributed to the formation of new collagen and the survival of chondrocytes and is a promising new biomaterial that will prove very useful in regenerative medicine.;2018
Resection of the nasal hump is one of the most critical steps of the rhinoplasty procedure which is quite prone to complications when performed improperly or inappropriately. In this article a practical facile and minimally traumatic hump resection technique using Kazanjian bone-cutting forceps is presented with excellent cosmetic and functional results. Fifty-seven consecutive primary (septo-)rhinoplasty patients with wide nasal bases and various sizes of nasal humps were enrolled in the study. Following reduction of the cartilaginous dorsum height L-strut shaping of the septum and septoplasty procedures Kazanjian bone-cutting forceps were used for resection of the bony nasal hump. Lateral osteotomies were then performed and the surgery was completed following insertion of the structural grafts tip procedures and turbinate surgery. A computer software was used to measure the nasal hump. The Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation questionnaire was used to evaluate patient satisfaction 12 months after the operation. The technique presented here was performed on 19 male and 38 female patients with a mean age of 24.95 +/- 6.07 years. The mean height of the nasal hump was 4.65 +/- 1.56 mm. No patient had complications requiring further corrective surgery. The Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation questionnaire showed that all patients remained in the group of happy subjects. Long-term patient satisfaction indicates that the proposed technique could be used as an alternative procedure to other hump resection techniques. The technique described is an effective reliable and atraumatic method of resection of any size nasal hump.;2017
Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment due to progressive degeneration of the rod photoreceptor cells in the retina. Nasal deformities are known to attract attention result in stigmatization and negatively affect a person's self-perception. Cosmetic surgical management of blind patients is a broad undertaking requiring the involvement of both a plastic surgeon and a psychologist. While plastic surgeons have performed various reconstructive surgeries on blind patients including mammoplasty and abdominoplasty rhinoplasty for a blind patient has not been reported to date. The results of this study point to the positive psychosocial outcomes in a 33-year-old blind patient following rhinoplasty.;2018
Revision rhinoplasties and saddle nose deformities usually require grafting for reconstruction. Between January 1 2000 and January 1 2017 autologous rib grafts were used in 127 secondary and tertiary rhinoplasty patients [(57/127 females) and (70/127 males)]. Osseous-cartilaginous rib grafts (OCRGs) were divided into three parts (i.e. 1/3 upper peripheral 1/3 central and 1/3 lower peripheral). The harvested OCRGs were also shaped as vertical strips using a number 11 scalpel blade. These OCRGs were shaped to form the L-strut cartilaginous graft (LSCGs) osseous-cartilaginous spreader grafts (OCSGs) osseous-cartilaginous onlay grafts nasal valve grafts (NVGs) and lower lateral cartilaginous grafts (LLCGs). The upper peripheral portion of the rib was usually used as an onlay graft for dorsal reshaping. The shape of this part was minimally convex after being cut from the main graft and the convex shape was very appropriate for use as an onlay graft. The middle portion of the graft that consisted of the osseous and cartilaginous structure was used for the OCSGs. The middle portion of the graft that contained only cartilage was used for the LSCGs NVGs and LLCGs. OCRGs were used for the dorsal alar septal upper lateral and columellar struts for all patients. OCSGs were used for all of the septal grafts to provide further stability. In the nasal valve failure patients the rib cartilage was fixed onto the lower lateral and upper lateral cartilage and was sutured using polyglactin to improve nasal valve function. One edge of the graft was sutured over the septum and the other edge was positioned against the maxillary crest to allow for air flow at the nasal valve. After an OCSG was sutured to the septum a flat and smooth dorsum was shaped before the dorsal onlay graft was placed and fixed. The bone fragments of the grafts that consisted of spreader and onlay grafts were tied to the radix nasi bone without any space. After 6 months of follow-up a minimally warping defect was apparent in 8 patients but none of these patients requested another surgery. The analysis of the questionnaire responses revealed that > 90% of the patients were satisfied with the outcome of the procedure.;2017
Rhinoplasty alone or combined with septoplasty is one of the cornerstone management techniques in facial esthetic surgery. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of rhinoplasty maneuvers on facial and smile esthetics. The study included a total of 27 adult patients. Measurements of gingival length (GL) right and left maxillary incisor-upper lip distance (MIULD) right and left inter-lip distance (ILD) and right and left gingival pocket depth (GPD) were performed and rounded to the nearest millimeter in full smile and at rest. All measurements were obtained at baseline and at the postoperative 1st and 6th months by the same clinician. As compared with the baseline values significant decreases were determined in the left and right GLs in full smile left and right MIULD and left ILD at the postoperative 1st month and in the GL left and right MIULD and left and right ILD at the postoperative 6th month. In conclusion rhinoplasty maneuvers can improve smile esthetics by changing the GL thereby increase patient satisfaction.;2020
Rhinoplasty as an operation is akin to a game of chess where every maneuver will influence the eventual outcome. Undoubtedly more than one approach to the nasal soft tissues envelop can produce beautiful and safe results as will be described in the paper namely the subcutaneous sub-superficial musculoaponeurotic system supra- and sub-perichondral planes. For different justifiable reasons surgeons have their preferences regarding dissection planes on the tip middle and upper thirds and regarding the manipulation of the soft tissue layers and nasal ligaments. The concept of the nasal layers and the presence of relevant ligamentous structures and how to restore them in an anatomical fashion will help to understand the logic behind various approaches.;2021
Rhinoplasty is a collection of surgical procedures performed on nose for the purpose of correcting functional and shape deformities. Nose is a facial feature which naturally draws attention during everyday contact. Any operation performed on nose has to blend well with the other facial features of the face. For this reason rhinoplasty is a type of surgery which requires artistic skills from surgeon as well as surgical skills. In this paper we present an artistic simulation tool which manipulates the shape of the nose on the bases of rhinoplasty procedures to be used during the surgery. Unlike other artistic simulation tools which can modify shape with no constraints this tool simulates the effect of individual operations. Simulation tool can be valuable only if it predicts the outcome of the surgery with accuracy. Ultimately the outcome of the simulation depends largely on the experience of the surgeon. This is also the case with the tool presented in this study so with experience the tool can be useful for predicting outcome more and more accurately. In this paper the mechanical model of the nose and tools used for simulation are discussed. The simulation results are compared with actual rhinoplasty results to see the fidelity of the approach. A flowchart of the decision process and how rhinoplastic simulation together with the ideal nose data can be used to aid actual rhinoplastic surgery is given at the end. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Rhinoplasty is a common procedure in cosmetic surgery all over the world. Patients desire enhancement of their facial beauty by the correction of preexisting nasal deformities. Precisely performed operations lead to better results and enhancing technical accuracy accordingly results in more successful outcomes. Endoscopy helps us visualize the closed parts of the body with the aid of an illuminated optical device. The objective behind the present case series was to bring the advantages of open and closed rhinoplasty together by using endoscopic vision systems. A total of 312 patients with unoperated nasal deformities from private practice were operated and videoendoscopic closed rhinoplasty was performed on each patient. Postoperative patient satisfaction was assessed using the Rhinoplasty Outcome Score the level of satisfaction was found to be excellent. In the present case series it was hypothesized that trocar mobility under the skin flap allows virtual binocular vision that eventually leads to stereoptic depth perception. This allows virtual three-dimensional (3D) vision on the screen of the endoscope with a regular trocar. The mobility of the tip in the transverse axis created a virtual 3D appearance. Our experiences with videoendoscopic closed rhinoplasty are shared in this report. (C) 2017 British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Rhinoplasty is a common surgical procedure. Bleeding prevention is a crucial part of the surgery. We aimed to evaluate the different dose regimens of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing intraoperative blood loss among patients undergoing rhinoplasty. This prospective randomized study was performed in patients scheduled for rhinoplasty surgery between March 2019 and March 2020. The patients were divided into 3 groups containing 30 patients in each group. The patients in Group 1 received the first dose of 1 g intravenous (IV) TXA 10 minutes before the surgery and the second dose was administered at the end of the operation. The patients in Group 2 received only a single dose of 1 g of IV TXA 10 minutes before the surgery. The patients in Group 3 did not receive medication. Demographic data were obtained through a review of patient's medical records. Preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels postoperative transfusion and complications rate were compared between the study groups. No significant differences were observed between the study groups in terms of age gender body mass index American Society of Anesthesiologists scores and the level of preoperative Hb values (P > 0.05). The mean total blood loss was lower in Group 1 than the other groups but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.464). The administration of single-dose IV TXA or intermittent IV doses of TXA could decrease total blood loss in rhinoplasty but the statistical and clinical relevance was not significant.;2021
Rhinoplasty is a complex but commonly applied surgical procedure. Patient satisfaction is the least discussed but one of the most important determinants of surgical success. Evaluation of the patient satisfaction together with surgeon satisfaction were the main goals of this study. The roles of anxiety gender age and follow-up period were also studied. 53 eligible patients operated by the first two authors within the previous 2 years were enrolled in the study. The medical records were reviewed for demographic data as well as the details of the surgical procedure. Functional and esthetic satisfactions of the patients were evaluated by VAS and ROE respectively. Surgeon satisfaction was evaluated by VAS in crosswise manner. Anxiety was measured by STAI_s and STAI_t scales. The analysis concerning esthetic results as well as functional results did not reveal any significant difference between the two surgeons (p = 0.132 p = 0.43 respectively). ROE scores were significantly different among patients with good and very good functional results. The difference between surgeon satisfaction and patient satisfaction was found to be insignificant (p = 0.273). Correlation analysis yielded a positive correlation between STAI_I and STAI_II (Pearson r = 0.335 p = 0.014) but not between STAI scores and ROE scores. Moreover there was no relation between anxiety scores and the functional results. Likely gender as well as age follow-up and surgical technique were not found to have any effect on patient satisfaction either. Patient satisfaction is preferential in rhinoplasty. In our patient series patient satisfaction was shown to be correlated with functional outcome but not with surgeon satisfaction. Anxiety was not found to have a significant impact on results of rhinoplasty. Our results should be interpreted cautiously keeping in mind that our patients' primary drive for rhinoplasty was functional.;2018
Rhinoplasty is a difficult procedure to record for several reasons which include the narrow dark and deep surgical field cluttered with many instruments and the heads and hands of the surgical team often blocking the view. This study discusses 13 rhinoplasty cases that were recorded using the authors' technique. A three-minute unedited segment was extracted from the mid-portion of each surgical case and that footage was evaluated by three specialist examiners. Results indicate that the authors' technique can offer a effective solution in the video recording of the nasal-dorsal part of a rhinoplasty.;2016
Rhinoplasty is a plastic surgical procedure that requires careful attention at every stage because of its applicability and the different expectations of the patients and the physicians. The steps of the procedure should be followed strictly before during and after the operation. This case review is about a patient in whom a hematoma developed at the nasal dorsum because the patient neglected post-surgical care. After the early recognition of this complication the hematoma is drained and the patient's dressing is reconstructed. After 3 days of follow-up the hematoma is resolved and the patient is discharged. Patients should be closely followed after rhinoplasty as with every surgery. When a complication develops early intervention should be made as soon as possible.;2018
Rhinoplasty is a sophisticated surgery that needs high technical skills with knowledge. The DR technique is a refined technique to deal with the selected cases which are challenging for rhinology (wide dorsum base and humpy nose). Still so many things are unknown and one life span will be never enough to solve it. However the author thinks that any solution fills the gaps is the only thing we can improve the medicine.

Rhinoplasty is one of the most challenging procedures to master in plastic surgery. A successful outcome almost always requires a detailed preoperative analysis. However intraoperative assessment should not be underestimated as well. To give a rough idea about the changing positions of the basic landmarks of the nose we would like to demonstrate the 3-point suture determination test. With this simple method surgeons might estimate the instant effects of certain maneuvers during surgery.;2014
Rhinoplasty is one of the most common and challenging surgeries in aesthetic plastic surgery. Among rhinoplasty operations dorsal hump reduction and septal deviation surgeries are quite common. In the present research the author describes new approaches in which let-down and crossbar techniques are used in patients with simultaneous dorsal hump and septal deviation deformations. The records of the patients were accessed from a private practice. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria 36 patients were included. Two approaches were defined according to patients' needs. Patients were evaluated using the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaire before and 12 months after surgery. The follow-up periods ranged between 14 and 21 months. The ROE scores ranged between 80 and 100 points after 1 year. The initial median ROE score was 55.5 and it increased to 90.5 points at 12 months after surgery (P < 0.001). Patient satisfaction was excellent for 90% of the included patients. The present research is the first to demonstrate the successful results of the combination of crossbar and let-down techniques in patients with septal deviation and nasal hump. Plastic surgeons will be able to solve these challenging problems without relapse with the combination of crossbar and let-down techniques.;2021
Rhinoplasty is one of the most variable operations in facial plastic surgery because of the various deformities involved and dissimilar methods used to correct them. Although the exposure of the surgical anatomy with an open approach to rhinoplasty is much better than with the endonasal approach many surgeons focus mainly on the risk of a visible columellar scar. However despite this unfavorable complication of a midcolumellar incision a better understanding of the nasal deformities can be gained and a more detailed reconstruction can be performed. Surgeons have developed various methods to reduce the risk of scar formation. Different incision types include the Z V reverse V and W incisions. In our experience meticulous inverted V midcolumellar incision closure results in a better scar. There is no convincing reason to reject the transcolumellar incision for external rhinoplasty.;2009
Rhinoplasty is the most challenging facial aesthetic surgical procedure according to many plastic surgeons. Nasal bone osteotomies especially lateral osteotomies have a complicated history. If lateral osteotomy is not stable after osteotomy during intraoperative period stabilization is attempted with internal and external nasal splints but it is not possible to be confident about the stabilization since it is not fully fixed and cannot be observed directly. The authors presented the technique stabilization of the lateral osteotomy inferior tip with cerclage wire if there is a stabilization problem or step-off deformity after lateral osteotomy.;2019
Rhinoplasty remains one of the most commonly performed aesthetic surgical procedure that demands a meticulous intraoperative precision as well as maximum precaution and control. Nasal osteotomy is a key component to shape the bony vault in aesthetic rhinoplasty but it is also the so versatile dangerous and difficult to learn. The present study aims to evaluate the usefulness of our locator instrument for beginners which is called transilluminating osteotome. The use of transilluminating osteotome instead of guided lateral nasal osteotome is a reliable instrument since it facilitates the localization of osteotome and osteotomy line beneath the soft tissue with a limited damage to the surrounding soft tissues.

Rhinoplasty surgery has been among the most popular techniques sought by men and women in the last decade. Since Dr John Roe's endonasal rhinoplasty approach was first introduced in 1887 loss of nasal tip projection has been a challenging problem. To solve this problem a variety of technical methods have been presented by many authors. In this study the transseptal transfixion incision method was used to preserve the nasal tip projection. Transmembranous transfixion incisions were used and a 2-mm cartilaginous strip was left attached to the membranous septum. At the end of the operation the cartilaginous strip was used as a strut flap. To evaluate nasal tip projection preoperative and postoperative lateral view photos of all patients were marked at reference points (lateral cantus alar groove and angulus oris) and overlapped. The changes of the nose were clearly evaluated using Photoshop CS and Macromedia Fireworks in accordance with clinimetric analysis methods. All patients were evaluated at 12 months postoperatively. Although we did not use the additional tip projecting method including cartilage graft suture of nasal tip projections went well and columella appearances were natural. In this technique extra time and both autologous and artificial tissue are not required to maintain the nasal tip support. The main anatomic relation between lower lateral cartilages and septum is not disturbed and the appearance of the nasal tip is more natural. It is easy to determine how much the caudal septum will be reduced.;2009
Rhinoplasty via either an open or a closed approach is classically performed in the supraperichondrial plane i.e. underneath the SMAS. Total subperichondrial and subperiosteal approaches providing large exposure of all of the osteocartilaginous framework of the nose have been described in recent years. This deeper dissection requires adaptation of surgical instruments to perform both subperichondrial and subperiosteal dissection but also to perform osteotomies. New tools such as the Rhinosculpture or piezoelectric motor are particularly useful in this context. Acquisition of this dissection technique although it requires a long learning curve is largely rewarded by the advantages of this technique in primary and secondary rhinoplasty. The objective of this technical note is to provide a detailed description of the operative technique and the instrumentation required. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.;2019
Saddle nose deformity is a challenging complication of septoplasty or septorhinoplasty characterized by underprojected cartilaginous dorsum. Nasal dorsal augmentation is a significant part of reconstructive surgery of saddle nose deformities. In this study the authors aimed to discuss the results of using toothpick-shaped costal cartilage grafts in nasal dorsal augmentation of saddle nose deformity. Twelve patients who underwent nasal dorsal augmentation due to moderate to severe saddle nose deformity secondary to the previous septoplasty or septorhinoplasty were retrospectively reviewed. Costal cartilage grafts prepared in the shape of toothpicks were used in all patients. Costal cartilage was used as toothpick-shaped free grafts in 12 patients (female: 7 male: 5) with a mean age of 42 (range: 24-56) for dorsal augmentation in the secondary septorhinoplasty. All patients had a history of previous surgery (septoplasty n=9 and septorhinoplasty n=3). All patients were operated under general anesthesia with open technique septorhinoplasty. The mean follow-up was 18 (range: 9-48) months. In only 1 of the 12 patients a postoperative complication was observed including an infection of the tip area in the second postoperative week. None of the patients experienced donor site complications or major graft resorption. All patients were satisfied with functional and esthetic outcomes. No revision surgery was needed in any patient. Toothpick-shaped costal cartilage grafts are useful in nasal dorsal augmentation of moderate to severe saddle nose deformity. This technique offers smooth camouflage satisfactory accordance with the recipient region and shorter operation time. In addition it avoids the side effects from wrapping techniques such as foreign body reaction or additional donor site morbidities.;2017
Saddle nose deformity is characterized by depression of the nasal bone and the cartilage dorsum associated with a collapse in the upper lateral and alar cartilages. Etiopathogenesis usually involves trauma or invasive excision of the bone and cartilage. Surgical treatment for functional and aesthetic recovery relies on the use of grafts. Options for grafting include autogenous tissue such as bone or cartilage and alloplastic augmentation. Nine patients with saddle nose deformity underwent surgical reconstruction with autogenous costal cartilage. The deformity was the result of trauma in seven patients and secondary to surgery in two patients. Cartilage obtained from the sixth and seventh ribs was used as the graft material to compensate for the low nasal dorsum. Cartilage was used as a single unit and shaped to cover the nasal dorsum and the lateral nasal walls completely. The upper lateral cartilages were fixed to shaped cartilage graft. Additional cartilage grafts into the columella and septum were also placed in all patients. Functional and aesthetic outcome was satisfactory in all patients. As a result using costal cartilage graft a single unit allowed more predictable and reliable reconstruction of the saddle nose deformity than the conventional dorsal grafts.;2007
Saddle nose deformity presents a significant challenge to surgeons. The reconstruction of a saddle nose requires structural addition to the nasal dorsum and tip. Costal cartilage grafts have been utilized for fixing severe saddle nose deformity but costal cartilage is notorious for early and/or late warping. In addition to well-known measures the efficacy of a preventive surgical technique against warping was investigated in this study. Costal cartilage grafts were used in 18 patients with severe saddle noses. Due to recurrent and late warping of the grafts an additional measure was taken in 23 patients with a comparable deformity. In these 23 patients just before insertion the costal cartilage was transected on 75 % of its horizontal width every 2 mm alternating between both sides along the entire length of the implant a so-called accordion technique. With traditional measures early and/or late warping of the graft was observed in 7 (39 %) of 18 patients postoperatively. Two grafts warped so severely that they required revision surgery. On the other hand additional use of the accordion technique prevented the costal cartilage from warping in all 23 cases. The warping complication rate was significantly higher in patients whose graft did not undergo the described accordion technique. The accordion technique is thought to break the recoil mechanism responsible for warping. Since incorporating this surgical technique warping has not been seen in any saddle nose deformity patients treated by us in the last 5 years. This simple technique is strongly recommended in these cases. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Saddle nose reconstruction is based on the use of support grafts to manage aesthetic and functional problems. Bone (calvarial iliac crest costal nasal hump ulnar and heterogenous origin) cartilage (septal costal heterogenous) and synthetic materials (silicon silastic polyethylene) were used as support grafts. Three patients have been included in this study to define the surgical management and long-term aesthetic and functional results of patients undergoing rhinoplasty with support grafts for a saddle nose deformity. Open rhinoplasty was employed. Both the lower turbinates were excised and the bone dissected from the soft tissues in two cases and in one case only mucosa was removed. The amount of support needed was measured by using bone wax. The bone was used shaped in layers according to the defect and sutured to each other by vycril suture and wrapped around by surgicell. The graft was then inserted in its place and fixed with external prolene sutures. Results were satisfactory in both function and aesthetics. Ten to 16-month followups had no complications. Saddle nose surgery basically requires the use of a support graft to repair the nasal dorsum. A lower turbinate bone graft procedure has some advantages: it is cheap and safe it is ready to use and not time-consuming there is no donor area and no additional donor site morbidity and it enlarges the airway and the passage to prevent nasal airway obstruction.;2002
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease that manifests as noncaseating granulomas commonly in the lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes. Subcutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis that are caused by granulomas are referred to as specific for sarcoidosis whereas other lesions are considered nonspecific. The authors present sarcoidosis nodule formation on the lateral nasal osteotomy lines in a sarcoidosis patient undergoing rhinoplasty surgery as a rare patient.Level of Evidence: V;2016
Secondary rhinoplasty on a patient with a middle vault deformity is one of the most challenging procedures for a plastic surgeon. In order to achieve proper nasal aesthetics and airway function a surgeon most commonly chooses to engraft the nose with a spreader dorsal. onlay or columellar graft. This paper examines the aforementioned techniques in the management of 25 patients who presented with a severe middle nasal vault deformity. Methods: During the last 5 years 25 patients received secondary rhinoplasty using triple cartilage grafts to repair severe middle vault deformities. Patients were then questioned at least 3 months postoperatively about both airway problems and cosmetic satisfaction. Results: All the 25 patients indicated cosmetic satisfaction with 23 of the patients also achieving complete nasal airway function. Only two patients persisted to have an insufficient nasal airway. An endonasal examination revealed a slight nasal synechiae in one patient while no anatomic problem was identified in the second patient. From a cosmetic standpoint a straight dorsum with improved dorsal-facial balance were achieved. aesthetic lines and nasal. profile along with nasal-facial balance were achieved. When indicated secondary rhinoplasty to repair a middle vault deformity using the combination of spreader dorsal onlay and columellar grafts to augment the nose has shown to have both functional and cosmetic benefits.

Secondary septoplasty can be a challenging problem. Nasal obstruction and esthetic problems are not infrequently observed in secondary septoplasty cases. Secondary operation can be more complicated than primary operation because septal cartilage and neighbor structures can be surrounded by sear tissue. In addition normal anatomic shape of these structures can be disrupted by previous operation. It is our clinical experience however that external rhinoplasty cartilage grafts and horizontal control sutures offer significant advantages that may be critical for achieving satisfactory functional and cosmetic results. Hence we present our approach to restoration of operated septal deviation using a surgical algorithm that we have developed. Our surgical algorithm provides a logical structured method adaptable to variations in the septal deformity. We have followed this algorithm in the surgical correction of 15 patients with secondary nasal deviations achieving predictable largely satisfactory outcomes.;2008
Septal reconstruction alone or together with rhinoplasty can be a very challenging operation. In situations where septal cartilage is used for grafting or is not enough bony implants taken from the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and vomer can be used as a filler material between the mucoperichondrial flaps to avoid from unwanted mucosal atrophy flapping and septal perforation. These bony implants can also be used for splinting the dorsal and/or caudal segment of the septal cartilage after reshaping by rongeurs. On rare occasions they can even be used for subtotal reconstruction of the septum.;2013
Septorhinoplasty aims to improve not only the esthetic appearance but also breathing function of the nose. Although the esthetic improvement can be judged by the patient and the surgeon easily evaluation of nasal breathing is more complicated. Besides the subjective symptom scores given by the patient some objective methods have been developed. One of the most widely used of these objective methods is acoustic rhinometry which gives valuable information about the cross-sectional areas and volumes of the nasal airway as a function of distance from the nostril. Since the introduction of acoustic rhinometry many papers were reported regarding its efficiency with some conflicting conclusions. Septorhinoplasty has the potential to narrow the nasal airway especially if it includes lateral osteotomies and hump reduction. We aimed to evaluate the role of rhinoplasty on nasal obstruction with the help of subjective symptom scores and acoustic rhinometry. The study consisted of 26 patients who underwent septorhinoplasty. Before and after surgery the symptom scores and findings of acoustic rhinometry were collected both before and after decongestion of the nasal mucosa. Symptom scores decreased on both sides which were statistically significant (p < 0.05) however the changes in cross-sectional areas of the nasal airway were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The correlation between the symptom scores and acoustic rhinometry findings was not significant for all levels. The effect of septorhinoplasty on nasal airway and some important maneuvers to protect against nasal obstruction are discussed.;2013
Septorhinoplasty is a very common operation in the practice of plastic surgery and otolaryngology. We report a case with massive subarachnoid hemorrhage originating from carotid artery injury following corrective septorhinoplasty. The carotid rupture is a very rare but life-threatening major complication of nasal surgery. Therefore surgeons performing surgery in this area should be very careful and aware of this entity. According to our knowledge this is the fourth case report of a carotid artery injury following septorhinoplasty but it is the first bilateral and lethal one in the literature.;2004
Septorhinoplasty is one of the most sophisticated operations in aesthetic surgery. Surgical evolution and skill are mainly gained by close follow-up of patients which can be achieved by physical examination photographing and meticulous recording obtained before and after operation. On the contrary to some previous forms reported for this aim we hereby developed a novel form of only 1 document that is simple in design and practical to apply. We think that preoperative and post records of patients can more safely be obtained by means of our personal form. More optimal and scientific studies based on these filled forms can be performed prospectively and retrospectively. We also believe that this form can present a standard for the assessment of septorhinoplasty patients in researches publications and presentations if it would generally be approved by aesthetic surgeons.;2010
Several surgeons advise a variety of tip sutures and describe their own techniques in open approach. Septocolumellar suture is one of them and can be described as a loop suture between the medial crura and caudal septum. Although some of the articles mention that it can be applied in closed rhinoplasty there is no description of the technical details. This paper presents indications technical steps and advantages of the septocolumellar suture in closed rhinoplasty. After completing the classic sequence of the endonasal extramucous technique the medial crural cartilages are dissected from the overlying skin at the midcolumellar level keeping the distal fibrous attachments between the anterior columellar skin and these cartilages intact. A 510 or 4/0 Prolene (Ethicon Ltd UK) with a round needle is passed penetrating both the medial crura and then the caudal septum. Depending on the penetration level of this suture the tip projection can be increased or decreased the tip can be rotated and columellar show can be corrected. This suture also makes the medial crura of the alar cartilages and septum rigidly fixed together thus providing stability. Depending on the experience gained in 433 primary and 62 secondary rhinoplasty cases since 2000 it can be claimed that this technique presenting an alternative to the open approach in many cases and expanding the borders of closed approach allows one to manipulate the tip and columella easily with closed rhinoplasty and provides a significant decrease in the suboptimal results and number of complications.;2007
Severe dorsal deviations in crooked noses are treated by either in situ septoplasty with asymmetric spreader grafts (ISS) or extracorporeal subtotal septal reconstruction (ECS). To our knowledge except one retrospective study there is no other that compares the objective and subjective results of these two treatment modalities. The aim of this study was to compare the aesthetic and functional outcomes of ECS and ISS in crooked noses. This study was carried out on 40 patients (ISS in 20 patients and ECS in 20 patients) who underwent external rhinoplasty surgery due to crooked noses between May 2014 and January 2016. While performing rhinoplasty on the patients the decision of whether to use the ECS or ISS technique was randomized in a sequential fashion. Surgical outcomes were assessed and compared using the anthropometric measurement of photographs with Rhinobase software. Subjective assessments of nasal obstruction and aesthetic satisfaction were evaluated with a visual analog scale. There was a significant difference between rhinion deviation angle supratip deviation angle (SDA) and tip deviation angle pre- and postoperatively in the ECS group whereas in the ISS group except SDA all other postoperative angles were significantly improved from preoperative values (p = 0.218). The nasal tip projection in the ECS and ISS groups was 29.48 31.5 preoperatively and 29.78 31.26 postoperatively. The mean postoperative nasal tip projection value (p > 0.005) did not change significantly compared to the preoperative value in both groups. The mean postoperative value of nasolabial (p = 0.226) angle did not change significantly compared to the mean preoperative one in the ECS group. However in the ISS group the mean postoperative value of nasolabial (p = 0.001) angle significantly improved compared to the mean preoperative value. There was significant improvement in both groups while improvements in both functional and aesthetic outcomes were much higher in the extracorporeal group. None of the patients had postoperative nasal obstruction that required revision surgery. One patient underwent revision rhinoplasty due to an irregularity on the nasal dorsum in the ECS group. This is the first study that compares subjective and objective aesthetic and functional outcomes of crooked nose surgery according to two common septoplasty techniques in a randomized self-controlled fashion. This study was effective in both objectively and subjectively comparing the functional and aesthetic aspect of the patients submitted to two common different techniques of treatment of nasal deviations in crooked nose patients.;2018
Severe middle vault deformity with disturbed nasal form and function is one of the most challenging procedures to correct in a secondary rhinoplasty. Reconstructing the deformity with autologous septal cartilage would be the primary choice of most surgeons if it were always available. However in certain cases the lack of a sufficient quantity of autologous cartilage has forced surgeons to explore other viable options. This paper discusses our experience with the combined use of spreader and dorsal onlay grafts from various materials in the reconstruction of severe middle vault deformity in 110 patients. In follow up (between 6 and 42 months mean 21 months) all patients were noted to have improved in both aesthetics and function with no major complications noted. In summary this study proposes that any engrafting material can be used safety when the proper surgical principals and technique are employed. (C) 2005 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.

Severe septal deviation is a challenging deformity usually treated using aggressive surgical methods and extracorporeal septoplasty (ECS) is a commonly used method for this issue. However this method has severe risks and complications such as the recurrent deformity or nasal saddling. In this article we present an alternative solution to ECS procedure for the correction of severe septal deviation. Sixteen patients with severe c- or s-shaped septal deviation with a mean age of 26.5 years were included in the study. The entire deviated part of the septal cartilage was resected as a vertical block creating a full-thickness defect between the most cranial and caudal parts of the septal cartilage. After that two spreader grafts were placed bilaterally facilitating the septal integrity and leaving the full-thickness septal defect unchanged. The surgical results were evaluated using the preoperative and postoperative facial photographs and patient satisfaction was determined using nine relevant questions of DAS-59 scale. The only complication observed in the follow-up period of 19 months was hanging columella deformity which was corrected at the postoperative first year. The mean length of the resected septal segment was 12.4 mm. The mean length of the resultant septal cartilage defect after the vertical resection was 5.9 mm. The mean length of the placed spreader grafts was 25.6 mm. The comparison of the preoperative and postoperative photographs showed significant improvement of the nasal contour and considerable correction of the septal deviation. The statistical evaluation of the answers given to the questions of the DAS-59 scale clearly demonstrates that a significant degree of patient satisfaction was achieved. Severe septal deviation may be successfully corrected by full-thickness resection of the deviated part and reconstruction with bilateral spreader grafts with a low risk of postoperative complications.;2016
Silent Sinus Syndrome is a rare syndrome that usually involves the maxillary sinus. In this case report we present a rare case diagnosed as Silent Sinus Syndrome with frontal ethmoid and maxillary sinus involvement which was presented with periorbital complaints after the rhinoplasty operation performed in our clinic.;2020
Since 1996 cranial bone chips or septal bone chips harvested during septal deviation surgery and small chips of ear or septal cartilage have been used in 67 patients for dorsal nasal augmentation or for smoothing dorsal nasal irregularities. In this study 59 overresections of ostecartilaginous nose structures during previous aesthetic nose surgeries and 8 primary rhinoplasties occasioned the use of bone or cartilage grafts. For 57 patients both bone and ear cartilage grafts were used for the reconstruction. Bone grafts were used for seven cases and cartilage grafts for three cases. The results from 7 years of experience with this method of nasal dorsum reconstruction were satisfactory and durable. The most important advantage of this method is that the bony side of the nose is reconstructed with bone and the cartilage side with cartilage. Another advantage is that the bone chips are incorporated with both nasal bones building a strong dorsal nasal bony monoblack. This technique also is useful for augmenting mild saddle nose deformity and dorsal nasal projection deficiency on the bony part cartilage part or both parts.;2004
Since 1997 129 patients have undergone the open approach rhinoplasty procedure. Scar quality with running W incision was compared to the scar with V type incision. According to clinical and statistical evaluations after 6 months postoperatively the running W incision group showed better scar quality than the V type incision group. The advantages of a running W incision are camouflaging the depressed scar in the incision line and decreasing the angles of the corners of incision lines. Running W type incision is superior to V incision on the columella and may provide less scaring than a single Z and reverse V incisions according to our long-term clinical results.;2003
Since the septum plays a key role in maxillofacial growth the effect of septorhinoplasty maneuvers and the use of poly-p-dioxanone plate during growth on maxillofacial growth was investigated in our study. Thirty-three New Zealand rabbits each with an age of 8 weeks were included in the study. Maxillofacial computed tomography was performed on all 8-weeks old rabbits. Then the rabbits were divided into 5 groups randomly. No intervention was done on the rabbits in group 1. Nasal dorsum of the rabbits in the 2nd group were opened and the mucosae were bilaterally elevated. In the third group underwent limited cartilage resection by preserving the nasal dorsum. Removed cartilage was crushed and placed back between the mucoperichondrial flaps for the rabbits in the 4th group. Crushed cartilage with Poly-P-Dioxanone plate was used for the rabbits in the 5th Group. Maxillofacial computed tomography was performed at the end of the 20th week and growth parameters were investigated. When the group 2 was compared with the control group the nasal bone length was observed to be significantly shorter (P < 0.05). Group 5 compared with group 4 incisive bone volume remained significantly low (P < 0.05) and malocclusion developed. Nasal bone length was affected negatively in the group that underwent osteotomy and mucosa elevation. Although positive results related to poly-p-dioxanone plate use have been reported for adults incisive bone development retarded in noses that had not yet reached adult size in our study and the maxillofacial development was affected adversely.;2021
Skin problems following rhinoplasty may cause dissatisfaction concerning the esthetic expectations of the patients. This study was conducted to determine whether nasal skin type has an effect on skin problems after rhinoplasty. Thirty-five patients undergoing rhinoplasty in our tertiary referral center between May 2018 and August 2019 were included in the study. The nasal skin sebum level was measured with Sebumeter preoperatively and patients were divided into two groups according to the median sebum level. Among the 35 patients half of them with higher nasal skin sebum were categorized as oily skin group ( n =17 14 males 3 females mean sebum level: 200.3 +/- 26.9) and the other half were categorized as dry skin group ( n =18 10 males 8 females mean sebum level: 101.9 +/- 38). Periorbital edema and ecchymosis were assessed at postoperative days 1 3 and 7. Acne and seborrhea severity determined with Global Acne Grading System and Seborrheic Dermatitis Area Severity Index the day before operation and postoperative days 7 and 14 and months 1 3 and 10. Compared with dry skin group upper eyelid ecchymosis score at postoperative day 7 was statistically higher in oily skin group ( p =0.044). There was no significant difference in upper eyelid edema scores between postoperative days 1 and 3 for oily skin group ( p =0.020). No statistically significant differences were found for acne and seborrhea severity. Nasal skin sebum levels may affect periorbital edema and ecchymosis after the procedure but no significant effect has been observed for acne and seborrhea. Predicting the effect of nasal skin types on these problems may help the surgeon to inform patients more correctly.;2020
Structural deficiencies of the nasal dorsum are most commonly of congenital traumatic or iatrogenic etiology. Various grafts including autografts homografts and synthetic materials have been used to this end and are described in the literature.Autologous septal cartilage is the most commonly used graft material when limited augmentation rhinoplasty is planned. However it is difficult to retain sufficient cartilage to allow of such augmentation in instances where most of the septal cartilage has been used. The authors place moderately crushed cartilage beneath a monolayer of surgicel when performing limited nasal dorsum augmentation. The aim of the present study is to describe authors' approach and its utility by reviewing other methods reported in the literature.;2016
Study design A prospective clinical study. Background To the best of our knowledge there is no study in the literature that addresses the effect of showing comparative photographs in the follow-up period to patients who had undergone nonsurgical rhinoplasty on patient satisfaction. Objectives To examine the effect of showing preprocedure and postprocedure photographs to patients in the follow-up period on patient satisfaction. Methods It was a nonsimultaneous prospective study that included patients suitable for nonsurgical rhinoplasty. Photographs were taken during routine follow-up after 1 month of the procedure and patients were asked to fill the Derriford Appearance Scale 24 (DAS24) and Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaires. Next after the preprocedure and postprocedure photographs were shown to the patients they were asked to complete the DAS24 and ROE questionnaires again. Results The study included 265 female patients. The mean age of the patients was 35.11 +/- 8 (18-61 years). Before the preprocedure and postprocedure photographs were shown the DAS24 score was 52.2 +/- 14.26 and the ROE score was 75.91 +/- 11.91. After the photographs were shown the DAS24 score was found to be 40.80 +/- 13.25 and the ROE score as 87.722 +/- 8.56. Therefore significant improvement in DAS24 and ROE scores and an increase in patient satisfaction were observed after the preprocedure and postprocedure photographs were shown (p = 0.01 p < 0.05). Conclusion Showing preprocedure and postprocedure photographs in the follow-up period to patients who underwent nonsurgical rhinoplasty leads to greater patient satisfaction with the surgery and their self-image.;2021
Subcutaneous emphysema is a clinical entity that may be associated with trauma. Rhinoplasty is not an atraumatic procedure. This report presents a case of acute periorbital emphysema after cosmetic rhinoplasty. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Success in dorsum reshaping is not only dependent on definitive hump reduction but also to stable mobilization of lateral walls. Between April 2005 and November 2008. the author performed powered micro saw osteotomy on 627 primary and secondary rhinoplasty and septorhinoplasty cases. Satisfactory results were obtained in all of the cases. There was no complications such as rocker effect step deformity collapse verticalization of lateral walls or other skin-soft tissue complications. Unlike blunt-force osteotomies that fracture the bone margins especially because of the physical inconsistencies of human bone. PMSO acts strictly in the way the surgeon does plan the line of osteotomy Powered micro saw osteotomy provides a precise approach for hump reduction and mobilization of lateral walls.;2009
Supratip deformity is an iatrogenic convexity that occurs cephalically to the nasal tip. This is also known as parrot beak deformity and causes an unnatural appearance of the nose. In the literature there are several explanations of the mechanism of the deformity and methods to correct it. One of the most accepted theories about the cause of supratip deformity is overresection of the caudal dorsum. Healing soft tissues fill in the gap created between the septum and the tip of the lower lateral cartilages leading to fullness in the supratip area. The lower third and basically distal third of the middle third of the nose include several muscle groups ligamentous structures and perichondrium as the subcutaneous soft tissues. With the idea of elevating a reverse-based flap basically from the lower third and the lower third of the middle third of the nose including the perichondrium and SMAS tissue we aimed to reduce this gap which has the potential to accumulate soft tissues that cause supratip fullness. Between December 2008 and July 2010 the reverse nasal SMAS-perichondrium flap was used in 42 primary rhinoplasty patients. This flap was used in 42 patients. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 18 months. No early or late complications were noted such as infection excessive bleeding or extended edema. Minor revisions were performed in only two patients with the aim of achieving a smoother nasal dorsum. The reverse nasal SMAS-perichondrium flap is a new flap. The results presented here are not long term however the preliminary results are promising. The flap should be avoided in cases of thin skin or at least be used with caution whereas in thick skin cases it is very safe. Further studies in larger groups are required to better define the advantages and disadvantages of this flap.;2012
Surface aesthetics of an attractive nose result from certain lines shadows and highlights with specific proportions and breakpoints. Analysis emphasizes geometric polygons as aesthetic subunits. Evaluation of the complete nasal surface aesthetics is achieved using geometric polygons to define the existing deformity and aesthetic goals. The relationship between the dome triangles interdomal triangle facet polygons and infralobular polygon are integrated to form the diamond shape light reflection on the nasal tip. The principles of geometric polygons allow the surgeon to analyze the deformities of the nose define an operative plan to achieve specific goals and select the appropriate operative technique.;2016
Surface aesthetics of the attractive nose are created by certain lines shadows and highlights with specific proportions and breakpoints. Our evaluation of the nasal surface aesthetics is achieved using the concept of geometric polygons as aesthetic subunits both to define the existing deformity and the aesthetic goals. Surgical techniques have been developed and modified to achieve the desired surface appearance and those are detailed in this article. The principles of geometric polygons allow the surgeon to analyze the deformities of the nose to define an operative plan to achieve specific goals and to select the appropriate operative technique. These aesthetic concepts and surgical techniques were used in 257 consecutive rhinoplasties performed in the past 3 years by the principal author (B.C.).;2013
Surgical elongation of the short columella is a challenging problem for the surgeon. Although some flaps from the upper lip are successfully used to correct this deformity on cleft lip patients with a scarred upper lip these methods cannot be applied to noncleft patients with a smooth upper lip. Distant flaps and composite grafts do not give the best aesthetic results. The use of an external approach for rhinoplasty is preferred by many surgeons especially for difficult or secondary cases. Most incisions for open rhinoplasty are placed on the columella. This report describes a new incision for open rhinoplasty to be used on patients with a short columella. The incision is a standard forked flap with a columellar base but the legs of the flap extend to the nostril bases instead of to the upper lip. This method was used on eight aesthetic rhinoplasty patients with a short columella between March 1995 and March 1998. The results of the method are discussed.;1999
Suture tip plasty is one the most used methods in nasal tip surgery. Transdomal suture (TDS) used for this purpose is utilized for providing the dome symmetry thinning the nasal tip and enhancing the nasal tip projection and rotation. However there are not sufficient visual data on what the dome position should be during TDS. In this study it was aimed to be directive in tip plasty and to define the convenient dome holding technique during TDS. Patients 510 male and 621 female at the age of 18 to 50 years who underwent the open technique septorhinoplasty between the years of 2003 to 2015 were included in the authors' study. The length of the patient follow-up varies between 1 and 10 years. Patients on which the lateral crural strut graft was used and which underwent dome division/vertical dome division in tip surgery and patients who were diagnosed with the alar cartilage asymmetry and underwent dome excision for any pathological reason to demonstrate the effectiveness of the TDS holding technique. During the TDS the dome area was administered with 5/0 polydioxanone by being held at an angle close to the cranial in the posterior and the caudal in the anterior with a dentated forceps. In this study according the authors' pre and postoperative conclusions the authors consider that this is a sufficient visual data on what the dome position should be during TDS by presenting video.;2018
Ten New Zealand Albino rabbits were used in this study. A lateral incision was made on the nasal dorsum and a pocket formed in the subperiosteal plane to replace the implant. A fascia lata graft was obtained from the regio femoralis. High-density porous polyethylene (HDPP) was cut and covered with fascia lata. The material was positioned in the pocket formed on the nasal dorsum. Four months post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to evaluate the resorption of the material. Animals were then sacrificed and the nasal dorsum including the graft material was removed and subjected to macroscopic and histopathological examinations. All rabbits survived the 4-month period. MRI revealed that all the graft materials were intact no sign of resorption was evident. Macroscopically no rejection was observed. Histopathologic examination revealed that the HDPP remained intact on the nasal dorsum. HDPP covered with fascia can therefore be used for augmentation of the nasal dorsum. HDDP is easy to work with and will avoid the increased operative time and morbidity associated with autograft harvesting.;2013
Tertiary rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure to correct nasal deformities that have been developed after prior unsuccessful surgeries. Such surgery requires complicated manipulations and tissue grafting for proper restoration. In the current study we report the use of fascia lata graft combined with cartilage grafts for contour restoring and camouflage. Twenty-three patients who had severe nasal deformities were included of whom 14 were men and 9 were women. Their ages ranged between 24 and 34 years (mean 29 y). All patients were twice previously operated on by surgeons other than the authors. An informed consent was obtained from all patients. After harvesting the costal cartilage the fascia lata graft (mean size 2-3 cm) was uniformly harvested from the right lateral thigh. Application of the fascia lata and the cartilage graft was achieved through the open rhinoplasty incision. The fascia lata was applied over the cartilage in the dorsal region in 20 patients (86.9%) applied over the reconstructed alar and dome area in the nasal tip in 8 patients (34.7%) and applied over both areas simultaneously in 4 patients (17.3%). Postoperative follow-up was between 14 and 35 months (mean 24.5 mo) clinical evaluation photographic documentation and a questionnaire form related to donor-site morbidity and patient satisfaction were applied after 12 months of the follow-up period. Results showed that all patients had an improved aesthetic result and no apparent irregularities were observed in the integument of the aesthetic lines. No complications or no requirement for revision surgery was observed later on. In conclusion refinements of the nasal dorsum and the nasal tip in tertiary rhinoplasty are indeed important and difficult to be managed. Placing the fascia lata over the applied cartilage grafts provide a good cover that conceals the possible irregularities or distortions that may appear in the late postoperative period.;2012
The aim is to investigate the contribution of the PNIF test in daily clinical practices in the objective evaluation of the early postoperative functional results of septoplasty and the effect of the severity direction and type of nasal septum deviation on mean PNIF values. Nasal septum deviation (NSDs) of the cases were grouped according to the Mladina classification and the severity of NSDs. An objective evaluation of the nasal airway was conducted via a peak flowmeter device in the preoperative and postoperative first month. When examining the mean PNIF values according to genders it was observed that the values determined in male cases in the preoperative and postoperative period were higher. In the intragroup evaluation performed according the Mladina classification a statistically significant increase was observed in the preoperative and postoperative PNIF values of the cases in Types 1-4. In the intragroup evaluation performed according to the severity of NSD there was a significant increase in the preoperative and postoperative PNIF values of the mild and moderate cases. When comparing the preoperative and postoperative PNIF values of the groups in terms of the severity of NSD it was observed that there was a significant difference. The PNIF can be used in routine clinical practices to evaluate the septoplasty results objectively. In the evaluation of functional results the change in the mean PNIF values may also vary according to the direction and severity of septum deviation and the Mladina classification other than age gender and ethnic origin.;2021
The aim of functional septorhinoplasty is to create an esthetically elegant nose and harmony in the face by preserving nasal function as well as maintaining or restoring adequate airway. Since nasal complaints are usually subjective it may be difficult to evaluate the functions objectively. In the present study we aimed to investigate the alterations in nasal function associated with septorhinoplasty by using both objective and subjective methods. The study population consisted of 40 patients who underwent septorhinoplasty and 40 healthy controls. Before and after the operation visual analog scale acoustic rhinometry rhinomanometry and Odiosoft-Rhino test were applied to all patients and controls. There were significant differences in all parameters both before and after the operation. While a significant difference was obtained between the patient and control groups in terms of preoperative values no significant difference was found between postoperative values of these groups. Both objective and subjective methods are important in evaluations.;2013
The aim of the study is to investigate the histopathologic and cartilage mass changes in hyperbaric oxygen (HBO)-treated auricular cartilage grafts either crushed or fascia wrapped in a rabbit model. This is a prospective controlled experimental study. Sixteen rabbits were randomly allocated into control (n=8) and treatment groups (n=8). Each group was further grouped as crushed cartilage (n=4) and fascia wrapped crushed cartilage (n=4). The eight rabbits in the treatment group had HBO once daily for 10 days as total of 10 sessions. The mass of cartilage cartilage edge layout structural layout staining disorders of the chondroid matrix necrosis calcification besides bone metaplasia chronic inflammation in the surrounding tissues fibrosis and increased vascularity were evaluated in the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Fibrosis in the surrounding tissue and cartilage matrix was evaluated with Masson's trichrome stain. The toluidine blue staining was used to evaluate loss of metachromasia in matrix. The prevalence of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in chondrocytes was also evaluated. Although the remaining amount of cartilage mass after implantation does not show a significant difference between the control and the study group (p=0.322 p <0.05).The difference between control and study group in terms of positive staining with GFAP was statistically significant (p=0.01 p <0.05). Necrosis and loss of matrix metachromasia were significantly low in the study group compared with control group (p=0.001 p=0.006 p <0.05). HBO therapy did not have significant effect on the mass of rabbit auricular cartilage graft. HBO therapy significantly reduced loss of metachromasia necrosis and GFAP staining in the auricular cartilage grafts of the animal model.;2015
The aim of this article is to define a tip graft that provides camouflage for a smoothly contoured natural-looking tip and that prevents long-term graft visibility. When traditional grafts are used to substantially increase tip projection there is a possibility for thinning of the skin and subsequent graft visibility. To avoid such unwanted results the authors have developed a novel graft: the camouflaging alar tip (CAT) graft. In this study the authors provide a retrospective analysis of the long-term follow-up of 742 patients from 2003 to 2013 in whom a CAT graft was placed. This article is a synopsis of the authors' 10 years experience in nasal tip surgery.;2015
The aim of this study is to find the ideal solution and the optimum temperature to protect the viability of the cartilage graft. This randomized prospective study consists of 30 patients with septal deviation. All patients had septoplasty operation for chronic nasal obstruction. Ten strips of cartilages were prepared from each excised septum and then immersed in formalin alcohol (96%) saline (09%) gentamicin (80 mg) and cefazolin sodium (Cezol 1gr) solutions in a total of 300 vials. Those vials were stored for 6 months at both +4 degrees C and -18 degrees C temperatures. Two groups were compared with each other. 22 cases were male (73%) and 8 patients were female (7%). The age range was between 20 and 48 (average 25.34 +/- 4.09 years). Parameters at +4 degrees C the cartilage volume was not significantly different among the solutions (P > 0.05). Necrosis was significantly lower in the alcohol (46.7%) compared to other solutions (P = 0.001). Calcification was lower in the gentamicin group (56.7%). The loss of metachromasia was lower in the alcohol solutions (P = 0.000). Parameters at -18 degrees C the loss of metachromasia was higher in the gentamicin group (56.7%) than the other solutions (P = 0.003). The authors observed no significance in the rates of necrosis calcification metaplasia inflammation vascularity or fibrosis among the solutions (P > 0.05). Less necrosis and metachromosis loss in the alcohol solution indicated that alcohol was more suitable for preservation of the cartilage. In addition temperature degree for the preservation of the cartilage did not show any significant differences.;2019
The aim of this study is to report the long-term effectiveness of septocolumellar projection control suture (PCS). Fourteen cases underwent rhinoplasty including projection control suture have been included into the study. The long-term effectiveness of PCS is investigated on patients' early and late postoperative photographs. Mean durations between operation and early and late postoperative photographic documentations were 1.28 +/- 06 (range 1-3) and 23.27 +/- 7.84 (range 12-48) months respectively. The measurement of the nasal tip projection by using Goode and Byrd-Hobar techniques were accomplished on the lateral view photographs. The Scion Image software program was utilized for numerical analysis. There was no statistically significant change in nasal tip projection on early and late postoperative periods. The Goode and Byrd-Hobar ratios were measured as 0.584 and 0.572 in preoperative photographs. There were statistical significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative results (p = 0.001 for Goode and p = 0.0001 for Byrd-Hobar). The mean Goode's ratio was 0.614 +/- 0.035 in the early postoperative period and 0.616 +/- 0.035 in the late postoperative period. The mean Byrd-Hobar's ratio was 0.673 +/- 0.037 in the early postoperative period and 0668 +/- 0039 in the late postoperative period (p = 0.336 for Goode p = 0.374 for Byrd-Hobar). There was no projection loss in any of our cases after a two years follow-up period. According to these preliminary results on a limited number of patients PCS seems to be a reliable and effective surgical method to create the desired nasal tip projection for a long time.;2010
The aim of this study was to assess the success of rhinoplasty by evaluating the inter-rater variability in the light of primary indication as functional or cosmetic. Subjective aesthetic perception was compared with objective facial analysis. 45 rhinoplasty patients were included in the study. 25 had cosmetic plus functional reasons with septal deviation (group 1) and 20 had pure cosmetic reasons without septal deviation (group 2). Preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively four individuals (patient surgeon 2 independent surgeons) rated the aesthetic appearance of the nose with visual analogue scale. Facial photogrammetric analysis was applied. The patient's aesthetic perception score was significantly correlated with the two independent surgeons (p < 0.05) whereas not with the primary surgeons. Regarding the objective parameters patient's aesthetic perception was significantly correlated with the dorsal alignment in both groups (p < 0.05). General satisfaction score was significantly correlated with the nasal breathing as well as with the aesthetic perception scores in both groups. This correlation was higher for aesthetic perception in group 1 and nasal breathing in group 2. Inter-rater variability of outcome perception was higher in cosmetic patients. Nasal dorsal alignment was the only objective parameter which was correlated with the patient's perception. Patient's perception of outcome has better represented the objective photogrammetric analysis rather than the primary surgeons. An interesting finding was the more significant correlation of general satisfaction with aesthetic perception in the functional group whereas nasal breathing in the cosmetic group.;2015
The aim of this study was to compare the degree of nasal tip rigidity from different techniques for increasing nasal tip projection. Retrospective records of patients who had undergone rhinoplasty were reviewed at the tertiary referral center. 81 patients who had undergone suturing of the medial crura to the extension graft or to the long septum were selected. In group A fixation was performed at the same level compared to before surgery. In group B tip grafting was performed to gain 3 mm or more in projection after fixation as done in group A. In group C the same tip projection was provided by advancing the medial crura on the caudal septum or extension graft. Patients were evaluated with a visual analog scale based on the rigidity of the nasal tip (0 = very flexible 10 = very rigid). When the preoperative and postoperative VAS scores of all groups were compared postoperative scores were significantly higher than the preoperative scores (p < 0.001). The postoperative scores of group C were higher than those of the other groups. These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between groups A and B with regard to the postoperative scores (p = 0.389). However in group C the increase between preoperative and postoperative scores was significantly higher than in the other groups (p < 0.001). Advancing the medial crura on the caudal septum and suturing to gain 3 mm or more of tip projection may result in a more rigid nasal tip. Patients should be informed preoperatively of this potential result. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

The aim of this study was to compare the facial photogrammetric analysis results of the Turkish population who are pleased with their facial appearance with the facial analysis data of patients who underwent rhinoplasty in order to find the most prominent objective facial measurements that lead patients to surgical correction of the nose. Forty rhinoplasty patients (20M 20F) and 40 people without nasal deformity (20M 20F) were included in this study. Rhinobase software was used for photogrammetric facial analysis. The differences in the nasofrontal angle (NFA) nasolabial angle (NLA) chin projection (CP) middle facial height (MFH) and tip deviation angle (TDA) between the patient and the control groups and between the males and females were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The most significant differences between the control group and the patient group were crooked nose obtuse NFA acute NLA chin underprojection and increased MFH.;2011
The aim of this study was to evaluate psychosocial distress and improvement in quality of life (QoL) of patients undergoing rhinoplasty and compare the level of distress associated with the types of rhinoplasty. A total of 79 patients who underwent external rhinoplasty were enrolled in the study. The patients were grouped due to primary secondary functional and cosmetic rhinoplasty. The patients were evaluated four times: preoperative evaluation 4th 12th and 24th weeks postoperatively and completed questionnaires including the rhinoplasty outcome evaluation (ROE) scale nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) scale and Derriford Appearance Scale 24 every four visit. The revision cases and patients with cosmetic indication have more emotional distress than others at the preoperative and early postoperative period (p < 0.005). However the distress level equalize and return baseline values beyond 12 weeks. The ROE and NOSE scores of all patients were very significantly improved by the rhinoplasty (p < 0.001). To our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate changes in distress of patients undergoing rhinoplasty using DAS-24 scale. The psychosocial distress has a significant impact on quality of life and therefore it is an important factor to assess the success of surgery. In addition regardless of initial demand and type of surgery rhinoplasty provides improvement in nasal obstruction and a positive impact on QoL in most of the patients undergoing rhinoplasty.;2015
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of controlled hypotension on cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and evaluation of postoperative cognitive function in patients undergoing rhinoplasty. Fifty adult patients who were scheduled for elective rhinoplasty surgery and required controlled hypotension were enrolled in this prospective study. Controlled hypotension was provided using a combination of propofol and remifentanil infusion supplemented with nitroglycerin infusion as necessary. rSO(2) was evaluated during controlled hypotension by NIRS. Cerebral desaturation was observed in 5 out of 50 patients (10 %) during hypotensive anesthesia. The greatest decrease from baseline was 28 % when MAP was 57 mmHg. In both non-desaturated and desaturated patients postoperative MMSE scores were significantly lower than preoperative scores. There was a 4 % decrease in the non-desaturated patients and a 7 % decrease in the desaturated patients when preoperative and postoperative MMSE scores were compared. A decline in cognitive function 1 day after surgery was observed in 23 patients (46 %) and in all patients with intraoperative cerebral desaturation. The current study showed that even if SpO(2) is in the normal range there might be a decrease of more than 20 % in cerebral oxygen saturation during controlled hypotension.;2016
The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TA) and methylprednisolone on periorbital edema ecchymosis and intraoperative bleeding in patients who underwent open septorhinoplasty (oSRP). Seventy-five patients performing hump extraction and osteotomies were allocated into 3 groups as follows: group 1 25 patients as control group 2 25 patients who were administered oral TA as first dose 1 g starting 2 hours before surgery 3 g daily in divided doses (1 g every 8 hours) for 5 days and group 3 25 patients who were administered a single dose of 1 mg/kg intravenous methylprednisolone at the beginning of the surgery. Operation time amount of intraoperative bleeding and complications were recorded. Scoring of eyelid edema and periorbital ecchymosis was evaluated on postoperative first third and seventh days using scale of 0 to 4 by 2 observers. In groups using TA and methylprednisolone periorbital edema and ecchymosis scores were significantly lower compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No significant difference was seen clinically and statistically in preventing or decreasing both periorbital edema and ecchymosis between group 2 and group 3. Patients given TA showed significantly less intraoperative bleeding compared with controls and patients who were administered methylprednisolone. We observed that the administration of methylprednisolone significantly decreases periorbital edema and ecchymosis. Additionally our results support that TA use in patients who underwent oSRP with osteotomies was found clinically and statistically effective for prevention of bleeding during oSRP operations and reduction of both periorbital edema and ecchymosis.;2015
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the amount of bleeding and bacteremia during nasal septal surgery. Seventy-one patients undergoing septoplasty were enrolled in the present study. The amount of bleeding was measured and recorded for each patient. Preoperative and postoperative blood cultures were collected immediately after the induction of anesthesia and 20 min after the operation respectively. While none of the blood cultures taken preoperatively were positive for any organism the cultures obtained postoperatively were positive in 9 (12.7%) of 71 patients who underwent septoplasty and bacteremia was more frequent among those with a greater amount of bleeding during the surgery. The results of this study suggest that although bacteremia had no clinical consequences for patients patients with more bleeding have an increased risk of developing bacteremia which may cause complications in higher risk individuals.;2012
The aim of this study was to measure the postoperative satisfaction of patients who underwent open technique septorhinoplasty (SRP) using Nasal Obstruction Symptoms Evaluation (NOSE) Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation (ROE) and visual analog scale (VAS) and to assess the reliability and usability of these forms in the outcome of SRP. Forty-five patients who underwent primary open technique SRP were included in the study. The levels of patient satisfaction were assessed before the surgery and in the long-term using NOSE ROE and VAS. Nasal Obstruction Symptoms Evaluation scores were found to be decreased significantly after surgery whereas ROE scores were increased postoperatively (P < 0.01). Patients' either functional (VAS) and aesthetic (VAS) increased significantly in the long-term after surgery (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between preoperative and postoperative measurements of NOSE ROE functional VAS and aesthetic VAS by sex (P > 0.05). There was a statistically significant positive relationship between ROE difference before and after surgery and functional VAS difference (r = 0.544 P = 0.001). There was a positive correlation between pre-postoperative ROE difference and aesthetic VAS difference (r = 0.766 P = 0.001). The relationship between the pre-postoperative NOSE score difference and functional VAS difference was found to be significantly negative (r = -0.833 P = 0.001). The relationship between pre-postoperative NOSE difference and aesthetic VAS difference was also significantly negative (r = -0.475 P = 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between ROE difference between before and after surgery and NOSE difference (r = -0.640 P = 0.00). The disease-specific quality of life assessment forms used to evaluate patient esthetic and functional satisfaction correlate significantly with nasal obstruction and ROE.;2016
The amount or quality of available septal cartilage may be inadequate for grafting in some rhinoplasty patients. In such cases auricular or costal cartilage may provide an additional source of cartilage. Crushed septal cartilage has been shown to be useful for dorsal onlay grafts. We aimed to investigate the effect of different degrees of crushing on the viability of human auricular and costal cartilage. Ten auricular and 10 costal cartilage grafts were obtained from 20 patients during secondary rhinoplasty. Each graft was sectioned into five pieces. One of the pieces was left intact and the remaining four were prepared as slightly moderately significantly and severely crushed. Viability and proliferation rates of chondrocytes in cell cultures were evaluated. Mean viability rates on day 1 for intact slightly crushed moderately crushed significantly crushed and severely crushed auricular cartilages were 70% 67% 65% 58% and 45% while those for costal cartilages were 65% 63% 59% 55% and 53% respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the viability rates of the similarly crushed auricular and costal cartilage groups on days 1 2 3 and 10. The viability of crushed human auricular and costal cartilage grafts depends on the degree of crushing applied. (C) 2010 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.;2011
The anatomy of the nasal muscles contributes a social harmony in aesthetic rhinoplasty because these muscles coordinate the nose and the upper lip while smiling. Sometimes this coordination can be interrupted by the hyperactivity or variations of these muscles and may result as a deformity because of their dynamic functions and relations with the nose. In our daily practice we usually perform the rhinoplasty without considering the dynamic functions. When the patients recover the muscle functions after operation and start to use their mimics such as smiling the undamaged dynamic forces may start to rotate the tip of the nose inferiorly in a long-term period correlated with their preoperative function. To avoid this unexpected rotation it is essential to remember preoperative examination of the smile patterns. To manage this functional part of rhinoplasty we aimed to clarify the smiling patterns or deformities mainly focused on depressor septi nasi muscle in this article. This muscle creates downward movement of the nasal tip and shortens the upper lip during smiling. The overactivity of this muscle can aggravate the smiling deformity in some patients by a sharper nasolabial angle correlated with levator labii superioris alaeque nasi and orbicularis oris muscle activities. The article not only stresses the correction of this deformity but also aims to guide their treatment alternatives for correlation of postoperative results and applicability in rhinoplasty.;2014
The anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct (NLD) in relation with the lateral nasal wall was studied in 15 half-heads of human adult cadavers by serial photographs of the dissection of the lateral nasal wall. The aim of the study was to determine the intranasal anatomical relationships of the NLD with the lateral nasal wall for surgical reference during endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy. Following removal of the nasal mucosa anterior to the uncinate process the exposed bone was removed by drilling. The entire NLD was exposed intranasally. The relationships of the NLD with the maxillary sinus ostium and anterior nasal spine were determined and the length of the NLD was measured. The morphology of the NLD opening was observed and its distance from several landmarks were measured. There were three types of intranasal orifice: pin-point triangular and slit-like. The NLD is located on average 24.6 +/- A 3.56 mm posterior to the anterior nasal spine. The nearest distances between the opening of the NLD and the nasal floor and between the opening of the NLD and the most anterior attachment of the inferior nasal concha were 13.7 +/- A 3.15 and 14.3 +/- A 2.05 mm respectively. The length of the NLD was 21.9 +/- A 2.03 mm on average. The nearest distances between the NLD and the maxillary sinus ostium was 3.9 +/- A 0.88 mm. Cadaver dissections and the photographs of the fine dissections provide a more accurate description of the lateral nasal wall anatomy. These data provide valuable anatomical information to the surgeon performing endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy.;2010
The basic aim of our study is to compare the results of the conventional and piezoelectric osteotomy in rhinoplasty by complete subperiosteal degloving of nasal bone to minimize soft-tissue injury. The study was designed as a prospective double-blind randomized and controlled study. Setting is a tertiary referral hospital in Turkey. Ninety patients who underwent primary open rhinoplasty with osteotomy performed by either the conventional instruments or the piezoelectric device. The complete subperiosteal degloving of the entire nasal bone was done up to the nasal maxillary sulcus medial canthus and nasion in all patients independent of the type of osteotomy device used. Patients subsequently underwent median-oblique and lateral osteotomy either with an ultrasonic device or a conventional 2-mm guarded straight osteotome. The postoperative edema and ecchymosis were evaluated by another surgeon who was blinded to the osteotomy procedure on postoperative days 2 and 7. The edema scores were significantly increased on the second day compared with the seventh day in both groups 1 and 2. However there was no significant difference between groups. The ecchymosis scores were slightly higher in postoperative day 2 compared with day 7 in both groups 1 and 2 but statistically not significant. This study showed that the main reason edema and ecchymosis are seen post-rhinoplasty is related to soft-tissue injury during osteotomy.;2017
The Binder syndrome is a congenital anomaly mostly seen in females characterized by a flat facial profile and flat nose with absent nasal spine short columella flat nasal dorsum hypoplastic lower lateral cartilages (LLC) and septum class-III malocclusion and cleft lip and palate. A 26-year-old female patient with a Binder syndrome was referred to the clinic with a flat nasal dorsum hypoplastic LLC deformed nostrils and hypoplastic columella. She had a history of bilateral cleft lip and palate ocular strabismus hypothyroidism and growth retardation. An augmentation rhinoplasty with an open approach was performed in January 2019. The seventh costal cartilage and the rectus fascia were preferred as autologous grafts. An extended columellar strut graft was prepared and fixed to the nasal spine. Two lateral crural strut grafts was prepared and placed. The hypoplastic LLC were fixated to these grafts. A dorsal onlay graft was settled. Then the diced cartilage-fascia (DC-F) graft was prepared and it was settled in over the nasal dorsum. A smaller and spherical DC-F graft was constructed to be placed over the extended columellar strut graft for increasing the tip projection. One-year postoperative results of this case confirm that the DC-F graft conserved its volume and shape. The growth retardation has not been described in Binder syndrome in the current literature and this is the first case of nasal augmentation with DC-F graft in Binder syndrome. DC-F graft is a reliable alternative for the augmentation of the nasal dorsum in Binder syndrome. Level of evidence: Level V therapeutic study.;2021
The case of a 47-year-old patient with a nasal dorsum cyst excised via external rhinoplasty is described. The lesion was diagnosed as a mucous cyst. Only ten cases of mucous cysts on the nasal dorsum have been published to date all having developed post rhinoplasty. To our knowledge ours is the first case that is not associated with rhinoplasty. The external rhinoplasty approach permits better exposure and complete excision of the nasal dorsum masses and offers good esthetic results.;2000
The combination of dorsal nasal reconstruction and camouflage of surface irregularities is an important step in rhinoplasty. We hereby present our technique of delivering diced cartilage in combination with bone dust to the nasal dorsum using the patient's blood as a carrier. We advocate use of an autologous material (blood) as a scaffold for graft delivery dismissing the use of a foreign material or fascial wrapping of the graft. Using the patient's blood for this purpose not only stabilizes the graft into a malleable structure that is easily applicable to the nasal dorsum it also decreases the potential for reaction against foreign material.

The comparison of patient satisfaction with the use of diced cartilage graft wrapped in fascia (DCF) graft in composite versus dorsum augmentation-only reconstructions (DAOR) technical hints and complications in our series affecting the end-result and the patient satisfaction (PS) has been presented. Between 2013 and 2018 the DC-F graft is used in 32 rhinoplasty cases. Nine of patients have had composite reconstruction (CR). The DAOR has been needed for 23 of patients. The follow-up period has been 2 months to 3 years. The authors have obtained satisfactory results in 24 cases but some untoward progress in 8 cases. A questionnaire was prepared and asked all patients for the assessment of the satisfaction from appearance breathing self-esteem and positive psychological effect. The learning curve for rhinoplasty should be calculated for hump reduction crooked nose augmentation rhinoplasty and so on. separately which is also relevant for the use of a DC-F graft. Placing the DC-F over a straight platform choosing the accurate graft and fascia material wisely proper tailoring of DC-F sliding it under the skin-superficial musculoaponeurotic system properly etc. determine the quality of the end result and the degree of PS. Operating on the DAOR are relatively more comfortable compared to CRs but responses to our questionnaire denote higher degrees of satisfaction in CR cases. Utilization of the DC-F graft in secondary rhinoplasties for dorsum augmentation provides satisfactory results. The degree of PS with the DC-F reconstruction seems to have an adverse correlation with the extent of deformities that you start with.;2019
The comprehensive treatment of a patient with cleft lip and palate requires an interdisciplinary approach for functional and esthetic outcomes. A 20-year-old woman with bilateral cleft lip and palate had a chief complaint of unesthetic appearance of her teeth and the presence of oronasal fistulae. Her clinical and radiographic evaluation showed a dolichofacial growth pattern a Class II skeletal relationship with retroclined maxillary central incisors 5 mm of negative overjet maxillary constriction maxillary and mandibular crowding congenitally missing maxillary right incisors and left lateral incisor and a transposed maxillary left canine. Her treatment plan included the extraction of 3 premolars maxillary expansion segmental maxillary osteotomy repair of the oronasal fistulae rhinoplasty periodontal surgery and prosthodontic rehabilitation. To obtain a better occlusion and reduce the dimensions of the fistulae orthognathic surgery comprising linear and rotational movements of the maxillary segments (premaxilla right and left maxillary alveolar segments) in all 3 axes was planned by performing 3-dimensional virtual surgery on 3-dimensional computerized tomography. At the end of the interdisciplinary treatment a functional occlusion a harmonious profile and patient satisfaction were achieved. Posttreatment records after 1 year showed stable results.;2014
The concept and technique of using high-density porous polyethylene (HDPP) a nonresorbable synthetic material for nasal spreader grafts are presented. This material is thought to be particularly useful in revision (secondary or tertiary) rhinoplasty in which internal valve collapse frequently is confronted and septal cartilage often is unavailable because it has been harvested for spreader or other grafts. Sold as a thin plain sheet (0.85 x 38 x 50 mm) that can be cut to an appropriate size for spreader grafts HDPP is a ready-to-use material commercially available on the market. Because HDPP permits ingrowths of fibrous tissue inside and around it is a nonabsorbable material that stabilizes the upper lateral cartilages in their new position and maintains the appropriate internal valve angle. The authors used this material for 15 patients undergoing secondary (n = 12) and tertiary (n = 3) rhinoplasty because of valvular collapse. During the mean follow-up period of 16 months (range 8-30 months) neither complication nor recurrence of airway obstruction occurred.;2006
The coral or Madrepororia is a sea invertebrate with a skeleton morphologically and chemically very similar to mineral bone. In 1990 we implanted coral blocks sterilized by gamma irradiation into the nasal dorsa of ten dogs. Resorption and substitution with bone or fibrous tissue were observed within 6 months. Between 1991 and 1994 biocoral was used in 20 patients with saddle nose deformities in order to augment the nasal pyramid and dome. Two extrusions were observed in the early postoperative period during follow-up. One of these extrusions was related to trauma and necessitated removal of the implant. Our findings show that coral is a suitable alloplastic material that can be used in the correction of saddle nose deformities.;1997
The crooked nose is certainly among the most difficult to treat deformities for rhinoplasty surgeons. This deformity is a complex problem because each structural nasal component can be effected and they may be asymmetric bilaterally. Despite the use of sophisticated techniques and an additional effort unfortunately the long-term aesthetic results may not be perfect with some minor flaws. Here in this study the authors introduce a new technique that is used to correct crooked nose deformity. Sixteen consecutive patients who underwent open approach rhinoplasty by the same senior author between January 2015 and January 2018 with the diagnosis of C-shaped reverse C-shaped and I-shaped crooked nose deformity were included. The authors performed low-to-low lateral osteotomy with transverse root osteotomy to concave side (wider side) and low-to-high osteotomy to convex side (narrower side) combined with a unilateral spreader graft to concave side. Frontal images were taken preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively to use for further assessments. The authors compared the preoperative deviation angle values at rhinion (RDA) and at nasal tip (tip deviation angle) with postoperative values. In the study group RDA value showed significant decrease after surgery the preoperative RDA value was 6.2 degrees (1.66 degrees-16.39 degrees) and it was calculated as 2.44 degrees (0.7 degrees-5.77 degrees) with P<0.001 postoperatively. The changes at tip deviation angle were also significant (P<0.001) and tip deviation was successfully decreased from a value of 5.08 degrees (2.8 degrees-10.62 degrees) to 2.13 degrees (0.5 degrees-6.6 degrees) postoperatively. In conclusion this study offers a new and effective technique to correct crooked nose deformity that can be used safely with satisfying aesthetic results.;2019
The crooked nose is one that the vertical axis of the nose inclines from the midline. As a rule a major septal deformity almost always accompanies to impairing breathing and aesthetic appearance. To achieve total straightening of the crooked nose the septum must become the target of the treatment. To prevent redeviation we used rigid bone grafts instead of flexible and relatively weak cartilage to maintain the support of the corrected deformity. Between February 2005 and July 2007 9 patients (all male) with crooked noses underwent corrective surgery The mean age of the patients was 21 years (range 19-23 years). The source of the bone graft was medial side of iliac crest in all patients. The mean follow-up was 18 months ranging from 10 to 26 months. All patients had both functional and cosmetic problems. Mean operation time was 4 hours. Airway patency was improved in all cases. The grafts did not shift in any case and did not develop unsightly irregularities over time. Absorption of the grafts was not seen in the follow-up. There were no cases of extrusion or infection. No donor site complication occurred. None of the patient required secondary surgery. A residual deviation can be obvious despite all attempts which has no deleterious effect on patient satisfaction. This article introduces a novel technique for the correction of the crooked nose.;2008
The deviated nose is a particular challenge because both functional and aesthetic problems must be addressed. A most important challenge is resection of the hump. The nasal bones often are asymmetric in deviated noses. Several methods have been used for resection of the hump. Using the authors' method it is possible to calculate the extent of hump resection. Clinical analysis of the nasal deviation is performed preoperatively. Digital photographs are taken and all the landmarks are marked on the life-size photo prints. Planning begins on the deviated side. The ideal dorsal line is drawn and the extent of hump resection is planned according to the preoperative measurements. Measurements on the deviated side are applied to the other side using the medial canthi and the most prominent part of the alar creases as landmarks. Classical methods emphasize the importance of the chisel position during hump removal. According to the classical approach the chisel should be positioned lower on the deviated side to resect more bone. However there is no method for calculating how the chisel should be positioned exactly during hump resection. Therefore a precise plan has been devised to leave symmetric nasal bones after hump resection. The authors have applied this method in eight cases achieving satisfactory results.;2006
The digital world and social media are becoming increasingly important. Social media connect people together in a visual manner. Profile photographs are required by most social networking sites. A trend toward the increasing popularity of selfies on social media has rendered people more aware of their appearance. A selfie is a photograph that one takes of oneself usually employing a smartphone or webcam which is then shared on social media. Thus the demand for aesthetic procedures correcting imperfections such as a prominent nose has increased for which the technique is a rhinoplasty. Patients with reasonable expectations treated by skilled surgeons are usually very happy with the results. Rhinoplasty does not cure low self- esteem but does correct more visible imperfections of the face. Although some hope that a rhinoplasty will resolve many unwanted facial features besides nose problems it can only change the size and shape of the nose improving its form. However in the age of the selfie everyone wants to look better. Self- consciousness is increasing as are concerns over grooming and appearance at work and social events. These issues have become more important in recent years with the increase in selfie- taking people are now more aware of how their nose appears to others. In this review we discuss whether selfie- taking has triggered a rise in rhinoplasties along with a detailed survey of the literature.;2017
The extended spreader graft technique in septorhinoplasty is presented. The procedure involves applying spreader grafts before lateral osteotomies to support the whole osteocartilaginous vault. This study enrolled 51 patients who had undergone open septorhinoplasty between January 2010 and March 2012. The dorsal width ratio (DWR) was calculated for each patient by dividing the keystone width score by the intercanthal width score. The preoperative DWR scores classified 32 of the 51 noses as normal six noses as narrow and 13 noses as wide. All the patients with a nose classified as narrow preoperatively had a nose with a normal width postoperatively. All but one patient who had a normal preoperative DWR score also had a normal DWR score postoperatively. Of the 13 patients who had a wide nose preoperatively seven were classified in the normal-width group postoperatively. Although the remaining six patients had a positive DWR score change (DWR closer to 0.50) they still were in the wide-nose group postoperatively. All but three patients were satisfied with their cosmetic and aesthetic results. Inverted-V or open-roof deformities were not observed. For all 18 patients in the normal nasal width group preoperatively (18/32) the nasal dorsum seemed wide after lateral osteotomies due to the spacing effect of the graft. As a result of medializing the bones the caudal end of the graft became palpable. Although the graft position was checked perioperatively at the postoperative 6-month follow-up assessment three patients had palpable cartilages in the keystone area one of which needed a surgical revision. Extended spreader grafts applied before lateral nasal osteotomies can support the entire nasal dorsum including the bony vault. This spacing effect could be highly advantageous for both narrow and wide noses. In narrow noses these grafts prevent further narrowing of the osteocartilaginous vault and support the dorsal aesthetic lines. In wide noses extended spreader grafts fill the bone gap before lateral osteotomy and help to prevent open-roof deformity. In addition fixing the upper lateral cartilages before lateral osteotomies might further prevent bone collapses even after premature fractures. In normal-width noses after completion of the lateral osteotomies the bone gap usually does not persist and nasal bones push the cranial end of the spreader graft dorsally. Therefore in normal-width noses extending the graft along the bony gap is not necessary and the use of extended spreader grafts is not preferred.;2013
The first case of a postrhinoplasty cyst lined with unusual stratified squamous epithelium unlike the other published mucous ones is described in this article. There are two different theories accounting for this complication: namely mucosal herniation and the free graft theory. Although the cyst was very close to the marginal rim incision there was no connection between the cyst and vestibuler skin. Thus the free graft theory is more logical than the herniation theory to explain the development of this cyst.;2010
The hemodynamic effects of perioperative stressors including preoperative patient anxiety intraoperative local anesthetic/adrenaline infiltrations and some painful interventions have not been fully elucidated in plastic surgery procedures. The present study was designed to determine the hemodynamic effects of perioperative stressor events in American Society of Anesthesiologists class I patients undergoing rhinoplasty procedures under general anesthesia. The study included 50 healthy patients 18 to 51 years of age (mean age 27 +/- 7 years) who underwent a rhinoplasty procedure in the authors' department. All patients were connected to a digital ambulatory Holter recorder for 24 hours starting on the day before the operation and continuing throughout the procedure. All of the patients received 10 ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:80000 adrenaline 15 minutes after intubation. Observations consisted of heart rate noninvasive blood pressure and power spectral heart rate variability analyses the latter of which is indicative of the sympathovagal balance of the patients. The majority of patients developed a persistent moderate sinus tachycardia before the induction of anesthesia. After the infiltration of lidocaine/adrenaline a mild to moderate and short-lasting tachycardia was detected. A similar increase in pulse rate was also noticed during lateral osteotomies. No significant blood pressure changes attributable to perioperative stressors (with the exclusion of general anesthesia induction intubation and extubation) were observed. Sympathetic activity was found to be responsible from marked tachycardia before the induction which was attributable to preoperative anxiety. The authors' study has demonstrated that there are three hemodynamically unstable periods causing tachycardia for rhinoplasty patients that directly concern the plastic surgeon: immediate preoperative anxiety local anesthetic/adrenaline injection and lateral osteotomies. The authors conclude that these patients would benefit from routine use of premedications and that a lidocaine/adrenaline combination is a safe adjunct to general anesthesia in young rhinoplasty patients. In addition a deeper anesthesia during local infiltration and osteotomics would be appropriate.;2005
The interdomal fat pad (IFP) is an important structure related to tip deformity in rhinoplasty. This study aimed to evaluate the IFP by ultrasonography before surgery and to demonstrate the existence of the IFP as a distinct anatomic structure in cadavers and patients. Three dimensions of the IFP were measured in 23 patients using ultrasound before rhinoplasty and in 10 cadavers using dissection. All fat pads were examined by histopathologic methods. In the cadavers three dimensions of the IFP were found: 2.3 x 3.7 x 12.8 mm. In the patients three dimensions of IFP were measured by ultrasonography: 2.8 x 4.1 x 13.7 mm. Histopathologic examinations showed that the IFP is a structure differentiated from subcutaneous tissue. The IFP was demonstrated in all cadavers and patients by surgical and radiologic methods. All cases had a fat pad in the interdomal space with varying sizes.;2008
The internal nasal valve (INV) refers to the slit-like region between the caudal end of the upper lateral cartilage (ULC) and the nasal septum. It is the narrowest portion and primary regulator of the nasal airway. Reduction rhinoplasty decreases the nasal airway cross-sectional area and may cause symptoms unless additional surgical measures are taken. Rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty was performed for 76 patients with a nasal hump. using an external approach. As a consequence of the nasal hump removal the ULCs were separated from the septal cartilage. All patients underwent one of the three forms of cartilaginous nasal dorsum reconstruction: primary closure (PC) (50 patients) spreader graft (SG) (19 patients): or upper lateral splay graft (ULSG) (7 patients). ht least 3 months postoperatively INV obstruction was evaluated by asking the patients about nasal obstruction symptoms and visually examining the INV with an otoscope. Nasal obstruction complaints and INV constriction found among patients in the PC. SG and ULSG groups were 16 (32%). 2 (10.5%) and none respectively. The results of the PC group were compared statistically with the combined results of the SG and the ULSG groups. The patients in the combined SG-ULSG group had significantly less nasal obstruction complaints and INV angle constriction compared with the PC group. Due to the higher rate of postoperative INV stenosis PC should be avoided. The author uses ULSG when the septal cartilage appears straight and sturdy and SGs when the straightened septal cartilage looks weak and vulnerable. since SGs not only improve the INV but also reinforce the septal cartilage.;2000
The lacrimal drainage system (LDS) is vulnerable to surgical trauma during rhinoplasty. We aimed to investigate the possible effects of the low lateral osteotomies on the LDS during rhinoplasty using active transport dacryocystography (ATD) at the late postoperative stage. Twenty patients who underwent open rhinoplasty were evaluated by AM between the sixth and seventh postoperative months. Presence of the LDS dehiscence and the absence of the passage of the contrast material into the inferior meatus were noted as signs of injury to the LDS in ATD. The proximity of the osteotomy site to the LDS was measured using three different measurements in AM The distance from the lacrimal fossa to the lateral osteotomy site the distance from the inferior meatus to the lateral osteotomy site and the distance from the middle point of the lacrimal fossa and inferior meatus to the lateral osteotomy site were measured. The anatomic integrity of the bone structure around the LDS was preserved in all patients and free drainage of contrast media from the fossa lacrimalis to inferior meatus was observed in ATD evaluation of all patients. ne average distance from the LDS to the lateral osteotomy site was found to be between 7-8.8 mm. In conclusion the low lateral osteotomy is a safe method in order to avoid trauma to the LDS and ATD seems an appropriate diagnostic technique in evaluation of the LDS after rhinoplasty.;2004
The lateral crus plays a significant role in the aesthetic appearance of the nose. Excessive concavities of the lower lateral crura can lead to heavy aesthetic disfigurement of the nasal tip and to insufficiencies of the external nasal valve. The lateral crus of the alar cartilage may also cause a concavity of the alar rim and even collapse of the alar rim in severe cases. Surgical techniques performed on the lateral crus help to treat both functional and aesthetic deformities of the lateral nasal tip. We present a reverse plasty technique for the lateral crus and we evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of the technique.;2013
The long nose with a plunging tip is a deformity that involves an inferiorly rotated nasal tip leading to an increase in the length of the nose. The anatomic basis of the long nose with a plunging tip may be divided into two types. Type 1 presents a normal alar-cartilage complex inferiorly displaced by a long nasal septum and long upper lateral cartilages. Type 2 is caused by a dislocation of the alar cartilages downward from the aponeurotic attachments to the septal angle. During the study period the authors identified 60 patients with long noses and plunging tips. For 22 patients with type 1 long noses the high septal incision technique was used in 12 cases and the step technique in 10 cases. The invagination procedure alone was used for 22 of 38 patients with type 2 plunging noses. Also an extension graft with the invagination procedure was used for 6 patients and a columellar strut graft was used for 10 patients. A high septal incision increased tip rotation without significantly changing the amount of tip projection. However the step procedure the invagination technique alone septal extension graft with the invagination technique and columellar strut grafts increased nasal tip rotation and projection. During the study period 38 patients were identified as having a smiling deformity which was improved using the authors' modification procedure. On the basis of the results the authors recommend that the appropriate treatment for each patient with a long nose and a plunging tip must be determined by preoperative and intraoperative examination findings with the patient at rest and while smiling.;2006
The maintenance of desired tip projection and rotation is an important goal in rhinoplasty. In this study the effects of the columellar strut graft and septocolumellar sutures were evaluated in a follow-up period of 1 year. In half of 44 patients nasal tip was constructed with basic tip maneuvers and two septocolumellar sutures (Group-1 Suture Group) whereas in the remaining 22 patients a columellar strut graft was added for tip support (Group-2 Suture + Graft Group). Standardized right profile images were taken preoperatively 1 month postoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. Nasal tip projection was evaluated using Goode's method. For the evaluation of tip rotation the nasolabial angle was measured. The results were statistically compared and a p value lower than 0.05 was considered as significant. Between the postoperative first month to first year the loss of tip projection was 3.8% in Group-1 and 3.5% in Group-2 which was statistically insignificant (p value 0.942). The loss of tip rotation was found as 4.6A degrees (4.1%) in Group-1 and 4.6A degrees (4.0%) in Group-2 which was also statistically insignificant (p value 0.979). Considering the results of the study in most of the primary cases two septocolumellar sutures in conjunction with basic tip maneuvers are sufficient for positioning and stabilizing of the nasal tip and a short and floating columellar strut graft does not have any affect in maintenance of the desired nasal tip rotation and projection.;2017
The major goals in contour restoration procedures are to re-establish the desired contour with the use of resilient and durable materials that can be easily found and harvested. Cartilage grafts are commonly used for these purposes though they often possess a problem of donor site morbidity and shortage of quantity. The neo-cartilage formation capacities of both perichondrium and periosteum are well-known. We aimed to optimize both the amount and quality of the newly forming tissue from perichondrial and periosteal grafts. For this purpose the grafts were wrapped on themselves. Placement of oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) within graft layers was performed in two groups with the aim of giving support to the regenerating tissue and increasing the connective tissue formation within the graft layers. Three-month-old New Zealand white rabbits were used. Group 1 ear perichondrial and Group 2 calvarium periosteal grafts of 1.4 x 2.4 cm were harvested folded on themselves and sutured at the edges to create closed pockets. 0.8 x 0.8 cm sized ORC sheets were placed inside the pockets before wrapping in Group 3 perichondrial and Group 4 periosteal grafts. 0.2-mL autogenous blood was injected in each pocket. All grafts were transplanted under the abdominal muscle fascia and harvested after 6 weeks. Volumes and weights of wrapped perichondrial grafts were higher than their periosteal counterparts either with or without the inclusion of ORC. Grafts with ORC (Groups 3 and 4) were heavier than the grafts lacking ORC (Groups 1 and 2) in a statistically significant manner (P <= 0.01). Histologically the inclusion of ORC in both perichondrial and periosteal grafts resulted in an increased amount of fibrosis yet did not preclude neo-cartilage formation.;2006
The management of septal deviations is one of the major challenges for the surgeon due to variability of the etiology of nasal obstruction. In parallel with the advances in rhinoplasty techniques during the last three decades the treatment options for septal deviation increased tremendously. In this article a new anatomical and virtual division of the nasal septum known as segmental division is proposed. Additionally the management of deviations in the caudal and/or dorsal segment is presented. In traumatic and revision cases more difficult techniques necessitating the harvesting of conchal or costal cartilages are also demonstrated.;2013
The many benefits of the open-approach septorhinoplasty should not be excluded on the basis of columellar scarring alone. Technical factors that contributed to the favorable outcome of the columellar scar included proper planning of location and design of the incision used meticulous closure and good postoperative care. In the current study we describe a simple postoperative wound care procedure that allows clean visualized wound with less crust formation easy removal of the sutures by the surgeon and better columellar scar in the early postoperative period.;2010
The most serious form of nasal dorsum pathologies is saddle nose deformity. Vary of nasal dorsal augmentation grafts were reported in the literature but inferior bone graft (ITBG) alone has not attracted attention. The ITBG has advantages such as easy and fast harvesting easy to shape due to cancellous bone tissue. The graft technique is similar to the inferior turbinoplasty with the medial mucosal flap technique and can be performed without bioabsorbable hemostatic material (e.g. Turkish Delight) suture fixation or without tissue adhesives. Major complications of the ITBG technique are injury of the posterior lateral nasal branch of the sphenopalatine artery and subdermal mucous cyst that developing on nasal dorsum. Since easy application fast harvesting and similar permanence to cartilage grafts as augmentation material ITBG can also been used successfully in minor dorsal deficits in addition to saddle nose deformities.;2021
The nasal tip and columella are the two main key components that affect the results of a successful and aesthetically satisfactory rhinoplasty. A true hanging columella is a deformity in which the caudal border of the columella has a downward bowing appearance due to disproportion between the ala nasi and the columella which is usually congenital. In the management of this challenging deformity a thorough understanding and consideration of tip dynamics and the anatomical causes address the proper technique to be used. In this study we present our clinical experience with the medial crural tuck-up technique used on 53 consecutive patients with a true hanging columella. A total of 1421 patients underwent rhinoplasty between January 2005 and September 2011 53 of those patients (age range = 20-37 years mean = 27.3 years) who underwent this technique were involved in the study. Thirty-eight patients were followed up for more than 1 year. The results were evaluated by comparing postoperative photos with preoperative photographic documentation. The appearance of the nasal tip and columella remained fine and stable over the 1 year of follow-up. Despite its limitation of applicability in secondary cases the advantages of this technique are that it does not require conchal or costal cartilage and the desired tip rotation and projection can be done with ease.;2013
The nasal tip projection and rotation to be obtained with tip plasty play a key role in achieving successful results. Cartilage sparing techniques provide extra ease to reshape the cartilage in revision rhinoplasty. Freed dome cartilage eliminates the restricting forces of mucosa. The authors recommend to free the dome cartilage from mucosa during the tip plasty which ensures the desired dome shape and extra projection. A total of 218 patients who were operated between the dates of January 2017 and August 2018 were included in this study. About 3mm parts of the marked domes toward medial and lateral crurae were dissected from the mucosa. New domes were created with bilateral hemitransdomal sutures. The outcome of the operation was asked to the patients verbally and answers were recorded. Of 218 patients who were included in the study 182 were females and 36 were males. Patients had a mean age of 26.5 years. The length of follow-up was 11.8 months. About 205 patients had primary rhinoplasty while 12 patients had secondary rhinoplasty and 1 patient had revision rhinoplasty. Of the patients 89.9% (196/218) were very satisfied with the result and 7.4% (16/218) were satisfied whereas 2.7% (6/218) were dissatisfied. Only 5 patients who were dissatisfied with the result underwent revision rhinoplasty operation. The combination of the modified free dome suture with the mucosal dissection in dome area provides achieving the desired tip projection and symmetry.;2020
The nasolabial cyst also known as Klestadt's cyst is a rare non-odontogenic soft tissue lesion of the nasal alar region. Aetiopathogenesis of the nasolabial cysts is controversial. Embryonic and developmental theories were considered at pathogenesis of the nasolabial cyst. In addition surgical or non-surgical trauma is one of the possible theories. This paper reports a case of a 33-year-old male patient that presented with bilateral nasolabial cysts after rhinoplasty and alar base reduction.

The nose anatomy is a functional and aesthetically important organ because of its three-dimensional structure visible location in the face region and its connection with the respiratory tract. Aesthetic and reconstructive nasal surgery requires correction of deformations in cartilage and bone structures as well as preservation of the natural connections between all subunits. The minimal mistake made can result in functional or aesthetically bad results. In this study the authors aimed to create an experimental nose model that help aesthetic and reconstructive nose surgery operations.;2018
The nose is one of the most operated organs in the body and its anatomy has been well defined by plastic and ENT surgeons. Although rhinoplasty is the most commonly performed operation in plastic surgery Some unexpected results and complications may be related to unknown or unclarified anatomical structures in the nose. We aimed to evaluate the interdomal region in four fresh cadavers and 24 patients who underwent open rhinoplasty. since the nasal tip area is the most difficult part of the rhinoplasty. Detailed cartilage and soft tissue interactions were studied in fresh cadavers. The existence of the interdomal fat pad Lis a separate anatomical structure was proven in necropsy specimens from cadavers using various histochemical dyes. Nasal tip ultrasonography was performed preoperatively in patients who underwent rhinoplasty. All patients had a fat pad in the interdomal space of varying sizes but fatty (bulbous) noses had larger fat pads. Interdomal fat pad tissue which Occupies the interdomal space was demonstrated by ultrasonography. The size of the fat pads varied from 1.2 mmx2.4 mm to 3.6 mmx5.2 mm. Anatomical observation and biopsies were performed during surgery. Finally surgical and radiological anatomy of the interdomal fat pad was demonstrated in all cadavers and patients. We speculate that the interdomal fat pad is an important anatomical structure and may contribute to unexpected postoperative results in rhinoplasty. This newly defined fat pad can be assessed by ultrasonography. a safe and inexpensive technique. The surgical approach to the interdomal fat pad is solely through open rhinoplasty technique. Thus a consideration of the interdomal fat pad and detection of its size preoperatively may play a key role in choice of technique and success of rhinoplasty.;2004
The objective of this study is to provide a valid and reliable Turkish version of the original Standardized Cosmesis and Health Nasal Outcomes Survey (SCHNOS). The SCHNOS questionnaire was translated from English to Turkish using standardized guidelines. Participants completed the questionnaire twice with an interval of 7 to 10 days. Reliability and validity analyses were performed based on these answers. Differences between the rhinoplasty and control groups the internal consistency of the instrument (Cronbach's alpha coefficient) and the strength of association between the two repeated measures (Pearson's correlation coefficient) were analyzed. Of the 188 included individuals (106 females 82 males mean age 28 +/- 8.4 years) 97 were in the rhinoplasty group and 91 were in the control group. The mean total SCHNOS scores were 0.6 +/- 0.4 and 29.4 +/- 8.9 in the control and rhinoplasty groups respectively and there was a statistically significant difference in total scores between the groups ( p <0.001). The internal consistency reliability of the scale was found to be highly significant (Cronbach's alpha=0.96 with a lower 95% confidence interval of 0.89). The test-retest correlation value was 0.95 for the total score and each item had a strong test-retest correlation ranging from 0.92 to 0.96. The Turkish version of the SCHNOS is a valid and reliable scale for evaluating both functional and cosmetic outcomes in Turkish-speaking patients undergoing rhinoplasty.;2019
The pathology of nasal tip complex remains as a problem to be solved in unilateral cleft lip nose deformity wherein open rhinoplasty and cartilage grafts are used frequently. For this reason the research for the treatment of cleft-side tip projection lost and ala depression still continues. Our technique is to put the cartilage graft at posterior dome area after the release of cleft-side ala from vestibular mucosa and skin to elevate the ala depression and tip projection. This technique has been used on 16 patients between the years 2003 and 2007. This technique different from the augmentation methods aims to increase the direct lateral crura's elastic support strength and to support the new position of alar cartilage. This method will particularly be helpful in obtaining the long-term results in delayed and serious cases.;2008
The patient who presents for aesthetic surgery possesses various demands depending on the characteristic properties of the individual. Evaluation of self-esteem body image and eating habits in patients of aesthetic surgery could help in understanding patients and their demands. We performed Rosenberg Scale Test for evaluation of self-esteem on 98 patients who presented for any kind of aesthetic surgery. Seventy-five patients who required no operation for body fat tissue were give body imaging scale and eating attitude scale tests. The results of the tests revealed an increase in the self-esteem of the patients but it was not statistically significant. There was a minor disturbance in the body imaging scale without any statistical significance (p > 0.05). The eating attitude of the patients indicated a disturbance with a ratio of 10% (p < 0.01) and these patients were referred to psychiatrists. Even if patients of aesthetic surgery have no disorder in the perception of their body images they reflect their aesthetic problems in their eating attitude however they have no problem in the fat tissue distribution of their body. The aesthetic imperfection could impede the normal daily life of a patient and adaptation to the social life and this defect is a health problem that should be solved as soon as possible.;2003
The reconstructive plan of full-thickness nasal defects should include recreation of internal nasal lining skeletal and cartilaginous Support and external cover. We performed nasal reconstruction combined with turn-over island nasal skin flap for nasal lining reconstruction in 12 patients who underwent full-thickness resection of nasal area because of skin cancer. The flap filled the nasal lining defect of the alar area and provided a good support for skeletal reconstruction. The external skin coverage which was enlarged according to the Subunit principle was restored by the forehead skin flap at the same operation. Enlarging the nasal defect according to the subunit principle and using the residual skin as a turn-over skin island flap for nasal lining combined with forehead skin flap for external coverage provides an excellent nasal reconstruction in a single operation.;2008
The results from segmental fourth metatarsal bone reconstruction of significant nasal dorsal defects are described. Solid bone graft reconstructions frequently lead to an unnatural hardness of the nasal tip. Rib cartilage reconstructions are pliable and soft but pose a problem because they easily undergo warpage. The operation is performed using the open approach. An outer fourth metatarsal bone graft used for the bone component extends at least two-thirds of the dorsum length. It is secured in place with a compression screw and a Kirschner wire. The cartilage component comprises an abbreviated L-strut constructed of septal cartilage. It is slotted into the metatarsal bone in a tongue-in-groove manner and sutured to it through a drill hole in the bone. The dorsal profile is completed in this manner.;2006
The short distance of the nasal tip from the alar crease indicates inadequate projection. Tip grafts are commonly used for the management of this problem. In addition to tip grafts labiocolumellar augmentation by cartilage grafts also provides further elevation of the tip complex for patients with poor tip definition excessive alar base width inadequate tip projection or plunging nasal tip. In addition to standard rhinoplasty procedure and tip grafting for nasal tip augmentation a linear cartilage graft was inserted centrally just behind the labiocolumellar angle for further tip elevation. The graft was placed in the subdermal plane just anterior to the orbicularis oris muscle to prevent graft displacement and clicking during muscle motion. This procedure was performed for 45 rhinoplasty patients only three of whom underwent tip plasty procedures alone. During I year 43 patients were followed up. Most of the patients (75%) were satisfied with the results of the procedure. Tip graft combined with labiocolumellar graft is an effective technique for obtaining satisfactory tip projection and correcting the acute labiocolumellar angle.;2003
The soft triangle is a basic yet delicate and vulnerable subunit of the nose that is under-rated both academically and surgically. The soft triangle is located at the apex of the nostril at the point where the dermis is in direct contact with dermis that contains no intervening subcutaneous tissue and it may be unintentionally harmed during rhinoplasty.The authors suggest using a modified incision and closure and filling with significantly or severely crushed cartilage to prevent notching and to provide support for the soft triangle. The more the authors understand the nature of the soft triangle the more they will be able to obtain superior surgical results in the nasal tip area.;2016
The study hypothesized the potential positive effects of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in postoperative rhinoplasty patients such as better wound healing less dead space and less edema. The authors assessed PRF for nasal dorsum camouflage and studied its potential effects on nasal dorsal skin in rhinoplasty. Thirty-eight patients who underwent open approach primary rhinoplasty were categorized into two groups: nasal dorsal PRF group and control group. PRF membrane was used for nasal dorsum camouflage and laid over the bony dorsum and cartilage framework of the supratip area. Skin and subcutaneous soft tissue thickness were measured by linear superficial tissue ultrasound at the pre- and postoperative first week and the third month in both groups. Mean skin thickness over the supratip area was significantly higher in the control group in the first-week control. There were no significant differences in both first-week and third-month controls' nasal dorsum mean skin thickness measurements between the two groups. Regarding PRF complications we encountered no complications in either group including scarring hematoma infection skin discoloration and acne. The authors present the application of PRF membrane over the bony dorsum and cartilage framework of the supratip area. They observed its positive effect on postoperative edema especially in the early postoperative period. Long-term investigations have to be performed to evaluate its potential effect on the rhinoplasty procedure. This was a level of evidence 3 study.;2019
The use of cameras in the operating room is increasing. However there is not always a free person or an assistant who is familiar with your camera. In order to take faster and high quality photographs in the operating room we use under water camera cases. These cases are produced for each type of camera and can be gas sterilized prior to operation.;2008
The viability of cartilage grafts has been well documented however controversy still exists about the viability of crushed cartilage. Recently there has been a tendency to use diced cartilage grafts wrapped with oxidized regenerated cellulose (Surgicel) sheets for improving dorsal contour in rhinoplasty. The viability of diced cartilage grafts and the effect of Surgicel on cartilage grafts are not well known. In this study we used ear cartilage from 18 Neu Zealand rabbits. Cartilage grafts were transplanted to surgically created subcutaneous pockets on the back of the rabbits on both the left and right sides. There were three groups: (1) intact cartilage grafts (2) crushed cartilage grafts and (3) diced cartilage grafts. The grafts that were transplanted to the right side were wrapped with Surgicel. Cartilage grafts in all groups were viable. In grafts that were wrapped with Surgicel a marked increase in the collagen content was investigated. Grafts that were wrapped with Surgicel demonstrated no evidence of proliferation whereas the bare cartilage grafts demonstrated significant amounts of proliferation.;2001
The visibility of cartilage grafts underneath the skin is a complication of rhinoplasty particularly in patients with thin nasal skin. Preparing the graft with optimum dimensions symmetry and smoothness is crucial for the fine crafting of the cartilage to prevent visibility. The camouflage of the visible cartilage graft with a crushed cartilage a resected cephalic portion of the lower lateral cartilage fascia connective and/or fatty tissues is another option for hiding the visibility. The nasal tip is the most common location where the graft visibility is of concern. The authors introduce the smoothing of the cartilage graft by sanding it with a scalpel. This technique safely provides perfection and precision of smoothing of the cartilage in very desired shape. It is possible to obtain 3D super clean-cut shining surface. The tangential sculpting of the cartilage graft with a scalpel carries the risk of over resection. However the sanding with a scalpel moves forward so gentle that over resection is not possible. It is also possible to smooth non-visible structural grafts such as strut and spreader grafts to reduce surface irregularities. Additionally the sand-dust caused by cartilage sanding is a 'cartilage pate' which can be used for camouflage of minute irregularities of the nasal dorsum.;2019
There are many causes of septal injury or saddle nose. A variety of materials like autografts or exogenous ones have been used for reconstruction. Cartilage grafts are usually used for reconstruction. The reconstruction material should be strong enough to reshape the nose but also easy to reshape (cut or crop) and the cartilage should be thick enough to allow cosmetic shaping. A new technique for total septal reconstruction is presented in this paper. From the experience of these three cases. The method described here has two significant advantages. This method provides better stability and strength and also allows for easy reshaping or cropping of the cartilage it seems to be an easier method to reconstruct the septum with good results.;2015
There are several anthropometric studies regarding the nose however none of them involves data about a statistical shape analysis. In this study a landmark-based geometric morphometric technique was used to analyze the nasal shapes in a young Turkish adult population. A population of 75 female and 75 male volunteer Turkish young adults whose ages ranged 18 39 years (24.82 +/- 5.64 year) was examined. The stratified sampling method was used to determine the subjects according to the seven main geographic regions of Turkey. All data was obtained from standardized digital photographic images taken from anterior lateral and inferior aspects by using standard anthropometric measurement methods. Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis (EDMA) is used to calculate all possible linear distances among landmarks by creating matrixes for each subject. Today the anthropometric methods and surgical practice intersected at a point to treat the congenital or post-traumatic facial disfigurements in various racial or ethnic groups. Rhinoplasty surgeons require access to facial databases based on accurate anthropometric measurements to perform optimum correction in both sexes. There should be some points brought to mind during the cosmetic nasal surgery for men because of different expectations which is not technically different from the one for women. This study is a way to clarify these important points and a basis for further clinical studies enhancing the plans of the corrective surgery.;2007
There is a growing belief that people who undergo aesthetic procedures such as rhinoplasty and breast augmentation are more prone to social media addiction. In the present research we aimed to compare the level of social media addiction between women who underwent breast augmentation surgery and age- and education-matched controls. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria 52 women who underwent breast augmentation surgery and 50 age- and education-matched healthy women participated in the study. These groups were compared with respect to social media addiction self-esteem and body satisfaction. The case group had significantly higher scores on the social media addiction scales (SMAS) than the control group (p= .001). A total of 40 (76.93%) patients in the case group scored above the cutoff point of 74 on the SMAS compared to 21 (42%) individuals in the control group. The prevalence of addiction was higher in the case group (p = .001). The present study is the first to demonstrate a higher rate of social media addiction in the special population of breast augmentation surgery patients. As this surgery is elective rather than vital surgeons should screen the psychological status of women who undergo this surgical procedure.;2021
There is a rich blood flow to the mucosa in the nasal region. In rhinoplasty surgical procedures are performed in a narrow and confined space. So bleeding during surgery reduces visibility which can complicate the procedure. This study investigated the effects of the patient position on amount of intraoperative bleeding during surgical procedures. This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 71 patients who underwent elective rhinoplasty. The patients were operated on in three groups. Group 1 consisted of 23 patients who were operated on in the supine position Group 2 included 28 patients who were operated on using a 15A degrees angle reverse Trendelenburg position Group 3 consisted of 20 patients who were operated on at a 20A degrees angle reverse Trendelenburg position. There were statistically significant differences between the groups in regard to surgeon satisfaction and the amount of intraoperative bleeding. The amount of intraoperative bleeding in Group 1 was significantly higher than those of Groups 2 and 3 and surgeon satisfaction was lower. Reverse Trendelenburg position reduces intraoperative bleeding in rhinoplasty patients while facilitating the procedure compared to the supine position. Surgery at a 15A degrees angle reverse Trendelenburg position provides the optimum working conditions by both significantly reducing intraoperative bleeding and allowing for comfortable conditions for the surgeon.;2016
Thinness of nasal dorsum skin and subcutaneous tissue underlying nasal dorsal skin are the major factors related to the visibility of small irregularities. Here the authors discuss the use of bare fragmented cartilage grafts in managing nasal dorsum and the results obtained.Eight hundred fifty-six patients were operated for rhinoplasty between September 2009 and September 2014. Fragmented cartilage grafting over the nasal dorsum was performed in 781 of 856 patients. In total 214 patients who were followed up regularly were evaluated. Nasal dorsum management of 182 out of 214 patients was performed as is described here and is included in this study. The authors fragmented the cartilage grafts with Kocher clamp until the fragmented cartilages do not exhibit resistance which are then placed over the nasal dorsum and can be shaped easily by external manouevers.Follow-up period ranged from 6 to 36 months. There was no seroma formation infection or abscess formation during the postoperative follow-up period. Four patients required a secondary operation for nasal dorsum management. The irregularity was corrected by simple rasping. The rest of the patients were satisfied with their nasal dorsum appearance. Nasal dorsum management with fragmented crushed cartilages showed durable results during the follow-up period.The authors use fragmented cartilage grafts in nasal dorsum management and do not wrap them into endogenous or exogenous sleeve material thus preventing the delay for vascularization of cartilage grafts which is directly related to obtain durable results. By this way durable results and smooth nasal dorsum can be maintained.;2016
This paper presents a method in which bone or cartilage grafts are fixed to the septal cartilage with cyanoacrylate-based tissue adhesive for the treatment of septal deviation. A prospective study was designed to show the effectiveness of the technique. Cyanoacrylate-based tissue adhesive was used to fix the cartilage or bone grafts onto the septal cartilage to straighten deviated septal cartilage in 77 patients. Regarding the patients' preoperative and postoperative nasal respiration the following were assessed: (1) Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scales (2) patient satisfaction with postoperative nasal respiration using visual analog scoring and (3) computerized tomographic images. The patients were followed up for 29 months on average. Patients' respiration-related problems resulting from septal deviation were relieved in all but four patients. Clinically and radiologically the straightened septums preserved their new forms and it was detected with computerized tomography that the bone grafts had acquired permanency. In addition the NOSE scores improved significantly compared to their preoperative levels. In cases in which the use of bone or cartilage grafts is chosen to straighten the deviated septal cartilage fixation of grafts with cyanoacrylate (CA) tissue adhesive is a quick instantly effective and reliable method. CA which enables the subsurface of the graft to have complete contact with the septal cartilage provides extra benefit by transferring all of the reformative forces of the grafts to the septal cartilage.

This prospective randomized study investigated the effects of preoperative hypnosis on hemorrhage and pain in open septorhinoplasty (SRP). Twenty-two patients undergoing SRP under general anesthesia were included and equally divided into two groups. Patients in the hypnosis group (HG) received a total of three sessions of hypnotic induction. The first two sessions occurred 3 days and 1 day prior to surgery respectively and the last session was in the hospital the day of surgery. The other 11 patients constituted the control group (CG). Compared with the CG the HG's intraoperative use of total remifentanil and the visual analog scale scores at the 2nd and 3rd postoperative hours were significantly lower (p < .05). Hypnosis did not affect the quality of the surgical field. However preoperative use of hypnosis decreased intraoperative remifentanil requirements and postoperative pain.;2019
This study aimed to compare the effects of combined and noncombined lidocaine with adrenaline infiltration in general anesthesia (GA) procedures in which the standard anesthesia depth is monitored by Bispectral Index monitoring on minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) levels and the costs. Following approval by the local ethics committee an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II group of 40 adult patients for whom elective rhinoplasties under GA were planned was divided into 2 double-blind randomized groups. In group 1 GA and lidocaine + adrenaline were administered whereas in group 2 only GA and adrenaline were administered. All the patients who had been taken to the operation room underwent electrocardiography and measurements of the peripheral oxygen saturation end-tidal carbon dioxide heart rate mean blood pressure and Bispectral Index monitoring. Using the operation time and the MAC% values the total consumed inhalation agent amounts were calculated and the cost difference was determined. The mean blood pressure values were lower in group 1 (P < 0.05). In group 1 the MAC% was 20.83% lower than that of group 2 the consumed desflurane amount was 20.29% and the cost was 20.29% lower than that of group 2 (P G 0.05). In rhinoplasties under GA the lidocaine + adrenaline combination infiltration not only decreased inhaled anesthetic requirement and cost but also supported the hemodynamic stability. In addition surgical satisfaction increased in the lidocaine + adrenaline group because of small number of agitated patients during the recovery period.;2011
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a novel adjustable closed-loop sewing machine lock stitching technique on cartilage shape. This study was performed on 18 rabbits that were divided into 3 groups to evaluate the short- (Group I) medium- (Group II) and long-term (Group III) effects of the technique on cartilage shape. Three cartilage grafts were obtained from the right and left ears of the rabbits and measured angularly. For the cartilage grafts obtained from the right ears contours were corrected using the stitching technique proposed herein. The cartilage grafts obtained from the left ears were not stitched these were maintained as the control group. Angular measurements were performed for the stitched cartilage grafts and all the cartilages grafts obtained were finally embedded into the rabbits' backs. The rabbits in Groups I II and III were euthanized at week 2 6 and 12 respectively after which the cartilages were reevaluated for angular measurement and submitted for histopathological examination. A significant improvement from baseline was detected in the angular measurements of the stitched cartilage grafts obtained from the rabbits in each group. For the stitched cartilage grafts obtained from Group II and III rabbits the angular measurements obtained immediately after stitching were found to be better than those obtained after euthanasia. In histopathological evaluation elevated collagen perichondrium and connective tissue levels were detected in grafts obtained from Group Ill rabbits. The novel stitching technique proposed herein appears to have beneficial long-term effects on the maintenance of cartilage contour.;2019
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between low back pain and performing rhinoplasty and presents the data related to the prevalence of low back pain among the otorhinolaryngologists included in a sample. The questionnaire prepared by the researchers was completed by volunteer otorhinolaryngologists who participated in the 22nd International Rhinocamp Congress. The questionnaire prepared to investigate low back problems contained items to obtain the demographic features of the participants whether they were performing septorhinoplasty how many years they had been performing this procedure whether they had any problem (ache pain or discomfort) in the lumbar region whether they had been hospitalized or had surgery due to this problem low back pain frequency and intensity and the presence of low back pathologies (e.g. protrusion perforated disc and bulging) detected by magnetic resonance imaging. The research was performed with the participation of 110 otorhinolaryngologists of whom 37.3% (n = 41) were women and 62.7% (n = 69) were men 79.1% (n = 87) were performing rhinoplasty surgery and 69.1% (n = 76) had low back pain. Low back pain was reported in 72.4% (n = 63) of the doctors performing rhinoplasty and 56.5% (n = 13) of those who did not perform this surgery. There was a statistically significant relationship between the presence of low back pain and whether the doctors performed rhinoplasty surgery (chi(2) = 4.151p = 0.042 [< 0.05]). In addition the complaints of low back pain were affected by the number of years the doctors had been performing rhinoplasty (p = 0.001 < 0.01). Low back pain was found to be frequent among otorhinolaryngologists performing rhinoplasty. Training exercises and performing the operation in a position that will prevent the occurrence of lower back pain can improve quality of life and minimize labor loss caused by pain among rhinoplasty surgeons.;2021
This study aimed to prospectively evaluate patient satisfaction by means of the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaire before and after functional septorhinoplasty. We carefully selected 62 patients (mean age 31.8 years 28 men 34 women) who underwent open functional septorhinoplasty in the Otorhinolaryngology and Head Neck Surgery Department of Suehri State Hospital. Satisfaction analyses were carried out by means of the ROE questionnaire both before the surgery and at least 4 weeks after the surgery. Patients were divided according to age (25 vs >25 years) and follow-up duration (6 vs >6 months). In addition patients were grouped according to their satisfaction scores: 0 to less than 50 bad outcome (group B) 50 to less than 75 good outcome (group G) and 75 or greater perfect outcome (group P). The mean satisfaction score in all the patients significantly increased after functional septorhinoplasty (from 24.8 +/- 14.6 to 70.1 +/- 17.3 P < 0.001). Moreover the increment in mean satisfaction scores did not differ with age or follow-up duration. We conclude that the ROE questionnaire can help surgeons select suitable candidates for functional septorhinoplasty who will most benefit from the surgery.;2014
This study aims to focus on one of the lesser mentioned topics in discussions of aesthetic nose operations the soft triangle. In addition to outlining the characteristics of the area the various complications specific to the soft triangle are discussed along with methods and techniques utilized by the authors to avoid such complications. One hundred twenty-seven of 841 (15 %) patients who were assessed both preoperatively and intraoperatively for the presence of an anatomical issue of the soft triangle were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups according to their anatomical features that were identified intraoperatively. The preoperative and postoperative photographs of all patients were compared to assess the effects of the respective soft triangle grafts on both nostril length and the nostril/lobule harmony. The average follow-up time of the patients was 27 months (6-60). Postoperative notching (of various degrees) was found in six (6/127) total patients: one (1/31) patient in the first group two (2/24) patients in the second group and three (3/72) patients in the third group. Neglecting the soft triangle area might yield grim results in terms of cosmetic and functional aspects. To avoid these problems incisions should be planned purposefully and patients who have anatomically weak support should be identified so that additional precautions should be taken for these cases.;2015
This study aims to investigate the relationship between individuals' attitudes about acceptance of aesthetic surgery (e.g. rhinoplasty autoplasty blepharoplasty and mammaplasty) and some of the worship practices in Islamic religion such as performing prayer fasting and going to pilgrimage. Although many people think that aesthetic surgery is inappropriate in Islamic religion no studies in the literature were found to have investigated this issue. This study collected data through a questionnaire administered to 96 patients who applied to our Plastic Surgery Clinic and underwent various surgical operations and 96 patients who were recommended plastic surgery but rejected to have one the questionnaire aimed to identify the participants' frequency of religious worship practices and appropriateness of aesthetic surgery to their beliefs. The participants responded on the frequency of religious worship levels according to the options in the questionnaire. The Acceptance of Cosmetic Surgery Scale was utilized in order to identify their attitudes towards aesthetic surgery. Levels of performing prayers fasting and going to pilgrimage in the groups that accepted surgery and in the groups that rejected surgery were significantly different (p < 0.001 p = 0.008 p < 0.001). In two different groups the Acceptance of Aesthetic Surgery Scale scores were significantly different within the prayer groups and fasting groups (p < 0.001 p < 0.001 p = 0.001 p < 0.001). While the group that accepted surgery indicated no significant differences between those who thought about going to pilgrimage and who did not (p = 0.650) there was a significant difference in the group that rejected surgery (p < 0.001). While 14.6% of the participants in the group that accepted surgery considered aesthetic surgery a sin this proportion was 56.3% in the group that rejected surgery and this difference was significant (p < 0.001). In both surgery groups there were differences in the scale scores of those who considered aesthetic surgery a sin and those who did not (p < 0.001 p < 0.001). There was a significant relationship between worship practices one of the biggest indicators of the level of belief in Islamic religion and aesthetic surgery attitudes. However despite the fact that belief levels affect the decision of having an operation in plastic surgery in case of serious health problems the decision of having an operation becomes more important religious beliefs.;2020
Tip plasty is an important procedure that contributes much to obtaining an aesthetically pleasant nose. To increase precision during the tip plasty procedure control over the lower lateral cartilages should be maximized. This can be accomplished by extending the exposure of the cartilage framework. We present our Freed Lower Lateral Cartilages With Intact Lateral Attachments approach through which inferior lateral cartilages are being dissected free from their attachments while only their lateral bases (lateral crural parts) are left intact. A total of 1752 consecutive patients operated on with this approach were included. All patients were cosmetic rhinoplasty patients operated on between the years 1999 and 2014. During tip plasty the lower lateral cartilages of all patients were totally dissected from all their attachments while the lateral bases were left intact. The suture and graft techniques for the tip plasty procedure were then applied to reconfigure the tip region. The approach was used successfully in 1752 patients in a 15-year period. The mean age of patients was 33.5 years. The complication rate was 6.4 % and the revision rate was 4.7 % for the patients. Only 1.2 % of patients needed a revision surgery for tip and/or alar region. None of these patients needed further revision. The aesthetic and functional outcomes revealed high satisfaction rates. The Freed Lower Lateral Cartilages With Intact Lateral Attachments approach in tip plasty facilitates manipulation of the tip region while maintaining precise control to provide definition in terms of symmetry and three-dimensional configuration. Furthermore it constitutes an autologous and practical platform on which nondestructive techniques can be performed in a combined and synergistic fashion.;2016
Tip rhinoplasty is a key component of aesthetic rhinoplasty. An understanding of the correlation between tip surface aesthetics and the underlying anatomic structures enables proper identification and correction of tip abnormalities. Surface aesthetics of the attractive nose are created by certain lines shadows and highlights with specific proportions and breakpoints. In this Featured Operative Technique the authors describe a stepwise process for tip rhinoplasty that conceptualizes aesthetic subunits as geometric polygons to define the existing deformity the operative plan and the aesthetic goals. Tip rhinoplasty is described in detail from initial markings through incisions and dissection. The autorim graft concept is explained and lateral crural steal and footplate setback techniques are described for the attainment of symmetric domes with correct lateral crural resting angles. Methods in columellar reconstruction are described including creating the columella (C') breakpoint and the infralobular caudal contour graft. The principal author (B.C.) has applied these techniques to 257 consecutive polygon rhinoplasties over the past 3 years.;2014
To compare conventional osteotomy with the piezosurgery medical device in terms of postoperative edema ecchymosis pain operation time and mucosal integrity in rhinoplasty patients. In this prospective study 49 rhinoplasty patients were randomly divided into two groups according to osteotomy technique used either conventional osteotomy or piezosurgery. For all patients the total duration of the operation was recorded and photographs were taken and scored for ecchymosis and edema on postoperative days 2 4 and 7. In addition pain level was evaluated on postoperative day 2 and mucosal integrity was assessed on day 4. All scoring and evaluation was conducted by a physician who was blinded to the osteotomy procedure. In the piezosurgery group edema scores on postoperative day 2 and ecchymosis scores on postoperative days 2 4 and 7 were significantly lower than in the conventional osteotomy group (p < 0.05). On postoperative day 2 the pain level was lower in the piezosurgery group than in the conventional osteotomy group (p < 0.05). In an endoscopic examination on postoperative day 4 while 24% of the patients in the conventional osteotomy group had mucosal damage no such damage was observed in the piezosurgery group. When total operation duration was compared there was no significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05). Piezosurgery is a safe osteotomy method with less edema (in the early postoperative period) and ecchymosis compared with conventional osteotomy as well as less pain a similar operation duration and no mucosal damage.;2017
To compare the cellular viability of diced crushed and morselized cartilage used in nasal surgeries. In this study cartilage was extracted from the ears of seven New Zealand rabbits and was subsequently either diced crushed or morselized to an amorphous state or left unmodified. The four types of grafts were then implanted in the back regions of the rabbits. After 3 months the cellular viability from four groups was compared to a control group using confocal microscopy. Analysis of the data obtained from the enumeration of live cells showed no statistically significant difference between the unmodified graft group and the control group. The diced crushed and morselized cartilage groups did show a statistically significant difference in terms of live cell count with the highest number of live cells in diced cartilage group. A statistically significant decrease in live cell count was detected in crushed cartilage group. Our study shows that the viability of cells in diced cartilage grafts is greater than those in crushed or morselized cartilage grafts.;2015
To correct saddle nose deformity diced cartilage grafts have been commonly used over the past decade. However following the correction of saddle nose deformity with diced cartilage graft some problems like graft absorption or displacement may occur which require revision surgery. Here a new technique is presented for correcting saddle nose deformity when diced cartilage graft fails. Twelve cases were admitted to my clinic with complaints of nasal dorsal irregularity and depressions asking for tertiary rhinoplasty. Seven (four women and three men) of these patients who had a gap smaller than 1 cm in the lower 1/3rd of nasal dorsum were selected for the described technique. After the nasal dorsum is undermined through the supra-perichondrial and subperiosteal plane the diced cartilage island attached to the nasal dorsal skin is released distally until the island can be transposed to the tip area. This island attached to the nasal dorsal skin proximally is formed as a flap and moved caudally as an advancement flap and sutured to the posterior of the dome area. The patients were followed for minimum 1 year (12-20 months) with intervals of 3 months. All the patients and also the surgeon were satisfied with the results. No complications such as resorption of the grafts were observed in any of the cases. This is an alternative new practical technique for correcting saddle nose deformity in the lower 1/3 of the nasal dorsum in which the diced cartilage graft technique has failed to correct. In addition tip projection and upward rotation can be achieved with this technique.;2015
To evaluate the effects of open rhinoplasty incisions on tip projection using digitized photographs. Thirty-one patients who underwent open technique rhinoplasty were prospectively included in the study. The lateral aspect photographs were taken before the operations. Following midcolumellar incision septal elevation was done until septal cartilage was shown. After replacing the skin totally back and suturing midcolumellar incision the intraoperative photographs were taken. The projection indexes were measured by Goode method from the photographs and the measurements were compared. A statistically significant decline of the nasal projection was established after open technique approach. Open rhinoplasty approach led to the decrease of the nasal tip projection. This result was thought to be the effect of ligamentous disruption.;2012
To examine the effects of single-dose dexamethasone use on edema ecchymosis and intraoperative bleeding in rhinoplasty a double-blind randomized trial with placebo control was planned. A total of 55 consecutive patients were included in the study. The dexamethasone (10 mg) was given intravenously just before surgery (preoperative group n=18) or at the end of surgery (postoperative group n=20). In the placebo group 17 patients received saline preoperatively or postoperatively. Intraoperative blood loss was recorded for each patient. Postoperative scoring of eyelid swelling and ecchymosis was begun after approximately 24 hours and lasted into postoperative day 9. Only for the first 2 days was the difference between steroid groups (preoperative and postoperative) and the placebo group statistically significant for a decrease in eyelid edema (p < 0.05). A statistically significant difference in upper eyelid ecchymosis for both preoperative and postoperative steroid groups versus the placebo group also existed in the first 2 days (p < 0.05). Preoperative or postoperative steroid administration had no influence on the ecchymosis of the lower eyelid. When the results of the preoperative and postoperative steroid groups were compared no significant difference was detected between the two groups in either edema or ecchymosis. To determine whether steroid use shortened the recovery period the days on which edema and ecchymosis reached a minimum level were compared among the groups no statistically significant difference was found among them. Using single-dose dexamethasone preoperatively did not alter in traoperative blood loss. Use of single-dose dexamethasone (either preoperatively or postoperatively) in rhinoplasty has a significant effect in decreasing upper and lower eyelid edema and upper eyelid ecchymosis for the first 2 days when compared with a placebo group. However the effect of dexamethasone was lost after the first 2 days and its use did not shorten the recovery period.;1999
To the plastic surgeon the nose is one of the most interesting and challenging facial structures and its anatomy is well defined. From the point of view of aesthetic surgery the nasal tip area is an especially important structural unit and the most difficult to address in rhinoplasty. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the existence of the nasal interdomal fat pad as a distinct anatomical structure that occupies the interdomal space and is apart from subcutaneous fat. In our study we proved the existence of the interdomal fat pad by histochemical studies and anatomical observations in 88 patients who underwent primary external rhinoplasty and three fresh cadavers. All specimens were examined by hemotoxylen-eosin Sudan black and oil red staining as well as S100 protein immunoreactivity staining. The mass of the interdomal fat pad was greater in patients with bulbous noses and/or divergent alar cartilage than in patients with thin skin. We speculated that the interdomal fat pad may be the major anatomic structure contributing to unexpected results in difficult cases such as those involving bulbous noses. According to our study the existence of the interdomal fat pad should be kept in mind during the preoperative planning of rhinoplasty.;2003
topic of interest and concern in rhinoplasty. Resection of even a minute amount of roof during hump removal disturbs the stabilizing effect of the upper lateral cartilages which then causes a fall of upper lateral cartilages medially toward the anterior septal edge restricting airflow at the internal valves and creating midvault problems. Methods: The resected alar cartilages were placed deep to the upper lateral cartilages as a strengthened spring to prevent midvault collapse and internal valve incompetency. Although weak and small alar cartilages are limitations of the technique the authors think that this is not so frequent because the total force exerted on the upper lateral cartilages by the spring graft is higher than the force of each individual two cartilage pieces. Results: It was easy to view the widening of the internal valve and the smooth appearance of the middle third of the nose intraoperatively. All patients were satisfied with the results both functionally and aesthetically. Conclusions: The spring graft technique a modification of the splay graft handles both the functional and aesthetic problems in the dorsal midvault. The spring graft with its advantages and disadvantages is a technique that solves the frequently encountered problems of incompetent internal nasal valve and midvault collapse without the need for a second donor site. It is a simple reliable technique that is easy to learn and execute and must be kept in mind in selected patients.;2007
Traditional open rhinoplasty leaves a scar on the columella. No one can say that this scar is invisible. It is less noticeable in Caucasian patients but it is a problem in non-Caucasian patients like in our country. To avoid such a scar and still obtain a wide exposure of the nasal framework the bilateral paramarginal incisions close to the columella were extended down to the nasal floors. The lower lateral cartilages forming the nasal tip could then be delivered out through one of the nostrils. An exposure similar to the traditional open rhinoplasty was then achieved. The technique has been used in 23 patients with satisfactory results. In conclusion the open rhinoplasty without transcolumellar incision can replace the traditional transcolumellar open rhinoplasty technique in selected patients.;2006
Transgender individuals are people whose gender identities differ from the gender they were assigned at birth. This case report aims to present the anesthesia management of HIV-positive transgender patient admitted to the plastic surgery clinic for mammoplasty and rhinoplasty operation. Transgender individuals may have difficulties in anesthesia management due to their clinical characteristics. Anatomical pharmacological and psychological aspects should be carefully examined in terms of anesthesia before the surgical procedure. In addition a multidisciplinary approach will benefit both anesthesia management and postoperative care;2021
Two main well-known approaches are used in rhinoplasty: open and closed techniques. This study aimed to define two new tip suture modifications that enhance and stabilize tip shape projection and position through an extended infracartilaginous incision with an open rhinoplasty exposure. This study investigated 56 consecutive primary rhinoplasty patients 18-51 years of age (mean age 27.8 years) who underwent surgery between June 2011 and June 2012 and had at least a 1-year postoperative follow-up period. Rhinoplasty was performed through an extended infracartilaginous incision with an open exposure. Transdomal suture modification for columella-lobular angle augmentation and a footplate repositioning suture for tip projection (and position) enhancement also were defined. A postoperative satisfaction survey was applied to all the patients at their 1-year follow-up visit. The postoperative satisfaction rate was 96 %. The nasal tip positions and projections of the patients were fine and stable in all the patients after a 1-year postoperative period. At this writing no over- or underprojection supratip deformity saddle-nose deformity or dorsal-surface irregularities have been encountered. Representative cases are displayed. This study defined two new tip suture techniques and combined them with an extended infracartilaginous incision. Also control of the entire nose and nasal valve area was possible through this incision. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Underrotation of the nasal tip with narrow nasolabial angle is a common nasal deformity that leads to a long nose appearance named drooping nose. In these patients there are various techniques described to correct droopy tip and to achieve a desirable nasal tip rotation such as lateral crural steal lateral crural overlay tongue-ingroove columellar strut graft tip rotation sutures cephalic trimming and others. In this study the effects of tongue-in-groove (TIG) and columellar strut graft (CS) and the contribution of cap graft on nasal tip rotation and projection were evaluated. Twenty-eight consecutive patients who underwent open approach rhinoplasty by the same senior author (ULD) between January 2015 and December 2016 with the diagnosis of septonasal deformity and droopy nasal tip were included. In 9 of these patients nasal tip was constructed with strut graft in 6 patients with both strut and cap grafts in 6 patients with TIG technique and in 7 patients with both TIG and cap graft. Standardized right lateral images were taken preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively to use for further assessments. The nasal tip rotation was evaluated by measuring nasolabial angle (NLA) and the nasal projection (NP) was evaluated by using the Goode method. Finally the postoperative values of NLA and NP at the 6th month were compared with preoperative recorded values in between groups. Each group showed increase at nasal projection however significance was present only in CS graft and TIG groups (P=0.011 and P=0.027 relatively). Each 4 groups showed significant increase in nasal tip rotation. In addition the comparison of percent changes between preoperative and postoperative NP and NLA revealed no difference (P=0.56 and P=0.431 relatively). In conclusion the authors argued that TIG and CS graft techniques are both reliable methods to correct droopy nasal tip and using additional cap graft over dome area when required is safe and useful.;2018
Understanding nasal anatomy and physiology are the most important points for successful functional rhinoplasty. Anatomic structures playing major roles in nasal breathing functions include the septum and internal and external nasal valves so physical examination of these regions is essential. Planning for functional rhinoplasty involves the identification of the sites of nasal airway obstruction or old trauma and addressing those regions during the operation with a number of different techniques that have been described.;2017
Variation in nasal-tip deformity is the most common complaint of the patients requesting rhinoplastic surgery and the goal of nearly every rhinoplasty is to achieve ideal nasal-tip rotation and projection. We describe a procedure that allows the surgeon to secure nasal-tip rotation and projection through a suspension suture technique. Preserving the interalar soft tissues over the dorsal caudal septum and interdomal ligaments during the surgery is the major basis of this technique. We use the soft tissues as a suspending material for the tip complex which acts like one whole part.;2010
Various alloplastic and autogenous materials have been used for dorsal nasal augmentation. Bone and cartilage autografts commonly are used. We used rib cartilage graft for dorsal nasal augmentation. The aim of this study was to investigate the longterm outcomes and patient satisfaction of dorsal nasal augmentation with rib cartilage grafts. Thirty-eight patients who had been operated on for dorsal nasal augmentation with rib cartilage graft were included in this study. Operation times postoperative complications and revision surgery were investigated by using hospital records. Anthropometric measurements were used for determining the resorption rate of cartilage graft. A questionnaire was used for the evaluation of long-term patient satisfaction. Evaluation of the patients' records showed that average operation time was 116 minutes and there were no complications such as pleural damage. The mean follow-up period was 27.4 months. Nine patients required secondary nasal surgery including soft tissue augmentation (n = 1) nasal tip revision (n = 3) and reshaping the cartilage graft (n = 5). Long-term anthropometric measurements comparing preoperative and postoperative values documented increases in both tip projection (4.2%) and nasal length (1.2%) and an increase in nasolabial angle of 8.2 degrees. Eighty-one percent of the patients who answered the questionnaire rated the nasal size as normal. Nasal symmetry and nasal shape were good in 75% and 66% of the patients respectively. Results of the rib cartilage grafts that are used for dorsal nasal augmentation are satisfactory for the patients and resorption rates are not high enough to change the shape of the nose.;2007
Various methods of surgical treatment are defined in nasal deformities that cause nasal obstruction. Open technique septorhinoplasty is a method that is frequently used for this purpose. This study aims to compare surgical results of open technique septorhinoplasty operations with and without osteotomies. In addition changes in the quality of life of patients before and after treatment were investigated and the effects of the 2 methods on patients' quality of life were compared. Methods: Patients with nasal deformity were included in the study. Forty patients with wide nasal dorsum and a prominent hump underwent septorhinoplasty with lateral osteotomy (group 1) and 35 patients with a narrow nasal dorsum and a minimal hump underwent septorhinoplasty without osteotomy (group 2). A Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) questionnaire was used to evaluate disease-specific quality of life for patients in both groups. Basic characteristics operative parameters and preoperative and postoperative NOSE scores were compared between the groups. Results: Demographic properties of the groups were similar. Intraoperative parameters and postoperative complications were not different between the groups with the exception of operation time (which was significantly longer in group 1) and ecchymosis (which was seen in whole cases of group 1 and none of the group 2). Preoperative NOSE scores were similar in both groups. Postoperative NOSE scores were 5 (0-45) in group 1 and 10 (0-45) in group 2 (P > 0.05). The NOSE scores were significantly decreased after the operation in both groups (P < 0.001). The 2 groups were not significantly different when comparing the change in preoperative and postoperative NOSE scores. Conclusions: Rhinoplasty with or without osteotomy is an effective treatment for alleviating nasal obstruction symptoms. Osteotomy is an integral but not obligatory part of the operation. The addition of the osteotomy procedure in selected cases prolonged the operation time and significantly enhanced patient satisfaction.;2014
Various techniques are used in rhinoplasty. These techniques can be classified under transcolumellar approaches and endonasal procedures. Open rhinoplasty without transcolumellar incision (ORWTI) procedure can be described as a combination of these two techniques. In this study we present patients who underwent nasal surgery utilizing one of these three techniques between 1999 and 2013 and discuss some modifications to the techniques. Of a total of 1526 patients 1131 were operated on with open rhinoplasty with transcolumellar incision 219 were operated on with ORWTI and 176 were operated on using the endonasal approach. With an average follow-up period of approximately 4 years 4 % of the patients required revision. The patient satisfaction rate was more than 90 % for all of these techniques. The endonasal approach is an appropriate choice for select patients due to the lower chance of complications and a shorter procedure time. With open rhinoplasty with the transcolumellar incision technique the type of surgery can be more easily controlled however extended nasal tip edema and columellar scar are some of the disadvantages of this method. ORWTI allows a patient to avoid these disadvantages and provides a more controlled procedure similar to the open method.;2015
Visual perception of symmetry is a major determinant of satisfaction after aesthetic rhinoplasty. In this study we sought to investigate the existence of any relationship between anthropometric characteristics of the face and visual perceptions of asymmetry among rhinoplasty patients and to evaluate tools that can shed light on patients who appear at high risk for exaggerating potential asymmetries. In the first part 168 rhinoplasty patients were asked to fill out the demographic questionnaire nasal shape evaluation scale and the somatosensory amplification scale. In the second part we examined the relationship between anthropometric characteristics of the face and visual perceptions of asymmetry using standardized photographs of 100 medical students. In the third part patients answered the rhinoplasty outcome evaluation questionnaire 6 months after the surgery. Objectively no symmetrical face was observed in the anthropometric evaluation. Subjectively only 73% and 54% of the faces were considered asymmetrical by the rhinoplasty and the control groups respectively. The rate of asymmetry perception was significantly greater in revision patients when compared with primary rhinoplasty patients. The relationship between the rate of subjective perception of asymmetry and the somatosensory amplification scale scores was statistically significant. We found a significant inverse relationship between the rate of asymmetry perception and the rhinoplasty outcome evaluation scores. Plastic surgeons should be aware of this high selectivity in asymmetry perception which is associated with poor postoperative satisfaction. Somatosensory amplification scale may help identify rhinoplasty patients at a high risk for exaggerating potential asymmetries.;2017
We aimed to evaluate the survival of a well-known camouflage technique using ultrasound imaging of the graft through the nasal dorsum and supratip. Twenty-two patients (8 women and 14 men) who underwent primary rhinoplasty performed by the same surgeon in Isparta Turkey between December 2013 and February 2015 were evaluated in this retrospective study. We used the remaining pieces of harvested septal cartilage during rhinoplasty as autologous graft material and venous blood mixture as a scaffold in a Turkish Delight fashion. We used a 10- to 14-MHz broadband linear ultrasound probe (Toshiba Aplio MX ultrasound system Toshiba Medical Systems Tustin California). The mean total skin thickness values through bone (nasal dorsum) and cartilage (upper lateral cartilage) were calculated for each patient. Data were recorded for statistical analysis. We evaluated the patients pre- and postoperatively on the seventh day first month sixth month and just before the end of the first year using ultrasonography. We made detailed ultrasonographic images of the skin and the underskin through the bone sculpture and compared the measurements. All patients were scanned at the same time of day to exclude diurnal variation of dermal edema. Patients who presented for primary functional rhinoplasty were included in the study. Nasal dorsum cartilage was significantly thicker on the seventh postoperative day but the difference was not statistically significant in the sixth month after surgery compared with baseline values. There was no statistically significant difference between preoperative measures and measures in the sixth month. The difference in supratip thickness was significantly greater on the seventh postoperative day and there was a large difference at the first month compared with preoperative values but this did not reach significance. There was no significant difference in supratip thickness between pre- and postoperative values at the sixth month. This method can be easily performed to reduce visual and tactual irregularities on the dorsum of the nose and can promote perfection on the dorsal esthetic line but it is not sufficient for augmentation.;2018
We have retrospectively evaluated the charts of 120 patients who had undergone rhinoplasties. The noses were divided into 2 types. Type 1 (42 cases) was characterized by a normal radix high dorsum and prominent vault. These noses were corrected by dorsal reduction lateral osteotomy when needed and caudal septal resection. Type 2 (78 cases) was characterized by a dependent tip with inadequate projection and a low radix with an excessive projected dorsal hump. These noses were corrected by tip support with cartilage graft and/or various suturing techniques and dorsal reduction. Secondary revision was necessary in 26 patients (21.6% of the total number) mostly due to inadequate septal correction in the first operation and irregularities of the dorsum. The postoperative result was considered as good in 88 (81%) fair in 27 (15%) and poor in 5 (4%) by the patients. Although the cases presented in this series were mostly difficult ones experience was found to be the major determinant in success while dealing with the challenging noses of the Black Sea Region.;2012
We investigated the effect of a combination of pregabalin and dexamethasone when used as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen on pain control after rhinoplasty operations. Sixty patients were enrolled in this study. They were randomly assigned into three groups: Group C (placebo + placebo) Group P (pregabalin + placebo) and Group PD (pregabalin + dexamethasone). Patients received either pregabalin 300 mg orally 1 h before surgery dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously during induction or placebo according to their allocation. Postoperative pain was treated with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (tramadol 20-mg bolus dose 45-min lockout time). The numeric rating scale (NRS) side effects and consumption of tramadol pethidine and ondansetron were assessed. The median NRS scores at 0 1 and 6 h after surgery were significantly higher in Group C than in Group PD (p < 0.001 for all). The 24-h consumption of tramadol and pethidine was significantly reduced in Groups P and PD compared to Group C (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01). The total tramadol consumption was decreased by 54.5 % in Group P and 81.9 % in Group PD compared to Group C (p < 0.001 for both). The incidence of nausea was higher in Group C than in Groups P and PD between the postoperative 0-2 and 0-24-h periods (p < 0.05 for both). The frequency of blurred vision was significantly higher in Groups P and PD than in Group C within the 0-24-h period (p < 0.05 for both). We found that the addition of a single dose of pregabalin and dexamethasone to multimodal analgesia in rhinoplasty surgeries provided efficient analgesia and thus decreased opioid consumption.

We investigated the effects of lateral osteotomy on nasal sound intensity levels in 34 patients who underwent rhinoplasty. Four groups were evaluated: group 1 preoperative rhinoplasty with lateral osteotomy (Preop-RPwithLO) group 2 postoperative rhinoplasty with lateral osteotomy (Postop-RPwithLO) group 3 preoperative rhinoplasty without lateral osteotomy (Preop-RPwithoutLO) and group 4 postoperative rhinoplasty without lateral osteotomy (Postop-RPwithoutLO). By sound analysis low-frequency (Lf 500-1000 Hz) medium-frequency (Mf 1-2 kHz) and high-frequency (Hf 2-4 and 4-6 kHz) nasal sound intensities were defined. Mf-left values of Postop-RPwithLO were significantly lower than those of Preop-RPwithLO and Mf-left values of Postop-RPwithoutLO were significantly higher than those of Postop-RPwithLO and Preop-RPwithoutLO. Hf-right values of Preop-RPwithoutLO were significantly higher than those of Postop-RPwithLO and Postop-RPwithoutLO. Hf-total values of Postop-RPwithoutLO were significantly lower than those of Preop-RPwithoutLO. Nasal airway width decreased and nasal sounds especially Mf sound intensities increased in the nonlateral osteotomy group (group 4). When lateral osteotomy is performed the nasal air passage may be adjusted as required by the surgeon the air passage in the nasal valve region may not be narrowed and nasal sound intensities may decrease. During postoperative follow-ups increased Mf and Lf nasal sound intensities should be considered for the narrowness of the nasal passage and lower patency of the nasal cavities. Nasal sound analysis is a noninvasive technique and can also be used to evaluate nasal patency in septoplasty and rhinoplasty patients and children and for cases in which official reports are needed in addition to acoustic rhinometry measurements.;2014
We investigated the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in rhinoplasty or endoscopic sinus surgery patients. Patients received either oral placebo or gabapentin 1200 mg 1 h before surgery. After standard premedication 25 patients in each group received propofol fentanyl and local anesthesia at the operative site. Sedation was maintained by a continuous infusion of propofol adjusted according to the Ramsay scale. Sedation and pain scores were obtained at 5 15 30 45 and 60 min during surgery and 30 min and 2468 12 16 20 and 24 h after the procedure. Diclofenac 75 mg IM was administered as a rescue analgesic. Postoperative pain scores and intraoperative pain scores at 45 and 60 min were significantly lower in the gabapentin group. Fentanyl (122 +/- 40 mug versus 148 +/- 42 mug P < 0.05) and diclofenac (33 +/- 53 mg versus 111 +/- 92 mg P < 0.001) consumption was smaller and the time to first analgesic request (18 +/- 9 h versus 9 +/- 7 h P < 0.001) was longer in the gabapentin group. A more frequent incidence of dizziness was found in the gabapentin (versus placebo) group (24% versus 4% respectively). We conclude that gabapentin provided a significant analgesic benefit for intraoperative and postoperative pain relief in patients undergoing ambulatory rhinoplasty or endoscopic sinus surgery however dizziness may be a handicap for ambulatory use.;2004
We investigated the sonoelastographic features of the lower lateral nasal cartilage lateral crus (LLNC-LC) auricular conchal cartilage (ACC) and costal cartilage (CC). In this prospective study group 1 consisted of 60 participants (30 males and 30 females) between 18 and 35 years of age. Group 2 consisted of 60 participants (30 males and 30 females) between 35 and 50 years of age. Strain elastography (SE) and shear wave elastography (SWE) were performed. For all LLNC-LCs and ACCs type I SE was detected more in group 2 type II SE was detected more in group 1 and type III SE was detected more in group 1 ( p < 0.05). For CC type I SE was detected more in both groups ( p < 0.05). For LLNC-LC type I SE was detected more in males compared with females in both groups ( p < 0.05). For all LLNC-LC ACC and CC the SWE modulus of group 2 was significantly higher than that of group 1 ( p < 0.05). In older participants the SWE modulus increased. We recommend using ACC mainly in rhinoplasty operations for primary and revision cases as its SWE modulus is similar to that of the LLNC-LC. However due to the higher SWE modulus of CC CC grafts should not be used as the first choice in rhinoplasties especially in the reconstruction of the nasal tip contour but may be used in nasal dorsum augmentation.;2019
We present our experience with nasal grafts over 20 years. The nose located centrally always plays a key role in facial aesthetics. Public recognition of this makes rhinoplasty the most popular operation. From the traditional aesthetic point of view propogated by the media the nose must be narrow and straight and have correct nasolabial and forehead angles. It is the desire of every surgeon to obtain permanent and satisfactory cosmetic results. However it is not always possible to obtain good cosmetic appearance using conventional methods when the nose is small or large when the columella is short or when the skin is thick. Mostly nasal tip projection cannot be achieved. In the present article we report our experiences in primary asthetic rhinoplasty using cartilaginous grafts obtained from septum costa and ear as umbrella grafts of columella type.;2002
