In order to benefit from e-learning companies should conduct considerable up-front analysis to assess their readiness. There are a number of instruments in the market that can be used for assessing readiness for e-learning. However almost all of these instruments are developed to be used in countries that have a mature field of human resources development. So these instruments consist of terms phrases and applications that are meaningless for many companies in especially emerging countries where human resources development field has just shown an improvement. This article includes the description of a survey instrument that has been developed to assess e-learning readiness of companies in these kinds of countries and the results of a study that examines organizational readiness of companies for e-learning in Turkey. The study reveals that companies surveyed are overall ready for e-learning but they need to improve need to improve themselves particularly in the area of human resources in order to be able to successfully implement e-learning. Although this instrument has been developed according to the cultural characteristics of Turkish companies it can easily be adapted to be used by companies of other emerging countries.;2005;ın order to benefit from e-learning companies should conduct considerable up-front analysis to assess their readiness. there are a number of instruments in the market that can be used for assessing readiness for e-learning. however almost all of these instruments are developed to be used in countries that have a mature field of human resources development. so these instruments consist of terms phrases and applications that are meaningless for many companies in especially emerging countries where human resources development field has just shown an improvement. this article includes the description of a survey instrument that has been developed to assess e-learning readiness of companies in these kinds of countries and the results of a study that examines organizational readiness of companies for e-learning in turkey. the study reveals that companies surveyed are overall ready for e-learning but they need to improve need to improve themselves particularly in the area of human resources in order to be able to successfully implement e-learning. although this instrument has been developed according to the cultural characteristics of turkish companies it can easily be adapted to be used by companies of other emerging countries.
This paper explores the use of e-learning technologies for organisational learning within a commercial environment.

The results of the study reflect the high performance of the e-learning program. They also highlight critical issues concerning the successful implementation of e-learning technologies to achieve the knowledge sharing that is required for organisational learning.;2005;this paper explores the use of e-learning technologies for organisational learning within a commercial environment. a model has been developed to represent those factors that determine organisational learning. this model has been embedded within a case study based on the use of an e-learning program that was developed in order to enhance employees' knowledge and endorse corporate values within a norwegian company. the results of the study reflect the high performance of the e-learning program. they also highlight critical issues concerning the successful implementation of e-learning technologies to achieve the knowledge sharing that is required for organisational learning.
On-line collaboration is an instructional method that facilitates collaboration in an on-line learning setting. To promote effective collaboration it is vital to reveal both the student's and the instructor's point of view pertaining to effective on-line collaboration. In this study the effectiveness of a learning management system in on-line collaboration was first investigated in a graduate course offered through the means of distance learning. In this first phase of this study the nature of collaboration the students perceptions of the effectiveness of the tool in on-line collaboration the factors contributing to effective peer interaction among students and the role of the instructor as perceived by the students in the on-line course were explored. This phase of the study also involved the reviews of other learning management systems course management systems and groupware systems regarding the tools used to encourage collaboration. Also revealed was a lack of diversity in collaboration tools. Based on these preliminary findings an on-line document reviewing tool was developed and pilot tested in the second phase of the study. In this phase a web-based synchronous collaborative review tool called WebSCoRe is proposed to promote online collaboration. WebSCoRe is proposed as an attempt to develop and implement a new platform for on-line document reviewing to promote effective on-line collaboration among students and the instructor.;2006;on-line collaboration is an instructional method that facilitates collaboration in an on-line learning setting. to promote effective collaboration it is vital to reveal both the student's and the instructor's point of view pertaining to effective on-line collaboration. ın this study the effectiveness of a learning management system in on-line collaboration was first investigated in a graduate course offered through the means of distance learning. ın this first phase of this study the nature of collaboration the students perceptions of the effectiveness of the tool in on-line collaboration the factors contributing to effective peer interaction among students and the role of the instructor as perceived by the students in the on-line course were explored. this phase of the study also involved the reviews of other learning management systems course management systems and groupware systems regarding the tools used to encourage collaboration. also revealed was a lack of diversity in collaboration tools. based on these preliminary findings an on-line document reviewing tool was developed and pilot tested in the second phase of the study. ın this phase a web-based synchronous collaborative review tool called webscore is proposed to promote online collaboration. webscore is proposed as an attempt to develop and implement a new platform for on-line document reviewing to promote effective on-line collaboration among students and the instructor.
This study analyzed the factors that affect student success in an online computer programming course. The study had two with two main objectives. The first was to examine relationships among selected variables (gender age educational level locus of control and learning style) motivational beliefs (intrinsic goal orientation extrinsic goal orientation control beliefs task value self-efficacy and test anxiety) self-regulated learning components (cognitive strategy use self-regulation) and student success in the online course. The second objective was to examine course instructors' views about the factors that contribute to the students' success in the online course. The study sample consisted of two course instructors and 80 voluntary participants who partook in this online course in 2005-2006. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect relevant data in this study. Four online questionnaires (Demographic Survey Internal-External Locus of Control Scale Learning Style Inventory and Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) were used to gather data on quantitative variables and semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather data on instructors' views. The statistical results indicated that the effect of the self-regulation variables on students' success was statistically significant and the interview results indicated that successful students generally used self-regulated learning strategies in the online course.;2007;this study analyzed the factors that affect student success in an online computer programming course. the study had two with two main objectives. the first was to examine relationships among selected variables (gender age educational level locus of control and learning style) motivational beliefs (intrinsic goal orientation extrinsic goal orientation control beliefs task value self-efficacy and test anxiety) self-regulated learning components (cognitive strategy use self-regulation) and student success in the online course. the second objective was to examine course instructors' views about the factors that contribute to the students' success in the online course. the study sample consisted of two course instructors and 80 voluntary participants who partook in this online course in 2005-2006. both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect relevant data in this study. four online questionnaires (demographic survey ınternal-external locus of control scale learning style ınventory and motivated strategies for learning questionnaire) were used to gather data on quantitative variables and semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather data on instructors' views. the statistical results indicated that the effect of the self-regulation variables on students' success was statistically significant and the interview results indicated that successful students generally used self-regulated learning strategies in the online course.
This study is a presentation of the usage of distance education technologies in a bid to support face to face education of tourist guide candidates during the training tour. The laws require tourist guide candidates to successfully complete their internship tour and get a certificate. Since the time in this internship period is limited and there are restricting factors such as transportation accommodation many of the tourism places couldn't be included in this internship period. Besides the lack of experienced and competent guides in the visited places is also another negative factor reducing the quality and efficiency of the training. Technological support of the training of tourist guide candidates would effectively reduce the negativities of traditional education methods. Thus benefiting from computer technologies and audiovisual systems during the internship of tourist guide candidates would result in an increase in the effectiveness and usefulness of the training tour and would make it possible to visit more places in a shorter period. This study is a presentation on how distance education method could be implemented and an attempt to show the benefits could be obtained from implementation of these methods along with the possible problems that are predicted to arise.;2007;this study is a presentation of the usage of distance education technologies in a bid to support face to face education of tourist guide candidates during the training tour. the laws require tourist guide candidates to successfully complete their internship tour and get a certificate. since the time in this internship period is limited and there are restricting factors such as transportation accommodation many of the tourism places couldn't be included in this internship period. besides the lack of experienced and competent guides in the visited places is also another negative factor reducing the quality and efficiency of the training. technological support of the training of tourist guide candidates would effectively reduce the negativities of traditional education methods. thus benefiting from computer technologies and audiovisual systems during the internship of tourist guide candidates would result in an increase in the effectiveness and usefulness of the training tour and would make it possible to visit more places in a shorter period. this study is a presentation on how distance education method could be implemented and an attempt to show the benefits could be obtained from implementation of these methods along with the possible problems that are predicted to arise.
All-optical wavelength-routed WDM WANs can support the high bandwidth and the long session duration requirements of the application scenarios such as interactive distance learning or on-line diagnosis of patients simultaneously in different hospitals. However multifiber and limited sparse light splitting and wavelength conversion capabilities of switches result in a difficult optimization problem. We attack this problem using a layered graph model. The problem is defined as a k-edge-disjoint degree-constrained Steiner tree problem for routing and fiber and wavelength assignment of k multicasts. A mixed integer linear programming formulation for the problem is given and a solution using CPLEX is provided. However the complexity of the problem grows quickly with respect to the number of edges in the layered graph which depends on the number of nodes fibers wavelengths and multicast sessions. Hence we propose two heuristics layered all-optical multicast algorithm [( LAMA) and conservative fiber and wavelength assignment (C-FWA)] to compare with CPLEX existing work and unicasting. Extensive computational experiments show that LAMA's performance is very close to CPLEX and it is significantly better than existing work and C-FWA for nearly all metrics since LAMA jointly optimizes routing and fiber-wavelength assignment phases compared with the other candidates which attack the problem by decomposing two phases. Experiments also show that important metrics (e. g. session and group blocking probability transmitter wavelength and fiber conversion resources) are adversely affected by the separation of two phases. Finally the fiber- wavelength assignment strategy of C-FWA (Ex-Fit) uses wavelength and fiber conversion resources more effectively than the First Fit.

The proliferation of the Internet and World Wide Web applications has created new opportunities as well as new challenges for institutions and individuals who are either receiving or delivering education. Electronic (e) learning is one of the most important developments in education. It recognizes the shift from teaching to learning and puts the learner or user before the institution. The objectives and expected outcomes of e-learning are largely dependent on the quality of the teaching processes and the effectiveness of online access. Hence assessing methods for the effectiveness of e-learning Web sites are a critical issue in both practice and research. However Web site quality is a complex concept and its measurement is expected to be multidimensional in nature. Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are widely used for evaluating and ranking such problems containing multiple usually conflicting criteria. For this reason this article presents a quality evaluation model based on the MCDM to measure the e-learning Web sites' performance. In addition the subjectivity and vagueness in the assessment process are dealt with using fuzzy logic. The study has investigated 10 worldwide and 11 locally successful Web sites with the proposed method. By suggesting an aggregated measure based on the Web site quality criteria it is expected that the method could be useful to the e-learning service providers and system developers as well as to the researchers related with Web research.

The most commonly used and discussed videoconferencing mode for teaching languages from a distance is two-way simultaneous or point-to-point videoconferencing. Applications of multipoint videoconferencing to language classes however are not very common. This article aims to fill that gap by presenting the technical and pedagogical dimensions of a pilot project in teaching an introductory course in Turkish (102) via multipoint videoconferencing which was conducted among students at Syracuse University Cornell University and Colgate University. This study shows how multipoint videoconferencing works for language classes and gives some pedagogical pointers to language instructors who plan to use such a system for the first time.;2007;the most commonly used and discussed videoconferencing mode for teaching languages from a distance is two-way simultaneous or point-to-point videoconferencing. applications of multipoint videoconferencing to language classes however are not very common. this article aims to fill that gap by presenting the technical and pedagogical dimensions of a pilot project in teaching an introductory course in turkish (102) via multipoint videoconferencing which was conducted among students at syracuse university cornell university and colgate university. this study shows how multipoint videoconferencing works for language classes and gives some pedagogical pointers to language instructors who plan to use such a system for the first time.

Problem Statement: Entry to Turkish higher education is highly competitive. High school graduates gain access to universities based upon their performance on the Student Selection Examination (SSE) which about two million students take each year. Only 10% of these students are placed in undergraduate degree programs (excluding distance education programs). Students commonly start preparing for the exam during their elementary school years. The preparation often includes attendance to private prepatory schools (dershaneler). Preparation becomes highly stressful particularly during high school years. Purpose: The purpose of this to investigate depression test anxiety and social support of Students preparing for the SSE and in so doing drawing attention to issues faced by these students. Methods: A total of 844 students attending to private preparatory schools in the capital city of Ankara (56% females 44% males) participated in this study. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-1978 Formu) Test Anxiety Inventory (TAE) the Perceived Social Support Scale-Revised (PSSS-R) and Personal Information Form (developed by the researcher) were used for data collection. Individuals with scores of 17 or higher on the BDI were considered depressed 13-16 mildly depressed and those lower than 12 were regarded as not depressed. Scores of 46 or higher on the Test Anxiety Inventory were considered high level of test anxiety. Findings: Data analyses showed that 36% of students were depressed and 42% had high degree of test anxiety. Depression was more prevalent among females students with lower levels of achievement 11(th) graders and high school graduates. Level of depression did not differ significantly according to the kind of high school attended. Results also showed that depressed students scored higher on test anxiety than non-depressed ones. On the contrary depressed students reported lower levels of support from family friends and teachers. Recommendations: Greater prevalence of depression among females is worth further examination. High schools should develop psycho-educational programs for teachers and Families in order to enhance support for students preparing for the SSE. Teachers and families can be informed about needs of students with lower achievement level. Interventions targeting students' test anxiety might also alleviate depressive symptoms and improve their achievement levels. School guidance programs and particularly counseling services can be enriched. Future research can explore other aspects of these students' functioning including social and developmental issues Studies could also focus on family dynamics of students with depression and anxiety.;2007;problem statement: entry to turkish higher education is highly competitive. high school graduates gain access to universities based upon their performance on the student selection examination (sse) which about two million students take each year. only 10% of these students are placed in undergraduate degree programs (excluding distance education programs). students commonly start preparing for the exam during their elementary school years. the preparation often includes attendance to private prepatory schools (dershaneler). preparation becomes highly stressful particularly during high school years. purpose: the purpose of this to investigate depression test anxiety and social support of students preparing for the sse and in so doing drawing attention to issues faced by these students. methods: a total of 844 students attending to private preparatory schools in the capital city of ankara (56% females 44% males) participated in this study. beck depression ınventory (bdı-1978 formu) test anxiety ınventory (tae) the perceived social support scale-revised (psss-r) and personal ınformation form (developed by the researcher) were used for data collection. ındividuals with scores of 17 or higher on the bdı were considered depressed 13-16 mildly depressed and those lower than 12 were regarded as not depressed. scores of 46 or higher on the test anxiety ınventory were considered high level of test anxiety. findings: data analyses showed that 36% of students were depressed and 42% had high degree of test anxiety. depression was more prevalent among females students with lower levels of achievement 11(th) graders and high school graduates. level of depression did not differ significantly according to the kind of high school attended. results also showed that depressed students scored higher on test anxiety than non-depressed ones. on the contrary depressed students reported lower levels of support from family friends and teachers. recommendations: greater prevalence of depression among females is worth further examination. high schools should develop psycho-educational programs for teachers and families in order to enhance support for students preparing for the sse. teachers and families can be informed about needs of students with lower achievement level. ınterventions targeting students' test anxiety might also alleviate depressive symptoms and improve their achievement levels. school guidance programs and particularly counseling services can be enriched. future research can explore other aspects of these students' functioning including social and developmental issues studies could also focus on family dynamics of students with depression and anxiety.

In the current study the Distance Education Student Satisfaction Model estimated as a structural equation model is proposed to understand better what predicts student satisfaction from online learning environments. In the present study the following variables are employed based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis Bagozzi & Warshaw 1989) and literature: computer knowledge flexibility of distance education usefulness of distance education and distance education satisfaction. Results suggest that as long as students have the skills to use online tools and perceive that distance education is a useful and flexible way of learning communicating and sharing their enjoyment from online instruction will be promoted. Ultimately this satisfaction may lead to higher levels of engagement learning and success in the distance education setting. Data collected from 195 undergraduate students are analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and Analysis of Moment Structures statistical software. Implications of the findings of the present study are crucial for instructors practitioners and institutions planning to offer or currently engaged in offering distance education courses.;2008;ın the current study the distance education student satisfaction model estimated as a structural equation model is proposed to understand better what predicts student satisfaction from online learning environments. ın the present study the following variables are employed based on the technology acceptance model (tam) (davis bagozzi & warshaw 1989) and literature: computer knowledge flexibility of distance education usefulness of distance education and distance education satisfaction. results suggest that as long as students have the skills to use online tools and perceive that distance education is a useful and flexible way of learning communicating and sharing their enjoyment from online instruction will be promoted. ultimately this satisfaction may lead to higher levels of engagement learning and success in the distance education setting. data collected from 195 undergraduate students are analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences and analysis of moment structures statistical software. ımplications of the findings of the present study are crucial for instructors practitioners and institutions planning to offer or currently engaged in offering distance education courses.
Problem Statement: Continuous change and improvements for the quality of organizational development communication flow and knowledge sharing are crucial within institutions. Recent studies have paid a great deal of attention to the importance of learning organisations and emphasize distance education practices as an innovative strategy. This study fills a gap in the literature by using a comparative study to examine the distance education institutes as learning organisations. The study is significant as it compares the performance of distance education institutes as learning organizations. It also helps to identify quality improvements of learning organisations and provides insights to evaluate the integration of sharing learning in higher education practices within different cultural contexts. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the study is to investigate the comparison between the performances of the distance education institutes in North Cyprus and the UK Higher Education Institutions. These institutes' performances as learning organizations give a competitive advantage to their higher education system. Methods: The qualitative research method including in-depth interviews researcher observations and self-reports were used to examine these institutes. Data were then analyzed thematically and triangulated. The participants from North Cyprus and UK were purposefully selected as a sample on a voluntary basis. The multiple data collection techniques were reviewed by experts from Turkey UK and United States and piloted in order to increase the credibility of the research. Findings and Results: Findings revealed that higher education institutions need to use distance education practices as an innovative strategy for continuous improvement. In addition findings show that the distance education institute in the UK performs better as a learning organization than the distance education institute in North Cyprus which has limited infrastructure and lacks a collective vision. Conclusions and Recommendations: The research findings suggest that developing a learning organization with distance education practices provides an opportunity for the higher education system to extend its influence on external and multicultural environments. There is also an increasing need to provide strategic planning and evaluation of its effectiveness for the development of distance education institutes as learning organizations. In addition to the two cases examined other comparisons could also be made considering the cultural dimensions. Furthermore social interaction such as dialogue and inquiry can be explored using in-depth investigation to enrich other dimensions of learning organizations and improve organizational performance.;2008;problem statement: continuous change and improvements for the quality of organizational development communication flow and knowledge sharing are crucial within institutions. recent studies have paid a great deal of attention to the importance of learning organisations and emphasize distance education practices as an innovative strategy. this study fills a gap in the literature by using a comparative study to examine the distance education institutes as learning organisations. the study is significant as it compares the performance of distance education institutes as learning organizations. ıt also helps to identify quality improvements of learning organisations and provides insights to evaluate the integration of sharing learning in higher education practices within different cultural contexts. purpose of the study: the purpose of the study is to investigate the comparison between the performances of the distance education institutes in north cyprus and the uk higher education ınstitutions. these institutes' performances as learning organizations give a competitive advantage to their higher education system. methods: the qualitative research method including in-depth interviews researcher observations and self-reports were used to examine these institutes. data were then analyzed thematically and triangulated. the participants from north cyprus and uk were purposefully selected as a sample on a voluntary basis. the multiple data collection techniques were reviewed by experts from turkey uk and united states and piloted in order to increase the credibility of the research. findings and results: findings revealed that higher education institutions need to use distance education practices as an innovative strategy for continuous improvement. ın addition findings show that the distance education institute in the uk performs better as a learning organization than the distance education institute in north cyprus which has limited infrastructure and lacks a collective vision. conclusions and recommendations: the research findings suggest that developing a learning organization with distance education practices provides an opportunity for the higher education system to extend its influence on external and multicultural environments. there is also an increasing need to provide strategic planning and evaluation of its effectiveness for the development of distance education institutes as learning organizations. ın addition to the two cases examined other comparisons could also be made considering the cultural dimensions. furthermore social interaction such as dialogue and inquiry can be explored using in-depth investigation to enrich other dimensions of learning organizations and improve organizational performance.
This study focuses on a synchronous e-class project which was developed to increase the effectiveness of a second year advanced reading course within the Distance English Language Teacher Training (DELTT) program in Turkey. The aim of the study is to explore the perceptions of learners who participated in the e-class application and the impact of it on their success in their studies. From 675 second year learners in the DELTT program 26 were selected as the subjects of this study. The perceptions of the e-class participants were gathered from diaries they kept for each e-class session. Three main categories of perceptions emerged from the analysis of these diaries. These are learner attitudes about the application of the e-class about group work activities used and about various technological aspects. The conclusion drawn from the data is that in spite of some concerns Turkish learners perceived the e-class to be a very efficient way of conducting reading classes. A statistical analysis of exam scores supported participant perceptions and revealed that an e-class application can be as effective as the traditional face-to-face classroom mode. The findings suggest that an e-class could be used to increase the effectiveness of the distance teacher training program and has further implications for training future teachers.;2008;this study focuses on a synchronous e-class project which was developed to increase the effectiveness of a second year advanced reading course within the distance english language teacher training (deltt) program in turkey. the aim of the study is to explore the perceptions of learners who participated in the e-class application and the impact of it on their success in their studies. from 675 second year learners in the deltt program 26 were selected as the subjects of this study. the perceptions of the e-class participants were gathered from diaries they kept for each e-class session. three main categories of perceptions emerged from the analysis of these diaries. these are learner attitudes about the application of the e-class about group work activities used and about various technological aspects. the conclusion drawn from the data is that in spite of some concerns turkish learners perceived the e-class to be a very efficient way of conducting reading classes. a statistical analysis of exam scores supported participant perceptions and revealed that an e-class application can be as effective as the traditional face-to-face classroom mode. the findings suggest that an e-class could be used to increase the effectiveness of the distance teacher training program and has further implications for training future teachers.
Quality function deployment (QFD) is a product/service design and improvement tool used to achieve higher customer satisfaction. Basically QFD is a transformation of vague and imprecise customer needs into measurable product/service attributes. This article integrates compromise programming based goal programming into the QFD process to determine to what extent the product/service attributes should be improved. The fuzzy set theory is applied to the model to deal with the imprecise nature of data. Differing from existing QFD applications our proposed methodology applies analytic network process (ANP) to evaluate the inner dependencies among customer needs among product attributes and also the relationships between them. Furthermore it determines the best product/service in the market as the goal employing compromise programming. Finally the methodology ends with the goal programming method which consists of this predefined goal and the product/service provider's budget limitation. The aim is to improve the performance values of the selected product/service according to the best one. A real-world application on e-learning products provided by the higher education institutions in Turkey illustrates the applicability of our proposed methodology.;2008;quality function deployment (qfd) is a product/service design and improvement tool used to achieve higher customer satisfaction. basically qfd is a transformation of vague and imprecise customer needs into measurable product/service attributes. this article integrates compromise programming based goal programming into the qfd process to determine to what extent the product/service attributes should be improved. the fuzzy set theory is applied to the model to deal with the imprecise nature of data. differing from existing qfd applications our proposed methodology applies analytic network process (anp) to evaluate the inner dependencies among customer needs among product attributes and also the relationships between them. furthermore it determines the best product/service in the market as the goal employing compromise programming. finally the methodology ends with the goal programming method which consists of this predefined goal and the product/service provider's budget limitation. the aim is to improve the performance values of the selected product/service according to the best one. a real-world application on e-learning products provided by the higher education institutions in turkey illustrates the applicability of our proposed methodology.
Remote laboratories are technologies that aim to increase the effectiveness of educational programs. European Remote Radio Laboratory (ERRL) is an e-learning project for students teachers and technicians who will use very important devices of a radio frequency laboratory remotely. As a solution we have developed an e-learning system which aims to support the ERRL learners while studying on how to use equipments in the system. The system is developed according to the electronic performance support system (EPSS) approach. An EPSS is a computer-based well-structured system which improves the performance of individuals. It is an electronic infrastructure that contains stores and distributes personal (individual) or corporate knowledge to enable people to reach necessary levels of performance in the fastest possible time and with minimum teaching support of other people. This paper discusses how the content for such a system is developed and how this content is interactively used in the EPSS platform. The technical details of the developed EPSS are also discussed in this study. We believe that this paper will help instructional system designers for designing different alternatives to improve learners' performance.;2008;remote laboratories are technologies that aim to increase the effectiveness of educational programs. european remote radio laboratory (errl) is an e-learning project for students teachers and technicians who will use very important devices of a radio frequency laboratory remotely. as a solution we have developed an e-learning system which aims to support the errl learners while studying on how to use equipments in the system. the system is developed according to the electronic performance support system (epss) approach. an epss is a computer-based well-structured system which improves the performance of individuals. ıt is an electronic infrastructure that contains stores and distributes personal (individual) or corporate knowledge to enable people to reach necessary levels of performance in the fastest possible time and with minimum teaching support of other people. this paper discusses how the content for such a system is developed and how this content is interactively used in the epss platform. the technical details of the developed epss are also discussed in this study. we believe that this paper will help instructional system designers for designing different alternatives to improve learners' performance.

This exploratory study tests the assertion that instructional strategies that match field-dependence status of students are most effective. The study conducted with 12 graduate students registered in a graduate level online course. An online version of the Psychological Differentiation Inventory was used to measure the field-dependence status of students. Students' perceived learning outcomes their effort and involvement and level of interaction that they perceived in online course module were measured through an online questionnaire. Results suggested that matches between students' learning styles and instructional strategies did not affect learner perception of their own learning outcomes level of effort and involvement and level of interactions in the course. Data also indicated that no single instructional strategy among three instructional strategies tested emerged as superior for high and low field-dependent online students. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Japan and Korea have highly developed information and communications technology infrastructures and have recently reformed their higher education systems and encouraged e-transformation. However Japanese universities have not embraced e-learning as wholeheartedly as their Korean counterparts. The paper concludes that this is due to governmental and institutional failure to develop a cogent vision and strategic plan for e-learning to recognise the need for fundamental shifts in organisational cultures and structures and pedagogy and to provide training funding recognition and reward for such development. It attributes this to differences in the cultural perspectives values and customs of the two countries' policy makers managers and faculty members. The findings are seen to hold important lessons for other countries embarking on e-transformation.;2008;japan and korea have highly developed information and communications technology infrastructures and have recently reformed their higher education systems and encouraged e-transformation. however japanese universities have not embraced e-learning as wholeheartedly as their korean counterparts. the paper concludes that this is due to governmental and institutional failure to develop a cogent vision and strategic plan for e-learning to recognise the need for fundamental shifts in organisational cultures and structures and pedagogy and to provide training funding recognition and reward for such development. ıt attributes this to differences in the cultural perspectives values and customs of the two countries' policy makers managers and faculty members. the findings are seen to hold important lessons for other countries embarking on e-transformation.
There are a significant number of studies in the literature stressing the important role of teacher immediacy behaviors on learners' perceptions of social presence and satisfaction in open and distance learning environments.

As part of a needs analysis preceding the development of an e-learning platform on infection prevention European intensive care unit (ICU) nurses were subjected to a knowledge test on evidence-based guidelines for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A validated multiple-choice questionnaire was distributed to 22 European countries between October 2006 and March 2007. Demographics included nationality gender ICU experience number of ICU beds and acquisition of a specialised degree in intensive care. We collected 3329 questionnaires (response rate 69.1%). The average score was 45.1%. Fifty-five percent of respondents knew that the oral route is recommended for intubation 35% knew that ventilator circuits should be changed for each new patient 38% knew that heat and moisture exchangers were the recommended humidifier type but only 21% knew that these should be changed once weekly closed suctioning systems were recommended by 46% and 18% knew that these must be changed for each new patient only 51% and 57% respectively recognised that subglottic drainage and kinetic beds reduce VAP incidence. Most (85%) knew that semi-recumbent positioning prevents VAP. Professional seniority and number of ICU beds were shown to be independently associated with better test scores. Further research may determine whether low scores are related to a lack of knowledge deficiencies in training differences in what is regarded as good practice and/or a lack of consistent policy.

A distributed online curriculum and courseware development model (DONC2) is developed and tested in this study. Courseware development teams which may work in different institutions who need to develop high quality reduced cost on time products will be the users of DONC2. The related features from the disciplines of instructional design and software engineering were combined. The research is conducted as a collective case study including four cases with distinctive characteristics to reveal the several practices in online curriculum and courseware development work. The DONC2 development model was proposed using the results gathered from the investigated cases and a literature survey. The model uses the iterative incremental and agile software development approaches in order to overcome the disadvantages of other linear development approaches. This enables building releasable yet good quality products in short time periods. Furthermore continuous communication evaluation and feedback as well as good project management and readiness to adapt to changes are integrated as the essential characteristics. DONC2 is different then previous linear and non-adaptive models in all of these aspects. The model was tested with one of the cases while being improved with success. It was applied as a development model for scheduling of the courseware development project in the last case and considered as helpful for the success of the project by the project team members.;2009;a distributed online curriculum and courseware development model (donc2) is developed and tested in this study. courseware development teams which may work in different institutions who need to develop high quality reduced cost on time products will be the users of donc2. the related features from the disciplines of instructional design and software engineering were combined. the research is conducted as a collective case study including four cases with distinctive characteristics to reveal the several practices in online curriculum and courseware development work. the donc2 development model was proposed using the results gathered from the investigated cases and a literature survey. the model uses the iterative incremental and agile software development approaches in order to overcome the disadvantages of other linear development approaches. this enables building releasable yet good quality products in short time periods. furthermore continuous communication evaluation and feedback as well as good project management and readiness to adapt to changes are integrated as the essential characteristics. donc2 is different then previous linear and non-adaptive models in all of these aspects. the model was tested with one of the cases while being improved with success. ıt was applied as a development model for scheduling of the courseware development project in the last case and considered as helpful for the success of the project by the project team members.
A number of studies emphasized the need to capture learners' interaction patterns in order to personalize their learning process as they study through learning objects. In education context learning materials are designed based on pre-determined expectations and learners are evaluated to what extent they master these expectations. Representation of these expectations in learning and assessment objects on the other hand is a new challenge for e-learner providers. In order to address this challenge POLEonto (Personlized Ontological Learning Environment) proposes a new method to separate these expectations by determining domain concepts (ConceptNet) and cognitive skills (CogSkillNet) for expectations via creating cognitive skill and concept ontology for K-12 education. In this paper we report only the development and design processes of CogSkillNet within POLEonto environment and we further discuss how CogSkillNet can be modeled in the e-learning domain. We also describe how ontological representations play a role in creating personalized navigational guidance for allowing visualization of cognitive skills and providing useful navigational feedback to learners.;2009;a number of studies emphasized the need to capture learners' interaction patterns in order to personalize their learning process as they study through learning objects. ın education context learning materials are designed based on pre-determined expectations and learners are evaluated to what extent they master these expectations. representation of these expectations in learning and assessment objects on the other hand is a new challenge for e-learner providers. ın order to address this challenge poleonto (personlized ontological learning environment) proposes a new method to separate these expectations by determining domain concepts (conceptnet) and cognitive skills (cogskillnet) for expectations via creating cognitive skill and concept ontology for k-12 education. ın this paper we report only the development and design processes of cogskillnet within poleonto environment and we further discuss how cogskillnet can be modeled in the e-learning domain. we also describe how ontological representations play a role in creating personalized navigational guidance for allowing visualization of cognitive skills and providing useful navigational feedback to learners.

The main purpose of the study is to investigate Turkish undergraduate students' perceptions of the Web as a learning tool and to analyze whether their perceptions differ significantly based on gender socio-economic background and Web experience. Data obtained from 722 undergraduate students (331 males and 391 females) were used in the analyses. The findings indicated significant differences based on gender socio-economic background and Web experience. The students from higher socio-economic backgrounds indicated significantly higher attitude scores on the self-efficacy subscale of the Web attitude scale. Similarly the male students indicated significantly higher scores on the self-efficacy subscale than the females. Also the students with higher Web experience in terms of usage frequency indicated higher scores on all subscales (i.e. self-efficacy affective usefulness Web-based learning). Moreover the two-way ANOVA results indicated that the student's PC ownership has significant main effects on their Web attitudes and on the usefulness self-efficacy and affective subscales.;2009;the main purpose of the study is to investigate turkish undergraduate students' perceptions of the web as a learning tool and to analyze whether their perceptions differ significantly based on gender socio-economic background and web experience. data obtained from 722 undergraduate students (331 males and 391 females) were used in the analyses. the findings indicated significant differences based on gender socio-economic background and web experience. the students from higher socio-economic backgrounds indicated significantly higher attitude scores on the self-efficacy subscale of the web attitude scale. similarly the male students indicated significantly higher scores on the self-efficacy subscale than the females. also the students with higher web experience in terms of usage frequency indicated higher scores on all subscales (i.e. self-efficacy affective usefulness web-based learning). moreover the two-way anova results indicated that the student's pc ownership has significant main effects on their web attitudes and on the usefulness self-efficacy and affective subscales.
This study aimed to investigate the underlying components constituting the extended version of the ICT Indicators Measurement Scale (ICTIMS) which was developed in 2007 and extended in the current study through the addition of 34 items. New items addressing successful ICT integration at education faculties were identified through the examination of the recent literature and expert panels.

In like manner as conventional education and teaching approaches distance education tends to model the same procedures. Indeed formerly enriched on printed material served as a primary source. However thanks to the developments in technology and evolution in education computerised information has made inroads in distance education programmes. Moreover the radio and television also are fullfil the need of this particular program. At Anadolu University's Open Education Faculty's TV Production Centers (Educational TV-ETV) programs are produced consistent with the faculties adapted Open Education System. Since 1982 more than 5000 educational programs have been produced at the center. In this study the views of employees at Anadolu University's Open Education Faculty's TV Production Center's organizational commitment level are analysed according to affective continuance normative commitment perspectives within the framework of Meyer and Allen model. In this study an account of the TV Production Center is provided. Employee's commitment levels are also taken into consideration. Needless to say that to maintain higher success in practices commitment to organization is very important. Hence to assess the level of commitment to the organization surveys were distributed to employees. The organizational commitment scale provided by Meyr and Allen was also implemented to monitor the results. In the study organizational commitment within affective commitment continuance commitment and normative commitment is analyzed. The survey was applied to 134 employees of TV Production Center and also face-to-face interviews were conducted. In the second stage SPSS program was used for necessary analyses according to the demographics of employees (gender age and marital status number of children working duration working unit title and education) frequency test t-test and Anova test were applied.;2009;ın like manner as conventional education and teaching approaches distance education tends to model the same procedures. ındeed formerly enriched on printed material served as a primary source. however thanks to the developments in technology and evolution in education computerised information has made inroads in distance education programmes. moreover the radio and television also are fullfil the need of this particular program. at anadolu university's open education faculty's tv production centers (educational tv-etv) programs are produced consistent with the faculties adapted open education system. since 1982 more than 5000 educational programs have been produced at the center. ın this study the views of employees at anadolu university's open education faculty's tv production center's organizational commitment level are analysed according to affective continuance normative commitment perspectives within the framework of meyer and allen model. ın this study an account of the tv production center is provided. employee's commitment levels are also taken into consideration. needless to say that to maintain higher success in practices commitment to organization is very important. hence to assess the level of commitment to the organization surveys were distributed to employees. the organizational commitment scale provided by meyr and allen was also implemented to monitor the results. ın the study organizational commitment within affective commitment continuance commitment and normative commitment is analyzed. the survey was applied to 134 employees of tv production center and also face-to-face interviews were conducted. ın the second stage spss program was used for necessary analyses according to the demographics of employees (gender age and marital status number of children working duration working unit title and education) frequency test t-test and anova test were applied.
The purpose of this study is to identify the viewpoints of the candidates of Physical Education and Sports Teachers and Sports Managers and to examine these viewpoints with respect to sex class accommodation of the family monthly income of the family computer and internet facilities. Survey method was used to carry out the study. The sample of the study consisted of the students attending Department of Physical Education and Sports at Educational Faculty and Sports Management Department of Physical Education and Sports High School in Sakarya University. In order to gather data a questionnaire was developed by the researcher and it was applied to 330 students. Several statistical techniques such as frequency percentage t-test and ANOVA were used to analyze the data depending on the qualities of the variables.

A desirable characteristic for an e-learning system is to provide the learner the most appropriate information based on his requirements and preferences. This can be achieved by capturing and utilizing the learner model. Learner models can be extracted based on personality factors like learning styles behavioral factors like user's browsing history and knowledge factors like user's prior knowledge. In this paper we address the problem of extracting the learner model based on Felder-Silverman learning style model. The target learners in this problem are the ones studying basic science. Using NBTree classification algorithm in conjunction with Binary Relevance classifier the learners are classified based on their interests. Then learners' learning styles are detected using these classification results. Experimental results are also conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed automated learner modeling approach. The results show that the match ratio between the obtained learner's learning style using the proposed learner model and those obtained by the questionnaires traditionally used for learning style assessment is consistent for most of the dimensions of Felder-Silverman learning style.

There has been little research on assessment of learning management systems (LMS) within educational organizations as both a web-based learning system for e-learning and as a supportive tool for blended learning environments. This study proposes a conceptual e-learning assessment model hexagonal e-learning assessment model (HELAM) suggesting a multi-dimensional approach for LMS evaluation via six dimensions: (1) system quality (2) service quality (3) content quality (4) learner perspective (5) instructor attitudes and (6) supportive issues. A survey instrument based on HELAM has been developed and applied to 84 learners. This sample consists of students at both undergraduate and graduate levels who are users of a web-based learning management system U-Link at Brunei University. UK The survey instrument has been tested for content validity reliability and criterion-based predictive validity. The analytical results strongly support the appropriateness of the proposed model in evaluating LMSs through learners' satisfaction. The explanatory factor analysis showed that each of the six dimensions of the proposed model had a significant effect on the learners' perceived satisfaction. Findings of this research will be valuable for both academics and practitioners of e-learning systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Problem Statement: The internet as online technology has become one of the most popular communication channels among university students worldwide. Young adults and university students have become sophisticated users of technology and often lead the way in adapting new technologies for everyday use. Sometimes their technological savvy can become a gateway exposing them to a host of sordid activities including pornography drugs violence and cyberbullying. Although online technologies provide numerous benefits (i.e. learning and teaching activities) online technology also has a potentially 'dark side' as it can be used for harm. The current study focuses on the harmful consequences of one type of misuse of online technology: cyberbullying. Purpose of Study: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relations between cyberbullying and psychiatric symptoms and to investigate which symptoms predicted cyberbullying. Methods: This study was cross-sectional and correlational research. A demographic information form questions about cyberbullying and a Symptom Check List-90-Revised Form were administered to 695 undergraduate university students (247 males and 448 females). Findings and Results: Data revealed that there are significant differences between non-bully-victims pure-victims pure-bullies and bully-victims according to the self-reported psychiatric symptom scores. The non-bully-victim group reported significantly less psychiatric symptoms than pure-victims and bully-victims. The path analysis revealed that hostility and psychoticism significantly predicted cyberbullying. Additionally current cyberbullying could predict the possibility of future cyberbullying. Nearly half of the participants in the current study reported that they pretended (at least one time) to be someone else on the internet or cell phone. Additionally a significant relation between cyberbullying and anonymity was found. Interestingly although no gender differences were found in relation to victimization males engaged in cyberbullying and pretended to be someone else in cyberspace significantly more frequently than females. Additionally males were more likely than females to endorse that they would engage in cyberbullying in the future. Conclusions and Recommendations: The current study reported that some psychiatric symptoms were significant predictors of cyberbullying. The relation of psychoticism and hostility to cyberbullying particularly should be investigated in more detail in future research.;2009;problem statement: the internet as online technology has become one of the most popular communication channels among university students worldwide. young adults and university students have become sophisticated users of technology and often lead the way in adapting new technologies for everyday use. sometimes their technological savvy can become a gateway exposing them to a host of sordid activities including pornography drugs violence and cyberbullying. although online technologies provide numerous benefits (i.e. learning and teaching activities) online technology also has a potentially 'dark side' as it can be used for harm. the current study focuses on the harmful consequences of one type of misuse of online technology: cyberbullying. purpose of study: the purpose of the present study was to investigate the relations between cyberbullying and psychiatric symptoms and to investigate which symptoms predicted cyberbullying. methods: this study was cross-sectional and correlational research. a demographic information form questions about cyberbullying and a symptom check list-90-revised form were administered to 695 undergraduate university students (247 males and 448 females). findings and results: data revealed that there are significant differences between non-bully-victims pure-victims pure-bullies and bully-victims according to the self-reported psychiatric symptom scores. the non-bully-victim group reported significantly less psychiatric symptoms than pure-victims and bully-victims. the path analysis revealed that hostility and psychoticism significantly predicted cyberbullying. additionally current cyberbullying could predict the possibility of future cyberbullying. nearly half of the participants in the current study reported that they pretended (at least one time) to be someone else on the internet or cell phone. additionally a significant relation between cyberbullying and anonymity was found. ınterestingly although no gender differences were found in relation to victimization males engaged in cyberbullying and pretended to be someone else in cyberspace significantly more frequently than females. additionally males were more likely than females to endorse that they would engage in cyberbullying in the future. conclusions and recommendations: the current study reported that some psychiatric symptoms were significant predictors of cyberbullying. the relation of psychoticism and hostility to cyberbullying particularly should be investigated in more detail in future research.

Many teachers have the tendency to look at only the standardized test scores of their students while ignoring how or why various dimensions of language proficiency has improved or not improved. Portfolio however reveals a clear picture of the student's growth and development. This study reflects that traditional approaches to assessment of student progress in EFL writing lack indicators of students' development of the skill and aims to answer the following questions: what are the learning gains of students who keep an e-portfolio as part of an elementary-level English course and what are student perceptions about the online course using an e-portfolio and their learning gains? For this aim the researchers worked with two groups of students: the e-portfolio group who kept an electronic portfolio in the online elementary level English language course and the traditional assessment group who did not keep an e-portfolio. Although there were not significant differences between the post-test scores of the two groups there were significant learning gains in both groups. The perceptions of the students in the e-portfolio group reflected that they benefited from and enjoyed keeping a portfolio.;2010;many teachers have the tendency to look at only the standardized test scores of their students while ignoring how or why various dimensions of language proficiency has improved or not improved. portfolio however reveals a clear picture of the student's growth and development. this study reflects that traditional approaches to assessment of student progress in efl writing lack indicators of students' development of the skill and aims to answer the following questions: what are the learning gains of students who keep an e-portfolio as part of an elementary-level english course and what are student perceptions about the online course using an e-portfolio and their learning gains? for this aim the researchers worked with two groups of students: the e-portfolio group who kept an electronic portfolio in the online elementary level english language course and the traditional assessment group who did not keep an e-portfolio. although there were not significant differences between the post-test scores of the two groups there were significant learning gains in both groups. the perceptions of the students in the e-portfolio group reflected that they benefited from and enjoyed keeping a portfolio.

Blended learning environment (BLE) is increasingly used in the world especially in university degrees and it is based on integrating web-based learning and face-to-face (FTF) learning environments. Besides integrating different learning environments BLE also addresses to students with different learning approaches. The 'learning approach' categorizes individuals as 'surface learners' and 'deep learners'. This study investigated whether the academic performance and the satisfaction levels of the pre-service English teachers varied in respect to their learning approaches in a blended learning environment. At the end of the study it was found that a) academic performance scores of the students in the BLE did not show statistically significant difference between deep and surface learners b) the average satisfaction level with the BLE of deep learner students was statistically significantly higher than the average of surface learner students. Based on these findings it can be concluded that pre-service English Language teachers were in general highly satisfied with the BLE. In addition it can be stated that the courses which are designed for the BLE contribute to the achievement of the students with surface learning approach. Based on these conclusions BLE is advised for training of pre-service English Language teachers with different learning approaches.;2010;blended learning environment (ble) is increasingly used in the world especially in university degrees and it is based on integrating web-based learning and face-to-face (ftf) learning environments. besides integrating different learning environments ble also addresses to students with different learning approaches. the 'learning approach' categorizes individuals as 'surface learners' and 'deep learners'. this study investigated whether the academic performance and the satisfaction levels of the pre-service english teachers varied in respect to their learning approaches in a blended learning environment. at the end of the study it was found that a) academic performance scores of the students in the ble did not show statistically significant difference between deep and surface learners b) the average satisfaction level with the ble of deep learner students was statistically significantly higher than the average of surface learner students. based on these findings it can be concluded that pre-service english language teachers were in general highly satisfied with the ble. ın addition it can be stated that the courses which are designed for the ble contribute to the achievement of the students with surface learning approach. based on these conclusions ble is advised for training of pre-service english language teachers with different learning approaches.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CBI lesson sequence type and cognitive style of field dependence on learning from Computer-Based Cooperative Instruction (CBCI) in WEB on the dependent measures achievement reading comprehension and reading rate. Eighty-seven college undergraduate students were randomly assigned to lesson sequence type levels after assigning into three cognitive style group: field dependent (FD) field neutral (FN) and field independent (FI) based on the Group Embedded Figure Test (GEFT) scores. Instruction was delivered by means of two types of sequence of lessons for CBCI in WEB linear lesson (LL) and branching lesson (BL). A two-way analysis of covariance was used to investigate whether there are main effects and interactions between cognitive style of field dependence and lesson sequence types. In order to control statistical power and to equate the treatment groups Nelson-Denny Reading Comprehension Test scores were used as a covariate. The analysis of regression coefficients between lesson sequence type and dependent variables and between field dependence and dependent variables was shown in tables. Although the findings show non-significance in formal tests of hypotheses the interaction effects between field dependence and lesson sequence types on dependent measures were clarified. Four research questions converted to statistical hypotheses were tested according to the factorial design model.

This study investigates the factors impacting the achievement of adult learners in a technology certificate program on computer networks. We studied 2442 participants in 256 institutions. The participants were older than age 18 and were enrolled in the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) technology training program as 'non-degree' or 'certificate' students. Using a multilevel analysis factors impacting adult learners' achievement were identified. The results of Hierarchical Liner Model (HLM) analysis demonstrated that work status degree orientation motivation age gender and computer technical ability of the participants at the beginning of the program had impact on adult learner achievement. On the contrary to the past research the analysis showed that adult learners with full-time jobs achieve more than adult learners with no full-time jobs. Additionally the institutional level factors did not have any impact on achievement. Findings of this study provide important information for developing a framework that can guide research and practice in technology certificate programs.;2010;this study investigates the factors impacting the achievement of adult learners in a technology certificate program on computer networks. we studied 2442 participants in 256 institutions. the participants were older than age 18 and were enrolled in the cisco certified network associate (ccna) technology training program as 'non-degree' or 'certificate' students. using a multilevel analysis factors impacting adult learners' achievement were identified. the results of hierarchical liner model (hlm) analysis demonstrated that work status degree orientation motivation age gender and computer technical ability of the participants at the beginning of the program had impact on adult learner achievement. on the contrary to the past research the analysis showed that adult learners with full-time jobs achieve more than adult learners with no full-time jobs. additionally the institutional level factors did not have any impact on achievement. findings of this study provide important information for developing a framework that can guide research and practice in technology certificate programs.

The purpose of this article is to explore the evolution of the paradigm shift in educational management to evaluate Distributed Learning (DL) as a future approach to establish data of the perceptions of DL program members and to guide educational managers in improving DL programs. The current study is based on to build a conceptual framework of a holistic approach to DL programs. To investigate the program members' perceptions of DL a rating scale questionnaire (O'Malley & McCraw 1999) was implemented. The responses from 50 graduate program members of management education yielded a response rate of 80% from the total sample of 62 program members. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The findings as related by educational managers suggest that program members see their job as one of facilitating program quality rather than owning responsibility for program success. The industry of DL should be more closely aligned with the profession of continuing education administration where success effectiveness and quality have less to do with the formal actions of the office and more to do with the linkages and bridges that one can build with various academic units. In conclusion the class and the DL each have their own strengths and weaknesses. By using a successful combination of both methods more learning benefits can be attained than when using the traditional class or DL alone. According to the results of the survey a holistic model -covering learning resource centre instructors learners and learning climate as a whole- is suggested in improving success in DL.;2010;the purpose of this article is to explore the evolution of the paradigm shift in educational management to evaluate distributed learning (dl) as a future approach to establish data of the perceptions of dl program members and to guide educational managers in improving dl programs. the current study is based on to build a conceptual framework of a holistic approach to dl programs. to investigate the program members' perceptions of dl a rating scale questionnaire (o'malley & mccraw 1999) was implemented. the responses from 50 graduate program members of management education yielded a response rate of 80% from the total sample of 62 program members. descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. the findings as related by educational managers suggest that program members see their job as one of facilitating program quality rather than owning responsibility for program success. the industry of dl should be more closely aligned with the profession of continuing education administration where success effectiveness and quality have less to do with the formal actions of the office and more to do with the linkages and bridges that one can build with various academic units. ın conclusion the class and the dl each have their own strengths and weaknesses. by using a successful combination of both methods more learning benefits can be attained than when using the traditional class or dl alone. according to the results of the survey a holistic model -covering learning resource centre instructors learners and learning climate as a whole- is suggested in improving success in dl.
Background: Residents are one of the key stakeholders of specialty training. The Turkish Board of Family Medicine wanted to pursue a realistic and structured approach in the design of the specialty training programme. This approach required the development of a needs-based core curriculum built on evidence obtained from residents about their needs for specialty training and their needs in the current infrastructure. The aim of this study was to obtain evidence on residents' opinions and views about Family Medicine specialty training. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. The board prepared a questionnaire to investigate residents' views about some aspects of the education programme such as duration and content to assess the residents' learning needs as well as their need for a training infrastructure. The questionnaire was distributed to the Family Medicine Departments (n = 27) and to the coordinators of Family Medicine residency programmes in state hospitals (n = 11) by e-mail and by personal contact. Results: A total of 191 questionnaires were returned. The female/male ratio was 58.6%/41.4%. Nine state hospitals and 10 university departments participated in the study. The response rate was 29%. Forty-five percent of the participants proposed over three years for the residency duration with either extensions of the standard rotation periods in pediatrics and internal medicine or reductions in general surgery. Residents expressed the need for extra rotations (dermatology 61.8% otolaryngology 58.6% radiology 52.4%). Fifty-nine percent of the residents deemed a rotation in a private primary care centre necessary 62.8% in a state primary care centre with a proposed median duration of three months. Forty-seven percent of the participants advocated subspecialties for Family Medicine especially geriatrics. The residents were open to new educational methods such as debates training with models workshops and e-learning. Participation in courses and congresses was considered necessary. The presence of a department office and the clinical competency of the educators were more favored by state residents. Conclusions: This study gave the Board the chance to determine the needs of the residents that had not been taken into consideration sufficiently before. The length and the content of the programme will be revised according to the needs of the residents.;2010;background: residents are one of the key stakeholders of specialty training. the turkish board of family medicine wanted to pursue a realistic and structured approach in the design of the specialty training programme. this approach required the development of a needs-based core curriculum built on evidence obtained from residents about their needs for specialty training and their needs in the current infrastructure. the aim of this study was to obtain evidence on residents' opinions and views about family medicine specialty training. methods: this is a descriptive cross-sectional study. the board prepared a questionnaire to investigate residents' views about some aspects of the education programme such as duration and content to assess the residents' learning needs as well as their need for a training infrastructure. the questionnaire was distributed to the family medicine departments (n = 27) and to the coordinators of family medicine residency programmes in state hospitals (n = 11) by e-mail and by personal contact. results: a total of 191 questionnaires were returned. the female/male ratio was 58.6%/41.4%. nine state hospitals and 10 university departments participated in the study. the response rate was 29%. forty-five percent of the participants proposed over three years for the residency duration with either extensions of the standard rotation periods in pediatrics and internal medicine or reductions in general surgery. residents expressed the need for extra rotations (dermatology 61.8% otolaryngology 58.6% radiology 52.4%). fifty-nine percent of the residents deemed a rotation in a private primary care centre necessary 62.8% in a state primary care centre with a proposed median duration of three months. forty-seven percent of the participants advocated subspecialties for family medicine especially geriatrics. the residents were open to new educational methods such as debates training with models workshops and e-learning. participation in courses and congresses was considered necessary. the presence of a department office and the clinical competency of the educators were more favored by state residents. conclusions: this study gave the board the chance to determine the needs of the residents that had not been taken into consideration sufficiently before. the length and the content of the programme will be revised according to the needs of the residents.
This paper proposes a new usability evaluation checklist UseLearn and a related method for eLearning systems. UseLearn is a comprehensive checklist which incorporates both quality and usability evaluation perspectives in eLearning systems. Structural equation modeling is deployed to validate the UseLearn checklist quantitatively. The experimental results show that the UseLearn method supports the determination of usability problems by criticality metric analysis and the definition of relevant improvement strategies. The main advantage of the UseLearn method is the adaptive selection of the most influential usability problems and thus significant reduction of the time and effort for usability evaluation can be achieved. At the sketching and/or design stage of eLearning systems it will provide an effective guidance to usability analysts as to what problems should be focused on in order to improve the usability perception of the end-users. Relevance to industry: During the sketching or design stage of eLearning platforms usability problems should be revealed and eradicated to create more usable and quality eLearning systems to satisfy the end-users. The UseLearn checklist along with its quantitative methodology proposed in this study would be helpful for usability experts to achieve this goal. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Many countries around the world install mullions of computers. printers projectors smartboards and similar technologies in primary and secondary schools to equip new generations with the ability to effectively access and critically evaluate information and communication technologies. However experiences from different countries show that technology does not deliver educational success itself. There are some chronic problems hindering the effective use of educational technology This article aims to identify reasons behind the repetitive problems which occur in the context of Turkey's e-learning efforts in primary and secondary learning. The focus is to find out why an organization repeats the same mistakes and has to reinvent the wheel in similar consecutive projects.

In case of insufficient data samples in high-dimensional classification problems sparse scatters of samples tend to have many 'holes'-regions that have few or no nearby training samples from the class. When such regions lie close to inter-class boundaries the nearest neighbors of a query may lie in the wrong class thus leading to errors in the Nearest Neighbor classification rule. The K-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor (HKNN) algorithm tackles this problem by approximating each class with a smooth nonlinear manifold which is considered to be locally linear. The method takes advantage of the local linearity assumption by using the distances from a query sample to the affine hulls of query's nearest neighbors for decision making. However HKNN is limited to using the Euclidean distance metric which is a significant limitation in practice. In this paper we reformulate HKNN in terms of subspaces and propose a variant the Local Discriminative Common Vector (LDCV) method that is more suitable for classification tasks where the classes have similar intra-class variations. We then extend both methods to the nonlinear case by mapping the nearest neighbors into a higher-dimensional space where the linear manifolds are constructed. This procedure allows us to use a wide variety of distance functions in the process while computing distances between the query sample and the nonlinear manifolds remains straightforward owing to the linear nature of the manifolds in the mapped space. We tested the proposed methods on several classification tasks obtaining better results than both the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and their local counterpart SVM-KNN on the USPS and Image segmentation databases and outperforming the local SVM-KNN on the Caltech visual recognition database.;2010;ın case of insufficient data samples in high-dimensional classification problems sparse scatters of samples tend to have many 'holes'-regions that have few or no nearby training samples from the class. when such regions lie close to inter-class boundaries the nearest neighbors of a query may lie in the wrong class thus leading to errors in the nearest neighbor classification rule. the k-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor (hknn) algorithm tackles this problem by approximating each class with a smooth nonlinear manifold which is considered to be locally linear. the method takes advantage of the local linearity assumption by using the distances from a query sample to the affine hulls of query's nearest neighbors for decision making. however hknn is limited to using the euclidean distance metric which is a significant limitation in practice. ın this paper we reformulate hknn in terms of subspaces and propose a variant the local discriminative common vector (ldcv) method that is more suitable for classification tasks where the classes have similar intra-class variations. we then extend both methods to the nonlinear case by mapping the nearest neighbors into a higher-dimensional space where the linear manifolds are constructed. this procedure allows us to use a wide variety of distance functions in the process while computing distances between the query sample and the nonlinear manifolds remains straightforward owing to the linear nature of the manifolds in the mapped space. we tested the proposed methods on several classification tasks obtaining better results than both the support vector machines (svms) and their local counterpart svm-knn on the usps and ımage segmentation databases and outperforming the local svm-knn on the caltech visual recognition database.
Recent developments and new directions in education have emphasised learners' needs profile and pedagogical aspects by focusing on learner-centered approaches in educational settings. e-Learning on the other hand guarantees learners the opportunity of learning in their own way and leads to new considerations in course design. e-Learning is defined as the new form of learning rather than the use of new technologies. It requires new considerations in educational aspects and delivery methods. Personalised technologies and new approaches such as the use of ontologies and Semantic Webs in e-learning are some of the next challenges for both education and society in the future.

It is common knowledge that attention is important for learning. We need to utilize attention in order to learn something efficiently and effectively. Similarly we may also need to acquire familiarity with (i.e. learn) our surroundings in order to utilize our attention. In this study learning is defined as a product of one's exposure to natural visual stimuli. Using a virtual model of a natural scene we investigate both attention and its relationship to learning according to this definition. Specifically our focus is the effect of environment familiarity on gaze direction. Our findings reveal that the factor of familiarity with one's surroundings in virtual reality environments exerts a significant influence on peoples' ability to detect a variety of specific changes that occur within scenes under their observation.

Learning Objects (LOS) within their new features give new opportunities to learners and educators. LO based learning environments are mostly used within web environments especially through distance education. This study presents an application about the use of LOs in a real classroom environment. In this application a Learning Object Repository (LOR) relevant to secondary school mathematics curricula has been prepared and published on the web. The research sample consists of thirty students from a high school at 9th grade. In order to answer the research questions about the implementation of LOs for mathematics teaching in a high school classroom qualitative and quantitative data were obtained both from the teacher and students participated in the study. The analysis of the data illustrated that students were easily able to follow the instructions of LOs and practise activities within LOs. The attitudes and approaches of students were generally positive. In despite of inconveniency with the teacher's familiar instructional practices she also expressed her positive opinions about the learning and motivational effects of LOs. These findings support the idea that the use of LOs can be an effective learning tool in high school mathematics classrooms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the effect of time on the development of a community of inquiry by examining an online course offered over two different time periods. The study was guided by the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework (Garrison Anderson Archer The Internet and Higher Education 2000 2(2-3): 87-105). The focus was on a graduate level education course the topic of which was blended learning. The course was given by the same instructor in a 13-week fall semester and a 6-week spring term. Transcript analysis of weekly online discussions and the CoI Survey were used to explore the differences between the short-term and long-term versions of this course in terms of each measure of CoI presence (social teaching and cognitive presence). The findings showed differences between the short-term and long-term versions of this course in terms of the development of each presence and students' perceptions.;2011;this study investigated the effect of time on the development of a community of inquiry by examining an online course offered over two different time periods. the study was guided by the community of ınquiry (coı) framework (garrison anderson archer the ınternet and higher education 2000 2(2-3): 87-105). the focus was on a graduate level education course the topic of which was blended learning. the course was given by the same instructor in a 13-week fall semester and a 6-week spring term. transcript analysis of weekly online discussions and the coı survey were used to explore the differences between the short-term and long-term versions of this course in terms of each measure of coı presence (social teaching and cognitive presence). the findings showed differences between the short-term and long-term versions of this course in terms of the development of each presence and students' perceptions.
Taking advantage of international economic opportunities a country must create and utilize information and communication technologies (ICTs) in all sectors of its economy. Establishing an ICT infrastructure that supports practice and training is an imperative since e-learning has become an integral to the internal business process in many large organizations ranging from industry to universities. In this study the ICT capacity of the public extension service in Turkey was analyzed using data collected from 538 extension workers in nine agricultural zones. Frequency cross-tabulation chi-square Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were employed for interpreting the data in the study. Some personal characteristics of extension workers such as age groups gender groups and education groups were used for comparing the extension workers. According to the research findings cyber/digital extension techniques mainly Internet and e-mail have found only limited application in Turkish extension services. In Turkey just 40% of extensionists regularly use ICT in their work. ICTs usage levels vary according to age education and gender. The varieties of web pages visited and actors contacted via e-mails during extension activities help to establish a more participatory and interactive structure in agricultural knowledge systems. The Internet is often used by 40.7% of extensionists in Turkey. They spend about 50.3 hours per month on the Internet. The topics accessed on the Internet were agricultural content and information needed for self-directed learning etc. In the last year 26.8% of extensionists used information from the Internet in preparing some advice for farmers. An average of 18 of extension advice to farmers is based on information from the Internet. In the case of frequent internet users 38% of their advice to farmers is based on information from the Internet. The most significant factors restricting the use of ICTs in extension were language proficiency of extensionists the costs of Internet computer hardware and connection and limited knowledge about ICTs.;2011;taking advantage of international economic opportunities a country must create and utilize information and communication technologies (ıcts) in all sectors of its economy. establishing an ıct infrastructure that supports practice and training is an imperative since e-learning has become an integral to the internal business process in many large organizations ranging from industry to universities. ın this study the ıct capacity of the public extension service in turkey was analyzed using data collected from 538 extension workers in nine agricultural zones. frequency cross-tabulation chi-square mann-whitney u test and kruskal-wallis test were employed for interpreting the data in the study. some personal characteristics of extension workers such as age groups gender groups and education groups were used for comparing the extension workers. according to the research findings cyber/digital extension techniques mainly ınternet and e-mail have found only limited application in turkish extension services. ın turkey just 40% of extensionists regularly use ıct in their work. ıcts usage levels vary according to age education and gender. the varieties of web pages visited and actors contacted via e-mails during extension activities help to establish a more participatory and interactive structure in agricultural knowledge systems. the ınternet is often used by 40.7% of extensionists in turkey. they spend about 50.3 hours per month on the ınternet. the topics accessed on the ınternet were agricultural content and information needed for self-directed learning etc. ın the last year 26.8% of extensionists used information from the ınternet in preparing some advice for farmers. an average of 18 of extension advice to farmers is based on information from the ınternet. ın the case of frequent internet users 38% of their advice to farmers is based on information from the ınternet. the most significant factors restricting the use of ıcts in extension were language proficiency of extensionists the costs of ınternet computer hardware and connection and limited knowledge about ıcts.
This study aims to identify using an extended Technology-Acceptance Model (TAM) the factors affecting the decision of using a web-based learning system among blue-collar workers in the automotive industry. A structural equation-modeling approach was applied to identify the variables that significantly affect the decision of using the system. Using LISREL 8.54 data collected from 546 blue-collar workers were used to test the proposed research model. Empirical testing of the extended TAM found all paths to be significant in the hypothesized directions that is the results of the study strongly support the application of extended TAM in predicting the blue-collar workers' intention to use a web-based learning system. Among the factors social influence is a much stronger predictor of user intention compared to others. The study concludes with the implications of this study for managers and recommendations for possible future research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to determine whether there is a relationship between students' sense of community perceived cognitive learning and satisfaction in an e-learning course. Additionally the relationship of these variables with Internet self-efficacy and final examination scores is investigated. The participants were 88 students enrolled in elementary level English as a Foreign Language course of the distance education program at a higher education institution in Turkey. The results of the study suggest that sense of community and course satisfactions are strongly related to each other. Moreover students' course satisfaction is highly related to their perceived cognitive learning. Students' perceived cognitive learning was observed to have a very strong relationship with learner-to-content interaction while learner-to-learner interaction was at medium level and learner-to-instructor interaction was weak.;2011;this study aims to determine whether there is a relationship between students' sense of community perceived cognitive learning and satisfaction in an e-learning course. additionally the relationship of these variables with ınternet self-efficacy and final examination scores is investigated. the participants were 88 students enrolled in elementary level english as a foreign language course of the distance education program at a higher education institution in turkey. the results of the study suggest that sense of community and course satisfactions are strongly related to each other. moreover students' course satisfaction is highly related to their perceived cognitive learning. students' perceived cognitive learning was observed to have a very strong relationship with learner-to-content interaction while learner-to-learner interaction was at medium level and learner-to-instructor interaction was weak.

This paper describes the findings of an exploratory qualitative case study and examines problems and impediments faculty members encountered in blended learning environments in Turkish Higher Education system. A total of 117 faculty members from 4 universities responded to 8 interview questions. Findings were based on content analyses of interview transcripts. The results show that faculty members' problems with blended teaching resulted in the identification of three inductive categories: instructional processes community concerns and technical issues. The eight themes emerged from these three categories include the following: (1) complexity of the instruction (2) lack of planning and organization (3) lack of effective communication (4) need for more time (5) lack of institutional support (6) changing roles (7) difficulty of adoption to new technologies and (8) lack of electronic means. This study indicates that teaching blended courses can be highly complex and have different teaching patterns which in turn impacts successful implementation of the blended college courses.

Technological developments have affected teachers' instructional techniques: technology has allowed the concept of education to be viewed from different perspectives. The aim of this research is to integrate Web 2.0 tools which are sparsely found on the internet (each tool is on a different site) into education and see if it positively affects learning also students' opinions about this formed environment will be sought. The study sample consists of 55 students from whom data was collected. Descriptive statistics were calculated and a paired sample t-test was used in order to compare pre-experience test and post-experience test means. The univariate of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare group means. Positive opinions of students show that the use of the WLS environment within Web 2.0 tools brings a new dimension to distance learning. This paper is orientated towards anyone interested in social networks and Web 2.0 tools and individuals who may be interested in this includes teachers instructors students and educational organisations such as universities and schools. It may also be useful to those who have a general interest in social networks and Web 2.0 tools. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A sound decision methodology for evaluating and selecting e-learning products should consider multiple and conflicting criteria and the interactions among them. In this paper a decision framework which employs quality function deployment (QFD) fuzzy linear regression and optimization is presented for e-learning product selection. First a methodology for determining the target values for e-learning product characteristics that maximize overall customer satisfaction is presented. The QFD framework is employed to allocate resources and to coordinate skills and functions based on customer needs. Differing from earlier QFD applications the proposed methodology employs fuzzy regression to determine the parameters of functional relationships between customer needs and e-learning product characteristics and among e-learning product characteristics themselves. Finally the e-learning product alternatives are evaluated and ranked with respect to deviations from the target product characteristic values. The potential use of the proposed decision framework is illustrated through an application on e-learning products provided by the universities in Turkey. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

This article intends to introduce an e-portfolio system to help mentors assess the teacher candidates' performances and products in a large scale open and distance learning teacher training program. The Pre-School Teacher Training Program (PSTTP) of Anadolu University is a completely distance program that helps around 12.000 students get the required pre-service training to be able to apply for working at schools as teachers. This article focuses on design implementation management and evaluation of the e-portfolio system for PSTTP. In e-portfolio system it is expected that the managerial decisions (i.e. program/course design and selection technology selection teaching method selection so on.) are effective and efficient in many stages. Change in managerial understanding and structuring is required to improve the e-counseling system one of the corner stones of e-portfolio implementation. In parallel with all these expectations and goals developing and spreading the e-portfolio implementations which require constant evaluation and analysis of drawbacks and advantages will contribute to the structuring of the assessment process in distance education providing a more functional active and faster participation.;2011;this article intends to introduce an e-portfolio system to help mentors assess the teacher candidates' performances and products in a large scale open and distance learning teacher training program. the pre-school teacher training program (psttp) of anadolu university is a completely distance program that helps around 12.000 students get the required pre-service training to be able to apply for working at schools as teachers. this article focuses on design implementation management and evaluation of the e-portfolio system for psttp. ın e-portfolio system it is expected that the managerial decisions (i.e. program/course design and selection technology selection teaching method selection so on.) are effective and efficient in many stages. change in managerial understanding and structuring is required to improve the e-counseling system one of the corner stones of e-portfolio implementation. ın parallel with all these expectations and goals developing and spreading the e-portfolio implementations which require constant evaluation and analysis of drawbacks and advantages will contribute to the structuring of the assessment process in distance education providing a more functional active and faster participation.
The objective of this study is to present a model in the framework of Distance Education (DE) which suggests that a Distance Physical Education Program (DPEP) could be applied to those who are at various ages in various geographical locations and are working in various professions as part-time or full-time professionals. The use of DE in physical education with the support of education technologies and specialist systems provides significant opportunities. Through its flexible structure DPEP partly or completely eliminates the restrictions encountered in traditional physical education programs such as high costs differences in age geographical location and profession and it provides solutions that are specific to an individual. The scope of this study comprises all of the referees who are employed in the Turkish Super League (34 top-class and high classification referees and 78 top-class and high classification assistant referees). The program was applied for two years (2 x 46 weeks in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010). In order to collect data physical measurements were made at the beginning of the application at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year of the application to assess referees' capabilities of endurance speed agility and recovery ability. The results were loaded into a database. Based on the test results referees were submitted to individual and physical education programs via weekly e-mails. The outputs recorded by the referees during the application period with the support of specialist systems were submitted to the trainer every week. These were then entered into the training diary in the software on the computer and were later subjected to assessment. At the end of the assessment process referees were provided with feedback and the physical education continued without interruption. For the analysis and evaluation of the data statistical techniques such as descriptive statistics one-way repeated measures and post hoc comparisons were used. When the analysis results were evaluated it was found that the endurance capabilities of referees and assistant referees significantly improved which is a fact that can directly affect their professional proficiencies. The results of this study reveal that it is possible to conduct remote physical education in the scope of DE by taking into account the individual differences and by including the support of suitable technology.;2011;the objective of this study is to present a model in the framework of distance education (de) which suggests that a distance physical education program (dpep) could be applied to those who are at various ages in various geographical locations and are working in various professions as part-time or full-time professionals. the use of de in physical education with the support of education technologies and specialist systems provides significant opportunities. through its flexible structure dpep partly or completely eliminates the restrictions encountered in traditional physical education programs such as high costs differences in age geographical location and profession and it provides solutions that are specific to an individual. the scope of this study comprises all of the referees who are employed in the turkish super league (34 top-class and high classification referees and 78 top-class and high classification assistant referees). the program was applied for two years (2 x 46 weeks in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010). ın order to collect data physical measurements were made at the beginning of the application at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year of the application to assess referees' capabilities of endurance speed agility and recovery ability. the results were loaded into a database. based on the test results referees were submitted to individual and physical education programs via weekly e-mails. the outputs recorded by the referees during the application period with the support of specialist systems were submitted to the trainer every week. these were then entered into the training diary in the software on the computer and were later subjected to assessment. at the end of the assessment process referees were provided with feedback and the physical education continued without interruption. for the analysis and evaluation of the data statistical techniques such as descriptive statistics one-way repeated measures and post hoc comparisons were used. when the analysis results were evaluated it was found that the endurance capabilities of referees and assistant referees significantly improved which is a fact that can directly affect their professional proficiencies. the results of this study reveal that it is possible to conduct remote physical education in the scope of de by taking into account the individual differences and by including the support of suitable technology.
The primary aim of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Online Learning Environment Survey (OLES) in postsecondary distance education. The OLES is a 54 item instrument for assessing social-psychological perceptions among distance education students. The second aim was to investigate empirically perception of the online learning environment in Turkish context. This paper consisted of three models explaining online learning environments in the Turkish context. Model I based on relations of originally item-construct reported by Trinidad Aldridge & Fraser (2004) was analyzed with gathered data from Turkey setting by the translation adaptation and validation of the Online Learning Environment Survey (OLES) (Trinidad Aldridge & Fraser 2004) in a new Turkish-language form. In Model I the OLES was designed to measure nine dimensions of online educational environment. The fit of the proposed multidimensional factor structure was examined with 902 post-secondary distance education students in two institutions. Model II based on relations of emprically item-construct which were obtained with principal component analysis was investigated with first-order confirmatory factor analysis. Model II consist of twelve subconstructs. Model III with a higher-order construct with twelve first-order factors of OLES-TR was perfectly represented as a general online learning environments trait rather than the OLES.;2011;the primary aim of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the turkish version of the online learning environment survey (oles) in postsecondary distance education. the oles is a 54 item instrument for assessing social-psychological perceptions among distance education students. the second aim was to investigate empirically perception of the online learning environment in turkish context. this paper consisted of three models explaining online learning environments in the turkish context. model ı based on relations of originally item-construct reported by trinidad aldridge & fraser (2004) was analyzed with gathered data from turkey setting by the translation adaptation and validation of the online learning environment survey (oles) (trinidad aldridge & fraser 2004) in a new turkish-language form. ın model ı the oles was designed to measure nine dimensions of online educational environment. the fit of the proposed multidimensional factor structure was examined with 902 post-secondary distance education students in two institutions. model ıı based on relations of emprically item-construct which were obtained with principal component analysis was investigated with first-order confirmatory factor analysis. model ıı consist of twelve subconstructs. model ııı with a higher-order construct with twelve first-order factors of oles-tr was perfectly represented as a general online learning environments trait rather than the oles.

Due to increasing demand for education and training in the information age online learning and teaching is becoming a necessity in our future. However lack of research goals to understand impact of online learning environments on students is a problem in research on online learning environments. We identified four main research goals to pursue in online learning environments based on their impact on learner achievement engagement and retention (opposite of attrition). Those goals are (a) enhancing learner engagement & collaboration (b) promoting effective facilitation (c) developing assessment techniques and (d) designing faculty development programs. Current promising work in those areas is presented. Four methods that are common in the instructional technology literature are recommended to pursue those goals. Formative research and developmental research are relevant for all four. Although appropriate for any of the goals experimental research is a better fit for goals b and c and activity theory is useful for goals a and b. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study is to determine how students who are taking synchronous distance education classes via video conferencing perceive distance learning courses. A qualitative research approach was used for the study. Scale sampling was also used. The study's subjects consisted of a total of nine students comprised of 2(nd) and 4(th) grade students engaged in a course via synchronous distance education. For the study the case method a qualitative research method was used and research data was obtained via semi-structured interviews and observation results. Data was analyzed by means of the descriptive analysis method. Findings obtained at the study's conclusion indicate that students' perceptions of the course changed during and at the completion of the course. It was generally seen in the descriptions students made about the environment before taking synchronous distance education that they did not have advance information or that they had a prejudice due to their misinformation. It is seen in the conducted interviews that these prejudices start to be eliminated thanks to the opportunities provided by synchronous distance education through this process. It appears from students' descriptions of the course environment prior to taking the course that they did not have enough information or had preconceived ideas. As the course progressed student perception changed and they were able to perceive more clearly the opportunities that synchronous distance education can provide. In this study the most important problem in synchronous distance education was determined to be disconnection and sound problems. In this study a significant problem was the hardware - i.e. sound speed and connectivity issues. As well students became bored after some time because of limited camera angles and cameras. It was concluded that this situation prevents the continuity of the course and so leads to distraction. On the other hand it was observed that students start to get bored of the course after a while due to the fixedness of the camera angle and the small quantity of cameras. We also noticed that the fixed camera angle small number of cameras and problems occurring in the images affected student perceptions. Besides these technical problems the researchers observed and the students expressed that the factors of teacher environment distance course type and duration also caused the students' perceptions to change.;2011;the objective of this study is to determine how students who are taking synchronous distance education classes via video conferencing perceive distance learning courses. a qualitative research approach was used for the study. scale sampling was also used. the study's subjects consisted of a total of nine students comprised of 2(nd) and 4(th) grade students engaged in a course via synchronous distance education. for the study the case method a qualitative research method was used and research data was obtained via semi-structured interviews and observation results. data was analyzed by means of the descriptive analysis method. findings obtained at the study's conclusion indicate that students' perceptions of the course changed during and at the completion of the course. ıt was generally seen in the descriptions students made about the environment before taking synchronous distance education that they did not have advance information or that they had a prejudice due to their misinformation. ıt is seen in the conducted interviews that these prejudices start to be eliminated thanks to the opportunities provided by synchronous distance education through this process. ıt appears from students' descriptions of the course environment prior to taking the course that they did not have enough information or had preconceived ideas. as the course progressed student perception changed and they were able to perceive more clearly the opportunities that synchronous distance education can provide. ın this study the most important problem in synchronous distance education was determined to be disconnection and sound problems. ın this study a significant problem was the hardware - i.e. sound speed and connectivity issues. as well students became bored after some time because of limited camera angles and cameras. ıt was concluded that this situation prevents the continuity of the course and so leads to distraction. on the other hand it was observed that students start to get bored of the course after a while due to the fixedness of the camera angle and the small quantity of cameras. we also noticed that the fixed camera angle small number of cameras and problems occurring in the images affected student perceptions. besides these technical problems the researchers observed and the students expressed that the factors of teacher environment distance course type and duration also caused the students' perceptions to change.

Background: There is increasing attention to online learning as a convenient way of getting professional training. The number and popularity of online nursing continuing education programs are increasing rapidly in many countries. Understanding these may contribute to designing these programs to maximize success. Also knowing the perceptions and preferences in online learning aids development and orientation of online programs. The aims of this study are to show nurses' perceptions of online continuing education and to determine perceptions of various groups area groups working companies frequency of computer usage and age. Methods: The survey method was used in this quantitative study to reveal perception levels and relationship with related variables. Data were collected through an online instrument from a convenience sample of 1041 Registered Nurses (RNs) at an online bachelor's degree program. Descriptive and inferential analysis techniques were performed. Results: Nurses generally have positive perceptions about online learning (X = 3.86 SD = 0.48). A significant difference was seen between nurses who used computers least and those with the highest computer usage [F (3 1033) = 3.040 P < .05]. Neither nurses' ages nor lengths of working experience are significantly related to perceptions of online programs (r = -.013 P > .05 and r = -.036 P > .05 respectively). Nurses' perceptions are significantly different depending on the settings where they work [F (3989) = 3.193 P < .05]. The difference between perceptions of nurses living in urban areas (X = 3.82 SD = .51) and those living in rural areas (X = 3.88 SD = .47) was not significant [t (994) = -1.570 P > .05]. Conclusions: We found that nurses regard online learning opportunities as suitable for their working conditions and needs.

In this study we aim to conduct a complete evaluation of the e-portfolio application in the distance teaching practice course that is part of the Distance English Language Teacher (DELT) program at Anadolu University from the perspective of three groups: university supervisors preservice teachers and cooperating teachers. Using a survey on the needs of preservice teachers and how well these were met according to the three groups' perspectives we gathered qualitative and quantitative data on the feasibility of the e-portfolio application. Our analysis of the findings revealed that all three groups agreed about the needs of preservice teachers. And despite some minor variance in the perspectives of each group we determined that e-portfolio applications can meet the majority of the planning teaching and reflection needs in the teaching process. We offer suggestions to improve e-portfolio applications so they will better meet preservice teachers' needs.;2012;ın this study we aim to conduct a complete evaluation of the e-portfolio application in the distance teaching practice course that is part of the distance english language teacher (delt) program at anadolu university from the perspective of three groups: university supervisors preservice teachers and cooperating teachers. using a survey on the needs of preservice teachers and how well these were met according to the three groups' perspectives we gathered qualitative and quantitative data on the feasibility of the e-portfolio application. our analysis of the findings revealed that all three groups agreed about the needs of preservice teachers. and despite some minor variance in the perspectives of each group we determined that e-portfolio applications can meet the majority of the planning teaching and reflection needs in the teaching process. we offer suggestions to improve e-portfolio applications so they will better meet preservice teachers' needs.
This paper aims to investigate the perceptions of prospective EFL teachers in the distance higher education system toward ICT implementation in teaching English as a foreign language. The majority of respondents who expressed negative attitudes to ICT integration found the nature level and delivery of the training inadequate and accordingly affirmed that they do not feel sufficiently competent to use ICT in their future subject teaching without having sufficient prior knowledge of ICT dissemination. The results of the study imply that training that will enable teachers to become competent in and receptive to ICT is quite critical in distance education realms.;2012;this paper aims to investigate the perceptions of prospective efl teachers in the distance higher education system toward ıct implementation in teaching english as a foreign language. the majority of respondents who expressed negative attitudes to ıct integration found the nature level and delivery of the training inadequate and accordingly affirmed that they do not feel sufficiently competent to use ıct in their future subject teaching without having sufficient prior knowledge of ıct dissemination. the results of the study imply that training that will enable teachers to become competent in and receptive to ıct is quite critical in distance education realms.
The study compared the effects of Learning Objects (LOs) within different applications in classroom and in extracurricular activities. So in this study firstly a Learning Object Repository (LOR) has been designed in parallel with 9th grade school mathematics curriculum. One of the two treatment groups was named as classroom group (n=24) used LOs with the guidance of the teacher during lessons in a computer lab another group named as project group (n=26) used LOs at home with the aim of preparing projects and assignments. Students in both groups used LOs during 11 weeks. A pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design was used. Test results are compared in different learning domains (sets numbers relations and functions). In addition the interviews with the teacher and the observations inside the class were taken into account for revealing the reasons about the change on academic achievements. The results of the study about students' academic achievements showed that LOs use in classroom activities were more effective than LOs use in extracurricular activities if sets numbers relations functions and operations domains are considered together. Nevertheless this study supported the idea of LOs can be used in both in classroom activities and in extracurricular activities.;2012;the study compared the effects of learning objects (los) within different applications in classroom and in extracurricular activities. so in this study firstly a learning object repository (lor) has been designed in parallel with 9th grade school mathematics curriculum. one of the two treatment groups was named as classroom group (n=24) used los with the guidance of the teacher during lessons in a computer lab another group named as project group (n=26) used los at home with the aim of preparing projects and assignments. students in both groups used los during 11 weeks. a pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design was used. test results are compared in different learning domains (sets numbers relations and functions). ın addition the interviews with the teacher and the observations inside the class were taken into account for revealing the reasons about the change on academic achievements. the results of the study about students' academic achievements showed that los use in classroom activities were more effective than los use in extracurricular activities if sets numbers relations functions and operations domains are considered together. nevertheless this study supported the idea of los can be used in both in classroom activities and in extracurricular activities.
This study investigated the relationship among three types of presences including place presence social presence and co-presence in virtual worlds and their relationship with satisfaction and immersive tendencies of students. Students' scores on a subjective questionnaire were analyzed. The results indicated that there was a significant relationship among the place presence social presence and co-presence. While social presence seemed to affect the satisfaction most place and co-presence also affected students' satisfaction in the virtual world. Moreover immersive tendencies of the students were related to their place and co-presence but not to their social presence. Findings highlighted the important issues for the design of virtual world environments to increase presence and satisfaction of students. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Implementing instructional interventions to accommodate learner differences has received considerable attention. Among these individual difference variables the empirical evidence regarding the pedagogical value of learning styles has been questioned but the research on the issue continues. Recent developments in Web-based implementations have led scholars to reconsider the learning style research in adaptive systems. The current study involved a content analysis of recent studies on adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) which addressed learning styles. After an extensive search on electronic databases seventy studies were selected and exposed to a document analysis. Study features were classified under several themes such as the research purposes methodology features of adaptive interventions and student modeling and findings. The analysis revealed that the majority of studies proposed a framework or model for adaptivity whereas few studies addressed the effectiveness of learning style-based AEH. Scales were used for learning style identification more than automatic student modeling. One third of the studies provided a framework without empirical evaluation with students. Findings on concrete learning outcomes were not strong enough: however several studies revealed that suggested models influenced student satisfaction and success. Current trends potential research gaps and implications were discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines the global software development process by using content analysis techniques as described in an earlier study (Serce et al. 2011) to determine time-variant patterns of communication behaviors among student teams engaged in a global software development project. Data gathered from two software development projects involving students in the US Panama and Turkey were used to determine how globally distributed team behavior is temporally patterned in complex ways. A formal quantitative methodology for time variant analysis of the transcripts of global software student teams based on content analysis is established. Results from the analysis suggest a positive correlation between a team's temporal communication patterns and project outcomes as well as a relationship between variations in communication behaviors and different phases of the software development cycle. The research also found that the temporal variations in communication behaviors between software phases were similar for the two projects. Such findings are intended to strengthen the case for developing new temporal measures for analyzing groups and teams. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

E-learning has made rapid strides in recent years. Variety of tools supporting blended and online education systems paves the way for the development of e-learning. One of the main tools used in e-learning to support learning is undoubtedly asynchronous task-based online discussion groups or discussion board. Existing e-learning platforms (open source or in the market) provide collaboration tools however they are not truly integrated with other modules causing serial problems for the group members. Integration of discussion boards into the course content is of vital importance since they may directly affect learning. In this study we suggest a new easy-to-use-framework in which discussion boards are embedded in course content providing easy access to the students without distancing them from the learning material. The tutor can write feedback comments and rate on each learner's postings. Moreover students can also grade his friends' postings which may enhance their motivation and may also increase the number of the postings. This framework enriches course content with the power of forum tools and makes learners in the discussion process active with the support of feedback and grade reward.;2012;e-learning has made rapid strides in recent years. variety of tools supporting blended and online education systems paves the way for the development of e-learning. one of the main tools used in e-learning to support learning is undoubtedly asynchronous task-based online discussion groups or discussion board. existing e-learning platforms (open source or in the market) provide collaboration tools however they are not truly integrated with other modules causing serial problems for the group members. ıntegration of discussion boards into the course content is of vital importance since they may directly affect learning. ın this study we suggest a new easy-to-use-framework in which discussion boards are embedded in course content providing easy access to the students without distancing them from the learning material. the tutor can write feedback comments and rate on each learner's postings. moreover students can also grade his friends' postings which may enhance their motivation and may also increase the number of the postings. this framework enriches course content with the power of forum tools and makes learners in the discussion process active with the support of feedback and grade reward.

Nowadays distance learning education has been started to become familiar in behalf of classical face to face education (F2F) model. Web based learning is a major part of distance education systems. Web based distance learning can be defined shortly as an education type which doesn't force students and educators being into the same mediums. This education model has a student-cantered structure. In this type of education students can learn given lectures without dependency of time and place. And also students can communicate with their educators via various technology platforms. This is a fact that there are many factors have been effecting achievement of students in web-based distance learning. The success of students can be increased while determining weighted achievement factors.

E-learning has made rapid strides in recent years thanks to the advances in educational technology. Many educational institutions have started e-learning. In e-learning there is a need for administration documentation delivery of the course content and tracking students' performances all of which are done by the help of a software called Learning Management System (LMS). A robust LMS is a requirement for achieving the goals of the institution providing e-learning. There are basically three kinds of EMS: open source commercial and institution-based (self-developed). All of them have advantages and disadvantages. Choosing the type of LMS to be used by any institution depends on the decision makers of that institution. Decision makers in Kirikkale University chose to develop its own LMS depending on the individual needs of its distance education center. In this study a new learning management system called KUZEM LMS created by the software development team of Kirikkale University and used in the Distance Education Center of the same university is aimed to be introduced.

This study deals with the design and development process of computerized adaptive testing module integrated into UZWEBMAT. UZWEBMAT is an expert system supported adaptive and intelligent individualized e-learning environment. It was devoted to teach probability subject. A question bank was created in the study in the first place. This question bank was administered to learners in the form of work sheets. These tests were analyzed according to Item Response Theory. Model-data adaptivity was tested at the end of the analyses. It was deduced that data can be adapted to 3PL. Items non-compliant with 3PL were extracted from the question bank. At the end of these operations final question bank containing 752 questions in total was obtained. Learners taught with UZWEBMAT took end-of-subject tests for permutation combination binomial expansion and probability containing 20 20 15 and 20 questions respectively. Besides learners completing all subjects took end-of unit test containing 30 questions. Items in these tests were dynamically selected from the question bank pursuant to adaptive assessment. While test was dynamically being formed the question providing the furthest information regarding current estimated ability level of examinee was determined and it was presented to next examinee. Ability level of the examinee was re-estimated and updated according to the answer of each question. Thanks to this module learners individually taught with UZWEBMAT are provided with adaptive assessment in accordance with their own qualifications and capacities. In contrast to classical tests individual assessment becomes a reality through adaptive assessment which provides the opportunity to know learners according to their ability levels.

Recent research has shown that a growing number of students are victims of cyberbullying and a wider realization and a thorough understanding of cyberbullying is needed. Purpose of the Study: This survey-based study set out to explore the relationship between personality traits and cyberbullying among university students receiving education through either face-to-face or distance education modes. Methods: A sectional research design and correlation survey method was adopted throughout the study. As a causal and comparative study the dependent variable was set as cyberbullying (actively bullying others and/or being bullied) and the independent variable included five personality types. A path model was developed and tested in order to investigate the effects of learning modes and aforementioned personality types on two levels of cyberbullying. Findings and Results: The good fit indexes belonging to the model indicated acceptable conditions and capacity for explaining the relations among the variables. Emotional instability was observed as the leading predictor of being cyberbullied with a medium effect size. On the other hand the weakest predictor of being bullied was found to be openness to experience with a minor level negative effect size. The developed model was observed to be valid for both face-to-face and distance education learning modes. In addition a positive and medium level relationship between bullying and being exposed to bullying was observed. Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis conducted on the points obtained from the cyberbullying scale revealed that the majority of the group rarely bullies and is rarely exposed to cyberbullying. Conclusions and Recommendations: This study contributes to the extant literature on bullying in a few conceptual areas. For instance few research studies have examined the bullying issue in the tertiary context and through learning modes. The current investigation was limited by using a single data set to conduct all analyses. Further research is recommended to involve various variables such as cross-cultural effects on cyberbullying.;2012;problem statement: cyberbullying is associated with significant psychological issues among young people such as depression emotional distress low self-esteem and poor academic achievement. ıt is also regarded as an increasingly emergent problem in educational settings putting learners' psychological health safety and well-being at risk. recent research has shown that a growing number of students are victims of cyberbullying and a wider realization and a thorough understanding of cyberbullying is needed. purpose of the study: this survey-based study set out to explore the relationship between personality traits and cyberbullying among university students receiving education through either face-to-face or distance education modes. methods: a sectional research design and correlation survey method was adopted throughout the study. as a causal and comparative study the dependent variable was set as cyberbullying (actively bullying others and/or being bullied) and the independent variable included five personality types. a path model was developed and tested in order to investigate the effects of learning modes and aforementioned personality types on two levels of cyberbullying. findings and results: the good fit indexes belonging to the model indicated acceptable conditions and capacity for explaining the relations among the variables. emotional instability was observed as the leading predictor of being cyberbullied with a medium effect size. on the other hand the weakest predictor of being bullied was found to be openness to experience with a minor level negative effect size. the developed model was observed to be valid for both face-to-face and distance education learning modes. ın addition a positive and medium level relationship between bullying and being exposed to bullying was observed. ward's hierarchical cluster analysis conducted on the points obtained from the cyberbullying scale revealed that the majority of the group rarely bullies and is rarely exposed to cyberbullying. conclusions and recommendations: this study contributes to the extant literature on bullying in a few conceptual areas. for instance few research studies have examined the bullying issue in the tertiary context and through learning modes. the current investigation was limited by using a single data set to conduct all analyses. further research is recommended to involve various variables such as cross-cultural effects on cyberbullying.
Clin Microbiol Infect 2012 18: E308E313 Abstract Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat and compromises the management of infectious disease. This has particular significance in relation to infections of the respiratory tract which are the lead cause of antibiotic prescribing. Education is fundamental to the correct use of antibiotics. A novel open access curriculum has been developed in the context of a European Union funded research project Genomics to combat Resistance against Antibiotics in Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Europe (GRACE http://www.grace-lrti.org). The curriculum was developed in modular format and populated with clinical and scientific topics relevant to community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. This curriculum informed the content of a series of postgraduate courses and workshops and permitted the creation of an open access e-Learning portal. A total of 153 presentations matching the topics within the curriculum together with slide material and handouts and 104 webcasts are available through the GRACE e-Learning portal which is fully searchable using a mindmap to navigate the contents. Metrics of access provided a means for assessing usage. The GRACE project has permitted the development of a unique on-line open access curriculum that comprehensively addresses the issues relevant to community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections and has provided a resource not only for personal learning but also to support independent teaching activities such as lectures workshops seminars and course work.;2012;clin microbiol ınfect 2012 18: e308e313 abstract antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat and compromises the management of infectious disease. this has particular significance in relation to infections of the respiratory tract which are the lead cause of antibiotic prescribing. education is fundamental to the correct use of antibiotics. a novel open access curriculum has been developed in the context of a european union funded research project genomics to combat resistance against antibiotics in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in europe (grace http://www.grace-lrti.org). the curriculum was developed in modular format and populated with clinical and scientific topics relevant to community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. this curriculum informed the content of a series of postgraduate courses and workshops and permitted the creation of an open access e-learning portal. a total of 153 presentations matching the topics within the curriculum together with slide material and handouts and 104 webcasts are available through the grace e-learning portal which is fully searchable using a mindmap to navigate the contents. metrics of access provided a means for assessing usage. the grace project has permitted the development of a unique on-line open access curriculum that comprehensively addresses the issues relevant to community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections and has provided a resource not only for personal learning but also to support independent teaching activities such as lectures workshops seminars and course work.

Determination of students' attitudes towards online cooperative learning is an important issue which has not been studied adequately. In the literature there are few scales to measure the attitude towards online cooperative learning for which validity and reliability have been proven. The main purpose of this study is to develop an attitude scale in order to specify students' attitudes towards online cooperative learning. The sample group is composed of 599 students for the first application and 242 students for the second. In order to detect the validity of the scale exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses item factor total correlations corrected correlations and item discriminations were conducted. In order to assess the reliability of the scale the level of internal consistency and the stability levels were calculated. OCLAS is a five-point Likert-type scale and includes 17 items that can be gathered under 2 factors. The analyses provided evidence that the Online Cooperative Learning Attitude Scale (OCLAS) is a valid and reliable scale that can be used in order to determine students' attitudes towards cooperative learning in online environments.

This study was designed to test the validity and reliability of the Web-based Learning Environment Instrument (WEBLEI). Developed by Chang and Fisher (2003) the WEBLEI is a four-factor scale that measures the access interaction response and results. The multidimensional construct assesses student perceptions of four core aspects of the Web-based learning environment. The psychometric properties of the Turkish form of the WEBLEI were examined using a sample of 772 post-secondary students from Turkey. A series of CFA were performed to test four models to compare differing conceptualizations of the underlying structure of the WEBLEI to examine whether the WEBLEI comprises four sub-constructs proposed by Chang and Fisher (2003). Results indicated that the psychometric properties of correlated four-factor model were a satisfactory fit data.

It is essential to predict distance education students' year-end academic performance early during the course of the semester and to take precautions using such prediction-based information. This will in particular help enhance their academic performance and therefore improve the overall educational quality. The present study was on the development of a mathematical model intended to predict distance education students' year-end academic performance using the first eight-week data on the learning management system. First two fuzzy models were constructed namely the classical fuzzy model and the expert fuzzy model the latter being based on expert opinion. Afterwards a gene-fuzzy model was developed optimizing membership functions through genetic algorithm. The data on distance education were collected through Moodle an open source learning management system. The data were on a total of 218 students who enrolled in Basic Computer Sciences in 2012. The input data consisted of the following variables: When a student logged on to the system for the last time after the content of a lesson was uploaded how often he/she logged on to the system how long he/she stayed online in the last login what score he/she got in the quiz taken in Week 4 and what score he/she got in the midterm exam taken in Week 8. A comparison was made among the predictions of the three models concerning the students' year-end academic performance.;2013;ıt is essential to predict distance education students' year-end academic performance early during the course of the semester and to take precautions using such prediction-based information. this will in particular help enhance their academic performance and therefore improve the overall educational quality. the present study was on the development of a mathematical model intended to predict distance education students' year-end academic performance using the first eight-week data on the learning management system. first two fuzzy models were constructed namely the classical fuzzy model and the expert fuzzy model the latter being based on expert opinion. afterwards a gene-fuzzy model was developed optimizing membership functions through genetic algorithm. the data on distance education were collected through moodle an open source learning management system. the data were on a total of 218 students who enrolled in basic computer sciences in 2012. the input data consisted of the following variables: when a student logged on to the system for the last time after the content of a lesson was uploaded how often he/she logged on to the system how long he/she stayed online in the last login what score he/she got in the quiz taken in week 4 and what score he/she got in the midterm exam taken in week 8. a comparison was made among the predictions of the three models concerning the students' year-end academic performance.
Education plays an essential role in an individual life. It is through this process that a person initially formulates his thoughts with the help and guidance of the instructors within the boundaries of school. Parallel to this it is also by means of education that an individual discovers his strengths and is able to apply them to his practical life. In this regard it is important to utilise all aspects of the learning process including online procedures of teaching and learning that are so important in today world. It would be great to consider one of the initial moves of today world such as gearing up towards online procedures of teaching and learning. The facet of online teaching techniques is currently perceived by most individuals as an initial step towards transformation. Redefining techniques in the teaching system would deliver a set of skills knowledge and practicality to students some of whom are prospective teachers who are behind the walls of their classrooms. These new techniques could also expose them to a dimension of thought which is very pertinent to their daily activities and interests. Online social networking is so important for individuals today. Understanding the contributions of online teaching for students would be a huge leap towards achieving diverse learning with minimum supervision. This literature review references many studies that found that the importance of students interaction in online learning is essential both for educators and students. Students in online learning conditions performed modestly better than those receiving face-to-face instruction.;2013;education plays an essential role in an individual life. ıt is through this process that a person initially formulates his thoughts with the help and guidance of the instructors within the boundaries of school. parallel to this it is also by means of education that an individual discovers his strengths and is able to apply them to his practical life. ın this regard it is important to utilise all aspects of the learning process including online procedures of teaching and learning that are so important in today world. ıt would be great to consider one of the initial moves of today world such as gearing up towards online procedures of teaching and learning. the facet of online teaching techniques is currently perceived by most individuals as an initial step towards transformation. redefining techniques in the teaching system would deliver a set of skills knowledge and practicality to students some of whom are prospective teachers who are behind the walls of their classrooms. these new techniques could also expose them to a dimension of thought which is very pertinent to their daily activities and interests. online social networking is so important for individuals today. understanding the contributions of online teaching for students would be a huge leap towards achieving diverse learning with minimum supervision. this literature review references many studies that found that the importance of students interaction in online learning is essential both for educators and students. students in online learning conditions performed modestly better than those receiving face-to-face instruction.

This paper describes how interactive videoconference can benefit the Electrocardiography (ECG) skills of undergraduate nursing students. We have implemented a learning system that interactively transfers the visual and practical aspects of ECG from a nursing skills lab into a classroom where the theoretical part of the course is taught. The students and the instructor in the classroom observe the activities in the skill lab in real time while communicating with the nurse in the lab via audio and video links. An experiment was performed with the participation of 13 male and 57 female (total 70) second year nursing students-36 of who were assigned to Videoconference group (experimental group-VCG) and the other 34 were assigned to Traditional Classroom groups (control group-TCG). In the experiment ECG knowledge levels of participants were measured by repeated tests (pretest posttest I and posttest II) and data were analyzed with repeated measures of variances and covariance the results demonstrating that videoconferencing contributed significantly to the improvement of ECG skills of the participants. In addition a questionnaire was given to students along with posttest II and the result of which indicated overwhelming satisfaction with videoconference based lecture.;2013;this paper describes how interactive videoconference can benefit the electrocardiography (ecg) skills of undergraduate nursing students. we have implemented a learning system that interactively transfers the visual and practical aspects of ecg from a nursing skills lab into a classroom where the theoretical part of the course is taught. the students and the instructor in the classroom observe the activities in the skill lab in real time while communicating with the nurse in the lab via audio and video links. an experiment was performed with the participation of 13 male and 57 female (total 70) second year nursing students-36 of who were assigned to videoconference group (experimental group-vcg) and the other 34 were assigned to traditional classroom groups (control group-tcg). ın the experiment ecg knowledge levels of participants were measured by repeated tests (pretest posttest ı and posttest ıı) and data were analyzed with repeated measures of variances and covariance the results demonstrating that videoconferencing contributed significantly to the improvement of ecg skills of the participants. ın addition a questionnaire was given to students along with posttest ıı and the result of which indicated overwhelming satisfaction with videoconference based lecture.
Aims: A basic knowledge and understanding of first aid can be invaluable for both teachers and students to be able to provide emergency care in the event of an accident possibly saving lives and minimizing injury in school settings. The purpose of this research was to perform a comparison of online and face-to-face delivery modes for an introductory first aid course to determine if there existed a difference in student teachers' success depending on the delivery modes. Methods: The research compares participants' achievements in a first aid class taught by the same instructor using either face-to-face or online delivery modes. In total five sections of the course were assigned to either a face-to face or an online treatment condition. Results: The results of a paired samples t-test indicated that student teachers both in experiment and control groups performed adequately to attain the course goals (p < .05). The difference between the mean scores of all groups in pre- and post-tests verified the achievement of the participant learners. The results of a further independent t-test on groups' performances on the post application of the achievement test showed a significant variance in favour of participants who received online teaching (p < .05). Conclusion: The findings of the study suggest that while both online and face-to-face mode can be effective in achieving learning goals of first aid content online learning was found to be more effective in comparison to traditional classroom instruction.;2013;aims: a basic knowledge and understanding of first aid can be invaluable for both teachers and students to be able to provide emergency care in the event of an accident possibly saving lives and minimizing injury in school settings. the purpose of this research was to perform a comparison of online and face-to-face delivery modes for an introductory first aid course to determine if there existed a difference in student teachers' success depending on the delivery modes. methods: the research compares participants' achievements in a first aid class taught by the same instructor using either face-to-face or online delivery modes. ın total five sections of the course were assigned to either a face-to face or an online treatment condition. results: the results of a paired samples t-test indicated that student teachers both in experiment and control groups performed adequately to attain the course goals (p < .05). the difference between the mean scores of all groups in pre- and post-tests verified the achievement of the participant learners. the results of a further independent t-test on groups' performances on the post application of the achievement test showed a significant variance in favour of participants who received online teaching (p < .05). conclusion: the findings of the study suggest that while both online and face-to-face mode can be effective in achieving learning goals of first aid content online learning was found to be more effective in comparison to traditional classroom instruction.
Background: Although advances in distance learning have shown signs of a reconfiguration of the teacher's role in online environments a large number of online teaching practices still do not show many signs of this shift. Given the need for a change in pedagogies investigating how exemplary teachers transfer their thinking pedagogical knowledge and beliefs to successful online teaching is critical to understanding new online learning and teaching practices. The research on online teacher roles and practices however has been limited in terms of bringing teachers' voices into the research process and empowering them as autonomous professionals who constantly engage in a dialogue about solving complex problems and making decisions about online teaching. Purpose and Research Questions: The purpose of this research was to look at exemplary online teachers' transition to online teaching with a focus on their successful practices. The research investigated two central questions: (1) What are the successful practices that exemplary online teachers employ in their online teaching? (2) How do exemplary online teachers make a transition to online teaching in such a way that they create successful practices? Research Design: The study followed a qualitative multiple-case study approach examining six different cases of exemplary online teachers and their teaching contexts within a large research university in the Midwestern United States. Using multiple cases allowed for comparison of similar and contrasting online teaching situations and conditions within the university's different colleges. Participants Data Collection and Analysis: The data sources of the study consisted of (1) semistructured interviews conducted with six online program coordinators to collect contextual information and gather nominations for successful online teachers in each college and (2) ethnographic interviews conducted with 6 online teachers nominated as exemplary to gather teacher-expressed needs knowledge and successful practices. Within-and cross-case analyses were conducted to generate codes and identify the similarities and differences across the cases as well as common themes. Conclusions/Recommendations: The findings of this study indicated that when teachers described their successful practices they often linked them to their changing roles and new representation of their selves within an online environment. Their portrayal of the teacher self both built on a plethora of previous experiences and reformed with the affordances and limitations of the online environment went through a process whereby teachers were constantly challenged to make themselves heard known and felt by their students. This study showed that it was critical to listen to teachers' voices and give them a participatory role in the creation and use of their knowledge and experience in order to form their online teacher personas. As a result programs that prepare faculty to teach online may need to encourage teachers to reflect on their past experiences assumptions and beliefs toward learning and teaching and transform their perspectives by engaging in pedagogical inquiry and problem solving.;2013;background: although advances in distance learning have shown signs of a reconfiguration of the teacher's role in online environments a large number of online teaching practices still do not show many signs of this shift. given the need for a change in pedagogies investigating how exemplary teachers transfer their thinking pedagogical knowledge and beliefs to successful online teaching is critical to understanding new online learning and teaching practices. the research on online teacher roles and practices however has been limited in terms of bringing teachers' voices into the research process and empowering them as autonomous professionals who constantly engage in a dialogue about solving complex problems and making decisions about online teaching. purpose and research questions: the purpose of this research was to look at exemplary online teachers' transition to online teaching with a focus on their successful practices. the research investigated two central questions: (1) what are the successful practices that exemplary online teachers employ in their online teaching? (2) how do exemplary online teachers make a transition to online teaching in such a way that they create successful practices? research design: the study followed a qualitative multiple-case study approach examining six different cases of exemplary online teachers and their teaching contexts within a large research university in the midwestern united states. using multiple cases allowed for comparison of similar and contrasting online teaching situations and conditions within the university's different colleges. participants data collection and analysis: the data sources of the study consisted of (1) semistructured interviews conducted with six online program coordinators to collect contextual information and gather nominations for successful online teachers in each college and (2) ethnographic interviews conducted with 6 online teachers nominated as exemplary to gather teacher-expressed needs knowledge and successful practices. within-and cross-case analyses were conducted to generate codes and identify the similarities and differences across the cases as well as common themes. conclusions/recommendations: the findings of this study indicated that when teachers described their successful practices they often linked them to their changing roles and new representation of their selves within an online environment. their portrayal of the teacher self both built on a plethora of previous experiences and reformed with the affordances and limitations of the online environment went through a process whereby teachers were constantly challenged to make themselves heard known and felt by their students. this study showed that it was critical to listen to teachers' voices and give them a participatory role in the creation and use of their knowledge and experience in order to form their online teacher personas. as a result programs that prepare faculty to teach online may need to encourage teachers to reflect on their past experiences assumptions and beliefs toward learning and teaching and transform their perspectives by engaging in pedagogical inquiry and problem solving.
Problem Statement: Teaching a language with the help of comput ers and the Internet has attracted the attention of many practitioners and researchers in the last 20 years so the number of studies that investigate whether computers and the Internet promote language learning continues to increase. These studies have focused on exploring the beliefs and attitudes of learners and teachers towards computers and the Internet or on inquiring whether computers and the Internet increase the achievement levels of learners or enhance students' awareness of other cultures. Despite the widespread use of computers and the Internet in educational settings a small number of research studies have investigated the role of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) in promoting learner autonomy. This study will contribute to the literature on the ways that CALL environments foster learner autonomy. Purpose: The aim of this study is to utilize language learning environments equipped with technology to develop learner autonomy. There are four behavioural indicators of autonomy: using language learning strategies a high motivation level to learn the English language taking responsibility for one's own learning and continued English language study outside the classroom. Method: Forty-eight intermediate-level students at a private university in Ankara Turkey participated in this study. The students were divided into two groups: the Strategy Training Group (STG) and the Non-Strategy Training Group (NSTG). The students in the STG received a five-week language learning strategy training through CALL while the participants in the NSTG followed the university's regular curriculum. Data were collected by means of questionnaires semi-structured face-to-face interviews classroom observations e-learning diaries and the five-week language learning strategy training through CALL. Findings and Results: The results of the study indicate that the students in the STG displayed improvement in their usage of language learning strategies had higher motivation were more willing to take responsibility for their own learning and were engaged in extra-curricular study by means of CALL compared to the students in the NSTG. Conclusions and Recommendations: Becoming autonomous learners necessitates readiness on the part of the students. Therefore it is important for instructors to know whether their students are ready to develop autonomy. Autonomous learning differs from conventional foreign language education in the sense that the primary focus of autonomous learning is on the learners' individual awareness of the learning process. Therefore it would be beneficial for curriculum units in language teaching institutions to revise course objectives and to design classroom activities that promote learner autonomy.;2013;problem statement: teaching a language with the help of comput ers and the ınternet has attracted the attention of many practitioners and researchers in the last 20 years so the number of studies that investigate whether computers and the ınternet promote language learning continues to increase. these studies have focused on exploring the beliefs and attitudes of learners and teachers towards computers and the ınternet or on inquiring whether computers and the ınternet increase the achievement levels of learners or enhance students' awareness of other cultures. despite the widespread use of computers and the ınternet in educational settings a small number of research studies have investigated the role of computer-assisted language learning (call) in promoting learner autonomy. this study will contribute to the literature on the ways that call environments foster learner autonomy. purpose: the aim of this study is to utilize language learning environments equipped with technology to develop learner autonomy. there are four behavioural indicators of autonomy: using language learning strategies a high motivation level to learn the english language taking responsibility for one's own learning and continued english language study outside the classroom. method: forty-eight intermediate-level students at a private university in ankara turkey participated in this study. the students were divided into two groups: the strategy training group (stg) and the non-strategy training group (nstg). the students in the stg received a five-week language learning strategy training through call while the participants in the nstg followed the university's regular curriculum. data were collected by means of questionnaires semi-structured face-to-face interviews classroom observations e-learning diaries and the five-week language learning strategy training through call. findings and results: the results of the study indicate that the students in the stg displayed improvement in their usage of language learning strategies had higher motivation were more willing to take responsibility for their own learning and were engaged in extra-curricular study by means of call compared to the students in the nstg. conclusions and recommendations: becoming autonomous learners necessitates readiness on the part of the students. therefore it is important for instructors to know whether their students are ready to develop autonomy. autonomous learning differs from conventional foreign language education in the sense that the primary focus of autonomous learning is on the learners' individual awareness of the learning process. therefore it would be beneficial for curriculum units in language teaching institutions to revise course objectives and to design classroom activities that promote learner autonomy.

Experimental experience has a significant effect on students' engineering education and improves their practical skills. However experiments are high-cost requiring laboratory space experimental sets and so on. Computer-assisted learning (CAL) can provide a similar educational effect. Web-based interfaces a type of CAL often used in distance education are therefore economical solutions in that they require neither laboratories nor experimental equipment. In particular they facilitate students' understanding of the practical applications of their engineering education. This paper proposes the Web-based simulation of analog modulation techniques using MATLAB. To this end a Web-based educational interface called AnalogWeb was designed and implemented as part of an analog communication course. AnalogWeb was developed using MATLAB Builder for NE with WebFigures and ASP. NET platform it can be easily accessed by users/students using only a Web browser and requires no installation of MATLAB or any special program on the server or the clients. AnalogWeb is a user-friendly educational interface providing advanced visualization tools such as zoom moving graphics and three-dimensional imaging.

The dynamic and more demanding nature of today's life conditions force people and corporations to invest in life-long education. It is important to make this continuous learning process more affordable and accessible to larger groups of people. At this point e-learning seems to be more convenient way of learning than formal education especially for working adults because of their time and place constraints and their need for flexibility. The crucial concern is whether the e-learning process is useful or not and under what conditions it brings more value to adult learners. Thus the core research question guiding this study is: What are the most significant factors influencing corporatee-learning success? The study aims to answer this question by developing e-learning success models via data mining. After a number of data preprocessing activities a combination of descriptive and predictive data mining methodologies are applied on the data set. Most of the independent factors (learner demographics learner experience and course characteristics) are discovered to have power at different levels for explaining variance in e-learning success. Course program characteristics like content type existence of certification are explored having a strong influence on the success of e-learning process.;2013;the dynamic and more demanding nature of today's life conditions force people and corporations to invest in life-long education. ıt is important to make this continuous learning process more affordable and accessible to larger groups of people. at this point e-learning seems to be more convenient way of learning than formal education especially for working adults because of their time and place constraints and their need for flexibility. the crucial concern is whether the e-learning process is useful or not and under what conditions it brings more value to adult learners. thus the core research question guiding this study is: what are the most significant factors influencing corporatee-learning success? the study aims to answer this question by developing e-learning success models via data mining. after a number of data preprocessing activities a combination of descriptive and predictive data mining methodologies are applied on the data set. most of the independent factors (learner demographics learner experience and course characteristics) are discovered to have power at different levels for explaining variance in e-learning success. course program characteristics like content type existence of certification are explored having a strong influence on the success of e-learning process.
In accordance with expository teaching the aim of the research is to determine the effects of five different e-learning types on student achievement. In order to accomplish this five different e-learning designs dealing with the same subject were formed within the scope of expository teaching. These designs include two synchronous (Instructor-led Telementoring and E-coaching) and three asynchronous (Learner-led Facilitated Embedded) types of e-learning. The designs were carried out with 250 first-year university students attending the course Computer II (Database) distributed to five different groups. The participants were asked to compile a multiple choice achievement test with 40 items. The findings of the study showed that there were significant differences among groups in terms of student achievement. Instructor-led e-learning groups were more successful than other groups. Differences among the students' achievements were discussed based on the synchronous instructor effect.;2013;ın accordance with expository teaching the aim of the research is to determine the effects of five different e-learning types on student achievement. ın order to accomplish this five different e-learning designs dealing with the same subject were formed within the scope of expository teaching. these designs include two synchronous (ınstructor-led telementoring and e-coaching) and three asynchronous (learner-led facilitated embedded) types of e-learning. the designs were carried out with 250 first-year university students attending the course computer ıı (database) distributed to five different groups. the participants were asked to compile a multiple choice achievement test with 40 items. the findings of the study showed that there were significant differences among groups in terms of student achievement. ınstructor-led e-learning groups were more successful than other groups. differences among the students' achievements were discussed based on the synchronous instructor effect.
The purpose of this research is to determine the topics learning styles language skills learning environments materials out-of-class activities and assessment methods that are needed by learners of Turkish as a foreign language in the language learning process. The research was conducted with 305 foreign learners who were attending a language centre in Ankara to learn Turkish. The research utilised the Needs Analysis Questionnaire for Learners of Turkish as a Foreign Language that was developed by the researchers and which analysed seven dimensions of the learning process: themes learning styles language skills learning environments materials out-of-class activities and assessment. The findings obtained through the questionnaire were calculated as frequencies and percentages. The findings of the research revealed that learners of Turkish as a foreign language are most interested in topics related to the Turkish culture their own country and their work/job. It was also determined that the learners preferred audio-visual activities watching videos or small group discussions in the language learning process. From the analysis of learner needs related to learning environments it was seen that the learners preferred blended learning but were adverse to a totally e-learning-based environment. For assessment it was determined that the learners opposed self-assessment or peer assessment but rather preferred to have the teacher assess their written/spoken work.;2013;the purpose of this research is to determine the topics learning styles language skills learning environments materials out-of-class activities and assessment methods that are needed by learners of turkish as a foreign language in the language learning process. the research was conducted with 305 foreign learners who were attending a language centre in ankara to learn turkish. the research utilised the needs analysis questionnaire for learners of turkish as a foreign language that was developed by the researchers and which analysed seven dimensions of the learning process: themes learning styles language skills learning environments materials out-of-class activities and assessment. the findings obtained through the questionnaire were calculated as frequencies and percentages. the findings of the research revealed that learners of turkish as a foreign language are most interested in topics related to the turkish culture their own country and their work/job. ıt was also determined that the learners preferred audio-visual activities watching videos or small group discussions in the language learning process. from the analysis of learner needs related to learning environments it was seen that the learners preferred blended learning but were adverse to a totally e-learning-based environment. for assessment it was determined that the learners opposed self-assessment or peer assessment but rather preferred to have the teacher assess their written/spoken work.
Learning management systems (LMSs) contain hidden costs unclear user environments bulky developer and administration manuals and limitations with regard to interoperability integration localization and bandwidth requirements. Careful evaluation is required in selecting the most appropriate LMS for use and this is a general problem in web-based education. One possibility is to automate this evaluation process using computer-aided techniques. In this article the researcher has focused on the idea of automating the evaluation process and has developed a computer-aided system named Easy Way to Evaluate LMSs (EW-LMS) for the quick and efficient evaluation of LMSs especially for developing countries where the idea of using an LMS may be relatively new. The investigation described in this article was carried out with 88 voluntary higher education instructors to test the usefulness of the developed system. Two types of quantitative questionnaires were used during the study. The results obtained indicate that the instructors were highly satisfied using the developed system and the EW-LMS is technically sound and well developed. Theevaluation system can help instructors to select the best LMS appropriate to their educational needs and their type of usage in the shortest possible time with little effort without any specialized technical knowledge/training and by following simple user-friendly steps. The system is oriented to anyone interested in evaluating and using an LMS in web-based education. Those individuals who may be interested in using this software are instructors students or anyone else who may have an interest in LMSs and educational organizations such as universities schools and institutes.;2013;learning management systems (lmss) contain hidden costs unclear user environments bulky developer and administration manuals and limitations with regard to interoperability integration localization and bandwidth requirements. careful evaluation is required in selecting the most appropriate lms for use and this is a general problem in web-based education. one possibility is to automate this evaluation process using computer-aided techniques. ın this article the researcher has focused on the idea of automating the evaluation process and has developed a computer-aided system named easy way to evaluate lmss (ew-lms) for the quick and efficient evaluation of lmss especially for developing countries where the idea of using an lms may be relatively new. the investigation described in this article was carried out with 88 voluntary higher education instructors to test the usefulness of the developed system. two types of quantitative questionnaires were used during the study. the results obtained indicate that the instructors were highly satisfied using the developed system and the ew-lms is technically sound and well developed. theevaluation system can help instructors to select the best lms appropriate to their educational needs and their type of usage in the shortest possible time with little effort without any specialized technical knowledge/training and by following simple user-friendly steps. the system is oriented to anyone interested in evaluating and using an lms in web-based education. those individuals who may be interested in using this software are instructors students or anyone else who may have an interest in lmss and educational organizations such as universities schools and institutes.

The research presented in this paper proposes a new machine learning-based evaluation method for assessing the usability of eLearning systems. Three machine learning methods (support vector machines neural networks and decision trees) along with multiple linear regression are used to develop prediction models in order to discover the underlying relationship between the overall eLearning system usability and its predictor factors. A subsequent sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the rank-order importance of the predictors. Using both sensitivity values along with the usability scores a metric (called severity index) is devised. By applying a Pareto-like analysis the severity index values are ranked and the most important usability characteristics are identified. The case study results show that the proposed methodology enhances the determination of eLearning system problems by identifying the most pertinent usability factors. The proposed method could provide an invaluable guidance to the usability experts as to what measures should be improved in order to maximize the system usability for a targeted group of end-users of an eLearning system.

Numerous studies have attempted to explain the role of social networking platforms within educational environments though none of them has reported on their potential for enhancing professional development in education. The purpose of this qualitative research was to explore the reflections of prospective teachers who were assigned to design and conduct instruction on Facebook. Seven groups of prospective teachers (n=25) attending a teacher training program in Turkey participated in the study. Reflections of these prospective teachers on online teaching through Facebook were elicited by means of reflective papers. As an outstanding result of the online teaching project in the current study the prospective teachers gained positive experiences in utilising Facebook for designing and implementing online teaching activities that are in accordance with the constructivist learning paradigm. However sustaining learner involvement enhancing interaction and problems resulting from group work processes were observed as destructive issues throughout the online teaching project.;2014;numerous studies have attempted to explain the role of social networking platforms within educational environments though none of them has reported on their potential for enhancing professional development in education. the purpose of this qualitative research was to explore the reflections of prospective teachers who were assigned to design and conduct instruction on facebook. seven groups of prospective teachers (n=25) attending a teacher training program in turkey participated in the study. reflections of these prospective teachers on online teaching through facebook were elicited by means of reflective papers. as an outstanding result of the online teaching project in the current study the prospective teachers gained positive experiences in utilising facebook for designing and implementing online teaching activities that are in accordance with the constructivist learning paradigm. however sustaining learner involvement enhancing interaction and problems resulting from group work processes were observed as destructive issues throughout the online teaching project.

Proper execution of exams aimed at assessment & evaluation is of critical importance in Learning Management Systems (LMS). Problems arising from human-centered errors or technical difficulties may lead to questioning of exams and thus of reliability and efficiency of the distance education systems. Online examination system architecture proposed in this paper provides for integrated management of main functions such as question pool creation and update exam authoring execution and evaluation and management of the feedbacks from students along with ensuring use of analysis reports related to the questions and exams created by an intelligent agent in the decision-making processes. After conducting analyses on the distance education (DE) system of Sakarya University it was found that the proposed intelligent agent supported online exam system detects the problems that arise to a large extent and enables the instructors to decide more easily in a shorter time. This system which is possible to expand with its flexible structure to include additional intelligent features with the aim of resolving different problems can also be adapted to different institutions that use online examination systems.;2014;proper execution of exams aimed at assessment & evaluation is of critical importance in learning management systems (lms). problems arising from human-centered errors or technical difficulties may lead to questioning of exams and thus of reliability and efficiency of the distance education systems. online examination system architecture proposed in this paper provides for integrated management of main functions such as question pool creation and update exam authoring execution and evaluation and management of the feedbacks from students along with ensuring use of analysis reports related to the questions and exams created by an intelligent agent in the decision-making processes. after conducting analyses on the distance education (de) system of sakarya university it was found that the proposed intelligent agent supported online exam system detects the problems that arise to a large extent and enables the instructors to decide more easily in a shorter time. this system which is possible to expand with its flexible structure to include additional intelligent features with the aim of resolving different problems can also be adapted to different institutions that use online examination systems.
Background: You Tube has become a useful resource for knowledge and is widely used by medical students as an e-learning source. The purpose of this study was to assess the videos relating electrocardiogram (ECG) on You Tube. Methods: You Tube was searched on May 28 2013 for the search terms AF ecg for atrial fibrillation AVNRT for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia AVRT for atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia AV block or heart block for atrioventricular block LBBB RBBB for bundle branch block left anterior fascicular block or left posterior fascicular block for fascicular blocks VT ecg for ventricular tachycardia long QT and Brugada ecg. Non-English language unrelated and non-educational videos were excluded. Remaining videos were assessed for usefulness source and characteristics. Usefulness was assessed with using a checklist developed by the authors. Results: One hundred nineteen videos were included in the analysis. Sources of the videos were as follows: individuals n = 70 58.8% universities/hospitals n = 10 8.4% and medical organizations n = 3 2.5% health ads n = 10 8.4% health websites n = 26 21.8%. Fifty-six (47.1%) videos were classified as very useful and 16 (13.4%) videos were misleading. 90% of the videos uploaded by universities/hospitals were grouped as very useful videos the same ratio was 45% for the individual uploads. There were statistically significant differences in ECG diagnosis among the groups (for very useful useful and misleading p < 0.001 0.02 and 0.008 respectively). The ratio of the misleading information in ventricular tachycardia videos was found to be 42.9%. Conclusions: YouTube has a substantial amount of videos on ECG with a wide diversity from useful to misleading content. The lack of quality content relating to ECG on YouTube necessitates that videos should be selected with utmost care. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This study focuses on the use of wikis in collaborative writing projects in foreign language learning classrooms. A total of 34 intermediate level university students learning English as a foreign language (EFL) were asked to accomplish three different wiki-based collaborative writing tasks (argumentative informative and decision-making) working in groups of four. Student wiki pages were then analyzed to investigate the role of task type in the number of self and peer-corrections as well as form-related and meaning-related changes. In addition focus-group interviews and questionnaires were conducted to find out how students would describe their overall experience with the integration of a wiki-based collaborative writing project in their foreign language learning process. The results revealed that the argumentative task promoted more peer-corrections than the informative and decision-making tasks. In addition the informative task yielded more self-corrections than the argumentative and decision-making tasks. Furthermore the use of wiki-based collaborative writing tasks led to the accurate use of grammatical structures 94% of the time. The results of the study also suggest that students paid more attention to meaning rather than form regardless of the task type. Finally students had positive experiences using wikis in foreign language writing and they believed that their writing performance had improved.;2014;this study focuses on the use of wikis in collaborative writing projects in foreign language learning classrooms. a total of 34 intermediate level university students learning english as a foreign language (efl) were asked to accomplish three different wiki-based collaborative writing tasks (argumentative informative and decision-making) working in groups of four. student wiki pages were then analyzed to investigate the role of task type in the number of self and peer-corrections as well as form-related and meaning-related changes. ın addition focus-group interviews and questionnaires were conducted to find out how students would describe their overall experience with the integration of a wiki-based collaborative writing project in their foreign language learning process. the results revealed that the argumentative task promoted more peer-corrections than the informative and decision-making tasks. ın addition the informative task yielded more self-corrections than the argumentative and decision-making tasks. furthermore the use of wiki-based collaborative writing tasks led to the accurate use of grammatical structures 94% of the time. the results of the study also suggest that students paid more attention to meaning rather than form regardless of the task type. finally students had positive experiences using wikis in foreign language writing and they believed that their writing performance had improved.

We introduce a new algorithm for distance metric learning which uses pairwise similarity (equivalence) and dissimilarity constraints. The method is adapted to the high-dimensional feature spaces that occur in many computer vision applications. It first projects the data onto the subspace orthogonal to the linear span of the difference vectors of similar sample pairs. Similar samples thus have identical projections i.e. the distance between the two elements of each similar sample pair becomes zero in the projected space. In the projected space we find a linear embedding that maximizes the scatter of the dissimilar sample pairs. This corresponds to a pseudo-metric characterized by a positive semi-definite matrix in the original input space. We also kernelize the method and show that this allows it to handle cases with low-dimensional input spaces and large numbers of similarity constraints. Despite the method's simplicity experiments on synthetic problems and on real-world image retrieval visual object classification gender classification and image segmentation ones demonstrate its effectiveness yielding significant improvements over the existing distance metric learning methods.

A laboratory exercise is presented that demonstrates the impact of seed coverings and hormones on seed dormancy and release in seeds with endogenous physiological dormancy. The materials and methods are simple and inexpensive and can be accomplished as an on-campus laboratory or as a distance education exercise. The execution of the laboratory is rapid (approximate to 1 hour) and the results are obtained in 2 weeks. The exercise generates an opportunity for the discussion of a complex subject that involves the interaction of two tissue types within the seed (the embryo vs. the seed coverings) and nicely illustrates their role in seed dormancy maintenance.;2014;a laboratory exercise is presented that demonstrates the impact of seed coverings and hormones on seed dormancy and release in seeds with endogenous physiological dormancy. the materials and methods are simple and inexpensive and can be accomplished as an on-campus laboratory or as a distance education exercise. the execution of the laboratory is rapid (approximate to 1 hour) and the results are obtained in 2 weeks. the exercise generates an opportunity for the discussion of a complex subject that involves the interaction of two tissue types within the seed (the embryo vs. the seed coverings) and nicely illustrates their role in seed dormancy maintenance.
The concepts of sustainability and reusability have great importance in engineering education. In this context metadata provides reusability and the effective use of Learning Objects (LOs). In addition searching the huge LO Repository with metadata requires too much time. If the selection criteria do not exactly match the metadata values it is not possible to find the most appropriate LO. When this situation arises the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method can meet the requirements. In this study the SDUNESA software was developed and this software allows for the selection of a suitable LO from the repository by using an analytical hierarchy process MCDM method. This web-based SDUNESA software is also used to store share and select a suitable LO in the repository. To meet these features the SDUNESA software contains Web 2.0 technologies such as AJAX XML and SOA Web Services. The SDUNESA software was especially developed for computer engineering education. Instructors can use this software to select LOs with defined criteria. The parameters of the web-based SDUNESA learning object selection software that use the AHP method are defined under the computer education priorities. The obtained results show that the AHP method selects the most reliable learning object that meets the criteria.;2014;the concepts of sustainability and reusability have great importance in engineering education. ın this context metadata provides reusability and the effective use of learning objects (los). ın addition searching the huge lo repository with metadata requires too much time. ıf the selection criteria do not exactly match the metadata values it is not possible to find the most appropriate lo. when this situation arises the multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) method can meet the requirements. ın this study the sdunesa software was developed and this software allows for the selection of a suitable lo from the repository by using an analytical hierarchy process mcdm method. this web-based sdunesa software is also used to store share and select a suitable lo in the repository. to meet these features the sdunesa software contains web 2.0 technologies such as ajax xml and soa web services. the sdunesa software was especially developed for computer engineering education. ınstructors can use this software to select los with defined criteria. the parameters of the web-based sdunesa learning object selection software that use the ahp method are defined under the computer education priorities. the obtained results show that the ahp method selects the most reliable learning object that meets the criteria.

The aim of this study is to determine the factors affecting blue-collar workers' intention to use a web-based learning system in the preimplementation phase in the automotive industry. For that purpose an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) is proposed which included factors such as image perceived content quality and perceived system quality as additions to the basic model. Data collected from 546 blue-collar workers were used to test the proposed research model by using Linear Structural Relations software LISREL Version 8.54. The findings of the study indicate that perceived usefulness is the strongest predictor of behavioral intention to use a web-based learning system. In addition a high proportion of perceived usefulness is explained by perceived content quality and perceived ease of use is explained by perceived system quality and anxiety.

Cognitive-based individual differences among which are attention and attention design play a crucial role in designing personalized e-learning environments. In this study the effects of dynamic and static cue types presented to users in e-learning environments on implicit memory performance of individuals with different sustained attention levels are investigated. The statistical analyses suggest that the contextual cues prepared in different presentation types do not have a common significant effect on implicit memory performance of individuals with high or low sustained attention levels. Besides it is determined that the cues presented in two different forms i.e. dynamic and static has an effect on participants' implicit memory performance as long as sustained attention is ruled out. Better results obtained by static cueing compared to dynamic cueing on the other hand is important for learning environment design for individuals experiencing attention deficit.

There are many studies related to distance learning. Willingness and anxiety are important variables for distance learning. Recent research has shown that anxiety and willingness towards distance learning are moderated by personality. This study sought to investigate whether distance learning willingness and distance learning anxiety are associated with age gender occupation chronotype and personality in a Turkish vocational high school students sample. Two measures of individual differences were implemented: chronotype (morningness/eveningness preference) and BIG-5 dimensions (agreeableness conscientiousness extraversion neuroticism and openness). Seven hundred and sixty-nine vocational high school students from Turkey filled out a self-administered questionnaire. Evening types older and female students had higher distance learning willingness scores than morning types younger and male students. No significant difference was found between chronotype groups with respect to distance learning anxiety. Furthermore extraverted students reported a lower distance learning anxiety. Openness to experience was associated with high distance learning willingness. We conclude that evening types may benefit from distance learning more than other types.;2014;there are many studies related to distance learning. willingness and anxiety are important variables for distance learning. recent research has shown that anxiety and willingness towards distance learning are moderated by personality. this study sought to investigate whether distance learning willingness and distance learning anxiety are associated with age gender occupation chronotype and personality in a turkish vocational high school students sample. two measures of individual differences were implemented: chronotype (morningness/eveningness preference) and bıg-5 dimensions (agreeableness conscientiousness extraversion neuroticism and openness). seven hundred and sixty-nine vocational high school students from turkey filled out a self-administered questionnaire. evening types older and female students had higher distance learning willingness scores than morning types younger and male students. no significant difference was found between chronotype groups with respect to distance learning anxiety. furthermore extraverted students reported a lower distance learning anxiety. openness to experience was associated with high distance learning willingness. we conclude that evening types may benefit from distance learning more than other types.

This study offers a new method to measure navigation disorientation in web based systems which is powerful learning medium for distance and open education. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is used to measure disorientation in a more precise manner. The process combines theoretical and applied knowledge from two previously distinct research areas disorientation and string-matching. String-matching algorithms provide a more convenient disorientation measurement than other techniques in that they examine the similarity between an optimal path and learners' navigation paths. The algorithm particularly takes into account the contextual similarity between partly relevant web-pages in a user's navigation path and pages in an optimal path. This study focuses on the reasons and the required steps to use this algorithm for disorientation measurement. Examples of actual student activities and learning environment data are provided to illustrate the process.;2015;this study offers a new method to measure navigation disorientation in web based systems which is powerful learning medium for distance and open education. the needleman-wunsch algorithm is used to measure disorientation in a more precise manner. the process combines theoretical and applied knowledge from two previously distinct research areas disorientation and string-matching. string-matching algorithms provide a more convenient disorientation measurement than other techniques in that they examine the similarity between an optimal path and learners' navigation paths. the algorithm particularly takes into account the contextual similarity between partly relevant web-pages in a user's navigation path and pages in an optimal path. this study focuses on the reasons and the required steps to use this algorithm for disorientation measurement. examples of actual student activities and learning environment data are provided to illustrate the process.

The demand for distance education has been increasing at a rapid pace all around the world. This in turn places a special importance on the need for the development of more distance education systems. However there is an alarming rise in the number of distance education students that drop out of the system without asking for any help. The present study focuses on forming three fuzzy-based models through K-Means C-Means and subtractive clustering. The models are designed to predict students' year-end academic performance based on the 8-week data kept in the learning management system (LMS). Next the models are evaluated in terms of their accuracy in order to determine the most suitable one. Then the data was analyzed through various statistical methods and the results were compared. The model provides invaluable information regarding the students' year-end success or failure by analyzing the data on Basic Computer Skills a course included in the curriculum for sophomores at a local university. Thanks to such information those who are likely to drop out can be determined and accordingly the institution can start to take measures to encourage students not to drop out early in the semester which in turn can increase the extent to which distance education can be successful. The present study will hopefully decrease the number of students that drop out of distance education systems.;2015;the demand for distance education has been increasing at a rapid pace all around the world. this in turn places a special importance on the need for the development of more distance education systems. however there is an alarming rise in the number of distance education students that drop out of the system without asking for any help. the present study focuses on forming three fuzzy-based models through k-means c-means and subtractive clustering. the models are designed to predict students' year-end academic performance based on the 8-week data kept in the learning management system (lms). next the models are evaluated in terms of their accuracy in order to determine the most suitable one. then the data was analyzed through various statistical methods and the results were compared. the model provides invaluable information regarding the students' year-end success or failure by analyzing the data on basic computer skills a course included in the curriculum for sophomores at a local university. thanks to such information those who are likely to drop out can be determined and accordingly the institution can start to take measures to encourage students not to drop out early in the semester which in turn can increase the extent to which distance education can be successful. the present study will hopefully decrease the number of students that drop out of distance education systems.

Computer network and system management education is often structured based on theoretical information and it is not considered effective and efficient due to various reasons such as inadequacy of available materials and hardware. In addition investors are reluctant to make investments on the provision of educational materials due to relatively high cost specific to this field. However recent developments in virtualization technologies have led to the emergence of new trends in computer network and system management education. This paper provides information about the use of virtualization technology in computer network education the utilization of real network devices and defines a new generation network training platform. The aim of the study is to offer a new model using virtualization technology for network-based computer education. The topology additionally proposed here involves the use of real hardware instead of virtual ones which distinguishes it from the similar topologies. This model is expected to guide future network and system managers to develop and use a real network and system management training platform that is far more effective than simulation programs.

Objective E-learning is a candidate tool for clinical practice guidelines (CPG) implementation due to its versatility universal access and low costs. We aimed to assess the impact of a five-module e-learning course about CPG for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) on physicians' knowledge and clinical practice. Study design This work was conceived as a pre/post single-arm intervention study. Physicians from 11 European countries registered for the online course. Personal data pre- and post-course questionnaires and clinical data about 3 to 5 children with AGE managed by each physician before and after the course were collected. Primary outcome measures included the proportion of participants fully adherent to CPG and number of patients managed with full adherence. Results Among the 149 physicians who signed up for the e-learning course 59 took the course and reported on their case management of 519 children <5 years of age who were referred to their practice because of AGE (281 and 264 children seen before and after the course respectively). The course improved knowledge scores (pre-course 8.6 +/- 2.7 versus post-course 12.8 +/- 2.1 P < 0.001) average adherence (from 87.0 +/- 7.7% to 90.6 +/- 7.1% P = 0.001) and the number of patients managed in full adherence with the guidelines (from 33.6 +/- 31.7% to 43.9 +/- 36.1% P = 0.037). Conclusions E-learning is effective in increasing knowledge and improving clinical practice in paediatric AGE and is an effective tool for implementing clinical practice guidelines.;2015;objective e-learning is a candidate tool for clinical practice guidelines (cpg) implementation due to its versatility universal access and low costs. we aimed to assess the impact of a five-module e-learning course about cpg for acute gastroenteritis (age) on physicians' knowledge and clinical practice. study design this work was conceived as a pre/post single-arm intervention study. physicians from 11 european countries registered for the online course. personal data pre- and post-course questionnaires and clinical data about 3 to 5 children with age managed by each physician before and after the course were collected. primary outcome measures included the proportion of participants fully adherent to cpg and number of patients managed with full adherence. results among the 149 physicians who signed up for the e-learning course 59 took the course and reported on their case management of 519 children <5 years of age who were referred to their practice because of age (281 and 264 children seen before and after the course respectively). the course improved knowledge scores (pre-course 8.6 +/- 2.7 versus post-course 12.8 +/- 2.1 p < 0.001) average adherence (from 87.0 +/- 7.7% to 90.6 +/- 7.1% p = 0.001) and the number of patients managed in full adherence with the guidelines (from 33.6 +/- 31.7% to 43.9 +/- 36.1% p = 0.037). conclusions e-learning is effective in increasing knowledge and improving clinical practice in paediatric age and is an effective tool for implementing clinical practice guidelines.
Ontologies have often been recommended for E-learning systems but few efforts have successfully incorporated student data to represent knowledge conceptualizations. Defining key concepts and their relations between each other establishes the backbone of our E-learning system. The system guides an individual student through his/her course by evaluating their progress and suggesting instructional material to review based upon their answers. Three main tasks are performed within this framework: building ontologies for the course measuring a student's understanding level for the concepts and making personal suggestions to create an individualized learning environment. This paper presents: the integration of ontologies assisted with student data together with an intelligent Recommendation Module for the development of an E-learning system the comparison and correction adaption of ontology from students' mind maps and the assessment of students' actual weaknesses in comparison to what Recommendation Module suggests. The sample of 127 students five classrooms was conveniently selected among seventh grade students of a demographically average school in a major city in Turkey. The students' achievement was assessed and the scores for different questions were investigated for associations with concepts made in the students' minds. The results provided significant correlations among scores and a fit model for the concepts represented by questions. The student suggested model slightly differed from the ontology map from the experts. Based on the data-supported model the Recommendation Module more accurately determined the students' learning deficiencies and suggested concepts to be reviewed.;2015;ontologies have often been recommended for e-learning systems but few efforts have successfully incorporated student data to represent knowledge conceptualizations. defining key concepts and their relations between each other establishes the backbone of our e-learning system. the system guides an individual student through his/her course by evaluating their progress and suggesting instructional material to review based upon their answers. three main tasks are performed within this framework: building ontologies for the course measuring a student's understanding level for the concepts and making personal suggestions to create an individualized learning environment. this paper presents: the integration of ontologies assisted with student data together with an intelligent recommendation module for the development of an e-learning system the comparison and correction adaption of ontology from students' mind maps and the assessment of students' actual weaknesses in comparison to what recommendation module suggests. the sample of 127 students five classrooms was conveniently selected among seventh grade students of a demographically average school in a major city in turkey. the students' achievement was assessed and the scores for different questions were investigated for associations with concepts made in the students' minds. the results provided significant correlations among scores and a fit model for the concepts represented by questions. the student suggested model slightly differed from the ontology map from the experts. based on the data-supported model the recommendation module more accurately determined the students' learning deficiencies and suggested concepts to be reviewed.
Due to lack of infrastructure staff and finance rural people in developing countries generally have limited formal education and especially limited access to rural education services. However agricultural innovations are constantly changing and rural people should be informed of these developments Thus distance education can be one of the ideal solutions to reach rural areas. This paper discusses the importance and limitations of distance education through television in developing countries and presents the Turkish experience. The experiences of rural distance education projects in developing countries revealed that use of multiple agricultural extension methods together such as television programs printed materials group discussions and field demonstrations is more effective in changing rural people's attitudes towards agricultural innovations. Motivational factors such as prizes and giving certificates are also effective. After the projects further agricultural television programs and manuals can also be used to support the project.;2015;due to lack of infrastructure staff and finance rural people in developing countries generally have limited formal education and especially limited access to rural education services. however agricultural innovations are constantly changing and rural people should be informed of these developments thus distance education can be one of the ideal solutions to reach rural areas. this paper discusses the importance and limitations of distance education through television in developing countries and presents the turkish experience. the experiences of rural distance education projects in developing countries revealed that use of multiple agricultural extension methods together such as television programs printed materials group discussions and field demonstrations is more effective in changing rural people's attitudes towards agricultural innovations. motivational factors such as prizes and giving certificates are also effective. after the projects further agricultural television programs and manuals can also be used to support the project.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) came to prominence with Open Educational Resources Movement (OERM). It was based upon the idea of libre in removal of some permission barriers and gratis in removing the price barrier (Suber 2008) in learning resources. In line with the theoretical underpinnings of OERM MOOCs embody primary characteristics of connectivist pedagogy which are autonomy diversity openness and community participation. However in time moving away from its original philosophical and pedagogical values new variations of MOOCs have emerged and new MOOCs have become more market oriented and are aligned with instructivist cognitive and behaviourist pedagogy. In an attempt to empirically examine the change in underlying values of the MOOCs a survey method was employed by using a Connectivist Learning Environment Assessment Tool which was developed in the scope of this research. The tool could be useful for formulating and justifying a conceptual framework that enables us to reify the connectivist pedagogy and assess connectivist underpinnings of a learning environment including MOOCs. This research aims to contribute to MOOC studies against the background of previous knowledge from the Open Education and Connectivist fields.;2015;massive open online courses (moocs) came to prominence with open educational resources movement (oerm). ıt was based upon the idea of libre in removal of some permission barriers and gratis in removing the price barrier (suber 2008) in learning resources. ın line with the theoretical underpinnings of oerm moocs embody primary characteristics of connectivist pedagogy which are autonomy diversity openness and community participation. however in time moving away from its original philosophical and pedagogical values new variations of moocs have emerged and new moocs have become more market oriented and are aligned with instructivist cognitive and behaviourist pedagogy. ın an attempt to empirically examine the change in underlying values of the moocs a survey method was employed by using a connectivist learning environment assessment tool which was developed in the scope of this research. the tool could be useful for formulating and justifying a conceptual framework that enables us to reify the connectivist pedagogy and assess connectivist underpinnings of a learning environment including moocs. this research aims to contribute to mooc studies against the background of previous knowledge from the open education and connectivist fields.
In this study a scale-invariant representation for closed planar curves (silhouettes) is proposed. The orientations of all points within the Gaussian scale-space of the curve are extracted. This orientation scale-space is used to create the silhouette orientation image in which the positions of each pixel indicate the curve's pixel positions and scales whereas the colour represents orientation. The representation is extracted for multiple levels of the morphological scale-space of the silhouette. The proposed representation is invariant to scale and transformable under planar rotation. Using linear and non-linear distance learning methods experiments on the MPEG7 ETH80 and Kimia shape datasets were conducted with results indicating an advanced recognition capability.;2015;ın this study a scale-invariant representation for closed planar curves (silhouettes) is proposed. the orientations of all points within the gaussian scale-space of the curve are extracted. this orientation scale-space is used to create the silhouette orientation image in which the positions of each pixel indicate the curve's pixel positions and scales whereas the colour represents orientation. the representation is extracted for multiple levels of the morphological scale-space of the silhouette. the proposed representation is invariant to scale and transformable under planar rotation. using linear and non-linear distance learning methods experiments on the mpeg7 eth80 and kimia shape datasets were conducted with results indicating an advanced recognition capability.
Much of the literature and the academic discussion about institutional strategic planning of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) has been centred on the U.S. context. Literature on MOOCs in Europe is still developing and just recently some empirical studies were conducted. However these studies are not comparable and it is hard to learn about differences between regions and types of educational institutions. Given the very different institutional political and cultural contexts it is interesting to analyse how in these two different regions Higher Education institutions (HEIs) are responding to the challenges of the MOOC phenomena and are integrating it in their own strategic planning. The current research presents the first attempt to conduct a comparative study of institutional MOOC strategies in Europe and U.S. It is based on a survey launched by the EU-funded HOME project and compares results with a similar survey conducted in U.S. Results show that there are significant differences in how the U.S. and European HEIs understand the impact of massive open education and also how they perceive the efficiency of digital education and online learning.;2015;much of the literature and the academic discussion about institutional strategic planning of massive open online courses (mooc) has been centred on the u.s. context. literature on moocs in europe is still developing and just recently some empirical studies were conducted. however these studies are not comparable and it is hard to learn about differences between regions and types of educational institutions. given the very different institutional political and cultural contexts it is interesting to analyse how in these two different regions higher education institutions (heıs) are responding to the challenges of the mooc phenomena and are integrating it in their own strategic planning. the current research presents the first attempt to conduct a comparative study of institutional mooc strategies in europe and u.s. ıt is based on a survey launched by the eu-funded home project and compares results with a similar survey conducted in u.s. results show that there are significant differences in how the u.s. and european heıs understand the impact of massive open education and also how they perceive the efficiency of digital education and online learning.
Several unmet needs have been identified in allergic rhinitis: identification of the time of onset of the pollen season optimal control of rhinitis and comorbidities patient stratification multidisciplinary team for integrated care pathways innovation in clinical trials and above all patient empowerment. MASK-rhinitis (MACVIA-ARIA Sentinel NetworK for allergic rhinitis) is a simple system centred around the patient which was devised to fill many of these gaps using Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools and a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on the most widely used guideline in allergic rhinitis and its asthma comorbidity (ARIA 2015 revision). It is one of the implementation systems of Action Plan B3 of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP on AHA). Three tools are used for the electronic monitoring of allergic diseases: a cell phone-based daily visual analogue scale (VAS) assessment of disease control CARAT (Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test) and e-Allergy screening (premedical system of early diagnosis of allergy and asthma based on online tools). These tools are combined with a clinical decision support system (CDSS) and are available in many languages. An e-CRF and an e-learning tool complete MASK. MASK is flexible and other tools can be added. It appears to be an advanced global and integrated ICT answer for many unmet needs in allergic diseases which will improve policies and standards.;2015;several unmet needs have been identified in allergic rhinitis: identification of the time of onset of the pollen season optimal control of rhinitis and comorbidities patient stratification multidisciplinary team for integrated care pathways innovation in clinical trials and above all patient empowerment. mask-rhinitis (macvıa-arıa sentinel network for allergic rhinitis) is a simple system centred around the patient which was devised to fill many of these gaps using ınformation and communications technology (ıct) tools and a clinical decision support system (cdss) based on the most widely used guideline in allergic rhinitis and its asthma comorbidity (arıa 2015 revision). ıt is one of the implementation systems of action plan b3 of the european ınnovation partnership on active and healthy ageing (eıp on aha). three tools are used for the electronic monitoring of allergic diseases: a cell phone-based daily visual analogue scale (vas) assessment of disease control carat (control of allergic rhinitis and asthma test) and e-allergy screening (premedical system of early diagnosis of allergy and asthma based on online tools). these tools are combined with a clinical decision support system (cdss) and are available in many languages. an e-crf and an e-learning tool complete mask. mask is flexible and other tools can be added. ıt appears to be an advanced global and integrated ıct answer for many unmet needs in allergic diseases which will improve policies and standards.
The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) movement is the latest big thing in Open and Distance Learning (ODL). MOOCs offer both opportunities and threats that are extensively discussed in the literature including the potential of opening up education for all at a global scale. On the other hand MOOCs challenge traditional pedagogy and raise important questions about the future of campus-based education. However in discussing these opportunities and threats the majority of the literature tends to focus on the origin of the MOOC movement in the United States (US). The specific context of Europe with its diversity of languages cultural environments educational policies and regulatory frameworks differs substantially from the US context. Accordingly this article offers a European perspective on MOOCs in order to better understand major differences in threats and opportunities across countries and continents including the use and reuse of MOOCs for regional or global use via European or non-European platforms. In the context of the EU funded HOME project (Higher education Online: MOOCs the European way) a research initiative was undertaken to identify opportunities and threats of the MOOC movement for European higher education institutions. Three sources of data were gathered and analysed. Opportunities and threats were categorized into two levels. The macro level comprises issues related to the higher education system European context historical period and institutional concerns. The micro level covers aspects related to faculty teachers and courses thus to the operational level. The main opportunities discovered were: the ECTS as a robust system for formal recognition of accomplishments in MOOCs the trend for institutional collaboration stimulated by EU-funded programs and the many innovative and alternative pedagogical models used in MOOCs published in Europe. The main threats mentioned were: implementation problems of the ECTS difficulties in bridging non/informal and formal education and too much regulation hindering experimentation and innovation.;2015;the massive open online course (mooc) movement is the latest big thing in open and distance learning (odl). moocs offer both opportunities and threats that are extensively discussed in the literature including the potential of opening up education for all at a global scale. on the other hand moocs challenge traditional pedagogy and raise important questions about the future of campus-based education. however in discussing these opportunities and threats the majority of the literature tends to focus on the origin of the mooc movement in the united states (us). the specific context of europe with its diversity of languages cultural environments educational policies and regulatory frameworks differs substantially from the us context. accordingly this article offers a european perspective on moocs in order to better understand major differences in threats and opportunities across countries and continents including the use and reuse of moocs for regional or global use via european or non-european platforms. ın the context of the eu funded home project (higher education online: moocs the european way) a research initiative was undertaken to identify opportunities and threats of the mooc movement for european higher education institutions. three sources of data were gathered and analysed. opportunities and threats were categorized into two levels. the macro level comprises issues related to the higher education system european context historical period and institutional concerns. the micro level covers aspects related to faculty teachers and courses thus to the operational level. the main opportunities discovered were: the ects as a robust system for formal recognition of accomplishments in moocs the trend for institutional collaboration stimulated by eu-funded programs and the many innovative and alternative pedagogical models used in moocs published in europe. the main threats mentioned were: implementation problems of the ects difficulties in bridging non/informal and formal education and too much regulation hindering experimentation and innovation.
The trend of using e-learning systems is now rapidly expanding into all educational domains. Although they are popular research studies have been focused on the e-learners and undergraduate levels. Instructors play an important role in specifying the effectivity success or inefficacy and adoption of the e-learning systems so predicting instructors' behavioral intention to use learning management system is essential prior to its adoption. The purpose of this study is to explore instructors' behavioral intention to use Learning Management System (LMS) at a postsecondary military vocational college level. We used a conceptual framework proposed by Findik Coskuncay and Ozkan for understanding vocational college instructors' behavioral intention to use LMS. Framework includes the core constructs in technology acceptance model: namely perceived ease of use perceived usefulness behavioral intention and application self-efficacy technological complexity subjective norm. Additional external variables were also adopted namely instructors' age prior teaching experience and course relevance. Accordingly 115 instructors are asked to answer the questionnaire for investigating behavioral intention. After statistical analysis the results demonstrate that all mentioned variables either directly or indirectly affect the overall behavioral intention to use LMS. Instructors' perceived usefulness was found as the most significant factor for predicting instructors' behavioral intention to use LMS. Instructors' age did not correlate significantly with the factors in technology acceptance model and there was negative significant correlation between instructors' teaching experience and technological complexity subjective norm and behavioral intention.

This study examines the extent to which epistemological motivational decision-related and demographic variables predict college students' use of online information searching strategies (behavioural procedural and metacognitive strategies). The participants included preservice teachers (N = 538) from 13 universities in different parts of Turkey. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify the variables predicting each online information searching strategy. The results revealed that online information searching strategies were best predicted by epistemological beliefs and then decision-making styles web search experience and goal orientations. Students who had advanced epistemological beliefs in speed of learning tended to have better behavioural procedural and metacognitive strategies while students having naive epistemological beliefs in ability to learn had lower level online searching strategies. Students having more web search experience had better online searching strategies. Additionally as the level of students' mastery-approach goals increases the use of procedural and metacognitive domain strategies increase as well while the increase in the level of mastery-avoidance goals were related to the use of less behavioural domain strategies. Finally students having rational decision styles were more likely to use higher levels of online information searching strategies while students with avoidant styles tended to use less behavioural and procedural domain strategies.

This paper proposes a model for supporting electrical engineering with e-learning. The model development is based on survey data collected from representative teachers and students studying in higher education institutions in Turkey. To develop the model the study investigated the attitudes of the representative key stakeholders in the relevant higher education institutions towards e-learning by administrating questionnaires and interviews with teachers and students. The responses of the teachers and students were then compared. Based on the results a model was proposed with a multidimensional approach to e-learning. The model flips electrical engineering to make sure that the students review discuss and explore course content before and after class. The proposed model encourages students to start with e-learning to continue with the face-to-face learning setting on campus and then to come back to e-learning for evaluating their learning in the classroom. Using this model students can study at home and assess their learning before and after their attendance to campus lectures and enhance their learning with various types of learning namely self-directed learning self-assessment teacher-directed learning teacher assessment computer-directed learning and computer assessment. Similarly model evaluation was conducted at the relevant higher education institutions. To evaluate the applicability of the model a case-control study was conducted to determine whether the model had the intended effect on the participating students of the relevant institutions. As a result of the case-control study the effects of e-learning blended learning and traditional learning were verified by teaching the use of MATLAB software. The overall scores indicated that e-learning and blended learning were more effective as compared to traditional learning. The results of our study indicated that the knowledge increase in e-learners seemed to be gradual because they tended to study daily by completing each activity on time.;2016;this paper proposes a model for supporting electrical engineering with e-learning. the model development is based on survey data collected from representative teachers and students studying in higher education institutions in turkey. to develop the model the study investigated the attitudes of the representative key stakeholders in the relevant higher education institutions towards e-learning by administrating questionnaires and interviews with teachers and students. the responses of the teachers and students were then compared. based on the results a model was proposed with a multidimensional approach to e-learning. the model flips electrical engineering to make sure that the students review discuss and explore course content before and after class. the proposed model encourages students to start with e-learning to continue with the face-to-face learning setting on campus and then to come back to e-learning for evaluating their learning in the classroom. using this model students can study at home and assess their learning before and after their attendance to campus lectures and enhance their learning with various types of learning namely self-directed learning self-assessment teacher-directed learning teacher assessment computer-directed learning and computer assessment. similarly model evaluation was conducted at the relevant higher education institutions. to evaluate the applicability of the model a case-control study was conducted to determine whether the model had the intended effect on the participating students of the relevant institutions. as a result of the case-control study the effects of e-learning blended learning and traditional learning were verified by teaching the use of matlab software. the overall scores indicated that e-learning and blended learning were more effective as compared to traditional learning. the results of our study indicated that the knowledge increase in e-learners seemed to be gradual because they tended to study daily by completing each activity on time.
The objective of this study is to introduce an intelligent E-Learning software system which aims to improve students' motivations and academic achievements in computer programming courses. The system is based on an intelligent analysis approach which is formed via an Artificial Neural Network model trained by Cognitive Development Optimization Algorithm. This intelligent approach tries to provide appropriate materials to students by evaluating learning levels. At this point types of learning levels are defined by teachers and associated with specific abilities regarding to computer programming. After determining learning levels according to results of the performed activities it is then possible for software system to provide appropriate materials/applications corresponding types of low learning levels.

The information that is increasing and changing rapidly at the present day and the usage of computers in educational and instructional processes has become inevitable. With the rapid progress in technology research gives more importance to integrate intelligent issues with educational support systems such as distance learning and learning management systems. Such studies are considered as applications of the artificial intelligence on educational processes. Regarding this viewpoint some supervised learning models which is able to recognize the learning concepts from a given educational content presented to a tutoring system has been designed in this study. For this aim firstly three different corpora constructed from educational contents related to the subject titles such as calculus abstract algebra and computer science have been composed. For each candidate learning concepts the feature vectors have been generated using a relation factor in addition to tf-idf values. The relation factor is defined as the ratio of the total number of the most frequent substrings in the corpus that appear with a candidate concept in the same sentence within an educational content to most frequent substring in the corpus. The achievement of this system is measured according to the F-measure.;2016;the information that is increasing and changing rapidly at the present day and the usage of computers in educational and instructional processes has become inevitable. with the rapid progress in technology research gives more importance to integrate intelligent issues with educational support systems such as distance learning and learning management systems. such studies are considered as applications of the artificial intelligence on educational processes. regarding this viewpoint some supervised learning models which is able to recognize the learning concepts from a given educational content presented to a tutoring system has been designed in this study. for this aim firstly three different corpora constructed from educational contents related to the subject titles such as calculus abstract algebra and computer science have been composed. for each candidate learning concepts the feature vectors have been generated using a relation factor in addition to tf-idf values. the relation factor is defined as the ratio of the total number of the most frequent substrings in the corpus that appear with a candidate concept in the same sentence within an educational content to most frequent substring in the corpus. the achievement of this system is measured according to the f-measure.
The purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness of 3D multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) for freshmen orientation purposes. To do so a virtual orientation environment was developed on the Active Worlds MUVE. The study sample included 55 students who were enrolled in a university department. The study has a quasi experimental control group design. The orientation was carried out a week before the academic semester. The virtual departmental orientation was conducted with 25 participants in the 3D MUVE while the authentic departmental orientation was conducted with 30 participants who were led through the department by a guide. Both groups were administered a Conceptual Knowledge Test before and after their orientations along with a Spatial Knowledge Inventory and an Orientation Evaluation Questionnaire after the interventions. In addition the Presence Questionnaire in Virtual Environments was administered to the virtual orientation participants. While the conceptual knowledge posttest scores of experimental and control groups increased significantly there was no significant difference between them. It was found that students in the virtual orientation recalled spatial route details better than the participants in the authentic orientation while there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of spatial landmark details and overall spatial scores. When the groups were compared in terms of evaluation factors significant differences were observed in the effect on general learning and simplicity in favor of the virtual orientation while there were no significant differences in perceived usefulness and enjoyment. Participants perceived a high level of presence in the virtual orientation. There was a small positive correlation between presence and conceptual knowledge and a moderate positive correlation between presence and spatial knowledge. Decreasing distraction factors in the virtual environment had a positive influence on students' conceptual and spatial learning. In general the virtual orientation has similar or better results than authentic orientation in terms of the variables examined in this study. These findings demonstrate that 3D MUVEs can be effectively used by freshmen students for orientation purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the number of formative e-tests taken differed by gender using students' perceived self-regulation levels as a covariate. The sample was 340 teacher candidates reached through purposeful sampling. The study lasted a semester students were involved in a blended learning environment where classroom lessons supported by self-regulatory e-tests as a part of an online course management system called MOODLE. It was possible for students to take 10-item online quizzes and 20-item practice tests as many as they wanted. In the analysis a factorial ANOVA design was applied. Findings indicated a moderate correlation between the number of formative e-tests taken and the perceived self-regulation levels indicating higher perceived self-regulation levels as the number of formative e-tests increased. By using perceived self-regulation levels as a covariate the gender differences in the number of e-tests taken were also investigated. According to finding gender variable did not explain the differences in the compound variable the number of formative e-tests. However after controlling for the effect of perceived self-regulation the findings were significant. Hence we can conclude that self-regulated behavior is independent of students' gender therefore e-assessments is a self-regulated technology-based instructional aid in higher education.

We propose a two-layer decision fusion technique called Fuzzy Stacked Generalization (FSG) which establishes a hierarchical distance learning architecture. At the base-layer of an FSG fuzzy k-NN classifiers receive different feature sets each of which is extracted from the same dataset to gain multiple views of the dataset At the meta-layer first a fusion space is constructed by aggregating decision spaces of all the base-layer classifiers. Then a fuzzy k-NN classifier is trained in the fusion space by minimizing the difference between the large sample and N-sample classification error. In order to measure the degree of collaboration among the base-layer classifiers and the diversity of the feature spaces a new measure called shareability is introduced. Shearability is defined as the number of samples that are correctly classified by at least one of the base-layer classifiers in FSG. In the experiments we observe that FSG performs better than the popular distance learning and ensemble learning algorithms when the shareability measure is large enough such that most of the samples are correctly classified by at least one of the base-layer classifiers. The relationship between the proposed and state-of-the-art diversity measures is experimentally analyzed. The tests performed on a variety of artificial and real-world benchmark datasets show that the classification performance of FSG increases compared to that of state-of-the art ensemble learning and distance learning methods as the number of classes increases.

M-learning has enhanced the e-learning by making the learning process learner-centered. However enforcing exam security in open environments where each student has his/her own mobile/tablet device connected to a Wi-Fi network through which it is further connected to the Internet can be one of the most challenging tasks. In such environments students can easily exchange information over the network during exam time. This paper aims to identify various vulnerabilities that may violate exam security in m-learning environments and to design the appropriate security services and countermeasures that can be put in place to ensure exam security. It also aims to integrate the resulting secure exam system with an existing open-source and widely accepted Learning Management System (LMS) and its service extension to the m-learning environment namely the Moodbile Project.;2016;m-learning has enhanced the e-learning by making the learning process learner-centered. however enforcing exam security in open environments where each student has his/her own mobile/tablet device connected to a wi-fi network through which it is further connected to the ınternet can be one of the most challenging tasks. ın such environments students can easily exchange information over the network during exam time. this paper aims to identify various vulnerabilities that may violate exam security in m-learning environments and to design the appropriate security services and countermeasures that can be put in place to ensure exam security. ıt also aims to integrate the resulting secure exam system with an existing open-source and widely accepted learning management system (lms) and its service extension to the m-learning environment namely the moodbile project.
Background: In many countries gastric cancer is not diagnosed until an advanced stage. An Internet-based e-learning system to improve the ability of endoscopists to diagnose gastric cancer at an early stage was developed and was evaluated for its effectiveness. Methods: The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. After receiving a pre-test participants were randomly allocated to either an e-learning or non-e-learning group. Only those in the e-learning group gained access to the e-learning system. Two months after the pre-test both groups received a post-test. The primary endpoint was the difference between the two groups regarding the rate of improvement of their test results. Findings: 515 endoscopists from 35 countries were assessed for eligibility and 332 were enrolled in the study with 166 allocated to each group. Of these 151 participants in the e-learning group and 144 in the non-e-learning group were included in the analysis. The mean improvement rate (standard deviation) in the e-learning and non-e-learning groups was 1.24 (0.26) and 1.00 (0.16) respectively (P < 0.001). Interpretation: This global study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of an e-learning system to expand knowledge and provide invaluable experience regarding the endoscopic detection of early gastric cancer (R000012039).

Open student modeling (OSM) is an approach to technology -based learning which makes student models available to the learners for exploration. OSM is known for its ability to increase student engagement motivation and knowledge reflection. A recent extension of OSM known as open social student modeling (OSSM) complements cognitive aspects of OSM with social aspects by allowing students to explore models of peer students and/or an aggregated class model. In this paper we introduce an OSSM interface MasteryGrids and report the results of a large-scale classroom study which explored the impact of the social dimension of OSSM. Students in a database management course accessed nonrequired learning materials (examples and problems) via the MasteryGrids interface using either OSM or OSSM. The results revealed that OSSM-enhanced learning especially for students with lower prior knowledge compared with OSM. It also enhanced user attitude and engagement. Amount of student usage efficiency of student usage and student attitude varied depending on the combination of interface condition (OSM/OSSM) gender and student social comparison orientation.;2016;open student modeling (osm) is an approach to technology -based learning which makes student models available to the learners for exploration. osm is known for its ability to increase student engagement motivation and knowledge reflection. a recent extension of osm known as open social student modeling (ossm) complements cognitive aspects of osm with social aspects by allowing students to explore models of peer students and/or an aggregated class model. ın this paper we introduce an ossm interface masterygrids and report the results of a large-scale classroom study which explored the impact of the social dimension of ossm. students in a database management course accessed nonrequired learning materials (examples and problems) via the masterygrids interface using either osm or ossm. the results revealed that ossm-enhanced learning especially for students with lower prior knowledge compared with osm. ıt also enhanced user attitude and engagement. amount of student usage efficiency of student usage and student attitude varied depending on the combination of interface condition (osm/ossm) gender and student social comparison orientation.
Within the scope of this research efforts were exerted to increase teacher candidates' interaction ways through action research in a blended teaching profession course in higher education level. Teacher candidates participated in various blended learning activities during a semester-long course and the problems related to learners' participation in blended learning activities and their interactions during learning process were solved via action decisions. Blended learning activities were developed according to Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model and the lessons learned from previous two pilot studies. In order to conduct the activities face-to-face and synchronous virtual classroom sessions were combined with asynchronous from discussions and blog. At the beginning of the course teacher candidates chosed activity sets according to learning style model and throughout a semester-long course they participated in the activities. Throughout the action research process the ways of interactions between students students and instructor and students and the content were examined as well as the levels of learning accomplished by students during the learning process. This study has revealed indicators pointing to an increase both in students' interactions and levels of learning during the blended learning process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The situation in Ukraine poses severe problems to the higher education system and to students in Eastern Ukraine. Many students and academicians had been compelled to leave their university buildings and move westwards. Hence they are forced to substitute face-to-face teaching with distance learning often on a large scale but within a short span of time and with limited resources. While technical/technological infrastructure often exists know-how about conducting online teaching and respective faculty development is often found to be lacking. Within the framework of a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) a faculty development program developed in Turkey as an Open Educational Resource (e-Tutor) was adopted in three languages (English Ukrainian and Russian) to support qualifying university staff in teaching online. e-Tutor comprises of 14 modules each with various content covering different aspects of online teaching.

Concept map model is a method that creates domain model by identifying the relationship between concepts in course contents. This study presents an adaptive intelligent web based learning system called OPCOMITS (Object Oriented Programming Tutor using Concept Map Model). OPCOMITS has a free domain model which can be regulated by an expert for any course. It uses concept map model to regulate the topic hierarchy to measure the student's knowledge about a topic and to stimulate learning. By employing a concept map model it structures the course and provides an environment in which the lecturer can arrange the chapters topics concepts and the prerequisite relationships between the concepts. Thus it offers an adaptive and effective learning environment by measuring the level of student's knowledge about a topic offering reinforcing feedback diagnosing students' weaknesses and directing them to related chapter topic in the domain for revisions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach an experiment has been conducted on Computer Programming department in Object Oriented Programming course. From the experimental results it is found that OPCOMITS has contributed to the academic success of students using it and students have exhibited much better learning than those who have used a conventional e-learning system. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals Inc.;2016;concept map model is a method that creates domain model by identifying the relationship between concepts in course contents. this study presents an adaptive intelligent web based learning system called opcomıts (object oriented programming tutor using concept map model). opcomıts has a free domain model which can be regulated by an expert for any course. ıt uses concept map model to regulate the topic hierarchy to measure the student's knowledge about a topic and to stimulate learning. by employing a concept map model it structures the course and provides an environment in which the lecturer can arrange the chapters topics concepts and the prerequisite relationships between the concepts. thus it offers an adaptive and effective learning environment by measuring the level of student's knowledge about a topic offering reinforcing feedback diagnosing students' weaknesses and directing them to related chapter topic in the domain for revisions. to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach an experiment has been conducted on computer programming department in object oriented programming course. from the experimental results it is found that opcomıts has contributed to the academic success of students using it and students have exhibited much better learning than those who have used a conventional e-learning system.

BACKGROUND. Healthcare workers (HCWs) lack familiarity with evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). There is good evidence that effective educational interventions help to facilitate guideline implementation so we investigated whether e-learning could enhance HCW knowledge of HAI prevention guidelines. METHODS. We developed an electronic course (e-course) and tested its usability and content validity. An international sample of voluntary learners submitted to a pretest (TO) that determined their baseline knowledge of guidelines and they subsequently studied the e-course. Immediately after studying the course posttest 1 (T1) assessed the immediate learning effect. After 3 months during which participants had no access to the course a second posttest (T2) evaluated the residual learning effect. RESULTS. A total of 3587 HCWs representing 79 nationalities enrolled: 2590 HCWs (72%) completed TO 1410 HCWs (39%) completed T1 and 1011 HCWs (28%) completed T2. The median study time was 193 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 96-306 minutes). The median scores were 52% (IQR 44%-62%) for TO 80% (IQR 68%-88%) for T1 and 74% (IQR 64%-84%) for T2. The immediate learning effect (TO vs T1) was +24% (IQR 12%-34% P < .001) and a residual effect (TO vs T2) of +18% (IQR 8-28) remained (P < .001). A 200-minute study time was associated with a maximum immediate learning effect (28%). A study time >300 minutes yielded the greatest residual effect (24%). CONCLUSIONS. Moderate time invested in e-learning yielded significant immediate and residual learning effects. Decision makers could consider promoting e-learning as a supporting tool in HAI prevention.;2016;background. healthcare workers (hcws) lack familiarity with evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections (haıs). there is good evidence that effective educational interventions help to facilitate guideline implementation so we investigated whether e-learning could enhance hcw knowledge of haı prevention guidelines. methods. we developed an electronic course (e-course) and tested its usability and content validity. an international sample of voluntary learners submitted to a pretest (to) that determined their baseline knowledge of guidelines and they subsequently studied the e-course. ımmediately after studying the course posttest 1 (t1) assessed the immediate learning effect. after 3 months during which participants had no access to the course a second posttest (t2) evaluated the residual learning effect. results. a total of 3587 hcws representing 79 nationalities enrolled: 2590 hcws (72%) completed to 1410 hcws (39%) completed t1 and 1011 hcws (28%) completed t2. the median study time was 193 minutes (interquartile range [ıqr] 96-306 minutes). the median scores were 52% (ıqr 44%-62%) for to 80% (ıqr 68%-88%) for t1 and 74% (ıqr 64%-84%) for t2. the immediate learning effect (to vs t1) was +24% (ıqr 12%-34% p < .001) and a residual effect (to vs t2) of +18% (ıqr 8-28) remained (p < .001). a 200-minute study time was associated with a maximum immediate learning effect (28%). a study time >300 minutes yielded the greatest residual effect (24%). conclusıons. moderate time invested in e-learning yielded significant immediate and residual learning effects. decision makers could consider promoting e-learning as a supporting tool in haı prevention.
The purpose of this study is to determine the language equivalence and the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Web-Based Learning Platform Evaluation Scale (Web Tabanli Ogrenme Ortami Degerlendirme Olcegi [WTOODO]) used in the selection and evaluation of web-based learning environments. Within this scope the validity of the factor structure of this scale is examined on the basis of data collected from 482 students at 11 universities in Turkey. The results of the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) show that the 40-item four-factor structure of the scale parallels the original scale. To determine whether this structure agrees with the sample data first-level confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted. The findings indicate that the compliance level of the sample is good. In addition Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for the entire scale was calculated as .95 whereas McDonald's omega coefficient which is regarded more relevant for congeneric measurements was calculated as .96. These results indicate that the Turkish version of this scale with its 40-item four-factor structure is a valid and reliable instrument.;2016;the purpose of this study is to determine the language equivalence and the validity and reliability of the turkish version of the web-based learning platform evaluation scale (web tabanli ogrenme ortami degerlendirme olcegi [wtoodo]) used in the selection and evaluation of web-based learning environments. within this scope the validity of the factor structure of this scale is examined on the basis of data collected from 482 students at 11 universities in turkey. the results of the exploratory factor analysis (efa) show that the 40-item four-factor structure of the scale parallels the original scale. to determine whether this structure agrees with the sample data first-level confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) was conducted. the findings indicate that the compliance level of the sample is good. ın addition cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for the entire scale was calculated as .95 whereas mcdonald's omega coefficient which is regarded more relevant for congeneric measurements was calculated as .96. these results indicate that the turkish version of this scale with its 40-item four-factor structure is a valid and reliable instrument.
The purpose of this study was to explore the structural relationships between knowledge sharing behaviors (KSB) academic self-efficacy (ASE) and sense of community (SoC) of university students in e-learning community. The study was carried out with students who joined Facebook learning community that was created for the Computing I course which was taught with blended learning method. Data were collected from 316 university students by utilizing three self-report instruments: KSB scale ASE scale (sub-scales: 'social status' 'cognitive applications' and 'technical skills') and classroom community (CC) scale (sub-scales: 'connectedness' and 'learning'). The path analyses with structural equation modeling (SEM) further verified that students' KSB were related to their ASE and SoC in e-learning community. The results of the study revealed that the ASE and SoC of the students positively affect their KSB. And in terms of sub-scales the connectedness to the community learning perception in the community the self efficacy of the students on the cognitive applications in the courses and their social status in the community positively affect KSB. However students' self-efficacy perceptions on their technical skills affect KSB positively but its affect size was smaller compared to other sub-scales: Further research studies and implications are presented and discussed.

E-Learning has been an emerging topic for education world for two decades and due to this fact it has been analyzed with all of its dimensions and factors. However the evaluation and assessment issues of e-learning can be assumed as untouched especially in students' perspective. Evaluation and assessment concepts of students' cognitive affective and behavioral domains have a lot of variables that affect each other. In this study predictors of students' actual usage of online education systems and their relations are designed as a new theoretical framework and analyzed by applying Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis. For this analysis an online questionnaire is applied to the students who have been using a uniquely designed online evaluation and assessment system (OEAS) for five years in a governmental high school. As a result of the study self-efficacy and user interface design are found as significantly effective on perceived ease of use while self-efficacy and perceived ease of use have significant influence on perceived usefulness. In addition it is found that actual usage of online evaluation and assessment system is directly and significantly affected from perceived usefulness technical support and service quality. To sum up the conclusions of the study in students' perspective are advisable for the educational technologists.;2016;e-learning has been an emerging topic for education world for two decades and due to this fact it has been analyzed with all of its dimensions and factors. however the evaluation and assessment issues of e-learning can be assumed as untouched especially in students' perspective. evaluation and assessment concepts of students' cognitive affective and behavioral domains have a lot of variables that affect each other. ın this study predictors of students' actual usage of online education systems and their relations are designed as a new theoretical framework and analyzed by applying structural equation model (sem) analysis. for this analysis an online questionnaire is applied to the students who have been using a uniquely designed online evaluation and assessment system (oeas) for five years in a governmental high school. as a result of the study self-efficacy and user interface design are found as significantly effective on perceived ease of use while self-efficacy and perceived ease of use have significant influence on perceived usefulness. ın addition it is found that actual usage of online evaluation and assessment system is directly and significantly affected from perceived usefulness technical support and service quality. to sum up the conclusions of the study in students' perspective are advisable for the educational technologists.
This study aims to investigate how working memory (WM) performances and instructional strategy choices affect learners' complex cognitive task performance in online environments. Three different e-learning environments were designed based on Merrill's (2006a) model of instructional strategies. The lack of experimental research on his framework is the main argument of this paper. The participants' WM processes with the n-back task scores were used for defining their WM performances. This study is designed as repeated measures. Thirty-five undergraduate students completed complex cognitive tasks three times. According to their WM groups the participants were assigned to experimental conditions randomly by counterbalancing. The main results of the study indicated that although no performance differences were observed in complex cognitive tasks across instructional strategies there was a statistically significant change observed across WM groups in favour of those who had high WM performances. The interaction effect did not have an effect on participants' overall performance. These results indicate that cognitive differences lead to different outcomes when the instructional design is set to be the same for all. Therefore it is concluded that instructional design choices could take individual cognitive differences into account when developing adaptive e-learning environments.;2016;this study aims to investigate how working memory (wm) performances and instructional strategy choices affect learners' complex cognitive task performance in online environments. three different e-learning environments were designed based on merrill's (2006a) model of instructional strategies. the lack of experimental research on his framework is the main argument of this paper. the participants' wm processes with the n-back task scores were used for defining their wm performances. this study is designed as repeated measures. thirty-five undergraduate students completed complex cognitive tasks three times. according to their wm groups the participants were assigned to experimental conditions randomly by counterbalancing. the main results of the study indicated that although no performance differences were observed in complex cognitive tasks across instructional strategies there was a statistically significant change observed across wm groups in favour of those who had high wm performances. the interaction effect did not have an effect on participants' overall performance. these results indicate that cognitive differences lead to different outcomes when the instructional design is set to be the same for all. therefore it is concluded that instructional design choices could take individual cognitive differences into account when developing adaptive e-learning environments.

Lifelong learning can be defined as all of the activities which aim to develop an individual's skills knowledge and abilities socially individually and professionally. Previous research on lifelong learning has been about using computers digital competence and the correlation between demographic characteristics and intelligence. However only one scale was used in this research and in general only scores for demographic characteristics and lifelong learning were compared. In this research the correlation between distance-learning students' attitudes to technology their frequency of use of smartphones and their attitudes to lifelong learning were examined. Reliability studies were carried out prior to the study and the Turkish adaptations of the scales published in international journals were administered with permission. The study sample consisted of 881 students studying in 12 different units of Hitit University: six Vocational Schools four Faculties and two Graduate Schools. The data were analysed by creating a structural equation model on the open source R analysis program. According to the research results there was a significant correlation between the three scales and the correlation between the 'lifelong learning' scores and the 'frequency of of smartphone usage' scores was greater than the 'technology attitudes' scores.;2017;lifelong learning can be defined as all of the activities which aim to develop an individual's skills knowledge and abilities socially individually and professionally. previous research on lifelong learning has been about using computers digital competence and the correlation between demographic characteristics and intelligence. however only one scale was used in this research and in general only scores for demographic characteristics and lifelong learning were compared. ın this research the correlation between distance-learning students' attitudes to technology their frequency of use of smartphones and their attitudes to lifelong learning were examined. reliability studies were carried out prior to the study and the turkish adaptations of the scales published in international journals were administered with permission. the study sample consisted of 881 students studying in 12 different units of hitit university: six vocational schools four faculties and two graduate schools. the data were analysed by creating a structural equation model on the open source r analysis program. according to the research results there was a significant correlation between the three scales and the correlation between the 'lifelong learning' scores and the 'frequency of of smartphone usage' scores was greater than the 'technology attitudes' scores.

Teaching in the field of public health needs to employ a global perspective to account for the fact that public health problems and solutions have global determinants and implications as well. International university partnerships can promote such a perspective through the strengthening of cooperation exchange and communication between academic institutions across national boundaries. As an example for such an academic network in the field of public health we introduce the International Public Health Partnership-a collaboration between a university in Germany and universities in India Turkey and Nigeria. Formed in 2005 it facilitated the exchange of information fostered discussion about the transferability of public health concepts contributed to the structural development of the universities involved and promoted an intercultural dialog through a combination of local and distance learning activities. Although well accepted by students and staff different obstacles were encountered these included limited external funding scarce own financial time and personnel resources and diverging regulations and structures of degree programs at the partnership sites. In the present article we share several lessons that we learned during our joint collaboration and provide recommendations for other universities that are involved in partnerships with institutions of higher education or are interested to initiate such collaborations.;2017;teaching in the field of public health needs to employ a global perspective to account for the fact that public health problems and solutions have global determinants and implications as well. ınternational university partnerships can promote such a perspective through the strengthening of cooperation exchange and communication between academic institutions across national boundaries. as an example for such an academic network in the field of public health we introduce the ınternational public health partnership-a collaboration between a university in germany and universities in ındia turkey and nigeria. formed in 2005 it facilitated the exchange of information fostered discussion about the transferability of public health concepts contributed to the structural development of the universities involved and promoted an intercultural dialog through a combination of local and distance learning activities. although well accepted by students and staff different obstacles were encountered these included limited external funding scarce own financial time and personnel resources and diverging regulations and structures of degree programs at the partnership sites. ın the present article we share several lessons that we learned during our joint collaboration and provide recommendations for other universities that are involved in partnerships with institutions of higher education or are interested to initiate such collaborations.
Achievement goal theory is an important framework to understand students' achievement goals motivation and engagement in academic situations and to study teachers' instructional practices. There has been a debate about whether optimal motivation involves the pursuit of mastery goals only (i.e. mastery goal perspective) or the combined pursuit of mastery and performance-approach goals (i.e. multiple goal perspective Barron & Harackiewicz 2001 2003). In the present correlational research we tested these two goal perspectives in two Peruvian samples of high school students (Sample 1: N = 1505 Sample 2: N = 551) and further examined whether students in classes in which teachers were perceived to promote mastery goals only or performance-approach goals would display the most optimal learning pattern. After controlling for learners' performance-avoidance goal pursuit results provided only slim evidence for the additive goal perspective as the effects of students' pursuit of mastery goals were more robust and consistent across both samples and outcomes (i.e. learning strategies and math grades). Along similar lines at the class level perceived teacher-promoted mastery goals positively predicted deep-level learning strategies while class-level perceived teacher-promoted performance-avoidance goals related to lower academic achievement.

The purpose of this study is to determine use of Web 2.0 tools (frequency of using Web 2.0 tools duration of access to social networks intentions for using Web 2.0 by prospective science teachers) and to investigate the relationship between the use of these technologies and biotechnology literacy. The study was designed as a correlational research. The sample consisted of conveniently selected 101 prospective science teachers at the senior level. Data was collected by Biotechnology Literacy Test and Survey of Web 2.0 Technology Use. The data was analyzed by Pearson correlation test and calculating frequencies. Findings showed that the prospective science teachers mostly preferred to use Web 2.0 tools for fun. They also preferred to use the tools for exchange of knowledge reaching current resources and web based learning and research. Moreover they used social networks to follow daily news. Also prospective teachers use social networks mostly to follow the current events.

Aim. Psychiatric disorders are relatively frequent comorbidities in epilepsy and they have an impact on morbidity mortality and quality of life. This is a report from the Task Force on Education of the ILAE Commission on Neuropsychiatry based on a survey about educational needs of epileptologists regarding management of the psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy. Methods. The Task Force designed a quantitative questionnaire to survey the self-perceived confidence of child and adult epileptologists and psychiatrists in managing major psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy to identify: (1) critical areas of improvement from a list of skills that are usually considered necessary for effective management of these conditions and (2) the preferred educational format for improving these skills. Results. A total of 211 respondents from 35 different countries participated in the survey. Confidence and usefulness scores suggest that responders would most value education and training in the management of specific clinical scenarios. Child neurologists identified major Axis I disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders while adult neurologists identified attention deficit hyperactivity disorder intellectual disabilities and autistic spectrum disorder as key areas. Both adult and child neurologists identified screening skills as the priority. Psychiatrists mainly valued specific training in the management of psychiatric complications of epilepsy surgery or psychiatric adverse events of antiepileptic drugs. Sessions during congresses and face-to-face meetings represent the preferred educational format while e-learning modules and review papers were chosen by a minority of respondents. Conclusions. Results of this survey identify key areas for improvement in managing the psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy and suggest specific strategies to develop better training for clinicians involved in epilepsy care.;2017;aim. psychiatric disorders are relatively frequent comorbidities in epilepsy and they have an impact on morbidity mortality and quality of life. this is a report from the task force on education of the ılae commission on neuropsychiatry based on a survey about educational needs of epileptologists regarding management of the psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy. methods. the task force designed a quantitative questionnaire to survey the self-perceived confidence of child and adult epileptologists and psychiatrists in managing major psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy to identify: (1) critical areas of improvement from a list of skills that are usually considered necessary for effective management of these conditions and (2) the preferred educational format for improving these skills. results. a total of 211 respondents from 35 different countries participated in the survey. confidence and usefulness scores suggest that responders would most value education and training in the management of specific clinical scenarios. child neurologists identified major axis ı disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders while adult neurologists identified attention deficit hyperactivity disorder intellectual disabilities and autistic spectrum disorder as key areas. both adult and child neurologists identified screening skills as the priority. psychiatrists mainly valued specific training in the management of psychiatric complications of epilepsy surgery or psychiatric adverse events of antiepileptic drugs. sessions during congresses and face-to-face meetings represent the preferred educational format while e-learning modules and review papers were chosen by a minority of respondents. conclusions. results of this survey identify key areas for improvement in managing the psychiatric comorbidities of epilepsy and suggest specific strategies to develop better training for clinicians involved in epilepsy care.

As companies are driven to reshape their established practices with the impact of advancements in information and communication technologies corporate training emerges as a distinct area requiring technological transformation. This exploratory study aims to examine the attitudes of a sample of 106 of the top 500 corporations in Turkey regarding the usage of e-learning for corporate training. Findings show that most of these firms currently have a hesitant attitude toward this development. Through factor analysis the main advantages for using e-learning in corporate training have been classified as employee commitment and motivation convenience and accessibility customization and outsourcing and cost effectiveness while the disadvantages have been grouped as personal and organizational. Consequently attitudinal differences toward e-learning between companies have been explored according to two scale-related variables (employee size and company revenue) and two variables about organizational readiness (the existence of a Learning & Education Department and the current use of e-learning).

To fully understand the phenomenon of massive open online courses (MOOCs) it is important to identify and map trends and patterns in research on MOOCs. This study does so by reviewing 362 empirical articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 2008 to 2015. For the purpose of this study content analysis and discourse analysis were employed to analyze the articles. Accordingly the trend line showing the number of articles per year indicates that the extent of research on MOOCs is likely to increase in the coming years. In terms of research areas the findings reveal an imbalance and three research areas out of fifteen constitute more than half of all research on MOOCs. With regard to types of MOOCs related literature is dominated by research on xMOOCs. The discourse in MOOC articles takes a mostly neutral standpoint articles with a positive outlook outweigh those that are negative and there is an increase in a more critical discourse. Theoretical or conceptual studies are preferred by researchers although MOOC research generally does not benefit from being viewed through theoretical or conceptual lenses.;2017;to fully understand the phenomenon of massive open online courses (moocs) it is important to identify and map trends and patterns in research on moocs. this study does so by reviewing 362 empirical articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 2008 to 2015. for the purpose of this study content analysis and discourse analysis were employed to analyze the articles. accordingly the trend line showing the number of articles per year indicates that the extent of research on moocs is likely to increase in the coming years. ın terms of research areas the findings reveal an imbalance and three research areas out of fifteen constitute more than half of all research on moocs. with regard to types of moocs related literature is dominated by research on xmoocs. the discourse in mooc articles takes a mostly neutral standpoint articles with a positive outlook outweigh those that are negative and there is an increase in a more critical discourse. theoretical or conceptual studies are preferred by researchers although mooc research generally does not benefit from being viewed through theoretical or conceptual lenses.

The educational timetabling problem has been extensively investigated in timetabling literature. However the problem of assigning exams to examination buildings has not been studied intensively by researchers. We were inspired by Open and Distance Education System exams of Anadolu University. Anadolu University Open and Distance Education System which is used by approximately two millions of students and has more than two millions of graduates is a well-known institution in Turkey. In this study we propose a multi-objective mathematical model for multisession exam-building assignment problem. Objective functions of this model are to minimize the distance between consecutive session buildings for a given student to maximize the number of occupants of buildings in every session and to minimize the variety of booklets for building in every session. Mathematical model has been found inadequate because students-examination building assignment in the Anadolu University Open Education system is a large size real life problem. Starting from this point of view an order-based multi-objective heuristic algorithm is developed to solve this problem. The solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with the solution obtained by the mathematical modelling and the current state of the existing system.;2017;the educational timetabling problem has been extensively investigated in timetabling literature. however the problem of assigning exams to examination buildings has not been studied intensively by researchers. we were inspired by open and distance education system exams of anadolu university. anadolu university open and distance education system which is used by approximately two millions of students and has more than two millions of graduates is a well-known institution in turkey. ın this study we propose a multi-objective mathematical model for multisession exam-building assignment problem. objective functions of this model are to minimize the distance between consecutive session buildings for a given student to maximize the number of occupants of buildings in every session and to minimize the variety of booklets for building in every session. mathematical model has been found inadequate because students-examination building assignment in the anadolu university open education system is a large size real life problem. starting from this point of view an order-based multi-objective heuristic algorithm is developed to solve this problem. the solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with the solution obtained by the mathematical modelling and the current state of the existing system.
Provinces that vary by socioeconomic levels in Turkey are among the main starting points of planned development. Meanwhile one of the most important indicators considered in determining differences in development is education. Anadolu University clearly has a very important place in Turkey's higher education system with its Open and Distance Education System. Therefore we aim in our study to investigate how socioeconomic development affects provincial demand for an open education system. First we perform analyses over 81 provinces. However we thought the demand in Istanbul Ankara and Izmir to have a special place and excluded them to perform analyses over the remaining 78 provinces using the developmental index of 2012. We evaluated 48 different regression models statistically and using four different regression techniques created these models by dividing them into four classes: linear nonparametric generalized linear and generalized nonparametric. The relations in the models between education and development are examined not only as a parametric and linear relationship but also as a nonparametric and nonlinear relationship. We found a positive nonparametric and nonlinear relationship for the demand for the Open and Distance Education System with the provincial socioeconomic developmental levels.;2017;provinces that vary by socioeconomic levels in turkey are among the main starting points of planned development. meanwhile one of the most important indicators considered in determining differences in development is education. anadolu university clearly has a very important place in turkey's higher education system with its open and distance education system. therefore we aim in our study to investigate how socioeconomic development affects provincial demand for an open education system. first we perform analyses over 81 provinces. however we thought the demand in ıstanbul ankara and ızmir to have a special place and excluded them to perform analyses over the remaining 78 provinces using the developmental index of 2012. we evaluated 48 different regression models statistically and using four different regression techniques created these models by dividing them into four classes: linear nonparametric generalized linear and generalized nonparametric. the relations in the models between education and development are examined not only as a parametric and linear relationship but also as a nonparametric and nonlinear relationship. we found a positive nonparametric and nonlinear relationship for the demand for the open and distance education system with the provincial socioeconomic developmental levels.
The aim of this study was to study the effect of web-based teaching video packages on medical students' satisfaction during gross anatomy education. The objective was to test the hypothesis that individual preference which can be related to learning style influences individual utilization of the video packages developed specifically for the undergraduate medical curriculum. Web-based teaching video packages consisting of Closed Circuit Audiovisual System and Distance Education of Anatomy were prepared. 54 informative application videos each lasting an average 12 min competent with learning objectives have been prepared. 300 young adults of the medical school on applied anatomy education were evaluated in terms of their course content exam performance and perceptions.

This paper presents a review of peer-reviewed publications (2007-2017) on digital open educational practices (OEPs). It explores trends and patterns in this emerging area of study by examining paper abstracts and bibliographic data indexed in the Scopus database using a combination of descriptive statistics text mining social network analysis and content analysis. Findings demonstrated two major strands of OEP research: those who discuss OEP in the context of open educational resources mostly in terms of open educational resource creation adoption and use and those who discuss OEP in relation to other areas including open scholarship open learning open teaching or pedagogy open systems and architectures and open source software. Based on the findings of this study and in the light of the broader literature on OEPs we echo the calls for a need to conceptualize OEPs as a multidimensional and unifying construct.;2018;this paper presents a review of peer-reviewed publications (2007-2017) on digital open educational practices (oeps). ıt explores trends and patterns in this emerging area of study by examining paper abstracts and bibliographic data indexed in the scopus database using a combination of descriptive statistics text mining social network analysis and content analysis. findings demonstrated two major strands of oep research: those who discuss oep in the context of open educational resources mostly in terms of open educational resource creation adoption and use and those who discuss oep in relation to other areas including open scholarship open learning open teaching or pedagogy open systems and architectures and open source software. based on the findings of this study and in the light of the broader literature on oeps we echo the calls for a need to conceptualize oeps as a multidimensional and unifying construct.
The purpose of this study is to uncover factors that affect participation in online classes from the student's perspective. Interest in the online environment has been increasing and renders the opinions of students participating in online courses more important since the opinions of students in this environment are closely related to interaction. It has been seen that lack of interaction creates a sense of loneliness which causes students to drop their classes. For this reason a qualitative study has been conducted about student experiences on the use of methods that increase interaction in an online environment and participation. Participants were given tasks based on collaboration special attention was paid to make sure that the setting in which the participants found themselves was in accordance with the principles of the community of inquiry computerized equipment was used to facilitate online interactions. 15 students worked based on collaboration and 15 students worked individually. Data was collected with interviews and reflection reports. Open axial and selective coding was made by using the theorizing method. At the end of the study it was determined that participation in online environment was affected in both groups by factors such as personal approaches changing variables mediated attributes.;2018;the purpose of this study is to uncover factors that affect participation in online classes from the student's perspective. ınterest in the online environment has been increasing and renders the opinions of students participating in online courses more important since the opinions of students in this environment are closely related to interaction. ıt has been seen that lack of interaction creates a sense of loneliness which causes students to drop their classes. for this reason a qualitative study has been conducted about student experiences on the use of methods that increase interaction in an online environment and participation. participants were given tasks based on collaboration special attention was paid to make sure that the setting in which the participants found themselves was in accordance with the principles of the community of inquiry computerized equipment was used to facilitate online interactions. 15 students worked based on collaboration and 15 students worked individually. data was collected with interviews and reflection reports. open axial and selective coding was made by using the theorizing method. at the end of the study it was determined that participation in online environment was affected in both groups by factors such as personal approaches changing variables mediated attributes.

The importance of distance education has increased due to its many advantages. At the same time apart from university education distance education also allows oneself to develop in different subjects. This work examines a distance education study conducted at a university in Turkey. The Department of Industrial Engineering was selected for this study. E-learning applications for industrial engineering education are seen to be extremely efficient especially since they do not require laboratory applications. The Faculty of Engineering which aims to obtain a higher quality education of students who receive industrial engineering training through e-learning has evaluated related software companies in this regard. The infrastructure of the program has been determined as online and recorded broadcasting. Web-based training has been carried out by creating wide communication networks. This study explores in detail the necessary requirements for the successful execution of distance education in industrial engineering. In addition it has benefited from the work undertaken in the past in order to determine the assessment factors. These assessment factors consist of five main factors and twenty-four sub-factors. These assessment factors have been established in line with the opinions of the people who constitute the infrastructure of this study. These past evaluations were usually made subjectively. Subjective evaluations often cause misinterpretation of results. This study applies both analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) methods both of which are multiple criteria decision-making methods. Consistency ratios are calculated to determine whether comparisons are consistent for the AHP method. In addition the AHP method is discussed together with fuzzy logic to make the study more realistic. Due to the ease of application and common use triangular fuzzy numbers are preferred as a fuzzy method. The results are validated by the SWARA method which is used to weight the criteria. The purpose of this study is to weight the assessment factors affecting e-learning technology by using fuzzy AHP and SWARA methods. Thus the study illustrates that multi-criteria decision-making methods can be used in e-learning applications to evaluate many factors.;2018;the importance of distance education has increased due to its many advantages. at the same time apart from university education distance education also allows oneself to develop in different subjects. this work examines a distance education study conducted at a university in turkey. the department of ındustrial engineering was selected for this study. e-learning applications for industrial engineering education are seen to be extremely efficient especially since they do not require laboratory applications. the faculty of engineering which aims to obtain a higher quality education of students who receive industrial engineering training through e-learning has evaluated related software companies in this regard. the infrastructure of the program has been determined as online and recorded broadcasting. web-based training has been carried out by creating wide communication networks. this study explores in detail the necessary requirements for the successful execution of distance education in industrial engineering. ın addition it has benefited from the work undertaken in the past in order to determine the assessment factors. these assessment factors consist of five main factors and twenty-four sub-factors. these assessment factors have been established in line with the opinions of the people who constitute the infrastructure of this study. these past evaluations were usually made subjectively. subjective evaluations often cause misinterpretation of results. this study applies both analytic hierarchy process (ahp) and step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (swara) methods both of which are multiple criteria decision-making methods. consistency ratios are calculated to determine whether comparisons are consistent for the ahp method. ın addition the ahp method is discussed together with fuzzy logic to make the study more realistic. due to the ease of application and common use triangular fuzzy numbers are preferred as a fuzzy method. the results are validated by the swara method which is used to weight the criteria. the purpose of this study is to weight the assessment factors affecting e-learning technology by using fuzzy ahp and swara methods. thus the study illustrates that multi-criteria decision-making methods can be used in e-learning applications to evaluate many factors.
From the beginning of the e-learning technology era many concerns arose regarding the use of e-learning in everyday academic processes. Thus in recent years a number of studies were conducted on e-learning acceptance mostly with the use of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) Model. Current study investigates the determinants of acceptance of academic e-learning technologies with the use of proposed modified UTAUT model. The basic UTAUT model was supplemented by the examined new determinants: system interactivity and the area of scientific expertise. Therefore the paper contributes to UTAUT theory applied in e-learning by utilising empirical research with a modified UTAUT model including these two new variables. This study confirmed the hypotheses related to the effects of performance expectancy effort expectancy and system interactivity on behavioural intention to use e-learning technologies and also stated that the area of scientific expertise does not have a direct impact on the intention to use e-learning technologies. The research model has been tested in an academic environment in Turkey.;2018;from the beginning of the e-learning technology era many concerns arose regarding the use of e-learning in everyday academic processes. thus in recent years a number of studies were conducted on e-learning acceptance mostly with the use of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) model. current study investigates the determinants of acceptance of academic e-learning technologies with the use of proposed modified utaut model. the basic utaut model was supplemented by the examined new determinants: system interactivity and the area of scientific expertise. therefore the paper contributes to utaut theory applied in e-learning by utilising empirical research with a modified utaut model including these two new variables. this study confirmed the hypotheses related to the effects of performance expectancy effort expectancy and system interactivity on behavioural intention to use e-learning technologies and also stated that the area of scientific expertise does not have a direct impact on the intention to use e-learning technologies. the research model has been tested in an academic environment in turkey.
Professional development (PD) is critical for instructors who are adopting new roles and competencies in online teaching environments. This mixed-method study examines an online faculty development programme in Turkey reflecting upon participants' expectations readiness and satisfaction. The findings indicate a significant relationship between individual readiness and satisfaction and reveal that readiness positively predicts satisfaction. Participants' reflections demonstrate that to enhance their traditional roles they need competencies for online learning environments and active practice in real-life applications. PD is important for introducing the new pedagogies required and for integration of technology while the adoption of new roles is key to developing competent online instructors who have a positive attitude to online learning.;2018;professional development (pd) is critical for instructors who are adopting new roles and competencies in online teaching environments. this mixed-method study examines an online faculty development programme in turkey reflecting upon participants' expectations readiness and satisfaction. the findings indicate a significant relationship between individual readiness and satisfaction and reveal that readiness positively predicts satisfaction. participants' reflections demonstrate that to enhance their traditional roles they need competencies for online learning environments and active practice in real-life applications. pd is important for introducing the new pedagogies required and for integration of technology while the adoption of new roles is key to developing competent online instructors who have a positive attitude to online learning.

Previous studies have described many scales for measuring self-regulation however no scale has been developed specifically for self-paced open and distance learning environments. Therefore the aim of this study is to develop a scale for determining the self-regulated learning skills of distance learners in self-paced open and distance learning courses. Participants of this study were 1279 distance learners who were part of self-paced distance learning courses in a public open and distance teaching university in Turkey. The items of the scale were prepared based on the literature review expert opinions and learner questionnaires. The items of the scale were reduced from 62 to 30 after expert opinions and validity and reliability analyses. For the validity of the scale the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. The total variance was found to be 58.204%. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient calculated for the reliability of the scale was found to be.937. Five factors composed of goal setting help seeking self-study strategies managing physical environment and effort regulation emerged in the 30-item scale. Thus it was concluded that the scale has a high validity and reliability. This scale is intended to help teachers and instructional designers in developing strategies that will enable learners to either enhance their existing self-regulated learning skills or help them to acquire new skills in self-paced open and distance learning environments.;2018;previous studies have described many scales for measuring self-regulation however no scale has been developed specifically for self-paced open and distance learning environments. therefore the aim of this study is to develop a scale for determining the self-regulated learning skills of distance learners in self-paced open and distance learning courses. participants of this study were 1279 distance learners who were part of self-paced distance learning courses in a public open and distance teaching university in turkey. the items of the scale were prepared based on the literature review expert opinions and learner questionnaires. the items of the scale were reduced from 62 to 30 after expert opinions and validity and reliability analyses. for the validity of the scale the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. the total variance was found to be 58.204%. the cronbach's alpha coefficient calculated for the reliability of the scale was found to be.937. five factors composed of goal setting help seeking self-study strategies managing physical environment and effort regulation emerged in the 30-item scale. thus it was concluded that the scale has a high validity and reliability. this scale is intended to help teachers and instructional designers in developing strategies that will enable learners to either enhance their existing self-regulated learning skills or help them to acquire new skills in self-paced open and distance learning environments.
Although the number of online academic degree programs offered by universities in Turkey has become increasingly significant in recent years the current lack of understanding of administrators' motives that contribute to initiating these programs suggests there is much to be learned in this field. This study aimed to investigate administrators' perceptions of motives for offering online academic degree programs in universities in Turkey in terms of online associate degree programs online master's degree programs online bachelor's degree completion programs and online bachelor's degree programs. A qualitative research method was employed for this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 administrators from different universities' distance education centers in Turkey and thematic analysis was applied to the data. The research found that administrators' motives for offering online academic degree programs mainly involve in answering to the high demand of prospective students. Six major themes were identified with regard to influencing factors for administrators' motives: demands for programs mission to support education readiness of infrastructure teaching staff as well as applicability of content overcoming the shortage of classroom space and teachers obtaining revenue and gaining prestige.;2018;although the number of online academic degree programs offered by universities in turkey has become increasingly significant in recent years the current lack of understanding of administrators' motives that contribute to initiating these programs suggests there is much to be learned in this field. this study aimed to investigate administrators' perceptions of motives for offering online academic degree programs in universities in turkey in terms of online associate degree programs online master's degree programs online bachelor's degree completion programs and online bachelor's degree programs. a qualitative research method was employed for this study. semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 administrators from different universities' distance education centers in turkey and thematic analysis was applied to the data. the research found that administrators' motives for offering online academic degree programs mainly involve in answering to the high demand of prospective students. six major themes were identified with regard to influencing factors for administrators' motives: demands for programs mission to support education readiness of infrastructure teaching staff as well as applicability of content overcoming the shortage of classroom space and teachers obtaining revenue and gaining prestige.

Participation in online communities is an increasing need for future language teachers and their professional development. Through such participation they can experience and develop an awareness of the behaviors required to facilitate their future learners' participation in online learning. This article investigates participation interaction patterns and social presence (SP) levels of pre-service English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in online communication within a longitudinal blended learning setting. A secondary aim of this article is to explore social network analysis (SNA) as an alternative method to measure SP. Data analysis included calculation of number of forum entries and words qualitative analysis of interaction patterns content analysis and SNA. The results indicated that an online course on tutoring skills and SP improved pre-service EFL teachers' online participation skills. Increased interaction and a more cohesive network were observed as the course progressed. The findings are significant in that they suggest a relationship between content analysis for SP (especially the interactive dimension) and SNA measures (centrality influence and prestige) implicating SNA as an emerging research method for the investigation of SP. This article concludes with future research perspectives and suggestions for EFL teacher training.;2018;participation in online communities is an increasing need for future language teachers and their professional development. through such participation they can experience and develop an awareness of the behaviors required to facilitate their future learners' participation in online learning. this article investigates participation interaction patterns and social presence (sp) levels of pre-service english as a foreign language (efl) teachers in online communication within a longitudinal blended learning setting. a secondary aim of this article is to explore social network analysis (sna) as an alternative method to measure sp. data analysis included calculation of number of forum entries and words qualitative analysis of interaction patterns content analysis and sna. the results indicated that an online course on tutoring skills and sp improved pre-service efl teachers' online participation skills. ıncreased interaction and a more cohesive network were observed as the course progressed. the findings are significant in that they suggest a relationship between content analysis for sp (especially the interactive dimension) and sna measures (centrality influence and prestige) implicating sna as an emerging research method for the investigation of sp. this article concludes with future research perspectives and suggestions for efl teacher training.
According to researches motivation that initiates and sustains behaviour is one of the most significant components of learning in any environment. Accordingly level of intrinsic motivation triggers and sustains the interest of the open and distance education students when it comes to learning on their own in e-learning environments. Despite a comprehensive literature regarding the motivation of those learning in traditional learning environments the number of studies addressing the motivation of open and distance education students in e-learning environments is not sufficient. In this context this study aims at determining the level of intrinsic motivation of open and distance education students. Thus data were collected from 1639 distance education students in 22 programmes through Intrinsic Motivation in e-Learning Questionnaire developed and validated to that end. Analyses carried out indicate that the level of intrinsic motivation of open and distance education students is high in e-learning environments but there is not a statistically significant difference by gender programme structure (graduate/undergraduate) instruction type (distance-blended) and academic disciplines.;2018;according to researches motivation that initiates and sustains behaviour is one of the most significant components of learning in any environment. accordingly level of intrinsic motivation triggers and sustains the interest of the open and distance education students when it comes to learning on their own in e-learning environments. despite a comprehensive literature regarding the motivation of those learning in traditional learning environments the number of studies addressing the motivation of open and distance education students in e-learning environments is not sufficient. ın this context this study aims at determining the level of intrinsic motivation of open and distance education students. thus data were collected from 1639 distance education students in 22 programmes through ıntrinsic motivation in e-learning questionnaire developed and validated to that end. analyses carried out indicate that the level of intrinsic motivation of open and distance education students is high in e-learning environments but there is not a statistically significant difference by gender programme structure (graduate/undergraduate) instruction type (distance-blended) and academic disciplines.

In the relevant literature it is often debated whether learning programming requires high-level thinking skills the lack of which consequently results in the failure of students in programming. The complex nature of programming and individual differences including study approaches thinking styles and the focus of supervision all have an effect on students' achievement in programming. How students learn programming and the relationships between their study approaches and their achievement in programming have not yet been adequately illuminated. In this regard the present study aims to investigate the effect of the study approach used on students' attitudes toward programming and on their academic achievement within an online problem-based learning environment. In this study a single-factor pretest posttest single group and semiempirical method was utilized. The study was conducted on 41 students from a public university in Turkey. To implement problem-based learning activities a teaching environment was created with the Moodle platform allowing for group work and discussions. Seven status of the problems were prepared exclusively for the 12-week application period so that students could make suggestions about how to solve them. In the data collection phase the Study Approach Scale the Attitude Towards Programming Scale and the Academic Achievement Test were employed. T-test and covariance analyses were carried out in the statistical analysis phase. According to the findings of the present study students adopting the deep study approach were more successful than the students adopting a superficial approach. Moreover it was determined that the problem-based learning application had a positive effect on students' attitudes toward programming and that the study approach did not significantly affect the students' attitude toward programming.;2018;ın the relevant literature it is often debated whether learning programming requires high-level thinking skills the lack of which consequently results in the failure of students in programming. the complex nature of programming and individual differences including study approaches thinking styles and the focus of supervision all have an effect on students' achievement in programming. how students learn programming and the relationships between their study approaches and their achievement in programming have not yet been adequately illuminated. ın this regard the present study aims to investigate the effect of the study approach used on students' attitudes toward programming and on their academic achievement within an online problem-based learning environment. ın this study a single-factor pretest posttest single group and semiempirical method was utilized. the study was conducted on 41 students from a public university in turkey. to implement problem-based learning activities a teaching environment was created with the moodle platform allowing for group work and discussions. seven status of the problems were prepared exclusively for the 12-week application period so that students could make suggestions about how to solve them. ın the data collection phase the study approach scale the attitude towards programming scale and the academic achievement test were employed. t-test and covariance analyses were carried out in the statistical analysis phase. according to the findings of the present study students adopting the deep study approach were more successful than the students adopting a superficial approach. moreover it was determined that the problem-based learning application had a positive effect on students' attitudes toward programming and that the study approach did not significantly affect the students' attitude toward programming.
OBJECTIVES: As the adoption of robotic procedures becomes more widespread additional risk related to the learning curve can be expected. This article reports the results of a Delphi process to define procedures to optimize robotic training of thoracic surgeons and to promote safe performance of established robotic interventions as for example lung cancer and thymoma surgery. METHODS: In June 2016 a working panel was spontaneously created by members of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) and European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) with a specialist interest in robotic thoracic surgery and/or surgical training. An e-consensus-finding exercise using the Delphi methodology was applied requiring 80% agreement to reach consensus on each question. Repeated iterations of anonymous voting continued over 3 rounds. RESULTS: Agreement was reached on many points: a standardized robotic training curriculum for robotic thoracic surgery should be divided into clearly defined sections as a staged learning pathway the basic robotic curriculum should include a baseline evaluation an e-learning module a simulation-based training (including virtual reality simulation Dry lab and Wet lab) and a robotic theatre (bedside) observation. Advanced robotic training should include e-learning on index procedures (right upper lobe) with video demonstration access to video library of robotic procedures simulation training modular console training to index procedure transition to full-procedure training with a proctor and final evaluation of the submitted video to certified independent examiners. CONCLUSIONS: Agreement was reached on a large number of questions to optimize and standardize training and education of thoracic surgeons in robotic activity. The production of the content of the learning material is ongoing.;2018;objectıves: as the adoption of robotic procedures becomes more widespread additional risk related to the learning curve can be expected. this article reports the results of a delphi process to define procedures to optimize robotic training of thoracic surgeons and to promote safe performance of established robotic interventions as for example lung cancer and thymoma surgery. methods: ın june 2016 a working panel was spontaneously created by members of the european society of thoracic surgeons (ests) and european association for cardio-thoracic surgery (eacts) with a specialist interest in robotic thoracic surgery and/or surgical training. an e-consensus-finding exercise using the delphi methodology was applied requiring 80% agreement to reach consensus on each question. repeated iterations of anonymous voting continued over 3 rounds. results: agreement was reached on many points: a standardized robotic training curriculum for robotic thoracic surgery should be divided into clearly defined sections as a staged learning pathway the basic robotic curriculum should include a baseline evaluation an e-learning module a simulation-based training (including virtual reality simulation dry lab and wet lab) and a robotic theatre (bedside) observation. advanced robotic training should include e-learning on index procedures (right upper lobe) with video demonstration access to video library of robotic procedures simulation training modular console training to index procedure transition to full-procedure training with a proctor and final evaluation of the submitted video to certified independent examiners. conclusıons: agreement was reached on a large number of questions to optimize and standardize training and education of thoracic surgeons in robotic activity. the production of the content of the learning material is ongoing.
The purpose of the present study was to provide a comprehensive and descriptive review of the earlier research done on the refinement of the Community of Inquiry framework (Garrison Anderson & Archer 2000 2001 2010) that has greatly influenced both research and practice in online education so far. To this end the current review included peer-reviewed journal articles only by handling them both individually and determining their common theoretical and methodological aspects. The results revealed that previous research produced very significant insights into the revision of the framework by producing four new presence types and seven presence dimensions. However there were some theoretical methodological and empirical gaps that need to be addressed in the future. Specifically speaking these gaps ranged from addressing certain educational contexts to focusing on statistical significance only in some of earlier research. Accordingly all the findings led to the conclusion that addressing the existing gaps in further research would enrich our understanding of the Community of Inquiry framework thereby adding to the contributions of previous revision studies done on it and positively impacting online learning research and practice.;2018;the purpose of the present study was to provide a comprehensive and descriptive review of the earlier research done on the refinement of the community of ınquiry framework (garrison anderson & archer 2000 2001 2010) that has greatly influenced both research and practice in online education so far. to this end the current review included peer-reviewed journal articles only by handling them both individually and determining their common theoretical and methodological aspects. the results revealed that previous research produced very significant insights into the revision of the framework by producing four new presence types and seven presence dimensions. however there were some theoretical methodological and empirical gaps that need to be addressed in the future. specifically speaking these gaps ranged from addressing certain educational contexts to focusing on statistical significance only in some of earlier research. accordingly all the findings led to the conclusion that addressing the existing gaps in further research would enrich our understanding of the community of ınquiry framework thereby adding to the contributions of previous revision studies done on it and positively impacting online learning research and practice.
Background: Recommending effective minor ailment treatments and using non-prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medicines is a pharmacist's duty. Although common in most European countries self-medication counseling practices may differ from country to country. Objectives: This study explored Turkish community pharmacists' attitudes concerning the present self-medication market professional responsibilities toward patients' self-care and the usefulness of e-learning for patients' counseling education. Methods: The study was comprised of three phases: initially a document content analysis searched for relevant OTC regulatory and/or practice frameworks secondly qualitative individual interviews on self-medication with purposively selected Turkish community pharmacists were performed finally a focus group with practitioners and continuing education experts was conducted to deepen previous results. A thematic data analysis based on the attitudinal theory was conducted supported by MAXQDA v12 software. Results: Sixteen documental sources allowed the extraction of three initial main themes: self-medication classification of medicines and pharmacists' role. Individual interviews outlined four themes that informed the focus group discussion which produced four new themes. Themes and their codes reflected dissimilar practitioners' cognitions towards OTCs OTC usage and self-medication particularly if compared to other European conceptualizations. Contradictory feelings towards the value of OTCs for professional development e.g. patient counseling influenced by profit-based expectations were identified. Conclusion: Turkish community pharmacists and their minor ailments treatment competences have yet to thrive as a relevant professional intervention. There are risks of missing the best pharmacy practice standards thus losing their contribution to rational self-care. Besides weakening the societal recognition of the profession to help individuals' everyday health decisions and well-being there might be a reduced active role in public health.;2018;background: recommending effective minor ailment treatments and using non-prescription or over-the-counter (otc) medicines is a pharmacist's duty. although common in most european countries self-medication counseling practices may differ from country to country. objectives: this study explored turkish community pharmacists' attitudes concerning the present self-medication market professional responsibilities toward patients' self-care and the usefulness of e-learning for patients' counseling education. methods: the study was comprised of three phases: initially a document content analysis searched for relevant otc regulatory and/or practice frameworks secondly qualitative individual interviews on self-medication with purposively selected turkish community pharmacists were performed finally a focus group with practitioners and continuing education experts was conducted to deepen previous results. a thematic data analysis based on the attitudinal theory was conducted supported by maxqda v12 software. results: sixteen documental sources allowed the extraction of three initial main themes: self-medication classification of medicines and pharmacists' role. ındividual interviews outlined four themes that informed the focus group discussion which produced four new themes. themes and their codes reflected dissimilar practitioners' cognitions towards otcs otc usage and self-medication particularly if compared to other european conceptualizations. contradictory feelings towards the value of otcs for professional development e.g. patient counseling influenced by profit-based expectations were identified. conclusion: turkish community pharmacists and their minor ailments treatment competences have yet to thrive as a relevant professional intervention. there are risks of missing the best pharmacy practice standards thus losing their contribution to rational self-care. besides weakening the societal recognition of the profession to help individuals' everyday health decisions and well-being there might be a reduced active role in public health.
The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers' argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches which included concept mapping collaborative game playing and group lesson planning. The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop. To begin and end the teacher workshop teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. Researchers audio-recorded individual teachers' argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers' argumentation. Toulmin's argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants' argumentative statements. While the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly the quality of participants' argumentation did increase significantly. As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers' argumentation. Additionally these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants' knowledge facilitate the presentation of argumentation and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers' argumentation skills.;2018;the purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers' argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches which included concept mapping collaborative game playing and group lesson planning. the participants were ten high school science teachers from us high schools who elected to attend the workshop. to begin and end the teacher workshop teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. researchers audio-recorded individual teachers' argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers' argumentation. toulmin's argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants' argumentative statements. while the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly the quality of participants' argumentation did increase significantly. as these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers' argumentation. additionally these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants' knowledge facilitate the presentation of argumentation and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers' argumentation skills.

Technology diverts engineering education into learning management system for distance education activities. Learning management system facilitates the management of education and training process including instructor-student student-student and student-content communication. Nevertheless distance education has some disadvantages of not being able to establish active communication with students as in traditional education. This research offers a system which merges student emotion recognition with learning management system. This study aims to investigate the effects of merging student emotion recognition with learning management systems on learners' motivation and academic achievements. In this research the quasi-experimental design adopted 103 engineering students who were divided into three groups: the control group (participates in face-to-face education) the experimental group I (uses a system that merges emotion recognition with learning management system) and the experimental group II (uses learning management system). As a result of the research it was found that the academic achievement and motivation of the experimental group I was significantly better than performance of the experimental II and the control group.;2018;technology diverts engineering education into learning management system for distance education activities. learning management system facilitates the management of education and training process including instructor-student student-student and student-content communication. nevertheless distance education has some disadvantages of not being able to establish active communication with students as in traditional education. this research offers a system which merges student emotion recognition with learning management system. this study aims to investigate the effects of merging student emotion recognition with learning management systems on learners' motivation and academic achievements. ın this research the quasi-experimental design adopted 103 engineering students who were divided into three groups: the control group (participates in face-to-face education) the experimental group ı (uses a system that merges emotion recognition with learning management system) and the experimental group ıı (uses learning management system). as a result of the research it was found that the academic achievement and motivation of the experimental group ı was significantly better than performance of the experimental ıı and the control group.
Human-robot interaction HRI is one of the most important research areas in robotics. A novel approach for HRI on a robotic arm is proposed by using online teaching to eliminate the effect of tool inertia. The position error is reduced in repeated motion. A multi-axis F/T sensor is attached to Denso robotic arm to measure six components of force and torque. A new controller structure is introduced by modifying the virtual spring control with tool inertia effect compensation. The human hand force and torque are transformed to the desired position/orientation (P/O) through the instantaneous matching between the direct human guidance and the robot response. The motions according to the experimental results have been compared with different teaching control variables. The results are shown significant improvement in teaching performance. The repeated motion errors are obviously reduced.;2018;human-robot interaction hrı is one of the most important research areas in robotics. a novel approach for hrı on a robotic arm is proposed by using online teaching to eliminate the effect of tool inertia. the position error is reduced in repeated motion. a multi-axis f/t sensor is attached to denso robotic arm to measure six components of force and torque. a new controller structure is introduced by modifying the virtual spring control with tool inertia effect compensation. the human hand force and torque are transformed to the desired position/orientation (p/o) through the instantaneous matching between the direct human guidance and the robot response. the motions according to the experimental results have been compared with different teaching control variables. the results are shown significant improvement in teaching performance. the repeated motion errors are obviously reduced.
In this brief we investigate online training of long short term memory (LSTM) architectures in a distributed network of nodes where each node employs an LSTM-based structure for online regression. In particular each node sequentially receives a variable length data sequence with its label and can only exchange information with its neighbors to train the LSTM architecture. We first provide a generic LSTM-based regression structure for each node. In order to train this structure we put the LSTM equations in a nonlinear state-space form for each node and then introduce a highly effective and efficient distributed particle filtering (DPF)-based training algorithm. We also introduce a distributed extended Kalman filtering-based training algorithm for comparison. Here our DPF-based training algorithm guarantees convergence to the performance of the optimal LSTM coefficients in the mean square error sense under certain conditions. We achieve this performance with communication and computational complexity in the order of the first-order gradient-based methods. Through both simulated and reallife examples we illustrate significant performance improvements with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.;2018;ın this brief we investigate online training of long short term memory (lstm) architectures in a distributed network of nodes where each node employs an lstm-based structure for online regression. ın particular each node sequentially receives a variable length data sequence with its label and can only exchange information with its neighbors to train the lstm architecture. we first provide a generic lstm-based regression structure for each node. ın order to train this structure we put the lstm equations in a nonlinear state-space form for each node and then introduce a highly effective and efficient distributed particle filtering (dpf)-based training algorithm. we also introduce a distributed extended kalman filtering-based training algorithm for comparison. here our dpf-based training algorithm guarantees convergence to the performance of the optimal lstm coefficients in the mean square error sense under certain conditions. we achieve this performance with communication and computational complexity in the order of the first-order gradient-based methods. through both simulated and reallife examples we illustrate significant performance improvements with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.

Following theoretical frameworks including social-cognitive theory constructivism and creating collaborative learning community this correlational study elucidates the community of inquiry framework in regard to self-regulation metacognition and motivation in an online learning setting. Data were collected from 1535 students enrolled to an online Information and Communication Technology-I course offered by the Department of Informatics at a well-known public university. The data were collected online through Survey Monkey and then analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics using multiple linear regression analysis through SPSS version 23 statistical software. The findings notably revealed that self-regulation metacognition and motivation significantly contributed to the prediction of community of inquiry and its three presence types. The findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation for overall community of inquiry and its three presence types due to its significantly valuable contribution. This study resulted in a new tentative model adding a new construct of regulatory presence addressing learners' self-regulation. Further research could concentrate on this new tentative model in addition to the new construct.;2018;following theoretical frameworks including social-cognitive theory constructivism and creating collaborative learning community this correlational study elucidates the community of inquiry framework in regard to self-regulation metacognition and motivation in an online learning setting. data were collected from 1535 students enrolled to an online ınformation and communication technology-ı course offered by the department of ınformatics at a well-known public university. the data were collected online through survey monkey and then analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics using multiple linear regression analysis through spss version 23 statistical software. the findings notably revealed that self-regulation metacognition and motivation significantly contributed to the prediction of community of inquiry and its three presence types. the findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation for overall community of inquiry and its three presence types due to its significantly valuable contribution. this study resulted in a new tentative model adding a new construct of regulatory presence addressing learners' self-regulation. further research could concentrate on this new tentative model in addition to the new construct.
The Student Information System (SIS) has increasingly gained popularity among universities for various reasons. However evaluating student's trust and satisfaction of the system are not fully investigated. In this research a sample of 634 students participated in the study from Cyprus International University Cyprus. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique was employed with AMOS 23 software to identify the trust and satisfaction of students' SIS usage. The study model which include subjective norm image output quality result demonstrability perceived usefulness perceived ease of use trust and satisfaction was developed based on extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM II). Results obtained from the analysis indicated that image output quality result demonstrability and perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. Trust was found to be significantly correlated with satisfaction however subjective norm Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use did not have a significant influence on satisfaction. Furthermore the finding confirmed that several constructs in the TAM II that were important in previous studies were not significant in the SIS. The students' behavior aspects are essential for the effective use of the system. It provides valuable information for university management in understanding the challenges of student's trust and satisfaction about SIS usage.;2019;the student ınformation system (sıs) has increasingly gained popularity among universities for various reasons. however evaluating student's trust and satisfaction of the system are not fully investigated. ın this research a sample of 634 students participated in the study from cyprus ınternational university cyprus. the structural equation modelling (sem) technique was employed with amos 23 software to identify the trust and satisfaction of students' sıs usage. the study model which include subjective norm image output quality result demonstrability perceived usefulness perceived ease of use trust and satisfaction was developed based on extended technology acceptance model (tam ıı). results obtained from the analysis indicated that image output quality result demonstrability and perceived ease of use had a significant impact on perceived usefulness. trust was found to be significantly correlated with satisfaction however subjective norm perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use did not have a significant influence on satisfaction. furthermore the finding confirmed that several constructs in the tam ıı that were important in previous studies were not significant in the sıs. the students' behavior aspects are essential for the effective use of the system. ıt provides valuable information for university management in understanding the challenges of student's trust and satisfaction about sıs usage.
Openness in education is an evolving concept which is shaped by the changing needs of societies cultures geographies and economies thus it does not have a precise definition. By focusing on four sets of generic keywords - open education open learning open educational resources (OERs) and open educational practices (OEPs) - this paper examines research in openness in education through a systematic review of peer reviewed literature. In doing so the researchers sought to draw attention to existing trends and patterns and possible future trajectories of openness in education. Content analysis social network analysis and text-mining are the methods used for data collection and analysis. Findings show that there has been growing interest on openness in education particularly on OERs across different fields. Findings also point to OEPs as an emerging area of study which offers a fertile ground for future research. However on closer inspection a divide can be observed between the global north and global south in terms of research output.;2019;openness in education is an evolving concept which is shaped by the changing needs of societies cultures geographies and economies thus it does not have a precise definition. by focusing on four sets of generic keywords - open education open learning open educational resources (oers) and open educational practices (oeps) - this paper examines research in openness in education through a systematic review of peer reviewed literature. ın doing so the researchers sought to draw attention to existing trends and patterns and possible future trajectories of openness in education. content analysis social network analysis and text-mining are the methods used for data collection and analysis. findings show that there has been growing interest on openness in education particularly on oers across different fields. findings also point to oeps as an emerging area of study which offers a fertile ground for future research. however on closer inspection a divide can be observed between the global north and global south in terms of research output.
A wide variety of demand in e-learning and web-based learning caused a new approach in e-content presentation. In order to accomplish these demands learning object repositories (LORs) were developed. LORs have many learning objects (LOs) that are used to produce different types of e-content. When there are many LOs in LORs the evaluation and selection of them become a subjective and time-consuming process. Thus selecting the most suitable and best qualified LO is considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. In this study a hybrid analytic hierarchy process genetic algorithm (AHP-GA) method was developed for the evaluation of LOs from web-based Intelligent Learning Object Framework (Zonesa) LOR. This proposed hybrid system was used in a real case study and the results demonstrated that the proposed system can be used effectively by both users and machines to produce content by the help of LO metadata.;2019;a wide variety of demand in e-learning and web-based learning caused a new approach in e-content presentation. ın order to accomplish these demands learning object repositories (lors) were developed. lors have many learning objects (los) that are used to produce different types of e-content. when there are many los in lors the evaluation and selection of them become a subjective and time-consuming process. thus selecting the most suitable and best qualified lo is considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) problem. ın this study a hybrid analytic hierarchy process genetic algorithm (ahp-ga) method was developed for the evaluation of los from web-based ıntelligent learning object framework (zonesa) lor. this proposed hybrid system was used in a real case study and the results demonstrated that the proposed system can be used effectively by both users and machines to produce content by the help of lo metadata.
Background: This paper examines one EC-funded multinational project (RESCAP-MED) with a focus on research capacity building (RCB) concerning non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the Mediterranean Middle East and North Africa. By the project's end (2015) the entire region was engulfed in crisis. Objective: Designed before this crisis developed in 2011 the primary purpose of RESCAP-MED was to foster methodological skills needed to conduct multi-disciplinary research on NCDs and their social determinants. RESCAP-MED also sought to consolidate regional networks for future collaboration and to boost existing regional policy engagement in the region on the NCD challenge. This analysis examines the scope and sustainability of RCB conducted in a context of intensifying political turmoil. Methods: RESCAP-MED linked two sets of activities. The first was a framework for training early- and mid-career researchers through discipline-based and writing workshops plus short fellowships for sustained mentoring. The second integrated public-facing activities designed to raise the profile of the NCD burden in the region and its implications for policymakers at national level. Key to this were two conferences to showcase regional research on NCDs and the development of an e-learning resource (NETPH). Results: Seven discipline-based workshops (with 113 participants) and 6 workshops to develop writing skills (84 participants) were held with 18 fellowship visits. The 2 symposia in Istanbul and Beirut attracted 280 participants. Yet the developing political crisis tagged each activity with a series of logistical challenges none of which was initially envisaged. The immediacy of the crisis inevitably deflected from policy attention to the challenges of NCDs. Conclusions: This programme to strengthen research capacity for one priority area of global public health took place as a narrow window of political opportunity was closing. The key lessons concern issues of sustainability and the paramount importance of responsively shaping a context-driven RCB.;2019;background: this paper examines one ec-funded multinational project (rescap-med) with a focus on research capacity building (rcb) concerning non-communicable diseases (ncds) in the mediterranean middle east and north africa. by the project's end (2015) the entire region was engulfed in crisis. objective: designed before this crisis developed in 2011 the primary purpose of rescap-med was to foster methodological skills needed to conduct multi-disciplinary research on ncds and their social determinants. rescap-med also sought to consolidate regional networks for future collaboration and to boost existing regional policy engagement in the region on the ncd challenge. this analysis examines the scope and sustainability of rcb conducted in a context of intensifying political turmoil. methods: rescap-med linked two sets of activities. the first was a framework for training early- and mid-career researchers through discipline-based and writing workshops plus short fellowships for sustained mentoring. the second integrated public-facing activities designed to raise the profile of the ncd burden in the region and its implications for policymakers at national level. key to this were two conferences to showcase regional research on ncds and the development of an e-learning resource (netph). results: seven discipline-based workshops (with 113 participants) and 6 workshops to develop writing skills (84 participants) were held with 18 fellowship visits. the 2 symposia in ıstanbul and beirut attracted 280 participants. yet the developing political crisis tagged each activity with a series of logistical challenges none of which was initially envisaged. the immediacy of the crisis inevitably deflected from policy attention to the challenges of ncds. conclusions: this programme to strengthen research capacity for one priority area of global public health took place as a narrow window of political opportunity was closing. the key lessons concern issues of sustainability and the paramount importance of responsively shaping a context-driven rcb.
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines was developed by World Wide Web Consortium with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals organizations and governments. Given that there is a large percentage of very small entities that develop software who also utilize the ISO/IEC software process standard the purpose of this study is the development of software design patterns for users with visual disabilities. As a result four accessibility design patterns are defined: Authentication adapter Blindness adapter Dichromatic color vision adapter and Blurry vision adapter. These patterns will help to improve the design of the web applications built using them while being compliant with the ISO/IEC 29110 standard. The use of design patterns also enables the transfer of design experience to programming practices and improves the software documentation. To validate the set of patterns an online course for Spanish speakers was developed and the evaluation was carried out using simulators automated tools experts and users. Simulators and automated tools showed no accessibility errors and experts evaluated 10 heuristics principles and did not identify any severity issues. Taken together our results provide positive evidence that users with visual disabilities could benefit from the proposed features.;2019;the web content accessibility guidelines was developed by world wide web consortium with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals organizations and governments. given that there is a large percentage of very small entities that develop software who also utilize the ıso/ıec software process standard the purpose of this study is the development of software design patterns for users with visual disabilities. as a result four accessibility design patterns are defined: authentication adapter blindness adapter dichromatic color vision adapter and blurry vision adapter. these patterns will help to improve the design of the web applications built using them while being compliant with the ıso/ıec 29110 standard. the use of design patterns also enables the transfer of design experience to programming practices and improves the software documentation. to validate the set of patterns an online course for spanish speakers was developed and the evaluation was carried out using simulators automated tools experts and users. simulators and automated tools showed no accessibility errors and experts evaluated 10 heuristics principles and did not identify any severity issues. taken together our results provide positive evidence that users with visual disabilities could benefit from the proposed features.
ObjectiveUsage of YouTube as an educational tool is gaining attention in academic research. To date there has been no study on the content and quality of eye surgery videos on YouTube. The aim of this study was to analyze YouTube videos on phacoemulsification in eyes with small pupil.MethodsWe searched for the phrases small pupil cataract surgery small pupil phacoemulsification small pupil cataract surgery complications and small pupil phacoemulsification complications in January 2015. Each resulting video was evaluated by all authors and Krippendorff's alpha was calculated to measure agreement. Videos were classified according to pupil size (small/very small) in the beginning of the surgery and whether pupillary diameter was large enough to continue surgery safely after pupillary dilation by the surgeon in the video (safe/not safe). Methods of dilatation were also analyzed. Any stated ocular comorbidity or surgical complications were noted.ResultsA total of 96 videos were reviewed. No mechanical intervention for pupillary dilatation was performed in 46 videos. Fifty-eight operated eyes had no stated ocular comorbidity. Ninety-five operations ended successfully without major complication. There was fair agreement between the evaluators regarding pupil sizes (K=0.670) but poor agreement regarding safety (K=0.337).ConclusionsYouTube videos on small pupil phacoemulsification have low complication rates when compared to the literature although no reliable mechanical dilatation methods are used in almost half of these videos.

Women's representation in education-especially in higher education- is an important part of broader gender equity discussions. The gender imbalance in education is not a new issue and Turkey is no exception. In fact this has been the subject of an ongoing debate for years throughout the world. Governments from all around the world try to enhance gender equity in education along with other facets of the issue such as economical social work etc. Since its inception Turkey's largest distance education provider Anadolu University even though it is not an intended institutional policy contribute to enhance the equal representation of both men and women in higher education. The study specifically aimed at to assess how gender ratio has evolved over 32years whether spatial clustering exists within the gender data around the country and to what extent women were represented in higher education programs. To answer these queries gender ratio datasets were examined using visual (mapping) and spatial cluster analyses. Findings support that distant programs of the university have helped more women participate in higher education programs across the country over the years leading to relatively more normalized distribution of gender in education across the geographical regions. Findings are encouraging for the University administration towards tailoring programs to attract more women and the disadvantaged groups into the academic programs. Also fee and payment structures of the courses can be re-aligned to better serve disadvantaged regions of the country. In addition institutions all around the world providing mass distance education can review Anadolu University's cost and program structure to create their own structures to enhance their gender equality issues in education.;2019;women's representation in education-especially in higher education- is an important part of broader gender equity discussions. the gender imbalance in education is not a new issue and turkey is no exception. ın fact this has been the subject of an ongoing debate for years throughout the world. governments from all around the world try to enhance gender equity in education along with other facets of the issue such as economical social work etc. since its inception turkey's largest distance education provider anadolu university even though it is not an intended institutional policy contribute to enhance the equal representation of both men and women in higher education. the study specifically aimed at to assess how gender ratio has evolved over 32years whether spatial clustering exists within the gender data around the country and to what extent women were represented in higher education programs. to answer these queries gender ratio datasets were examined using visual (mapping) and spatial cluster analyses. findings support that distant programs of the university have helped more women participate in higher education programs across the country over the years leading to relatively more normalized distribution of gender in education across the geographical regions. findings are encouraging for the university administration towards tailoring programs to attract more women and the disadvantaged groups into the academic programs. also fee and payment structures of the courses can be re-aligned to better serve disadvantaged regions of the country. ın addition institutions all around the world providing mass distance education can review anadolu university's cost and program structure to create their own structures to enhance their gender equality issues in education.

Introduction: The immense progress in science and technology has changed our daily lives. This change has also had its impact on our educational system. In this regard numerous studies have been found in the literature investigating the integration of new technologies in the learning-teaching process and as such these studies led to the use of web-based educational tools as an alternative or an adjunct to the traditional learning methods. Method: Our quasi-experimental study focused on two separate teaching methods web-based and traditional. The effectiveness of web-based learning was investigated based on an objective structured clinical examination of 177 vocational health students enrolled to Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University's 2017-spring term. The study compared the objective structured clinical examination grades of these two methods. Two groups had been formed and the students were randomly allocated either into a study or a control group. The study group watched an online video clip whereas the control group received a traditional lecture. Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine whether students' successful attempts statistically differ according to the educational methodology also effective size and single factor variance analysis (ANOVA) was performed. Results: Based on the objective structured clinical examination the study group performed better in pediatric basic life support as opposed to the control group. Conclusion: This study suggests that the use of web-based video clips enhances the learning process and in certain subjects yields better performance results when compared to the traditional learning method. Our findings are in-line with the reported studies in the literature and provide additional insight for developing countries where simulation based education is limited.;2019;ıntroduction: the immense progress in science and technology has changed our daily lives. this change has also had its impact on our educational system. ın this regard numerous studies have been found in the literature investigating the integration of new technologies in the learning-teaching process and as such these studies led to the use of web-based educational tools as an alternative or an adjunct to the traditional learning methods. method: our quasi-experimental study focused on two separate teaching methods web-based and traditional. the effectiveness of web-based learning was investigated based on an objective structured clinical examination of 177 vocational health students enrolled to acibadem mehmet ali aydinlar university's 2017-spring term. the study compared the objective structured clinical examination grades of these two methods. two groups had been formed and the students were randomly allocated either into a study or a control group. the study group watched an online video clip whereas the control group received a traditional lecture. mann-whitney u test was used to determine whether students' successful attempts statistically differ according to the educational methodology also effective size and single factor variance analysis (anova) was performed. results: based on the objective structured clinical examination the study group performed better in pediatric basic life support as opposed to the control group. conclusion: this study suggests that the use of web-based video clips enhances the learning process and in certain subjects yields better performance results when compared to the traditional learning method. our findings are in-line with the reported studies in the literature and provide additional insight for developing countries where simulation based education is limited.

Institutions and universities have started using e-learning systems to reach the potential students from all over the world by decreasing costs of investments. The speed of technological developments increases the importance of e-learning systems and their technology-based components. E-learning systems also decrease the costs of both institutions and students with effective learning way. But the main problem of e-learning systems is that investment to the right and demanded components is important to actualize cost benefits. The main aim of this study is to analyze the relations of the components of e-learning systems and prioritize them in detail for stakeholders. To solve this problem in this study causal relations among the components are analyzed by using fuzzy DEMATEL. After determining the causal relations importance and priorities of the components are calculated according to these relations with the help of fuzzy analytic network process. The application includes 19 components of e-learning systems under three main cluster as e-learning education and technology. The results of this study supports that the most important components of e-learning systems are technology-based components and these are also the most affected and affecting components of the e-learning systems.;;ınstitutions and universities have started using e-learning systems to reach the potential students from all over the world by decreasing costs of investments. the speed of technological developments increases the importance of e-learning systems and their technology-based components. e-learning systems also decrease the costs of both institutions and students with effective learning way. but the main problem of e-learning systems is that investment to the right and demanded components is important to actualize cost benefits. the main aim of this study is to analyze the relations of the components of e-learning systems and prioritize them in detail for stakeholders. to solve this problem in this study causal relations among the components are analyzed by using fuzzy dematel. after determining the causal relations importance and priorities of the components are calculated according to these relations with the help of fuzzy analytic network process. the application includes 19 components of e-learning systems under three main cluster as e-learning education and technology. the results of this study supports that the most important components of e-learning systems are technology-based components and these are also the most affected and affecting components of the e-learning systems.
The aim of this study is to examine students' acceptance of and intention to use Learning Management Systems (LMSs) for university education in Turkey using extended Technology Acceptance Model (e-TAM). TAM has been widely used in various fields of technology acceptance in the last years and is found to be highly useful for the determination of the factors influencing the intention to use and adopt e-learning platforms at universities. However studies in this field have not converged around a uniform version of TAM. Almost all studies used different factors samples or technologies to study behavioral intention. In this study the most commonly used factors are compiled in one model. Results show that intention to use a LMS is affected from perceived usefulness perceived ease of use and social norm. At the same time perceived usefulness is affected from perceived ease of use social norm and user interface design and perceived ease of use is affected from user interface design and computer self-efficacy. Practitioners Notes What is already known about this topic E-TAM is successfully applied to various e-learning platforms (such as Moodle Blackboard IWiLL web-based learning system gadgets and etc.) to examine students' acceptance and intention to use. According to the literature the external variables are various and social norm user interface design and computer self-efficacy are most commonly used or suggested factors. What this paper adds In this study most common factors which were not used altogether in one framework in other studies are used to discover the behavioral intention to use a learning management System (LMS). The model is applied to two different sample groups by taking into consideration adoption issues. The proposed model of this study is analyzed by SEM technique to confirm the path and to find the best model fitting values. Implications for practice and/or policy Using this model the learning environment will improve and it will attract students more that will increase their intention to use LMS. This study would help universities to increase LMS usage by considering social norms user interface design and computer self-efficacy.;2019;the aim of this study is to examine students' acceptance of and intention to use learning management systems (lmss) for university education in turkey using extended technology acceptance model (e-tam). tam has been widely used in various fields of technology acceptance in the last years and is found to be highly useful for the determination of the factors influencing the intention to use and adopt e-learning platforms at universities. however studies in this field have not converged around a uniform version of tam. almost all studies used different factors samples or technologies to study behavioral intention. ın this study the most commonly used factors are compiled in one model. results show that intention to use a lms is affected from perceived usefulness perceived ease of use and social norm. at the same time perceived usefulness is affected from perceived ease of use social norm and user interface design and perceived ease of use is affected from user interface design and computer self-efficacy. practitioners notes what is already known about this topic e-tam is successfully applied to various e-learning platforms (such as moodle blackboard ıwill web-based learning system gadgets and etc.) to examine students' acceptance and intention to use. according to the literature the external variables are various and social norm user interface design and computer self-efficacy are most commonly used or suggested factors. what this paper adds ın this study most common factors which were not used altogether in one framework in other studies are used to discover the behavioral intention to use a learning management system (lms). the model is applied to two different sample groups by taking into consideration adoption issues. the proposed model of this study is analyzed by sem technique to confirm the path and to find the best model fitting values. ımplications for practice and/or policy using this model the learning environment will improve and it will attract students more that will increase their intention to use lms. this study would help universities to increase lms usage by considering social norms user interface design and computer self-efficacy.
This descriptive study which adopts a mixed-methods approach investigates whether the language learning component of the distance education program at a vocational school of higher education contributes to the students' lifelong learning propensities 21st-century skills and sustainability of their language education. A questionnaire eliciting answers from four standpoints were administered to students receiving English language instruction in the program. As for the qualitative side of the study group interviews were held with volunteers. The quantitative data were analyzed by a statistical program while the interview data were subjected to content analysis. The findings reveal that although the students have a positive attitude toward language learning in a distance education program they frequently refer to the need for the presence of a teacher for a variety of reasons. On the other hand it appears that the requirements of the language component of the program contributed to the students' plans for sustainability of their education after graduation. The results further indicate a need for more interaction and collaboration to be incorporated in the activities and that the philosophy underpinning the program curriculum and materials need to be reconsidered to equip the students to compete with the dynamics of the educational world.;2019;this descriptive study which adopts a mixed-methods approach investigates whether the language learning component of the distance education program at a vocational school of higher education contributes to the students' lifelong learning propensities 21st-century skills and sustainability of their language education. a questionnaire eliciting answers from four standpoints were administered to students receiving english language instruction in the program. as for the qualitative side of the study group interviews were held with volunteers. the quantitative data were analyzed by a statistical program while the interview data were subjected to content analysis. the findings reveal that although the students have a positive attitude toward language learning in a distance education program they frequently refer to the need for the presence of a teacher for a variety of reasons. on the other hand it appears that the requirements of the language component of the program contributed to the students' plans for sustainability of their education after graduation. the results further indicate a need for more interaction and collaboration to be incorporated in the activities and that the philosophy underpinning the program curriculum and materials need to be reconsidered to equip the students to compete with the dynamics of the educational world.
Open and Distance Learning (ODL) has a long history one marked by the emergence of open universities which was a critical development in the ecology of openness. Open universities have taken on significant local and global roles within the framework of meeting the needs of their respective regions of influence and as such their roles have evolved over time. Against this background the purpose of this research is to explore the open university phenomenon by examining the case of Anadolu University in Turkey a mega university that has transformed into what is now a giga university. More specifically the research first looks at openness in education and how the concept itself has led to the emergence of open universities before turning attention to Anadolu University which is a dual-mode state university with around 3 million enrolled students. Other issues that are addressed as part of this research include the rise of ODL and how it positioned itself within Turkish higher education the historical development of Anadolu University and its massiveness in terms of student numbers and services provided local and global ODL practices learner profiles learning materials and spaces exams and assessment and evaluation processes learner support services and Anadolu University's contribution as an open university to the field of ODL. The research shows that as an open university Anadolu University has narrowed the information gap and digital divide has enhanced equality of opportunity in education and has provided lifelong learning opportunities. More importantly as an institution that has gone beyond the conventional understanding of an open university Anadolu University serves as a catalyst of change and innovation in its emergence as a role model for other higher education institutions. The following recommendations were able to be developed from the examinations of this study: (1) develop a definition of openness based on the changing paradigms of the 21st century and online learning (2) enter into national and international collaborations between open universities (3) adopt culturally relevant open pedagogies (4) develop and design heutagogy-based curricula and (5) unbundle ODL services in mega and giga universities.;2019;open and distance learning (odl) has a long history one marked by the emergence of open universities which was a critical development in the ecology of openness. open universities have taken on significant local and global roles within the framework of meeting the needs of their respective regions of influence and as such their roles have evolved over time. against this background the purpose of this research is to explore the open university phenomenon by examining the case of anadolu university in turkey a mega university that has transformed into what is now a giga university. more specifically the research first looks at openness in education and how the concept itself has led to the emergence of open universities before turning attention to anadolu university which is a dual-mode state university with around 3 million enrolled students. other issues that are addressed as part of this research include the rise of odl and how it positioned itself within turkish higher education the historical development of anadolu university and its massiveness in terms of student numbers and services provided local and global odl practices learner profiles learning materials and spaces exams and assessment and evaluation processes learner support services and anadolu university's contribution as an open university to the field of odl. the research shows that as an open university anadolu university has narrowed the information gap and digital divide has enhanced equality of opportunity in education and has provided lifelong learning opportunities. more importantly as an institution that has gone beyond the conventional understanding of an open university anadolu university serves as a catalyst of change and innovation in its emergence as a role model for other higher education institutions. the following recommendations were able to be developed from the examinations of this study: (1) develop a definition of openness based on the changing paradigms of the 21st century and online learning (2) enter into national and international collaborations between open universities (3) adopt culturally relevant open pedagogies (4) develop and design heutagogy-based curricula and (5) unbundle odl services in mega and giga universities.
This study aims to investigate learners' interaction with the learning dashboards as a predictor outcome of an online learning experience and to what extent this interaction data could be used to predict and/or provide guidance through their academic performance. For this purpose a prescriptive learning dashboard integrated into an e-learning environment was developed as a learning analytics tool. The participants consisted of 126 higher education students enrolled in the 12-week Computer Networks and Communication course. Data gathered through logs and academic performances of learners were analysed with data mining techniques. The result of cluster analysis based on interaction with the prescriptive learning dashboard showed that learners were separated into four groups according to their behavioural patterns. A similar pattern appears when the related clusters are profiled based on the academic performances. At predictive analysis the study indicates that the interaction with prescriptive learning dashboard had certain effects on academic performance of learners significantly and artificial neural networks algorithm yielded the best performance for predicting academic performance. The results support that the usage prescriptive learning dashboards can be applied in online courses as an instructional aid to improve performance of learners and learning design in e-learning environments.;2021;this study aims to investigate learners' interaction with the learning dashboards as a predictor outcome of an online learning experience and to what extent this interaction data could be used to predict and/or provide guidance through their academic performance. for this purpose a prescriptive learning dashboard integrated into an e-learning environment was developed as a learning analytics tool. the participants consisted of 126 higher education students enrolled in the 12-week computer networks and communication course. data gathered through logs and academic performances of learners were analysed with data mining techniques. the result of cluster analysis based on interaction with the prescriptive learning dashboard showed that learners were separated into four groups according to their behavioural patterns. a similar pattern appears when the related clusters are profiled based on the academic performances. at predictive analysis the study indicates that the interaction with prescriptive learning dashboard had certain effects on academic performance of learners significantly and artificial neural networks algorithm yielded the best performance for predicting academic performance. the results support that the usage prescriptive learning dashboards can be applied in online courses as an instructional aid to improve performance of learners and learning design in e-learning environments.
Distance education (DE) is a constantly evolving and advancing field and as such its intellectual network and dynamics need to be investigated and explored. In this regard this study reviewed a total of 1685 articles and 51940 references through social network analysis for a bibliometric examination of the DE field. The findings indicate that DE is an interdisciplinary field and part of mainstream education. The progressive knowledge domain analysis revealed that the intellectual roots of DE stem from generic social learning theories after which DE-related theories began to emerge following the foundation of open universities. The research concludes that there was a paradigm shift that resulted from developments in online networked technologies in the 2000s at which time DE started to gradually evolve into sixth generation ubiquitous DE.;2019;distance education (de) is a constantly evolving and advancing field and as such its intellectual network and dynamics need to be investigated and explored. ın this regard this study reviewed a total of 1685 articles and 51940 references through social network analysis for a bibliometric examination of the de field. the findings indicate that de is an interdisciplinary field and part of mainstream education. the progressive knowledge domain analysis revealed that the intellectual roots of de stem from generic social learning theories after which de-related theories began to emerge following the foundation of open universities. the research concludes that there was a paradigm shift that resulted from developments in online networked technologies in the 2000s at which time de started to gradually evolve into sixth generation ubiquitous de.
Prediction of student performance is one of the most important subjects of educational data mining. Artificial neural networks are seen to be an effective tool in predicting student performance in e-learning environments. In the studies carried out with artificial neural networks performance predictions based on student scores are generally made but students' use of learning management system is not focused. In this study performances of 3518 university students who studying and actively participating in a learning management system were tried to be predicted by artificial neural networks in terms of gender content score time spent on the content number of entries to content homework score number of attendance to live sessions total time spent in live sessions number of attendance to archived courses and total time spent in archived courses variables. Since it is difficult to interpret how much input variables in artificial neural networks contribute to predicting output variables these networks are called black boxes. Also in this study the amount of contribution of input variables on the prediction of output variable was also examined. The artificial neural network created as a result of the study makes a prediction with an accuracy of 80.47%. Finally it was found that the variables of number of attendance to the live classes the number of attendance to archived courses and the time spent in the content contributed most to the prediction of the output variable.;2020;prediction of student performance is one of the most important subjects of educational data mining. artificial neural networks are seen to be an effective tool in predicting student performance in e-learning environments. ın the studies carried out with artificial neural networks performance predictions based on student scores are generally made but students' use of learning management system is not focused. ın this study performances of 3518 university students who studying and actively participating in a learning management system were tried to be predicted by artificial neural networks in terms of gender content score time spent on the content number of entries to content homework score number of attendance to live sessions total time spent in live sessions number of attendance to archived courses and total time spent in archived courses variables. since it is difficult to interpret how much input variables in artificial neural networks contribute to predicting output variables these networks are called black boxes. also in this study the amount of contribution of input variables on the prediction of output variable was also examined. the artificial neural network created as a result of the study makes a prediction with an accuracy of 80.47%. finally it was found that the variables of number of attendance to the live classes the number of attendance to archived courses and the time spent in the content contributed most to the prediction of the output variable.
The purpose of the study is to investigate the concern developments of first-time distance education instructors using the concerns-based adoption model (CBAM). This study used stages of concern (SoC) a component of CBAM as its theoretical framework. A descriptive case study was implemented which focused on the adaptation processes of nine instructors lecturing for the first time via distance education. The instructors attended a two-day training which was designed based on their initial concerns. Then instructors implemented their courses for four weeks via distance education. While the informational and personal stages (self-concerns) decreased compared to the initial findings the consequence stage increased in intensity. However self-concerns remained predominant in the process despite the reduction in self-concerns and increase in the consequence stage. Based on the findings the implications for distance education and recommendations for addressing the instructors' concerns are discussed. Recommendations for alleviating the concerns of first-time distance education instructors include: the provision of ongoing concern-based interventions that incorporate technological pedagogical and content knowledge providing working examples related to distance education from which instructors can learn vicariously and encouraging collaboration among instructors.;2019;the purpose of the study is to investigate the concern developments of first-time distance education instructors using the concerns-based adoption model (cbam). this study used stages of concern (soc) a component of cbam as its theoretical framework. a descriptive case study was implemented which focused on the adaptation processes of nine instructors lecturing for the first time via distance education. the instructors attended a two-day training which was designed based on their initial concerns. then instructors implemented their courses for four weeks via distance education. while the informational and personal stages (self-concerns) decreased compared to the initial findings the consequence stage increased in intensity. however self-concerns remained predominant in the process despite the reduction in self-concerns and increase in the consequence stage. based on the findings the implications for distance education and recommendations for addressing the instructors' concerns are discussed. recommendations for alleviating the concerns of first-time distance education instructors include: the provision of ongoing concern-based interventions that incorporate technological pedagogical and content knowledge providing working examples related to distance education from which instructors can learn vicariously and encouraging collaboration among instructors.
The aim of this study was to reveal research trends over the last six years by content analysis and to examine bibliometric results of articles related to the use of augmented reality (AR) in science education. For bibliometric mapping analysis a total of 147 articles were accessed and for content analysis a total of 79 articles published between 2013 and 2018 years were included from the Web of Science. From this a total of 62 articles were selected for analysis. Our results revealed that mobile learning science education science learning and e-learning were the most used keywords in articles while the focus of more recent articles tended to be on mobile learning. The results showed that recent articles have mostly focused on mobile learning and e-learning environments. The most-used words in the abstracts were education knowledge science education experiment and effectiveness. It is evident that recent articles have focused mostly on students' knowledge and achievement. Azuma Dunleavy and Klopfer are the most cited authors in this field. This is not surprising as they are probably the leading authors on AR in the literature. The most cited journals are Computers & Education Journal of Science Education & Technology Educational Technology and Society Computers in Human Behavior and British Journal of Educational Technology. These are the most prominent journals on the use of technology in education. Content analysis results showed that Learning/Academic Achievement Motivation and Attitude have been the most examined variables in the articles. Since academic achievement is highly influenced by motivation and attitude it is understandable that these variables are considered together in reviewed studies. It was found that mobile applications and marker-based materials on paper have been the most-favored types of materials for AR because these types of materials are easy to use and they can be developed easily and practically. Quantitative studies were the most used research design type but there have been only a limited number of qualitative studies in the last six years. This may be due to the increased tendency to use quantitative and mixed studies in recent years.;2019;the aim of this study was to reveal research trends over the last six years by content analysis and to examine bibliometric results of articles related to the use of augmented reality (ar) in science education. for bibliometric mapping analysis a total of 147 articles were accessed and for content analysis a total of 79 articles published between 2013 and 2018 years were included from the web of science. from this a total of 62 articles were selected for analysis. our results revealed that mobile learning science education science learning and e-learning were the most used keywords in articles while the focus of more recent articles tended to be on mobile learning. the results showed that recent articles have mostly focused on mobile learning and e-learning environments. the most-used words in the abstracts were education knowledge science education experiment and effectiveness. ıt is evident that recent articles have focused mostly on students' knowledge and achievement. azuma dunleavy and klopfer are the most cited authors in this field. this is not surprising as they are probably the leading authors on ar in the literature. the most cited journals are computers & education journal of science education & technology educational technology and society computers in human behavior and british journal of educational technology. these are the most prominent journals on the use of technology in education. content analysis results showed that learning/academic achievement motivation and attitude have been the most examined variables in the articles. since academic achievement is highly influenced by motivation and attitude it is understandable that these variables are considered together in reviewed studies. ıt was found that mobile applications and marker-based materials on paper have been the most-favored types of materials for ar because these types of materials are easy to use and they can be developed easily and practically. quantitative studies were the most used research design type but there have been only a limited number of qualitative studies in the last six years. this may be due to the increased tendency to use quantitative and mixed studies in recent years.

The use of web-based education and e-learning environments has increased with the developments in educational technology. Schools universities public institutions and other private sector companies started deploying these systems to train their students members and employees. Exams are carried out during the evaluation process of these trainings. Web-based tests are sometimes used for these exams. When there are so many questions about the same topic it is a time-consuming and difficult problem to prepare these exams in terms of the best quality quickly and effectively. In order to overcome this issue artificial intelligence techniques are utilized as well as conventional methods for producing test papers. In this study an Intelligent Question Evaluation and Selection Software (I-QUESS) that enables the selection of questions according to desired preferences by using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and genetic algorithm (GA) as hybrid was developed. This proposed hybrid system was used in a case study to create test sheet for web-based environments.;2020;the use of web-based education and e-learning environments has increased with the developments in educational technology. schools universities public institutions and other private sector companies started deploying these systems to train their students members and employees. exams are carried out during the evaluation process of these trainings. web-based tests are sometimes used for these exams. when there are so many questions about the same topic it is a time-consuming and difficult problem to prepare these exams in terms of the best quality quickly and effectively. ın order to overcome this issue artificial intelligence techniques are utilized as well as conventional methods for producing test papers. ın this study an ıntelligent question evaluation and selection software (ı-quess) that enables the selection of questions according to desired preferences by using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fahp) and genetic algorithm (ga) as hybrid was developed. this proposed hybrid system was used in a case study to create test sheet for web-based environments.
This study investigates the online peer feedback practices of teacher trainees who are engaged in designing CALL materials. The participants are 111 pre-service English language teachers enrolled in a teacher education programme in Turkey who post the materials they produce to an online course blog and then evaluate each other's materials. The data come from the compilation of blog posts produced to provide online peer feedback forming the Corpus of Online Peer Feedback in Teaching. The data are analysed using corpus linguistics drawing on frequency collocation concordance and keyword analyses. Our findings show that the participants highlight particular features of CALL materials such as student-centeredness learner interest and visual aspects by using constructive peer feedback with hedged evaluations which brings data-based evidence for their knowledge on and beliefs about CALL materials.

In this paper we study anomaly detection in a distributed network of nodes and introduce a novel algorithm based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We first reformulate the conventional SVM optimization problem for a distributed network of nodes. We then directly train the parameters of this SVM architecture in its primal form using a gradient based algorithm in a fully distributed manner i.e. each node in our network is allowed to communicate only with its neighboring nodes in order to train the parameters. Therefore we not only obtain a high performing anomaly detection algorithm thanks to strong modeling capabilities of SVMs but also achieve significantly reduced communication load and computational complexity due to our fully distributed and efficient gradient based training. Here we provide a training algorithm in a supervised framework however we also provide the extensions of our implementation to an unsupervised framework. We illustrate the performance gains achieved by our algorithm via several benchmark real life and synthetic experiments. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigates the effect of E-learning (EL) blended learning (BL) and flipped learning (FL) approaches on the mathematics achievement self-regulation and mathematics self-efficacy. Participants consist of 163 first-year students attending an associate degree program (a 2-year program) of a state university. The EL BL and FL settings in the research were designed based on Merrill's 'First Principles of Instruction Design Theory'. In the research in which a quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test research design was used the data were obtained by means of mathematics achievement test self-regulation and self-efficacy questionnaires. The experimental results showed that the mathematics achievement post-test scores of FL students were significantly higher than those of the students of EL and BL. No significant difference was found between BL and EL settings. In addition FL students showed significantly higher self-regulation and mathematics self-efficacy than the other groups' students. According to these results it can be said that the usage of FL approach in mathematics courses has a positive effect on the learning process of students. It is expected that the findings will be helpful in the future design and implementation of mathematics courses at vocational colleges.;2020;this study investigates the effect of e-learning (el) blended learning (bl) and flipped learning (fl) approaches on the mathematics achievement self-regulation and mathematics self-efficacy. participants consist of 163 first-year students attending an associate degree program (a 2-year program) of a state university. the el bl and fl settings in the research were designed based on merrill's 'first principles of ınstruction design theory'. ın the research in which a quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test research design was used the data were obtained by means of mathematics achievement test self-regulation and self-efficacy questionnaires. the experimental results showed that the mathematics achievement post-test scores of fl students were significantly higher than those of the students of el and bl. no significant difference was found between bl and el settings. ın addition fl students showed significantly higher self-regulation and mathematics self-efficacy than the other groups' students. according to these results it can be said that the usage of fl approach in mathematics courses has a positive effect on the learning process of students. ıt is expected that the findings will be helpful in the future design and implementation of mathematics courses at vocational colleges.
Social sharing in virtual learning environments differs from real environments resulting in a need for a specialized data collection tool related to social anxiety in these environments. This study seeks to develop a scale to identify the levels of social anxiety experienced in e-learning. The study group consists of 275 students who have previously experienced an online or a blended learning environment. The data were analyzed through exploratory factor analysis confirmatory factor analysis convergent and divergent validity tests. The interpersonal interactions of learners in online environments were considered in developing the tool. Two subscale forms were created to identify the levels of social anxiety in learner-learner interaction and learner-instructor interaction. Each subscale of the Social Anxiety Scale for E-Learning Environments (SASE) consists of 23 items and three subfactors. These sub-factors are called negative evaluation somatic symptoms and avoidance of interaction. The analyses indicate that the SASE is a reliable and valid measurement tool useful for assessing the social anxiety levels of online learners.;;social sharing in virtual learning environments differs from real environments resulting in a need for a specialized data collection tool related to social anxiety in these environments. this study seeks to develop a scale to identify the levels of social anxiety experienced in e-learning. the study group consists of 275 students who have previously experienced an online or a blended learning environment. the data were analyzed through exploratory factor analysis confirmatory factor analysis convergent and divergent validity tests. the interpersonal interactions of learners in online environments were considered in developing the tool. two subscale forms were created to identify the levels of social anxiety in learner-learner interaction and learner-instructor interaction. each subscale of the social anxiety scale for e-learning environments (sase) consists of 23 items and three subfactors. these sub-factors are called negative evaluation somatic symptoms and avoidance of interaction. the analyses indicate that the sase is a reliable and valid measurement tool useful for assessing the social anxiety levels of online learners.

Purpose The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of web-based distance education for the prevention of child emotional neglect and abuse by increasing parental awareness of emotional abuse and appropriate attitudes toward child-rearing. Design and Methods This study had a quasi-experimental randomized controlled design. The study sample included a total of 60 parents who had taken their child to a pediatric outpatient clinic in Turkey. Of 60 parents 30 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and 30 were randomly assigned to a control group. Data were collected using the Personal Characteristics Form the Recognition of Emotional Maltreatment Scale (REMS) and the Parental Attitude Research Instrument (PARI). The experimental group was offered a 6-week web-based distance education program focusing on the prevention of child emotional neglect and abuse. Findings There was no significant difference between the posttest scores of the experimental and control groups (P > .05). However a significant difference was found between pretest and posttest scores of the experimental group for the REMS and its subscales and for the overprotective mothering and strict discipline subscales of the PARI (P < .05). Conclusion The 6-week web-based distance education has the potential to increase parental awareness of child-rearing and emotional abuse. Practice Implications Web-based distance education has a positive effect on parenting attitudes and emotional abuse awareness levels. This form of parent education should therefore be utilized further in clinical practice.;2021;purpose the aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of web-based distance education for the prevention of child emotional neglect and abuse by increasing parental awareness of emotional abuse and appropriate attitudes toward child-rearing. design and methods this study had a quasi-experimental randomized controlled design. the study sample included a total of 60 parents who had taken their child to a pediatric outpatient clinic in turkey. of 60 parents 30 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and 30 were randomly assigned to a control group. data were collected using the personal characteristics form the recognition of emotional maltreatment scale (rems) and the parental attitude research ınstrument (parı). the experimental group was offered a 6-week web-based distance education program focusing on the prevention of child emotional neglect and abuse. findings there was no significant difference between the posttest scores of the experimental and control groups (p > .05). however a significant difference was found between pretest and posttest scores of the experimental group for the rems and its subscales and for the overprotective mothering and strict discipline subscales of the parı (p < .05). conclusion the 6-week web-based distance education has the potential to increase parental awareness of child-rearing and emotional abuse. practice ımplications web-based distance education has a positive effect on parenting attitudes and emotional abuse awareness levels. this form of parent education should therefore be utilized further in clinical practice.
This qualitative case study aimed to explore how novice instructional designers solved a real-world problem by proposing an instructional design model in Second Life. Twenty-one novice instructional designers who enrolled in a Distance Education course were tasked with proposing an instructional design model to solve the high drop-out rate problem in a Distance Education center. In the Second Life environment an island was rented and a Distance Education center was built. The participants worked in teams to propose an instructional design model for solving the real-world problem by simulating themselves as distance education specialists in this virtual Distance Education center. The data were collected through interviews open-ended questionnaires system logs and group reports regarding their problem-solving processes. The results showed that the novice instructional designers stated that carrying out the problem-solving process in the Second Life promoted their motivation and engagement related to the real-world problem. To solve the real-world problem five groups proposed Analysis-Design-Development-Implementation-Evaluation model while one group proposed an Attention-Relevance-Confidence-Satisfaction model. Although the participants were aware of the potential of the Second Life as a Problem-based Learning environment they stated that they preferred alternative technologies due to access and usability issues.;;this qualitative case study aimed to explore how novice instructional designers solved a real-world problem by proposing an instructional design model in second life. twenty-one novice instructional designers who enrolled in a distance education course were tasked with proposing an instructional design model to solve the high drop-out rate problem in a distance education center. ın the second life environment an island was rented and a distance education center was built. the participants worked in teams to propose an instructional design model for solving the real-world problem by simulating themselves as distance education specialists in this virtual distance education center. the data were collected through interviews open-ended questionnaires system logs and group reports regarding their problem-solving processes. the results showed that the novice instructional designers stated that carrying out the problem-solving process in the second life promoted their motivation and engagement related to the real-world problem. to solve the real-world problem five groups proposed analysis-design-development-ımplementation-evaluation model while one group proposed an attention-relevance-confidence-satisfaction model. although the participants were aware of the potential of the second life as a problem-based learning environment they stated that they preferred alternative technologies due to access and usability issues.

Purpose To determine how members of the Societe Internationale d'Urologie (SIU) are continuing their education in the time of COVID-19. Methods A survey was disseminated amongst SIU members worldwide by email. Results were analyzed to examine the influence of age practice region and settings on continuing medical education (CME) of the respondents. Results In total 2494 respondents completed the survey. Internet searching was the most common method of CME (76% allps < 0.001) followed by searching journals and textbook including the online versions (62% allps < 0.001). Overall 6% of the respondents reported no time/interest for CME during the pandemic. Although most urologists report using only one platform for their CME (26.6%) the majority reported using >= 2 platforms with approximately 10% of the respondents using up to 5 different platforms. Urologists < 40 years old were more likely to use online literature (69%) podcasts/AV media (38%) online CME courses/webinars (40%) and social media (39%). There were regional variations in the CME modality used but no significant difference in the number of methods by region. There was no significant difference in responses between urologists in academic/public hospitals or private practice. Conclusion During COVID-19 urologists have used web-based learning for their CME. Internet learning and literature were the top frequently cited learning methods. Younger urologists are more likely to use all forms of digital learning methods while older urologists prefer fewer methods.;2021;purpose to determine how members of the societe ınternationale d'urologie (sıu) are continuing their education in the time of covıd-19. methods a survey was disseminated amongst sıu members worldwide by email. results were analyzed to examine the influence of age practice region and settings on continuing medical education (cme) of the respondents. results ın total 2494 respondents completed the survey. ınternet searching was the most common method of cme (76% allps < 0.001) followed by searching journals and textbook including the online versions (62% allps < 0.001). overall 6% of the respondents reported no time/interest for cme during the pandemic. although most urologists report using only one platform for their cme (26.6%) the majority reported using >= 2 platforms with approximately 10% of the respondents using up to 5 different platforms. urologists < 40 years old were more likely to use online literature (69%) podcasts/av media (38%) online cme courses/webinars (40%) and social media (39%). there were regional variations in the cme modality used but no significant difference in the number of methods by region. there was no significant difference in responses between urologists in academic/public hospitals or private practice. conclusion during covıd-19 urologists have used web-based learning for their cme. ınternet learning and literature were the top frequently cited learning methods. younger urologists are more likely to use all forms of digital learning methods while older urologists prefer fewer methods.
Study Objectives: Learning management systems (LMS) are the most popular educational technology system used in distance education. In our study it was aimed to evaluate the acceptance levels of Suleyman Demirel University Faculty of Medicine students regarding the learning management system.

As online learning is becoming very popular in formal educational settings and in individual development online exams are starting to be recognized as one of the more efficient assessment methods. Online exams are effective in either blended or traditional forms of learning and when appropriately used bring benefits to both learners and the learning process. However learners' perceptions of online exams in developing countries have not been widely studied despite the potential of such research for contributing to more effective use of online exams in these countries. Thus this study served two purposes. First it aimed to investigate students' perceptions of online exams at a state university in Turkey and at a state university in Kyrgyzstan. Second the study compared the results. Structured as a mixed study the research was conducted during the 2018-2019 fall term. The participants were 370 undergraduate students taking first-year courses online. Quantitative data considered learners' perception scores gathered via a survey whereas qualitative data considered learners' opinions in response to an open-ended question. According to the quantitative analysis learners' perceptions differed according to gender major and prior online course experience variables. In addition Turkish and Kyrgyz learners differed in that Turkish learners found online exams less stressful and more reliable and fairer than traditional paper-based exams when compared with their Kyrgyz counterparts. The qualitative analysis provided important results for future planning in both institutions.;2020;as online learning is becoming very popular in formal educational settings and in individual development online exams are starting to be recognized as one of the more efficient assessment methods. online exams are effective in either blended or traditional forms of learning and when appropriately used bring benefits to both learners and the learning process. however learners' perceptions of online exams in developing countries have not been widely studied despite the potential of such research for contributing to more effective use of online exams in these countries. thus this study served two purposes. first it aimed to investigate students' perceptions of online exams at a state university in turkey and at a state university in kyrgyzstan. second the study compared the results. structured as a mixed study the research was conducted during the 2018-2019 fall term. the participants were 370 undergraduate students taking first-year courses online. quantitative data considered learners' perception scores gathered via a survey whereas qualitative data considered learners' opinions in response to an open-ended question. according to the quantitative analysis learners' perceptions differed according to gender major and prior online course experience variables. ın addition turkish and kyrgyz learners differed in that turkish learners found online exams less stressful and more reliable and fairer than traditional paper-based exams when compared with their kyrgyz counterparts. the qualitative analysis provided important results for future planning in both institutions.

With the integration of popular technologies such as social media smartphones and tablets in the education system new online course delivery methods such as flipped classrooms have emerged to enhance teaching and learning. To understand implications of the integration of such technologies in education the study examined the responses of 550 preservice teachers. Participants took their regular classes on a flipped classroom during a semester. After this experience the participants completed a survey instrument adapted for this study to measure their continuous intention to use flipped classroom. The research model which is based on technology acceptance model and social cognitive theory was tested by employing a structural equation modelling approach. Results indicated that self-regulation and self-efficacy have a positive impact on perceived ease of use (PEOU). Whereas perceived anxiety has a negative impact on the PEOU and self-efficacy. Self-efficacy mediates the relationship between perceived anxiety and PEOU. Further the results indicated that PEOU has a positive impact on perceived usefulness (PU). Both PU and PEOU have a positive impact on the continuous intention to use flipped classroom for teaching and learning. The findings suggested significant relationships between cognitive and technological factors and continuous intention to use flipped classroom.;2020;with the integration of popular technologies such as social media smartphones and tablets in the education system new online course delivery methods such as flipped classrooms have emerged to enhance teaching and learning. to understand implications of the integration of such technologies in education the study examined the responses of 550 preservice teachers. participants took their regular classes on a flipped classroom during a semester. after this experience the participants completed a survey instrument adapted for this study to measure their continuous intention to use flipped classroom. the research model which is based on technology acceptance model and social cognitive theory was tested by employing a structural equation modelling approach. results indicated that self-regulation and self-efficacy have a positive impact on perceived ease of use (peou). whereas perceived anxiety has a negative impact on the peou and self-efficacy. self-efficacy mediates the relationship between perceived anxiety and peou. further the results indicated that peou has a positive impact on perceived usefulness (pu). both pu and peou have a positive impact on the continuous intention to use flipped classroom for teaching and learning. the findings suggested significant relationships between cognitive and technological factors and continuous intention to use flipped classroom.
Objectives There is no standardised and up-to-date education model for urology residents in our country. We aimed to describe our National E-learning education model for urology residents. Methodology The ERTP working group consisting of urologists was established by the Society of Urological Surgery to create E-learning model and curriculum in April 2018. Learning objectives were set up in order to determine and standardise the contents of the presentations. In accordance with the Bloom Taxonomy 834 learning objectives were created for a total of 90 lectures (18 lectures for each PGY year). Totally 90 videos were shot by specialised instructors and webcasts were prepared. Webcasts were posted at uropedia.com.tr which is the web library of the Society of Urological Surgery. The satisfaction of residents and instructors was evaluated with feedbacks. An assessment of knowledge was measured with the multiple-choice exam. Results A total of 43 centres and 250 urology residents were included in ERTP during the academic year 2018/2019. There were 93/55/43/34/25 urology residents at 1st/2nd/3rd/4th and 5th year of residency respectively. Majority of the residents (99.1%) completed the ERTP. The overall satisfaction rate of residents and instructors were 4.29 and 4.67 (min: 1 so bad max: 5 so good). An assessment exam was performed to urology residents at the end of the ERTP and the mean score was calculated as 57.99 points (min: 20 max: 82).

Video lectures are one of the primary learning resources embedded in e-learning environments. Many universities prepare video lectures and share them as open course materials with students. In order to make the learning process more efficient and effective it is very important to design and personalize those learning resources for learners taking into their needs and cognitive differences. The literature regarding how cognitively diverse users benefit from which media design is scarce. Therefore the purpose of this research is to explore the effect of video lectures types (voice over type picture-in-picture type and screencast type) and learners' sustained attention levels (low and high) on their learning performance in an e-learning environment. The research was designed as a 2 x 3 factorial design. In addition learners' eye movements have been recorded during study sessions. Results indicate that main effect of learners' sustained attention levels and video lecture types on learning performance were significant. Furthermore it was observed that both for the students with high level of sustained attention and for the students with low level of sustained attention the use of picture-in-picture types of video lectures led higher learning performance scores. Similarly the eye tracking analyses also supported this finding.;2020;video lectures are one of the primary learning resources embedded in e-learning environments. many universities prepare video lectures and share them as open course materials with students. ın order to make the learning process more efficient and effective it is very important to design and personalize those learning resources for learners taking into their needs and cognitive differences. the literature regarding how cognitively diverse users benefit from which media design is scarce. therefore the purpose of this research is to explore the effect of video lectures types (voice over type picture-in-picture type and screencast type) and learners' sustained attention levels (low and high) on their learning performance in an e-learning environment. the research was designed as a 2 x 3 factorial design. ın addition learners' eye movements have been recorded during study sessions. results indicate that main effect of learners' sustained attention levels and video lecture types on learning performance were significant. furthermore it was observed that both for the students with high level of sustained attention and for the students with low level of sustained attention the use of picture-in-picture types of video lectures led higher learning performance scores. similarly the eye tracking analyses also supported this finding.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused teachers and students to abandon their physical classrooms and move into emergency distance education (EDE) settings. Thus sustaining the quality in education has become a challenge during this transitional period. Within this context the aim of this study was to explore the impact of EDE on language skills development (reading writing listening and speaking) of Turkish pre-service teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL). In this qualitative study data were gathered from 118 pre-service EFL teachers about the advantages and disadvantages of EDE for their language skills development. Thematic analysis was used as a research design and nine themes emerged for both advantages and disadvantages. The most important theme for both categories is content and implementation of online courses. This study pinpointed the eminence of this theme for if it is emphasized enough and handled efficiently it plays a huge role in developing language skills. The themes and sub-themes generated through thematic analysis showed the advantages and disadvantages of EDE for each skill in detail and also proved that EDE was most advantageous for writing skill and least advantageous for speaking skill. The participants stated that since writing skill was constantly used for almost all homework assignments and projects that skill was nurtured the most. Nevertheless speaking skill was ignored during online courses and writing became the new mode of communication by replacing speaking. The outcome of the present study encourages preparedness for EDE against a possible second wave. Thus the study is hoped to pave the way for anticipating issues and developing solutions for EDE contexts to preserve sustainability in higher education.;2020;the covıd-19 pandemic has caused teachers and students to abandon their physical classrooms and move into emergency distance education (ede) settings. thus sustaining the quality in education has become a challenge during this transitional period. within this context the aim of this study was to explore the impact of ede on language skills development (reading writing listening and speaking) of turkish pre-service teachers of english as a foreign language (efl). ın this qualitative study data were gathered from 118 pre-service efl teachers about the advantages and disadvantages of ede for their language skills development. thematic analysis was used as a research design and nine themes emerged for both advantages and disadvantages. the most important theme for both categories is content and implementation of online courses. this study pinpointed the eminence of this theme for if it is emphasized enough and handled efficiently it plays a huge role in developing language skills. the themes and sub-themes generated through thematic analysis showed the advantages and disadvantages of ede for each skill in detail and also proved that ede was most advantageous for writing skill and least advantageous for speaking skill. the participants stated that since writing skill was constantly used for almost all homework assignments and projects that skill was nurtured the most. nevertheless speaking skill was ignored during online courses and writing became the new mode of communication by replacing speaking. the outcome of the present study encourages preparedness for ede against a possible second wave. thus the study is hoped to pave the way for anticipating issues and developing solutions for ede contexts to preserve sustainability in higher education.
In this experimental study an intelligent tutoring system called the fuzzy Bayesian intelligent tutoring system (FB-ITS) is developed by using artificial intelligence methods based on fuzzy logic and the Bayesian network technique to adaptively support students in learning environments. The effectiveness of the FB-ITS was evaluated by comparing it with two other versions of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) fuzzy ITS and Bayesian ITS separately. Moreover it was evaluated by comparing it with an existing traditional e-learning system. In order to evaluate whether the academic performance of the students in different learning groups differs or not analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used based on the students' pre-test and post-test scores. The study was conducted with 120 undergraduate university students. Results showed that students who studied using FB-ITS had significantly higher academic performance on average compared to other students who studied with the other systems. Regarding the time taken to perform the post-test the results indicated that students who used the FB-ITS needed less time on average compared to students who used the traditional e-learning system. From the results it could be concluded that the new system contributed in terms of the speed of performing the final exam and high academic success.;2020;ın this experimental study an intelligent tutoring system called the fuzzy bayesian intelligent tutoring system (fb-ıts) is developed by using artificial intelligence methods based on fuzzy logic and the bayesian network technique to adaptively support students in learning environments. the effectiveness of the fb-ıts was evaluated by comparing it with two other versions of an ıntelligent tutoring system (ıts) fuzzy ıts and bayesian ıts separately. moreover it was evaluated by comparing it with an existing traditional e-learning system. ın order to evaluate whether the academic performance of the students in different learning groups differs or not analysis of covariance (ancova) was used based on the students' pre-test and post-test scores. the study was conducted with 120 undergraduate university students. results showed that students who studied using fb-ıts had significantly higher academic performance on average compared to other students who studied with the other systems. regarding the time taken to perform the post-test the results indicated that students who used the fb-ıts needed less time on average compared to students who used the traditional e-learning system. from the results it could be concluded that the new system contributed in terms of the speed of performing the final exam and high academic success.

E-learning environments can store huge amounts of data on the interaction of learners with the content assessment and discussion. Yet after the identification of meaningful patterns or learning behaviour in the data it is necessary to use these patterns to improve learning environments. It is notable that designs to benefit from these patterns have been developed particularly with the use of educational data mining and learning analytics in the recent times. On the other hand multi-criteria decision-making methods provide opportunities to researchers to discover and use the patterns in the data obtained from learning environments. This study seeks to discover the patterns in the interaction data gathered from e-learning environments. In this context the research has two main objectives. Firstly it aims to utilize the ELECTRE TRI method which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods designed to classify the learners based on the interaction data in different units. Secondly it aims to analyse the relationship between the classification based on the ELECTRE TRI method and the classification in the real life. To that end two different interaction data sets obtained from learning management systems at different times are used in this study. The first data set consists of the data on 11 criteria and 78 students whereas the second data set consists of the data on 25 criteria and 65 students. Three different categories are identified in the first data set by the ELECTRE TRI method. Based on this finding the classification in the ELECTRE TRI method is compared to the real-life classification which shows a medium-level correlation. Two different categories are identified in the second data set. There is a medium-level correlation between these categories and the real-life classification as well. In conclusion this study presents discussions on the use of multi-criteria decision-making methods to improve e-learning environments.;2021;e-learning environments can store huge amounts of data on the interaction of learners with the content assessment and discussion. yet after the identification of meaningful patterns or learning behaviour in the data it is necessary to use these patterns to improve learning environments. ıt is notable that designs to benefit from these patterns have been developed particularly with the use of educational data mining and learning analytics in the recent times. on the other hand multi-criteria decision-making methods provide opportunities to researchers to discover and use the patterns in the data obtained from learning environments. this study seeks to discover the patterns in the interaction data gathered from e-learning environments. ın this context the research has two main objectives. firstly it aims to utilize the electre trı method which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods designed to classify the learners based on the interaction data in different units. secondly it aims to analyse the relationship between the classification based on the electre trı method and the classification in the real life. to that end two different interaction data sets obtained from learning management systems at different times are used in this study. the first data set consists of the data on 11 criteria and 78 students whereas the second data set consists of the data on 25 criteria and 65 students. three different categories are identified in the first data set by the electre trı method. based on this finding the classification in the electre trı method is compared to the real-life classification which shows a medium-level correlation. two different categories are identified in the second data set. there is a medium-level correlation between these categories and the real-life classification as well. ın conclusion this study presents discussions on the use of multi-criteria decision-making methods to improve e-learning environments.

Student modeling is one of the most important processes in adaptive systems. Although learning is individual a model can be created based on patterns in student behavior. Since a student model can be created for more than one student the use of machine learning techniques in student modeling is increasing. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) which form one group of machine learning techniques are among the methods most frequently used in learning environments. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are specific types of these networks are used effectively for complex problems such as image processing computer vision and speech recognition. In this study a student model was created using a CNN due to the complexity of the learning process and the performance of the model was examined. The student modeling technique used was named LearnerPrints. The navigation data of the students in a learning management system were used to construct the model. Training and test data were used to analyze the performance of the model. The classification results showed that CNNs can be used effectively for student modeling. The modeling was based on the students' achievement and used the students' data from the learning management system. The study found that the LearnerPrints technique classified students with an accuracy of over 80%.;2021;student modeling is one of the most important processes in adaptive systems. although learning is individual a model can be created based on patterns in student behavior. since a student model can be created for more than one student the use of machine learning techniques in student modeling is increasing. artificial neural networks (anns) which form one group of machine learning techniques are among the methods most frequently used in learning environments. convolutional neural networks (cnns) which are specific types of these networks are used effectively for complex problems such as image processing computer vision and speech recognition. ın this study a student model was created using a cnn due to the complexity of the learning process and the performance of the model was examined. the student modeling technique used was named learnerprints. the navigation data of the students in a learning management system were used to construct the model. training and test data were used to analyze the performance of the model. the classification results showed that cnns can be used effectively for student modeling. the modeling was based on the students' achievement and used the students' data from the learning management system. the study found that the learnerprints technique classified students with an accuracy of over 80%.
Electrical circuits constitute the core of many courses at the undergraduate level in electrical and electronics engineering. For most undergraduate students learning and analyzing such circuits are a difficult process. A significant drawback of Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE)-based simulation tools in terms of e-learning is that they only generate circuit simulation outputs such as the current and voltage of electrical elements contained in a particular circuit. The users are not provided with the detailed information about the steps that are followed to obtain the related outputs. This study describes the development of a new software tool called ECDAT (a shorthand for the Electrical Circuit Description and Analysis Tool) which can serve as a practical component of electrical circuits courses. The developed tool currently analyzes simple direct electric circuits in a similar way as the existing circuit analysis and simulation ones and it produces an output document that includes the certain equations and intermediate calculations using the well-known circuit laws differently from the previous works. Another contribution of the study is that unlike the modified nodal analysis method used in SPICE-based circuit analysis programs it employs a graph analysis method for circuit analysis.;2021;electrical circuits constitute the core of many courses at the undergraduate level in electrical and electronics engineering. for most undergraduate students learning and analyzing such circuits are a difficult process. a significant drawback of simulation program with ıntegrated circuit emphasis (spıce)-based simulation tools in terms of e-learning is that they only generate circuit simulation outputs such as the current and voltage of electrical elements contained in a particular circuit. the users are not provided with the detailed information about the steps that are followed to obtain the related outputs. this study describes the development of a new software tool called ecdat (a shorthand for the electrical circuit description and analysis tool) which can serve as a practical component of electrical circuits courses. the developed tool currently analyzes simple direct electric circuits in a similar way as the existing circuit analysis and simulation ones and it produces an output document that includes the certain equations and intermediate calculations using the well-known circuit laws differently from the previous works. another contribution of the study is that unlike the modified nodal analysis method used in spıce-based circuit analysis programs it employs a graph analysis method for circuit analysis.
The aim of the article is to highlight the key elements related to the implementation of new technologies in education from the perspective of the opinions and experiences of educators in the field in Bolivia Brazil the Dominican Republic Ecuador Finland Poland Turkey and Uruguay. The text compares issues related to attitudes towards the use of new media in education experiences with different forms of e-learning and the level of restrictions on the use of smartphones in school. These variables are juxtaposed with the self-assessment of digital competence and how cyberspace is used. The survey was conducted using a standardised survey questionnaire translated into the relevant national languages in the first half of 2019 and involved a sample of 873 teachers representing eight countries. On the basis of the pilot studies it was noted that: 1) Teachers from LAC and EU like to use digital media - this is a constant trend independent of geographical location 2) Teachers note that new technologies are not always better than analogue didactic aids 3) Teachers from selected countries (the Dominican Republic Brazil Turkey and Uruguay) have much greater techno-optimism in themselves than teachers from Bolivia Poland Finland and Turkey in terms of the impact of ICT on student motivation and engagement 4) In all countries teachers prefer free online courses (the different forms of e-learning are used most often by those in the Dominican Republic and the least often in Bolivia and Poland) 5) In each country teachers who highly value their own digital competences and have a positive attitude towards new media use ICT much more actively 6) There is also a global trend in that the extensive use of cyberspace (typical e-services) appears in combination with the extensive use of various forms of e-learning 7) Teachers from Ecuador are most likely to want to ban the use of smartphones in schools.

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide a valuable learning platform for global learners. They are extensively utilized by an increasing number of people from all over the world due to their remarkable features including unlimited enrollment the lack of location requirements free access to a high number of courses and structural similarity to traditional lectures. However high dropout rates negatively affect their educational effectiveness. In this regard as a trending research topic in recent years the prediction of dropout rates in MOOCs has become a critical issue in terms of planning for the future and taking precautions. This study proposes a practical prediction approach for the student dropout problem of MOOCs. In this regard an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is utilized for the prediction of dropout rates in MOOCs for the first time in this study. The proposed approach uses the capabilities of both neural networks and fuzzy inference systems thus it provides highly accurate predictions. The performance of the proposed ANFIS approach is benchmarked against various models developed based on several machine learning methods including the decision tree logistic regression support vector machine ensemble learning and K-nearest neighbor methods. The results reveal that the proposed approach provides higher statistical accuracy than its benchmarks meaning that the proposed approach can be used effectively for MOOCs.;2021;massive open online courses (moocs) provide a valuable learning platform for global learners. they are extensively utilized by an increasing number of people from all over the world due to their remarkable features including unlimited enrollment the lack of location requirements free access to a high number of courses and structural similarity to traditional lectures. however high dropout rates negatively affect their educational effectiveness. ın this regard as a trending research topic in recent years the prediction of dropout rates in moocs has become a critical issue in terms of planning for the future and taking precautions. this study proposes a practical prediction approach for the student dropout problem of moocs. ın this regard an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (anfıs) is utilized for the prediction of dropout rates in moocs for the first time in this study. the proposed approach uses the capabilities of both neural networks and fuzzy inference systems thus it provides highly accurate predictions. the performance of the proposed anfıs approach is benchmarked against various models developed based on several machine learning methods including the decision tree logistic regression support vector machine ensemble learning and k-nearest neighbor methods. the results reveal that the proposed approach provides higher statistical accuracy than its benchmarks meaning that the proposed approach can be used effectively for moocs.
Along with the COVID-19 outbreak which has been a global threat for public health the unconfirmed information about the pandemic in circulation has become another threat. Hence it has become important to improve public understanding of science with a focus on explaining the nature of uncertainty in science and its impacts. The goal of the present study was to explore pre-service teachers' analysis of claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout an 8-week online implementation of a pre-service teachers' analysis task focus group interviews and instructor's feedback to this analysis in a course focusing on critical and analytical thinking. In order to achieve this purpose the researchers used the claims that contain fallacies conspiracy theories and scientific arguments related to the COVID-19 pandemic as an assessment tool. The researchers developed and used a rubric consisting of the high moderate and low levels of analysis in three different categories including evaluation of claims demarcation of fallacies and conspiracy theories from scientific arguments and judgment of the credibility of sources. The findings indicate that the participants analyzed the claims rarely at a high level before the focus group interviews. However after the focus group interviews almost every participant's analysis scores of evaluation demarcation and judgment increased. The results also revealed their commitment to various fallacies and conspiracy theories while arguing the claims. Concluding remarks are made for the further implications of teaching critical evaluation of claims based on evidence.;2021;along with the covıd-19 outbreak which has been a global threat for public health the unconfirmed information about the pandemic in circulation has become another threat. hence it has become important to improve public understanding of science with a focus on explaining the nature of uncertainty in science and its impacts. the goal of the present study was to explore pre-service teachers' analysis of claims related to the covıd-19 pandemic throughout an 8-week online implementation of a pre-service teachers' analysis task focus group interviews and instructor's feedback to this analysis in a course focusing on critical and analytical thinking. ın order to achieve this purpose the researchers used the claims that contain fallacies conspiracy theories and scientific arguments related to the covıd-19 pandemic as an assessment tool. the researchers developed and used a rubric consisting of the high moderate and low levels of analysis in three different categories including evaluation of claims demarcation of fallacies and conspiracy theories from scientific arguments and judgment of the credibility of sources. the findings indicate that the participants analyzed the claims rarely at a high level before the focus group interviews. however after the focus group interviews almost every participant's analysis scores of evaluation demarcation and judgment increased. the results also revealed their commitment to various fallacies and conspiracy theories while arguing the claims. concluding remarks are made for the further implications of teaching critical evaluation of claims based on evidence.
The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically reduced physical activity (PA) behaviors of many people. Physical education (PE) is considered one of the privileged instruments to promote youths' PA. We aimed to investigate the effects of lockdown on PE teachers' behaviors promoting their students' out-of-school PA and differences between three European countries. A sample of 1146 PE teachers (59.5% females) from France Italy and Turkey answered an online questionnaire about guiding students to engage in out-of-school PA helping them to set PA goals encouraging in self-monitoring PA the pedagogical formats of these behaviors and feedback asked to students. RM-MANCOVAs were performed with a two-time (before and during the lockdown) three country (France Italy Turkey) two gender factorial design using teaching years and perceived health as covariates. A significant multivariate main effect time x country x gender (p < 0.001) was reported for the behaviors promoting students' PA with French and Italian teachers increasing some behaviors while Turkish teachers showing opposite trends.

Estimating the flow state of students in a course allows evaluating their sentimental state and the challenges they are facing. In e-learning platforms the evaluation of flow state is a complex task because it depends on the ability to extract the parameters that better reflect the activity and effort of students. In this scope the current study proposes a method based on flow theory aiming to provide information about the students' flow state in a course that is taught in an e-learning environment. First the interaction of students with an e-learning platform that comprises classical e-learning pages and a timeline tool is analyzed using activity heatmaps and deep neural networks. Then by taking also in account their grades the flow state of students is calculated. The resulted data are validated with a statistical analysis that also utilizes student surveys. In order to guarantee that this method is applicable to various profiles students from different faculties participated in this study. In a period where education is rapidly adapting to online lectures and e-learning platforms the estimation of student's flow state in e-learning environments can provide useful feedback and data to students and educators.;2021;estimating the flow state of students in a course allows evaluating their sentimental state and the challenges they are facing. ın e-learning platforms the evaluation of flow state is a complex task because it depends on the ability to extract the parameters that better reflect the activity and effort of students. ın this scope the current study proposes a method based on flow theory aiming to provide information about the students' flow state in a course that is taught in an e-learning environment. first the interaction of students with an e-learning platform that comprises classical e-learning pages and a timeline tool is analyzed using activity heatmaps and deep neural networks. then by taking also in account their grades the flow state of students is calculated. the resulted data are validated with a statistical analysis that also utilizes student surveys. ın order to guarantee that this method is applicable to various profiles students from different faculties participated in this study. ın a period where education is rapidly adapting to online lectures and e-learning platforms the estimation of student's flow state in e-learning environments can provide useful feedback and data to students and educators.

Introduction: To reduce the rate of spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey distance education was initiated in all universities on 23 March 2020. Distance learning had not been experienced in physical therapy and rehabilitation education before the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aimed to (a) determine the acceptance and attitudes of Pamukkale University Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation undergraduate students towards distance learning during the COVID-19 outbreak and (b) compare the results among years. Methods: This study was conducted from May 2020 to June 2020 at the Pamukkale University School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation in Turkey. A total of 381 students (271 female 110 male) participated. The Distance Learning Systems Acceptance Scale (ease of use benefit) the Community Feeling Scale (affective and actional dimension) and the Distance Learning Attitude Scale (general acceptance individual awareness perceived usefulness effective participation) were used to measure students' acceptance and attitudes towards distance education. Results: Students had partly positive attitudes towards distance learning but were undecided about individual awareness usefulness and effective participation. The sense of community among students was moderate in the distance learning environment. Distance learning acceptance and attitude and the sense of community levels were highest in fourth-year students (last year of the school) followed by first- third- and then second year students. The distance learning and sense of community scores of first- and fourth-year students were significantly higher than those of second- and third-year students (p <= 0.01). Conclusion: Physical therapy and rehabilitation undergraduate students' attitudes towards distance learning during the COVID-19 outbreak were positive. However when comparing between years students in the second and third academic years had less positive attitudes. This may be because most of their curricula consisted of practical courses and summer field internships and there were no opportunities to practise on mannequins peers and patients in distance education. In this study the sense of community among students in the distance learning environment was also moderate. This may be because students were not enthusiastic about attending course lectures online and because they did not have to view the lectures at a set time.;2021;ıntroduction: to reduce the rate of spread of the covıd-19 pandemic in turkey distance education was initiated in all universities on 23 march 2020. distance learning had not been experienced in physical therapy and rehabilitation education before the covıd-19 outbreak. this study aimed to (a) determine the acceptance and attitudes of pamukkale university physical therapy and rehabilitation undergraduate students towards distance learning during the covıd-19 outbreak and (b) compare the results among years. methods: this study was conducted from may 2020 to june 2020 at the pamukkale university school of physical therapy and rehabilitation in turkey. a total of 381 students (271 female 110 male) participated. the distance learning systems acceptance scale (ease of use benefit) the community feeling scale (affective and actional dimension) and the distance learning attitude scale (general acceptance individual awareness perceived usefulness effective participation) were used to measure students' acceptance and attitudes towards distance education. results: students had partly positive attitudes towards distance learning but were undecided about individual awareness usefulness and effective participation. the sense of community among students was moderate in the distance learning environment. distance learning acceptance and attitude and the sense of community levels were highest in fourth-year students (last year of the school) followed by first- third- and then second year students. the distance learning and sense of community scores of first- and fourth-year students were significantly higher than those of second- and third-year students (p <= 0.01). conclusion: physical therapy and rehabilitation undergraduate students' attitudes towards distance learning during the covıd-19 outbreak were positive. however when comparing between years students in the second and third academic years had less positive attitudes. this may be because most of their curricula consisted of practical courses and summer field internships and there were no opportunities to practise on mannequins peers and patients in distance education. ın this study the sense of community among students in the distance learning environment was also moderate. this may be because students were not enthusiastic about attending course lectures online and because they did not have to view the lectures at a set time.

This study intends to investigate the factors which can affect the sustainability of mobile learning (m-learning) from many perspectives. Current studies on the sustainability of m-learning are reviewed in the context of organizational financial legal and ethical pedagogical assessment psychological and social factors. In addition to the literature review an investigation based on formal interviews is conducted with 11 heads in university centers for distance education (UCDE) to obtain additional sustainability factors. To test the impacts of the factors on sustainability in m-learning another investigation which bases on survey research is conducted with administrative personnel in UCDE and instructors and students in the distance education universities. A total of 667 survey responses are analyzed and a model for the sustainability of m-learning is developed. This article concludes that some factors have significant effects on sustainability in m-learning and some of them are critically important for m-learning initiatives. M-learning sustainability is studied rarely in some contexts such as organizational psychological and social context. Therefore this study can bridge this gap and provide a guideline to m-learning initiatives for sustainable education.;2021;this study intends to investigate the factors which can affect the sustainability of mobile learning (m-learning) from many perspectives. current studies on the sustainability of m-learning are reviewed in the context of organizational financial legal and ethical pedagogical assessment psychological and social factors. ın addition to the literature review an investigation based on formal interviews is conducted with 11 heads in university centers for distance education (ucde) to obtain additional sustainability factors. to test the impacts of the factors on sustainability in m-learning another investigation which bases on survey research is conducted with administrative personnel in ucde and instructors and students in the distance education universities. a total of 667 survey responses are analyzed and a model for the sustainability of m-learning is developed. this article concludes that some factors have significant effects on sustainability in m-learning and some of them are critically important for m-learning initiatives. m-learning sustainability is studied rarely in some contexts such as organizational psychological and social context. therefore this study can bridge this gap and provide a guideline to m-learning initiatives for sustainable education.
The present study is an evaluation of the distance education process along with related activities in primary secondary and high schools in Turkey during the Covid-19 pandemic. The present qualitative study involved K-12 students who participated in the distance education process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and content analysis was performed on the data. The research findings show that EBA TV supported students' learning and provided psychological support. The EBA portal was deemed beneficial for providing easy access to the content and promotion of interest with varied presentations. But both EBA TV and the EBA portal were also reported to be deficient in preparing students for examinations. Synchronous lessons were viewed more positively for such advantages as social interaction motivating atmosphere and opportunities to ask questions in real time. In conclusion the evaluations provided in this study can help instructional designers maintain and upgrade distance education activities targeting K-12 students.;2021;the present study is an evaluation of the distance education process along with related activities in primary secondary and high schools in turkey during the covid-19 pandemic. the present qualitative study involved k-12 students who participated in the distance education process. semi-structured interviews were conducted and content analysis was performed on the data. the research findings show that eba tv supported students' learning and provided psychological support. the eba portal was deemed beneficial for providing easy access to the content and promotion of interest with varied presentations. but both eba tv and the eba portal were also reported to be deficient in preparing students for examinations. synchronous lessons were viewed more positively for such advantages as social interaction motivating atmosphere and opportunities to ask questions in real time. ın conclusion the evaluations provided in this study can help instructional designers maintain and upgrade distance education activities targeting k-12 students.
Geocapabilities developed during team project-based fieldwork add value to Tourism Geography service modules in professional Tourism and Hospitality Management curricula. This article is based on a case-study in Turkish Higher Education. Here variations on the Prisoner's Dilemma were used to confront learners with some 'wicked problems' they may face in their professional careers. Comments on their decision processes are compared with those in individual reflective essays. Responses to the Prisoner's Dilemma exercises demonstrate optimism and idealism toward: team cooperation prioritising sustainability and investing in people. Reflective essay comments were less optimistic and more coloured by personal experience. Evaluation returns suggest most found these decision-making games helpful in clarifying personal priorities concerns and values.

Distance education (DE) which has evolved under the wings of information technologies in the last decade has become a fundamental part of our modern education system. DE has not only replaced the traditional education method as in social sciences and lifelong learning opportunities but also has significantly strengthened traditional education in mathematics science and engineering fields that require practical and intensive study. However it is deprived of supporting some key elements found in traditional educational approaches such as (i) modern computer laboratories with installed special software suitable for the student's field of interest (ii) adequate staff for maintenance and proper functioning of laboratories (iii) face-to-face technical support (iv) license fees. For students to overcome these shortcomings a virtual application pool is needed where they can easily access all the necessary applications via remote access. This research aims to develop a platform-independent virtual laboratory environment for DE students. This article has been developed specifically to guide DE institutions and to make a positive contribution to the literature. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been used to explain student behaviors. It was concluded that students using the platform performed more successful grades (12.89%) on laboratory assessments and that the students using the developed platform were found to be more satisfied with the education process.;2021;distance education (de) which has evolved under the wings of information technologies in the last decade has become a fundamental part of our modern education system. de has not only replaced the traditional education method as in social sciences and lifelong learning opportunities but also has significantly strengthened traditional education in mathematics science and engineering fields that require practical and intensive study. however it is deprived of supporting some key elements found in traditional educational approaches such as (i) modern computer laboratories with installed special software suitable for the student's field of interest (ii) adequate staff for maintenance and proper functioning of laboratories (iii) face-to-face technical support (iv) license fees. for students to overcome these shortcomings a virtual application pool is needed where they can easily access all the necessary applications via remote access. this research aims to develop a platform-independent virtual laboratory environment for de students. this article has been developed specifically to guide de institutions and to make a positive contribution to the literature. technology acceptance model (tam) has been used to explain student behaviors. ıt was concluded that students using the platform performed more successful grades (12.89%) on laboratory assessments and that the students using the developed platform were found to be more satisfied with the education process.
The COVID-19 pandemic which was reported in early January 2020 in China and spread rapidly around the globe will certainly remain as one of the most impactful disruptive events of the 21st century. To contain the spread of the virus while awaiting a vaccine countries applied different approaches from simply giving advice on personal hygiene and applying progressive measures to total lockdown. This paper aims to investigate the impacts of the pandemic on travel behavior in Istanbul Turkey through a longitudinal panel study conducted in three phases during the early stages of the epidemic and pandemic. The paper reflects the travel behavior evolution during the development of the outbreak resulting from residents' selfregulation and governmental measures distinguishing travel for commute Social/Recreational/Leisure (SRL) and shopping activities as well as use of different travel modes based on various socio-economic characteristics. Due to the application of the social distancing of at least 1.5 m closure of numerous non-essential venues encouraging teleworking and distance education job losses and cancellation of all social gatherings in Istanbul between the second and third phase of our data collection the transition in travel activity pattern and transport mobility appears to be quite extreme particularly for commuting and SRL trips.;2021;the covıd-19 pandemic which was reported in early january 2020 in china and spread rapidly around the globe will certainly remain as one of the most impactful disruptive events of the 21st century. to contain the spread of the virus while awaiting a vaccine countries applied different approaches from simply giving advice on personal hygiene and applying progressive measures to total lockdown. this paper aims to investigate the impacts of the pandemic on travel behavior in ıstanbul turkey through a longitudinal panel study conducted in three phases during the early stages of the epidemic and pandemic. the paper reflects the travel behavior evolution during the development of the outbreak resulting from residents' selfregulation and governmental measures distinguishing travel for commute social/recreational/leisure (srl) and shopping activities as well as use of different travel modes based on various socio-economic characteristics. due to the application of the social distancing of at least 1.5 m closure of numerous non-essential venues encouraging teleworking and distance education job losses and cancellation of all social gatherings in ıstanbul between the second and third phase of our data collection the transition in travel activity pattern and transport mobility appears to be quite extreme particularly for commuting and srl trips.
This study aims to investigate the influence of learners' characteristics on their engagement during online education due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigated learner characteristics included digital literacy self-directed learning motivation for learning and perceived stress. The data were collected from the undergraduate learners and the proposed moderated mediation model was tested. The findings showed that all learner characteristics are significant predictors of online learner engagement. Besides self-directed learning and motivation significantly mediate the relationship between digital literacy and engagement while perceived stress significantly moderates the relationship of digital literacy with self-directed learning but not with motivation for learning.;;this study aims to investigate the influence of learners' characteristics on their engagement during online education due to the covıd-19 pandemic. the investigated learner characteristics included digital literacy self-directed learning motivation for learning and perceived stress. the data were collected from the undergraduate learners and the proposed moderated mediation model was tested. the findings showed that all learner characteristics are significant predictors of online learner engagement. besides self-directed learning and motivation significantly mediate the relationship between digital literacy and engagement while perceived stress significantly moderates the relationship of digital literacy with self-directed learning but not with motivation for learning.

The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of COVID-19 measures on air quality in Turkey. For this investigation a daily mean of PM10 PM2.5 NO2 CO O-3O- and SO2 air pollutant data provided from the measurement stations run by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanisation and the Istanbul and Izmir Metropolitan Municipalities were used. The R program an open-code statistics program was used to generate associated distribution maps using the data obtained. Data for 29 metropolitan cities and the province of Zonguldak where the pandemic measures were first implemented were examined for air quality changes. In evaluating whether the COVID-19 measures have had an impact on the air quality of the 30 given cities two time periods were selected: a period before the COVID-19 measures were implemented (between January 1 and March 15) and the period in which the measures were in force (between March 16 and April 15). In order to take the effects of seasonal conditions on air quality based on the 2020 post-epidemic data into account the average data from 2018 and 2019 were also compared. This study finds that the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic period in the 30 major cities in which most of the Turkish population lives significantly improved the air quality. Assuming that some of the measures taken during the pandemic period will become permanent over time (such as the increase in home working the decrease in air travel thanks to online meetings the widespread use of distance education the change in consumption habits and a reduction of waste) the epidemic period is thought to represent a turning point in increasing global air quality.;;the main objective of this study is to determine the effects of covıd-19 measures on air quality in turkey. for this investigation a daily mean of pm10 pm2.5 no2 co o-3o- and so2 air pollutant data provided from the measurement stations run by the ministry of environment and urbanisation and the ıstanbul and ızmir metropolitan municipalities were used. the r program an open-code statistics program was used to generate associated distribution maps using the data obtained. data for 29 metropolitan cities and the province of zonguldak where the pandemic measures were first implemented were examined for air quality changes. ın evaluating whether the covıd-19 measures have had an impact on the air quality of the 30 given cities two time periods were selected: a period before the covıd-19 measures were implemented (between january 1 and march 15) and the period in which the measures were in force (between march 16 and april 15). ın order to take the effects of seasonal conditions on air quality based on the 2020 post-epidemic data into account the average data from 2018 and 2019 were also compared. this study finds that the restrictions imposed during the covıd-19 pandemic period in the 30 major cities in which most of the turkish population lives significantly improved the air quality. assuming that some of the measures taken during the pandemic period will become permanent over time (such as the increase in home working the decrease in air travel thanks to online meetings the widespread use of distance education the change in consumption habits and a reduction of waste) the epidemic period is thought to represent a turning point in increasing global air quality.
As COVID-19 reached Turkey in March 2020 all universities switched to e-learning in a very short period. Computer and software engineering (CE/SE) undergraduate students studying at university campuses have switched to e-learning. This paper seeks to understand the e-learning experience of CE/SE undergraduate students. A questionnaire was created and applied to CE/SE undergraduate students in Turkish universities. The data were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The questionnaire received 290 usable responses. The highlights from the findings include: the participants (1) used video recordings intensively for e-learning and found them useful (2) found face-to-face lectures more beneficial compared to digital live lectures (3) used external online resources to improve their learning performance in courses (4) thought that the materials and methods utilized for assessment should be adapted to e-learning for a better and fair evaluation (5) perceived significantly less instructor support and classmate interaction and collaboration in e-learning compared to on-campus education settings (6) rated their perceived satisfaction from e-learning as 2.85 slightly under the mid-level of the 5-point Likert scale (7) perceived instructor support student interaction and collaboration and student autonomy as noteworthy factors in high-quality e-learning.;2021;as covıd-19 reached turkey in march 2020 all universities switched to e-learning in a very short period. computer and software engineering (ce/se) undergraduate students studying at university campuses have switched to e-learning. this paper seeks to understand the e-learning experience of ce/se undergraduate students. a questionnaire was created and applied to ce/se undergraduate students in turkish universities. the data were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. the questionnaire received 290 usable responses. the highlights from the findings include: the participants (1) used video recordings intensively for e-learning and found them useful (2) found face-to-face lectures more beneficial compared to digital live lectures (3) used external online resources to improve their learning performance in courses (4) thought that the materials and methods utilized for assessment should be adapted to e-learning for a better and fair evaluation (5) perceived significantly less instructor support and classmate interaction and collaboration in e-learning compared to on-campus education settings (6) rated their perceived satisfaction from e-learning as 2.85 slightly under the mid-level of the 5-point likert scale (7) perceived instructor support student interaction and collaboration and student autonomy as noteworthy factors in high-quality e-learning.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused an emergency transform from traditional to distance learning at all levels of education which is called emergency remote teaching. To explore parents' views on students' experiences of remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic and their experience and perspectives toward remote teaching during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic a questionnaire was developed and distributed to parents who have at least one child who had attended a face-to-face learning environment prior to school closures and started remote teaching during the pandemic. 983 parents participated in the study. The parents' views on students' experiences of remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic their experiences and perspectives toward remote teaching were discussed. The results suggested that the remote teaching process has been challenging for both students and parents. It is found that the remote teaching practices were mainly covered in core courses remote teaching is considered as unsuitable for young children and students with special needs the parents complain about social isolation lack of interactivity and increased screen time and remote teaching has placed a heavy burden on parents. Lastly the parents stated that their children acquired self-regulated learning skills and digital socialization during emergency remote teaching.;2021;the coronavirus disease 2019 (covıd-19) pandemic caused an emergency transform from traditional to distance learning at all levels of education which is called emergency remote teaching. to explore parents' views on students' experiences of remote teaching during the covıd-19 pandemic and their experience and perspectives toward remote teaching during the lockdown of the covıd-19 pandemic a questionnaire was developed and distributed to parents who have at least one child who had attended a face-to-face learning environment prior to school closures and started remote teaching during the pandemic. 983 parents participated in the study. the parents' views on students' experiences of remote teaching during the covıd-19 pandemic their experiences and perspectives toward remote teaching were discussed. the results suggested that the remote teaching process has been challenging for both students and parents. ıt is found that the remote teaching practices were mainly covered in core courses remote teaching is considered as unsuitable for young children and students with special needs the parents complain about social isolation lack of interactivity and increased screen time and remote teaching has placed a heavy burden on parents. lastly the parents stated that their children acquired self-regulated learning skills and digital socialization during emergency remote teaching.
Objectives In 2018 Harvard University provided a 10-week online course titled Improving Global Health: Focusing on Quality and Safety as using Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) web-based platform. The course was designed for those who care about health and healthcare and wish to learn more about how to measure and improve that care - for themselves for their institutions or for their countries. The goal of this course was to provide visual and written education tools for different countries and different age groups. In respect to the aim of this study is to evaluate the impressions and benefits of group learning activity and educational needs after this Improving Global Health courses experience with an online survey among the participants. Methods Sixty-six family medicine practitioners and trainees who were among the participants of the course were the universe of the study. These young General Practitioners/Family Physicians (GPs/FPs) from different countries were organized among themselves to follow the course as a group activity. Two weeks after the course an online survey was sent to all the participants of this group activity. Results Twenty-eight out of 66 participants (42.4%) completed the survey and provided feedback on their perspectives and experience. Most of them were female (70.4%) and have not attended any MOOC course before (63%). This international group achieved a completion rate of approximately 65% by the deadline and nearly 90% including those finishing afterward. The majority felt that the group activity proved beneficial and supportive in nature. Conclusions Well-structured sustainable e-learning platforms will be the near futures' medical learning devices in a world without borders. Future studies should further explore facilitators and barriers among FPs for enrolling and completing MOOCs. Furthermore there is a need to evaluate how these group-learning initiatives may help participants incorporate lessons learned from the course into their daily practice.;;objectives ın 2018 harvard university provided a 10-week online course titled ımproving global health: focusing on quality and safety as using massive online open courses (moocs) web-based platform. the course was designed for those who care about health and healthcare and wish to learn more about how to measure and improve that care - for themselves for their institutions or for their countries. the goal of this course was to provide visual and written education tools for different countries and different age groups. ın respect to the aim of this study is to evaluate the impressions and benefits of group learning activity and educational needs after this ımproving global health courses experience with an online survey among the participants. methods sixty-six family medicine practitioners and trainees who were among the participants of the course were the universe of the study. these young general practitioners/family physicians (gps/fps) from different countries were organized among themselves to follow the course as a group activity. two weeks after the course an online survey was sent to all the participants of this group activity. results twenty-eight out of 66 participants (42.4%) completed the survey and provided feedback on their perspectives and experience. most of them were female (70.4%) and have not attended any mooc course before (63%). this international group achieved a completion rate of approximately 65% by the deadline and nearly 90% including those finishing afterward. the majority felt that the group activity proved beneficial and supportive in nature. conclusions well-structured sustainable e-learning platforms will be the near futures' medical learning devices in a world without borders. future studies should further explore facilitators and barriers among fps for enrolling and completing moocs. furthermore there is a need to evaluate how these group-learning initiatives may help participants incorporate lessons learned from the course into their daily practice.

The aim of the study was to investigate secondary school students' and teachers' access to information technologies in Turkey by making interregional comparisons. Document analysis of the qualitative research methods was employed to analyze the reports issued by the Turkish Ministry of National Education the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The results of the research revealed the importance of access to information and communication technologies for both students and teachers: 67.9% of the participating students were found to have Internet connection and 69.1% a computer in their homes while 80.3% of the students were observed to use a computer outside the school but 19.7% were not. The results also showed that 64.6% of the students have Internet connection in their classrooms but 29.2% of these students do not use the Internet in the classroom whereas 8.9% use it in the classroom all the time. The rate of students using a digital device for reading is 38.1% while that of those not using one is 61.9%. Some 32.1% of secondary school students were revealed not to have Internet connection at home. Additionally 77% of teachers were not trained in online teaching prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the findings teachers can be suggested to develop projects - i.e. of TUBITAK E-twinning and Erasmus - which potentially encourage students to use information and communication technologies so that both teachers and students can benefit from them. It is also suggested that the Ministry of National Education should work on improving the information communication technology competencies of teachers and students. Besides policies should be developed to eliminate regional differences in terms of access to digital resources and technology in terms of equal opportunities and opportunities.;2021;the aim of the study was to investigate secondary school students' and teachers' access to information technologies in turkey by making interregional comparisons. document analysis of the qualitative research methods was employed to analyze the reports issued by the turkish ministry of national education the turkish statistical ınstitute (tuık) and the programme for ınternational student assessment (pısa). the results of the research revealed the importance of access to information and communication technologies for both students and teachers: 67.9% of the participating students were found to have ınternet connection and 69.1% a computer in their homes while 80.3% of the students were observed to use a computer outside the school but 19.7% were not. the results also showed that 64.6% of the students have ınternet connection in their classrooms but 29.2% of these students do not use the ınternet in the classroom whereas 8.9% use it in the classroom all the time. the rate of students using a digital device for reading is 38.1% while that of those not using one is 61.9%. some 32.1% of secondary school students were revealed not to have ınternet connection at home. additionally 77% of teachers were not trained in online teaching prior to the covıd-19 pandemic. based on the findings teachers can be suggested to develop projects - i.e. of tubıtak e-twinning and erasmus - which potentially encourage students to use information and communication technologies so that both teachers and students can benefit from them. ıt is also suggested that the ministry of national education should work on improving the information communication technology competencies of teachers and students. besides policies should be developed to eliminate regional differences in terms of access to digital resources and technology in terms of equal opportunities and opportunities.
While we have been looking for alternative educational materials for our undergraduate students we found ourself in Covid-19 pandemic and had to think postgraduate education. On the first day of restrictions our major problem was to learn and find the best communication tool. The first experiences for online meetings were boring we were not feeling our emotions but as days past we got used to it. We all understand the importance of having alternatives and have to be ready for second choices. During those challenging days all had more time to work on our completed data time to write complete the proofreading of written materials. Other vital scientific activities for career development and profile building such as reading (every meeting with new articles/reviews) publishing and preparing oral presentation were fully completed during the online meetings as a part of lab meeting activities. They learned to improve communication skills be active participants and fight.;2021;while we have been looking for alternative educational materials for our undergraduate students we found ourself in covid-19 pandemic and had to think postgraduate education. on the first day of restrictions our major problem was to learn and find the best communication tool. the first experiences for online meetings were boring we were not feeling our emotions but as days past we got used to it. we all understand the importance of having alternatives and have to be ready for second choices. during those challenging days all had more time to work on our completed data time to write complete the proofreading of written materials. other vital scientific activities for career development and profile building such as reading (every meeting with new articles/reviews) publishing and preparing oral presentation were fully completed during the online meetings as a part of lab meeting activities. they learned to improve communication skills be active participants and fight.
The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a rapid transition from face-to-face to distance learning. The problems caused by this rapid transition are combined with the negative psychological outcomes of the pandemic leading to numerous problems and difficulties in the teaching and learning processes. The recentness of these issues and developments requires detailed investigation as to how they affect distance learning. This study aims to investigate the role of psycho-demographic variables in the motivation and attendance of higher education students in distance education within the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this descriptive study we collected data from 1494 Turkish university students via an online survey. Quantitative data were analysed using correlation analysis t test one-way ANOVA multiple linear regression analysis and structural equation modelling. Stress anxiety depression and intolerance of uncertainty were correlated negatively with distance learning motivation and frequency of distance learning attendance. While students who attended distance learning only synchronously joined the courses more frequently the motivation of those who joined the courses sometimes synchronously and sometimes asynchronously was higher. The strength of the relationships between intolerance of uncertainty and distance learning motivation was significantly increased via anxiety and depression. Findings highlight the need for analysis of psycho-demographic variables while designing and implementing distance education programmes. Psychological variables including stress anxiety and depression are related to motivation and attendance during distance education. While using both synchronous and asynchronous distance learning enhances motivation synchronous learning increases attendance.;2021;the covid-19 pandemic has led to a rapid transition from face-to-face to distance learning. the problems caused by this rapid transition are combined with the negative psychological outcomes of the pandemic leading to numerous problems and difficulties in the teaching and learning processes. the recentness of these issues and developments requires detailed investigation as to how they affect distance learning. this study aims to investigate the role of psycho-demographic variables in the motivation and attendance of higher education students in distance education within the context of the covid-19 pandemic. ın this descriptive study we collected data from 1494 turkish university students via an online survey. quantitative data were analysed using correlation analysis t test one-way anova multiple linear regression analysis and structural equation modelling. stress anxiety depression and intolerance of uncertainty were correlated negatively with distance learning motivation and frequency of distance learning attendance. while students who attended distance learning only synchronously joined the courses more frequently the motivation of those who joined the courses sometimes synchronously and sometimes asynchronously was higher. the strength of the relationships between intolerance of uncertainty and distance learning motivation was significantly increased via anxiety and depression. findings highlight the need for analysis of psycho-demographic variables while designing and implementing distance education programmes. psychological variables including stress anxiety and depression are related to motivation and attendance during distance education. while using both synchronous and asynchronous distance learning enhances motivation synchronous learning increases attendance.
E-learning studies are becoming very important today as they provide alternatives and support to all types of teaching and learning programs. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on educational systems has further increased the significance of e-learning. Accordingly gaining a full understanding of the general topics and trends in e-learning studies is critical for a deeper comprehension of the field. There are many studies that provide such a picture of the e-learning field but the limitation is that they do not examine the field as a whole. This study aimed to investigate the emerging trends in the e-learning field by implementing a topic modeling analysis based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on 41925 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2019. The analysis revealed 16 topics reflecting emerging trends and developments in the e-learning field. Among these the topics MOOC learning assessment and elearning systems were found to be key topics in the field with a consistently high volume. In addition the topics of learning algorithms learning factors and adaptive learning were observed to have the highest overall acceleration with the first two identified as having a higher acceleration in recent years. Going by these results it is concluded that the next decade of e-learning studies will focus on learning factors and algorithms which will possibly create a baseline for more individualized and adaptive mobile platforms. In other words after a certain maturity level is reached by better understanding the learning process through these identified learning factors and algorithms the next generation of e-learning systems will be built on individualized and adaptive learning environments. These insights could be useful for e-learning communities to improve their research efforts and their applications in the field accordingly.;2021;e-learning studies are becoming very important today as they provide alternatives and support to all types of teaching and learning programs. the effect of the covıd-19 pandemic on educational systems has further increased the significance of e-learning. accordingly gaining a full understanding of the general topics and trends in e-learning studies is critical for a deeper comprehension of the field. there are many studies that provide such a picture of the e-learning field but the limitation is that they do not examine the field as a whole. this study aimed to investigate the emerging trends in the e-learning field by implementing a topic modeling analysis based on latent dirichlet allocation (lda) on 41925 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2019. the analysis revealed 16 topics reflecting emerging trends and developments in the e-learning field. among these the topics mooc learning assessment and elearning systems were found to be key topics in the field with a consistently high volume. ın addition the topics of learning algorithms learning factors and adaptive learning were observed to have the highest overall acceleration with the first two identified as having a higher acceleration in recent years. going by these results it is concluded that the next decade of e-learning studies will focus on learning factors and algorithms which will possibly create a baseline for more individualized and adaptive mobile platforms. ın other words after a certain maturity level is reached by better understanding the learning process through these identified learning factors and algorithms the next generation of e-learning systems will be built on individualized and adaptive learning environments. these insights could be useful for e-learning communities to improve their research efforts and their applications in the field accordingly.

This paper reports the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the practice and delivery of geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering (GGE) education modules including lectures lab sessions student assessments and research activities based on the feedback from faculty members in 14 countries/regions around the world. Faculty members have since adopted a series of contingent measures to enhance teaching and learning experience during the pandemic which includes facilitating active learning exploring new teaching content related to public health expanding e-learning resources implementing more engaged and student-centred assessment and delivering high-impact integrated education and research. The key challenges that faculty members are facing appear to be how to maximise the flexibility of learning and meet physical distancing requirements without compromising learning outcomes education equity and interpersonal interactions in the traditional face-to-face teaching. Despite the challenges imposed by the pandemic this could also be a good opportunity for faculty members obliged to lecture to rethink and revise the existing contents and approaches of professing GGE education. Three future opportunities namely smart learning flipped learning and interdisciplinary education are identified. The changes could potentially provide students with a more resilient engaged interactive and technology-based learning environment.;2021;this paper reports the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the practice and delivery of geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering (gge) education modules including lectures lab sessions student assessments and research activities based on the feedback from faculty members in 14 countries/regions around the world. faculty members have since adopted a series of contingent measures to enhance teaching and learning experience during the pandemic which includes facilitating active learning exploring new teaching content related to public health expanding e-learning resources implementing more engaged and student-centred assessment and delivering high-impact integrated education and research. the key challenges that faculty members are facing appear to be how to maximise the flexibility of learning and meet physical distancing requirements without compromising learning outcomes education equity and interpersonal interactions in the traditional face-to-face teaching. despite the challenges imposed by the pandemic this could also be a good opportunity for faculty members obliged to lecture to rethink and revise the existing contents and approaches of professing gge education. three future opportunities namely smart learning flipped learning and interdisciplinary education are identified. the changes could potentially provide students with a more resilient engaged interactive and technology-based learning environment.
Many governments decided to cancel face-to-face teaching and learning activities in schools and universities. They replaced them with online teaching and distance learning activities to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to this sudden change students experienced some anthropometric environmental and psychosocial difficulties at home during the distance learning process. This study focuses on determining the importance of anthropometric environmental and psychosocial factors in the distance learning process during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study presents main factors and their subfactors affecting ergonomic conditions of university students during distance learning. A novel distance learning ergonomics checklist is proposed based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration checklists. The data are collected via a questionnaire filled by 100 university students who attend the Ergonomics course online. Then the integrated methodology includes Voting Analytic Hierarchy Process integrated Pythagorean Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to An Ideal Solution method is adopted to prioritize the factors determined. Thirty-nine different subfactors are evaluated under five titles and the most important factors are determined using the proposed methodology. With the results achieved it is seen that the suggested checklist and proposed methodology can be used by public and private education organizations as a guide for improving their distance learning strategies.;2021;many governments decided to cancel face-to-face teaching and learning activities in schools and universities. they replaced them with online teaching and distance learning activities to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (covıd-19). due to this sudden change students experienced some anthropometric environmental and psychosocial difficulties at home during the distance learning process. this study focuses on determining the importance of anthropometric environmental and psychosocial factors in the distance learning process during the covıd-19 pandemic. this study presents main factors and their subfactors affecting ergonomic conditions of university students during distance learning. a novel distance learning ergonomics checklist is proposed based on the occupational safety and health administration checklists. the data are collected via a questionnaire filled by 100 university students who attend the ergonomics course online. then the integrated methodology includes voting analytic hierarchy process integrated pythagorean fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ıdeal solution method is adopted to prioritize the factors determined. thirty-nine different subfactors are evaluated under five titles and the most important factors are determined using the proposed methodology. with the results achieved it is seen that the suggested checklist and proposed methodology can be used by public and private education organizations as a guide for improving their distance learning strategies.
Purpose Traditional anatomy education (TAE) is based on teaching by seeing and touching cadavers/plastic materials that enable three-dimensional thinking but there was no opportunity like this in distance anatomy education (DAE). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 many trainings planned face-to-face were carried out remotely. In this study our aim is to evaluate students' views on the efficiency of DAE and to increase the efficiency of DAE in the future. Methods The questionnaire used in the study was applied to the first grade students in the Faculty of Medicine at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University in 2019-2020. 239 students completed the survey. The questionnaire consisted of the demographic information that was obtained with voluntary consent and sections containing suggestions on DAE and its comparison with distance education of other basic medical science courses. The survey was prepared as a Likert scale (with 1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree) on Google forms and sent to the students online. Results 82.4% of the students marked totally disagree or disagree for the statement of DAE is more efficient than TAE. The total percentage of students who marked totally disagree or disagree for the statement of I was satisfied with the theoretical education in DAE was 58.6% but when it came to practical education the percentage raised to 79.9%. Conclusions According to the results the efficiency of DAE especially in terms of practice lessons was found to be lower than TAE.

Background Clinical training during the COVID-19 pandemic is high risk for medical students. Medical schools in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have limited capacity to develop resources in the face of rapidly developing health emergencies. Here a free Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) was developed as a COVID-19 resource for medical students working in these settings and its effectiveness was evaluated. Methods The RE-AIM (reach effectiveness adoption implementation and maintenance) framework was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of MOOC in teaching medical students about COVID-19. The data sources included the student registration forms metrics quantifying their interactions within the modules students' course feedback and free-text responses. The data were collected from the Moodle learning management system and Google analytics from May 9 to September 15 2020.

This qualitative study aims to examine teachers' opinions concerning the middle school curricula that have been in use for years in order to determine its suitability for distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants consisted of eighteen middle school teachers from different subject areas in Turkey. A maximum variation sampling method was employed for participant selection. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews. Due to the pandemic the interviews were conducted using video conferencing applications. The data was analyzed through content analysis. According to the findings the teachers report that while they are effective in achieving cognitive objectives they have difficulties in achieving affective and psychomotor objectives. In addition the teachers do not prefer to design their own materials rather they mainly benefit from ready-to-use materials during emergency distance education. The teachers also reveal that direct instruction and questioning were the teaching methods and techniques they preferred in online courses and that they were unable to adapt other methods and techniques to distance education which resulted in students experiencing teacher-centered activities. Moreover the teachers complain about students not attending the online courses on time or even at all their disinterest a lack of instant feedback limited communication with students and insufficient course lengths. Another critical finding was that the teachers only use homework end-of-unit quizzes and participation to online courses as measurement and evaluation tools and agree that they are unable to administer reliable and valid evaluation tools. The limitations of the study and implications for future research are later discussed.;2021;this qualitative study aims to examine teachers' opinions concerning the middle school curricula that have been in use for years in order to determine its suitability for distance education during the covıd-19 pandemic. the participants consisted of eighteen middle school teachers from different subject areas in turkey. a maximum variation sampling method was employed for participant selection. the data was collected through semi-structured interviews. due to the pandemic the interviews were conducted using video conferencing applications. the data was analyzed through content analysis. according to the findings the teachers report that while they are effective in achieving cognitive objectives they have difficulties in achieving affective and psychomotor objectives. ın addition the teachers do not prefer to design their own materials rather they mainly benefit from ready-to-use materials during emergency distance education. the teachers also reveal that direct instruction and questioning were the teaching methods and techniques they preferred in online courses and that they were unable to adapt other methods and techniques to distance education which resulted in students experiencing teacher-centered activities. moreover the teachers complain about students not attending the online courses on time or even at all their disinterest a lack of instant feedback limited communication with students and insufficient course lengths. another critical finding was that the teachers only use homework end-of-unit quizzes and participation to online courses as measurement and evaluation tools and agree that they are unable to administer reliable and valid evaluation tools. the limitations of the study and implications for future research are later discussed.
Learning analytics is quickly evolving. Old fashioned dashboards with descriptive information and trends about what happened in the past are slightly substituted by new dashboards with forecasting information and predicting relevant outcomes about learning. Artificial intelligence is aiding this revolution. The accessibility to computational resources has increased and specific tools and packages for integrating artificial intelligence techniques leverage such new analytical tools. However it is crucial to develop trustworthy systems especially in education where skepticism about their application is due to the risk of teachers' replacement. However artificial intelligence systems should be seen as companions to empower teachers during the teaching and learning process. During the past years the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya has advanced developing a data mart where all data about learners and campus utilization are stored for research purposes. The extensive collection of these educational data has been used to build a trustworthy early warning system whose infrastructure is introduced in this paper. The infrastructure supports such a trustworthy system built with artificial intelligence procedures to detect at-risk learners early on in order to help them to pass the course. To assess the system's trustworthiness we carried out an evaluation on the basis of the seven requirements of the European Assessment List for trustworthy artificial intelligence (ALTAI) guidelines that recognize an artificial intelligence system as a trustworthy one. Results show that it is feasible to build a trustworthy system wherein all seven ALTAI requirements are considered at once from the very beginning during the design phase.;2021;learning analytics is quickly evolving. old fashioned dashboards with descriptive information and trends about what happened in the past are slightly substituted by new dashboards with forecasting information and predicting relevant outcomes about learning. artificial intelligence is aiding this revolution. the accessibility to computational resources has increased and specific tools and packages for integrating artificial intelligence techniques leverage such new analytical tools. however it is crucial to develop trustworthy systems especially in education where skepticism about their application is due to the risk of teachers' replacement. however artificial intelligence systems should be seen as companions to empower teachers during the teaching and learning process. during the past years the universitat oberta de catalunya has advanced developing a data mart where all data about learners and campus utilization are stored for research purposes. the extensive collection of these educational data has been used to build a trustworthy early warning system whose infrastructure is introduced in this paper. the infrastructure supports such a trustworthy system built with artificial intelligence procedures to detect at-risk learners early on in order to help them to pass the course. to assess the system's trustworthiness we carried out an evaluation on the basis of the seven requirements of the european assessment list for trustworthy artificial intelligence (altaı) guidelines that recognize an artificial intelligence system as a trustworthy one. results show that it is feasible to build a trustworthy system wherein all seven altaı requirements are considered at once from the very beginning during the design phase.

With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the world the vast majority of students in various educational institutions around the world have changed their learning styles from the physical classroom to digital learning education. Especially the fact that university students take their lessons with e-learning in times of crisis (COVID-19 pandemic) has forced them to spend more time with the computer. This situation will also affect their academic motivation. This research aimed to test whether the fear of contracting COVID-19 (CoVFC) had a moderating effect on the prediction of preservice teachers' academic motivation (AMOTV) with their computer self-efficacy perceptions (CSE). With a combined approach a single model was employed to test the moderating role of CoVFC and the mediating role of Attitudes towards E-Learning (ATEL) in the prediction of preservice teachers' AMOTV with their CSE. 522 preservice teachers from 21 different branches participated in this research. As a result of the research the CSE of preservice teachers were determined to predict their AMOTV significantly and positively. The increase in CoVFC was found to have a negative moderating effect on the prediction of AMOTV with the CSE of preservice teachers. Also ATEL was found to have a partial mediating effect in the relationship between the CSE and AMOTV of preservice teachers.;;with the covıd-19 pandemic affecting the world the vast majority of students in various educational institutions around the world have changed their learning styles from the physical classroom to digital learning education. especially the fact that university students take their lessons with e-learning in times of crisis (covıd-19 pandemic) has forced them to spend more time with the computer. this situation will also affect their academic motivation. this research aimed to test whether the fear of contracting covıd-19 (covfc) had a moderating effect on the prediction of preservice teachers' academic motivation (amotv) with their computer self-efficacy perceptions (cse). with a combined approach a single model was employed to test the moderating role of covfc and the mediating role of attitudes towards e-learning (atel) in the prediction of preservice teachers' amotv with their cse. 522 preservice teachers from 21 different branches participated in this research. as a result of the research the cse of preservice teachers were determined to predict their amotv significantly and positively. the increase in covfc was found to have a negative moderating effect on the prediction of amotv with the cse of preservice teachers. also atel was found to have a partial mediating effect in the relationship between the cse and amotv of preservice teachers.
Recent developments in educational technology have led to a renewed interest in the utilisation of user-generated microgames for facilitating learning. The advantages and disadvantages of microgames which have been voluntarily created modified shared and used by users on open learning platforms to support learning are not yet clearly understood. The present study explores the strengths and weaknesses of user-generated microgames for assisting learning followed with some recommendations for the development and effective use of microgames from elementary teacher perspectives. This study is exploratory research conducted within the GeoGebra application with the participation of elementary school teachers from Indonesia. The study found that on the one hand user-generated microgames have multiple advantages to support learning mainly by their simplicity and short duration gameplay. On the other hand the games have several disadvantages especially due to the lack of content directly related to learning objectives and less interesting interfaces. It is recommended for users of open learning platforms to create more targeted microgames respecting a particular learning objective and for teachers to creatively connect games to learning for mastering knowledge skills or literacies.;;recent developments in educational technology have led to a renewed interest in the utilisation of user-generated microgames for facilitating learning. the advantages and disadvantages of microgames which have been voluntarily created modified shared and used by users on open learning platforms to support learning are not yet clearly understood. the present study explores the strengths and weaknesses of user-generated microgames for assisting learning followed with some recommendations for the development and effective use of microgames from elementary teacher perspectives. this study is exploratory research conducted within the geogebra application with the participation of elementary school teachers from ındonesia. the study found that on the one hand user-generated microgames have multiple advantages to support learning mainly by their simplicity and short duration gameplay. on the other hand the games have several disadvantages especially due to the lack of content directly related to learning objectives and less interesting interfaces. ıt is recommended for users of open learning platforms to create more targeted microgames respecting a particular learning objective and for teachers to creatively connect games to learning for mastering knowledge skills or literacies.
The qualification of a preschool teacher is one of the important factors that determine the quality of preschool education. To increase the quality in education teachers should be equipped with the necessary knowledge starting from pre-service training and in-service training should support the upgrading of their knowledge. Thus the aim of this study was to develop an e-Mentoring-Based Education Program (e-MENTE:PT) for preschool teachers and to test its effectiveness on their professional development during the in-service support period. The study used a design-based research approach. First focus group interviews were conducted with one-hundred-and-five preschool teachers to find out their needs. Then an e-MENTE:PT Program was developed based on these needs and devised to be used on the Canvas learning management system (LMS) which involves all opportunities of e-learning and allows one-to-one e-mentoring. The e-MENTE:PT Program involved twelve modules related to the pedagogical content knowledge of the preschool education program. Each module included contents goals module materials e-books videos pre- and post-module evaluation questions discussion questions live lessons and e-portfolios all of which were integrated in the LMS. Next eighteen full-time and nine substitute voluntary teachers from five different provinces were selected as mentees by means of criterion sampling. Nine academicians working in these provinces acted as mentors and implemented the application each working with two mentees for two months. Qualitative data were analysed by means of descriptive analysis and quantitative data were analysed by means of the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The research concluded that the e-MENTE:PT program supported preschool teachers' professional knowledge learning environments and classroom applications and an e-mentoring based teaching management system was effective on professional development.;;the qualification of a preschool teacher is one of the important factors that determine the quality of preschool education. to increase the quality in education teachers should be equipped with the necessary knowledge starting from pre-service training and in-service training should support the upgrading of their knowledge. thus the aim of this study was to develop an e-mentoring-based education program (e-mente:pt) for preschool teachers and to test its effectiveness on their professional development during the in-service support period. the study used a design-based research approach. first focus group interviews were conducted with one-hundred-and-five preschool teachers to find out their needs. then an e-mente:pt program was developed based on these needs and devised to be used on the canvas learning management system (lms) which involves all opportunities of e-learning and allows one-to-one e-mentoring. the e-mente:pt program involved twelve modules related to the pedagogical content knowledge of the preschool education program. each module included contents goals module materials e-books videos pre- and post-module evaluation questions discussion questions live lessons and e-portfolios all of which were integrated in the lms. next eighteen full-time and nine substitute voluntary teachers from five different provinces were selected as mentees by means of criterion sampling. nine academicians working in these provinces acted as mentors and implemented the application each working with two mentees for two months. qualitative data were analysed by means of descriptive analysis and quantitative data were analysed by means of the wilcoxon signed rank test. the research concluded that the e-mente:pt program supported preschool teachers' professional knowledge learning environments and classroom applications and an e-mentoring based teaching management system was effective on professional development.

Background There are major changes in education strategies as higher education institutions urgently need to adopt distance education tools and practices due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Medical education is also trying to get out of this emergency using distance education. In this study we aimed to develop a reliable and valid scale in order to evaluate the perceptions of medical students towards distance education. Methods The students taking part in the study were in the first five academic years of the medical faculty in Bursa in Turkey. At first 57 items were determined to evaluate students' perceptions. Content validity was examined according to the assessment of the expert team. Construct validity of these items was examined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Also Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated for reliability analysis. The medical students' responses were scored using a five-point Likert scale. Results When the content validity was examined the number of items was determined to be 38 items. Construct validity of these items was examined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Because of the exploratory factor analysis performed on the responses of 429 medical students 22 items were included in four factors. This four-factor model was applied to 286 medical students and validated by confirmatory factor analysis. Also Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated for reliability analysis and values were between 0.713 and 0.930. Conclusions This study demonstrated validation and reliability of perceptions of distance education for medical students.

Purpose The aim of the study was to assess the quality of videos on YouTube as educational resources for patients and physicians about blepharoplastic surgery. Methods This study is a retrospective and cross-sectional study. A YouTube search for the term blepharoplasty was made and the first 210 videos were recorded (all video searches were done by clearing all search history without any user login). The number of views likes and dislikes upload time (i.e. age) of all videos video duration and source (i.e. physicians non-physicians) were recorded. The video uploader physicians healthcare provider health-related channels were gathered in a group. Video sources were evaluated as physician and non-physician. The DISCERN Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and Global Quality scores of all videos were also evaluated and recorded by two experienced oculoplastic surgeons. Results Considering our exclusion criteria from 210 videos we evaluated 186 videos were included in the study. 147 (79%) of these videos were uploaded by physicians and 39 (21%) by non-physicians users. The total viewing average was 69548 +/- 14533. The average length (min) of all videos was 7.59 +/- 8.75 min. The average of total likes was 301.72 +/- 578.89 dislike was 28.47 +/- 68.90. The mean DISCERN score was 45.06 +/- 12.88 (fair quality) the mean JAMA score was 1.39 +/- 1.06 (poor quality) and the mean Global Quality score was 2.39 +/- 1.03 (intermediate quality). DISCERN JAMA GQS scores were statistically significant between videos uploaded by physicians and non-physicians (p<0.001). Conclusions As a result of the videos reviewed YouTube videos can be educational and informative for patients and physicians. Only if the video source and content are selected correctly.

The educational transformation of flipped classroom continues to be the important approach to increasing students' readiness for flipped learning. To successfully implement the flipped classroom students' readiness to use the materials delivered to them in the pre-class session and parent-school involvement should be part of the process to improve this student-centered learning approach. However little is known concerning the assessment of students' readiness to learn through the WBI in a flipped classroom and the role of parent-school involvement in student-centered learning approach. Hence this study aims to extend the UTAUT model by considering the experience expectancy parent-school involvement perceived behaviour control and perceived self-efficacy factors to investigate high school students' acceptance of WBI for flipped classroom (FC) approach. A total of 320 senior high school students in English Literature class were selected for the study using structured equation modelling to analyse the survey questionnaire data. The results revealed that performance expectancy effort expectancy parent-school involvement perceived self-efficacy and experience expectancy have positive influence on students' behavioural intention to use WBI. Also this current study identified that the perceived behavioral control has an insignificant effect on students' behavioral intention to use WBI for FC approach.

In the COVID-19 pandemic period most students felt lonely accordingly their motivation for self-learning was low. The study aimed to increase their enthusiasm for work and to improve their learning of biochemical subjects in the medical education programme during the pandemic period. Small parts of educational materials (microlearning) were presented in different formats such as videos interactive education exercises game-based quizzes and final exam was taken. The achievement of learning objectives of the course was evaluated by a survey. Students participating in daily activities gained higher self-confidence in learning and their final exam grade was higher compared to non-participating students (7.35 +/- 1.37 vs 7.06 +/- 1.88 p = 0.038). Most of the students agreed that daily activities (52%) increased their motivation to work. This approach might be proposed as a practice that supports distance learning or even traditional education especially in medical education that includes complex issues.;;ın the covıd-19 pandemic period most students felt lonely accordingly their motivation for self-learning was low. the study aimed to increase their enthusiasm for work and to improve their learning of biochemical subjects in the medical education programme during the pandemic period. small parts of educational materials (microlearning) were presented in different formats such as videos interactive education exercises game-based quizzes and final exam was taken. the achievement of learning objectives of the course was evaluated by a survey. students participating in daily activities gained higher self-confidence in learning and their final exam grade was higher compared to non-participating students (7.35 +/- 1.37 vs 7.06 +/- 1.88 p = 0.038). most of the students agreed that daily activities (52%) increased their motivation to work. this approach might be proposed as a practice that supports distance learning or even traditional education especially in medical education that includes complex issues.
The use of personalised learning environments (PLEs) and adaptive learning environments (ALEs) in education has increased during the COVID-2019 pandemic. Thus the need of effective and high-quality PLEs and ALEs has emerged but developing such learning environments has some difficulties such as the need for a huge number of qualified e-contents. Generation of e-contents for these systems is a time-consuming and costly process. Moreover presenting the same e-content for each student is not effective because each student can have different intelligence type. To overcome these problems low cost reusable and dynamic e-contents can be used for PLE and ALE systems. For this purpose fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was used to provide sequenced e-contents for PLE and ALE systems. This proposed system was used in a case study to investigate its impact on learning process. The performance of the proposed study was compared with analytical hierarchy process (AHP) which is another multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method also further statistical analyses were investigated. The results showed that 84.6% of students showed interest in the proposed system so the FAHP method can be used for presenting personalised e-content effectively.;2021;the use of personalised learning environments (ples) and adaptive learning environments (ales) in education has increased during the covıd-2019 pandemic. thus the need of effective and high-quality ples and ales has emerged but developing such learning environments has some difficulties such as the need for a huge number of qualified e-contents. generation of e-contents for these systems is a time-consuming and costly process. moreover presenting the same e-content for each student is not effective because each student can have different intelligence type. to overcome these problems low cost reusable and dynamic e-contents can be used for ple and ale systems. for this purpose fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fahp) was used to provide sequenced e-contents for ple and ale systems. this proposed system was used in a case study to investigate its impact on learning process. the performance of the proposed study was compared with analytical hierarchy process (ahp) which is another multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) method also further statistical analyses were investigated. the results showed that 84.6% of students showed interest in the proposed system so the fahp method can be used for presenting personalised e-content effectively.
This study presents a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of technology to develop critical thinking (CT). This review analyzed 57 publications from 2010 to 2020. With an inductive content analysis the study reached the themes related to the educational processes followed to develop technology-supported CT the characteristics of the technological tools used the findings obtained in terms of CT and the difficulties experienced in the implementations. The findings indicate that studies to develop CT mostly use writing-based practices through Web 2.00 tools. The study observed that technological tools are properly integrated into the Web-based Learning approach. The practices in the studies include a number of dimensions such as the roles the teacher's undertake according to their learning and teaching understanding educational environment implementation periods and types of education depending on how the educational process works. Themes such as accessibility technique insufficient experience in regards to prior learning social anxiety student resistance and mental fatigue emerged as the difficulties reported resulting from technological applications. This review evaluated the development of CT with skill disposition dimensions and CT indicators through the studies examined. The results of this study are valuable in terms of providing a perspective on what is necessary to develop CT by revealing the characteristics of studies that integrate technology into the learning environment. However the number of studies examining students' CT development in the first and early childhood periods is relatively low compared to other educational levels. Therefore there is a need for more research related to the technological applications of early CT development in future studies.;2021;this study presents a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of technology to develop critical thinking (ct). this review analyzed 57 publications from 2010 to 2020. with an inductive content analysis the study reached the themes related to the educational processes followed to develop technology-supported ct the characteristics of the technological tools used the findings obtained in terms of ct and the difficulties experienced in the implementations. the findings indicate that studies to develop ct mostly use writing-based practices through web 2.00 tools. the study observed that technological tools are properly integrated into the web-based learning approach. the practices in the studies include a number of dimensions such as the roles the teacher's undertake according to their learning and teaching understanding educational environment implementation periods and types of education depending on how the educational process works. themes such as accessibility technique insufficient experience in regards to prior learning social anxiety student resistance and mental fatigue emerged as the difficulties reported resulting from technological applications. this review evaluated the development of ct with skill disposition dimensions and ct indicators through the studies examined. the results of this study are valuable in terms of providing a perspective on what is necessary to develop ct by revealing the characteristics of studies that integrate technology into the learning environment. however the number of studies examining students' ct development in the first and early childhood periods is relatively low compared to other educational levels. therefore there is a need for more research related to the technological applications of early ct development in future studies.
Algorithms taken in the first year of university is one of the core courses of the computer science department. Traditional learning systems have some restrictions as they are teacher class and time-based. However distance education is one of the popular concepts of today since it has the flexibility of time and choice of location. Mobile learning which is a subbranch of distance education provides users opportunities to learn through educational mobile applications. In the present study an application to run on smart devices running the IOS operating system for engineering students to be used in supporting the basic algorithm education is described. The student can both get theoretical knowledge about concepts of algorithms and test himself/herself with questions in the question bank. There are three types of questions such as multiple-choice true/false and flowchart designed by the dragging-and-dropping method. The main contribution of this application is that the users can design a flowchart from beginning to end on screen by locating any flowchart components provided on the palette. They also have the opportunity to check their own solutions according to the inserted questions and answers in the database. The application was tested on a group of computer engineering undergraduate students from Mus Alparslan University. In that case the application is evaluated by both an exam and user surveys. The results of the exam show that the presented application had a positive effect on students' success. Besides the outcomes of the surveys have also given positive feedback.;;algorithms taken in the first year of university is one of the core courses of the computer science department. traditional learning systems have some restrictions as they are teacher class and time-based. however distance education is one of the popular concepts of today since it has the flexibility of time and choice of location. mobile learning which is a subbranch of distance education provides users opportunities to learn through educational mobile applications. ın the present study an application to run on smart devices running the ıos operating system for engineering students to be used in supporting the basic algorithm education is described. the student can both get theoretical knowledge about concepts of algorithms and test himself/herself with questions in the question bank. there are three types of questions such as multiple-choice true/false and flowchart designed by the dragging-and-dropping method. the main contribution of this application is that the users can design a flowchart from beginning to end on screen by locating any flowchart components provided on the palette. they also have the opportunity to check their own solutions according to the inserted questions and answers in the database. the application was tested on a group of computer engineering undergraduate students from mus alparslan university. ın that case the application is evaluated by both an exam and user surveys. the results of the exam show that the presented application had a positive effect on students' success. besides the outcomes of the surveys have also given positive feedback.

One of the objectives of this research is to develop and validate the Instructional Material Motivation Scale for Single-Use (IMMS-SU) instrument in the Turkish context. The IMMS-SU was developed and validated in a two-phased process on a sample of 1654 students. The Exploratory Factor Analysis revealed that IMMS-SU included 14 items (chi 2 = 332.59 sd = 74 p < 0.001) the fitness indices were found to be RMSEA = .077 SRMR = .040 AGFI = .88 NFI = .95 CFI = .96 and GFI = .92. The Cronbach's Alpha coefficients regarding the whole scale was calculated as alpha = 0.95. Thereafter in the second study the animated and interactive video materials used in distance education were scrutinized in the context of openness to different materials time spent viewing motivation and cognitive load. A total of 933 students participated who had a distance education experience. In order to collect data the extraneous cognitive load instrument (Kalyuga et al. Human Factors 40(1) 1-17 Kalyuga S.

This study undertook a bibliometric mapping analysis of research papers on Open Educational Practices (OEP) in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. This study functions as a guide for new research serving to identify trends in the OEP field and compare the existing research so as to identify gaps and promising future paths. A total of 635 studies were obtained however only 156 were finally selected for the analysis. VOSviewer software was used to identify the most frequently used keywords and terms in the abstracts and titles. This software was also used to analyse the studies for co-authorship and citations. The findings showed that research on OEP started in 2007 and focused on higher education including open and distance higher education. Most of the OEP studies were published in English as journal articles in particular many were published in Distance Education International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning and Open Praxis. The United Kingdom Spain and Australia were the top contributors to the OEP literature. The analysis of keywords and terms in the titles and abstracts revealed that current OEP trends covered only open pedagogy and open collaboration suggesting a need for more research on other trends such as open assessment open data and open science. The results also suggested that future research needs to focus more on inclusive open educational practices that accommodate students with disabilities.;2021;this study undertook a bibliometric mapping analysis of research papers on open educational practices (oep) in the web of science and scopus databases. this study functions as a guide for new research serving to identify trends in the oep field and compare the existing research so as to identify gaps and promising future paths. a total of 635 studies were obtained however only 156 were finally selected for the analysis. vosviewer software was used to identify the most frequently used keywords and terms in the abstracts and titles. this software was also used to analyse the studies for co-authorship and citations. the findings showed that research on oep started in 2007 and focused on higher education including open and distance higher education. most of the oep studies were published in english as journal articles in particular many were published in distance education ınternational review of research in open and distributed learning and open praxis. the united kingdom spain and australia were the top contributors to the oep literature. the analysis of keywords and terms in the titles and abstracts revealed that current oep trends covered only open pedagogy and open collaboration suggesting a need for more research on other trends such as open assessment open data and open science. the results also suggested that future research needs to focus more on inclusive open educational practices that accommodate students with disabilities.
Introduction: Paramedic students should have the crucial cognitive and psychomotor skills related to neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (N-CPR). Study Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of blended learning on the theoretical knowledge and preliminary knowledge of the psychomotor skills adherence to the algorithm and teamwork in simulation-based education (SBE) of N-CPR. Methods: This randomized prospective study was conducted on 60 fourth-semester paramedic students. The participants were separated into two groups following a classroom lecture. Each group was assigned either a slide presentation (Group 1 SP-G) or a video clip (Group 2 V-G). All the participants answered multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and each group (Group 1 and Group 2) was divided into 10 sub-groups. These sub-groups were then tested in an observational performance evaluation (OPE) consisting of a neonatal asphyxia megacode scenario after the classroom lecture and following the blended learning process. Results: Group performance teamwork communication skills and adherence to the algorithm were evaluated. There was a significant difference in the MCQ and OPE results between the after classroom lecture and after blended learning for both groups. The average score of Group 2 was higher than Group 1 in the MCQ results (Mann-Whitney U test P <.001). The average score of Group 2 was higher than Group 1 in the OPE results (Mann-Whitney U test P = .002).

COVID-19 pandemic triggered distance education in higher education. Decisions such as isolation social distancing and quarantine made by countries unexpectedly and suddenly forced face-to-face education to change to distance education within days. All academics around the world had to move online overnight. All the educational and academic activities in higher education (courses exams meetings etc.) had to be conducted online in a few days. Based on these changes this study aimed to analyze the relationships among student faculty (adaptations of faculty members to distance education) and institutional (distance learning capacities of the universities) variables that affected satisfaction of the students related to distance education in higher education institutions in Turkey during COVID-19 pandemic using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The study group included 14962 students and 3631 academics from 30 universities. The results showed that universities with higher distance education capacities got higher satisfaction scores. HLM analysis showed that 43% of the variation in satisfaction scores resulted from universities. The second HLM analysis showed that 44% of the overall satisfaction score variance of the students could be explained by the factors of university features (Level 2: distance education capacity and acceptance and use of distance education systems of faculty members). Thus it was determined that 44% of the university factor calculated as 43% in Model 1 (which is calculated within students' general satisfaction scores) resulted from the distance education capacity and the acceptance and use of distance education systems of faculty members. The findings of this study provide insights to improve distance education by stakeholders of higher education institutions.;2021;covıd-19 pandemic triggered distance education in higher education. decisions such as isolation social distancing and quarantine made by countries unexpectedly and suddenly forced face-to-face education to change to distance education within days. all academics around the world had to move online overnight. all the educational and academic activities in higher education (courses exams meetings etc.) had to be conducted online in a few days. based on these changes this study aimed to analyze the relationships among student faculty (adaptations of faculty members to distance education) and institutional (distance learning capacities of the universities) variables that affected satisfaction of the students related to distance education in higher education institutions in turkey during covıd-19 pandemic using hierarchical linear modeling (hlm). the study group included 14962 students and 3631 academics from 30 universities. the results showed that universities with higher distance education capacities got higher satisfaction scores. hlm analysis showed that 43% of the variation in satisfaction scores resulted from universities. the second hlm analysis showed that 44% of the overall satisfaction score variance of the students could be explained by the factors of university features (level 2: distance education capacity and acceptance and use of distance education systems of faculty members). thus it was determined that 44% of the university factor calculated as 43% in model 1 (which is calculated within students' general satisfaction scores) resulted from the distance education capacity and the acceptance and use of distance education systems of faculty members. the findings of this study provide insights to improve distance education by stakeholders of higher education institutions.
Most universities worldwide had to temporarily interrupt face-to-face education and start Emergency Distance Education (EDE) due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It is useful to identify the difficulties and problems that universities faced in this process in order that they can carry out a similar process more efficiently in the future. Therefore this study aimed to conduct an in vivo examination of EDE from the institutional perspective within the scope of universities during the pandemic period in Turkey. To this end all state university websites were searched according to 27 criteria which were determined to set out the EDE readiness status of universities. The results revealed that higher education institutions had difficulty in providing sufficient pedagogical and technical guidance to academic staff due to the rapid transition. With respect to students distance course contents activities and announcements were not equitably accessible for students from foreign countries and those with disabilities owing to the lack of information and communications technology (ICT) tools internet connection translation etc. A remarkable number of higher education institutions preferred the features of distance education tools such as cost familiarity stability availability of technical support and short preparation time rather than their pedagogical affordances.;;most universities worldwide had to temporarily interrupt face-to-face education and start emergency distance education (ede) due to the covıd-19 outbreak. ıt is useful to identify the difficulties and problems that universities faced in this process in order that they can carry out a similar process more efficiently in the future. therefore this study aimed to conduct an in vivo examination of ede from the institutional perspective within the scope of universities during the pandemic period in turkey. to this end all state university websites were searched according to 27 criteria which were determined to set out the ede readiness status of universities. the results revealed that higher education institutions had difficulty in providing sufficient pedagogical and technical guidance to academic staff due to the rapid transition. with respect to students distance course contents activities and announcements were not equitably accessible for students from foreign countries and those with disabilities owing to the lack of information and communications technology (ıct) tools internet connection translation etc. a remarkable number of higher education institutions preferred the features of distance education tools such as cost familiarity stability availability of technical support and short preparation time rather than their pedagogical affordances.
Research trends studies have emerged in education technologies (ET) to determine research manner and changes. Although the precedent examples dated back to the 1950s trend studies within ET have gradually been increasing since the 1970s. This study aimed to examine the ET publications and research trends in a 5-year time period from 2014 to 2018. With a bibliographic mapping tool namely VOSviewer three research questions were addressed relating to collaborations concepts and citations in educational technology studies. The data set was extracted from ISI Web of Science databases and included 1690 articles published in six educational technology journals between 2014 and 2018. We used co-authorship analysis to determine the collaborating researchers' institutions and their geographical locations (countries) when they published the articles. A co-occurrence analysis was used to investigate concepts. Finally a co-citation analysis was employed to determine the most cited papers and journals. Co-authorship analyses revealed that the number of articles published by researchers affiliated with institutions in the USA was the highest in the data set. According to co-occurrence analysis online learning especially in open learning environments was the most studied concept. Moreover co-citation analysis showed that the most frequently cited articles were published in Computers & Education. Additional findings discussion and limitations of the study were explained in the full text.;;research trends studies have emerged in education technologies (et) to determine research manner and changes. although the precedent examples dated back to the 1950s trend studies within et have gradually been increasing since the 1970s. this study aimed to examine the et publications and research trends in a 5-year time period from 2014 to 2018. with a bibliographic mapping tool namely vosviewer three research questions were addressed relating to collaborations concepts and citations in educational technology studies. the data set was extracted from ısı web of science databases and included 1690 articles published in six educational technology journals between 2014 and 2018. we used co-authorship analysis to determine the collaborating researchers' institutions and their geographical locations (countries) when they published the articles. a co-occurrence analysis was used to investigate concepts. finally a co-citation analysis was employed to determine the most cited papers and journals. co-authorship analyses revealed that the number of articles published by researchers affiliated with institutions in the usa was the highest in the data set. according to co-occurrence analysis online learning especially in open learning environments was the most studied concept. moreover co-citation analysis showed that the most frequently cited articles were published in computers & education. additional findings discussion and limitations of the study were explained in the full text.
Model-free techniques such as machine learning (ML) have recently attracted much interest toward the physical layer design (e.g. symbol detection channel estimation and beamforming). Most of these ML techniques employ centralized learning (CLK) schemes and assume the availability of datasets at a parameter server (PS) demanding the transmission of data from edge devices such as mobile phones to the PS. Exploiting the data generated at the edge federated learning (FL) has been proposed recently as a distributed learning scheme in which each device computes the model parameters and sends them to the PS for model aggregation while the datasets are kept intact at the edge. Thus FL is more communication-efficient and privacy-preserving than CL and applicable to the wireless communication scenarios wherein the data are generated at the edge devices. This article presents the recent advances in FL-based training for physical layer design problems. Compared to CL the effectiveness of FL is presented in terms of communication overhead with a slight performance loss in the learning accuracy. The design challenges such as model data and hardware complexity are also discussed in detail along with possible solutions.;2021;model-free techniques such as machine learning (ml) have recently attracted much interest toward the physical layer design (e.g. symbol detection channel estimation and beamforming). most of these ml techniques employ centralized learning (clk) schemes and assume the availability of datasets at a parameter server (ps) demanding the transmission of data from edge devices such as mobile phones to the ps. exploiting the data generated at the edge federated learning (fl) has been proposed recently as a distributed learning scheme in which each device computes the model parameters and sends them to the ps for model aggregation while the datasets are kept intact at the edge. thus fl is more communication-efficient and privacy-preserving than cl and applicable to the wireless communication scenarios wherein the data are generated at the edge devices. this article presents the recent advances in fl-based training for physical layer design problems. compared to cl the effectiveness of fl is presented in terms of communication overhead with a slight performance loss in the learning accuracy. the design challenges such as model data and hardware complexity are also discussed in detail along with possible solutions.
The provision of online learning experiences has been implemented by many universities worldwide to overcome several challenges including inequality in education. However this experience is still not a common approach in public universities in the Arab region. Furthermore several research studies have pointed out that a country's culture should be considered in order to enhance online learning as students may behave differently based on their cultural backgrounds. Nevertheless little is known about how a given culture may affect the learning behavioral patterns of students. Therefore to better understand the cultural phenomenon and to enhance the adoption of online learning in the Arab region this study aims to understand how an Arab culture may affect the online learning behaviors of students. Specifically this study applies a lag sequential analysis (LSA) approach to understand the behavioral patterns of 116 students from Tunisia in a six-week online course. The study then further discusses the different learning behavior patterns based on the theoretical framework of Hofstede's national cultural dimensions. The findings highlight that culture can affect how students engage in online learning discussions and how they maintain their learning performance online. The findings further indicate that online learning experiences may be beneficial for female students who experience social pressures in Arab cultures.;2021;the provision of online learning experiences has been implemented by many universities worldwide to overcome several challenges including inequality in education. however this experience is still not a common approach in public universities in the arab region. furthermore several research studies have pointed out that a country's culture should be considered in order to enhance online learning as students may behave differently based on their cultural backgrounds. nevertheless little is known about how a given culture may affect the learning behavioral patterns of students. therefore to better understand the cultural phenomenon and to enhance the adoption of online learning in the arab region this study aims to understand how an arab culture may affect the online learning behaviors of students. specifically this study applies a lag sequential analysis (lsa) approach to understand the behavioral patterns of 116 students from tunisia in a six-week online course. the study then further discusses the different learning behavior patterns based on the theoretical framework of hofstede's national cultural dimensions. the findings highlight that culture can affect how students engage in online learning discussions and how they maintain their learning performance online. the findings further indicate that online learning experiences may be beneficial for female students who experience social pressures in arab cultures.

Background: The nursing department also completely switched to distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. This new situation made the studies regarding attitudes experiences and difficulties of nursing in-structors towards distance education more important. Objectives: To determine the factors affecting the perceptions of nurse instructors towards distance education during the pandemic. Design: This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 389 nurse instructors working at a university constituted the sample. Methods: An information form and the Perceptions of Distance Education scale were used for data collection. The data were analyzed using frequency percentage arithmetic mean Cronbach Alpha internal consistency analysis t-test one-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis test were used in the analysis of the data. Result: The nurse instructors' distance education perception scale score and perception regarding basic perspective and resource access subdimension scores were at a medium level and the education-planning sub-dimension score at a high level. Those whose opinions on distance education changed compared to the pre-COVID-19 period those who received education related to distance education those who used new practices in the lessons those who believed that distance education is effective and those who thought that nursing is a suitable program for distance education had higher distance education perception scores. Conclusions: It was determined that difficulties experienced by nurse instructors in distance education negatively affected the perception of distance education and that positive experiences in distance education affected the perception positively. It is recommended to organize trainings for instructors to improve distance education skills to encourage students to participate in classes and to support nurse lecturers in overcoming difficulties.;2021;background: the nursing department also completely switched to distance education during the covıd-19 pandemic. this new situation made the studies regarding attitudes experiences and difficulties of nursing in-structors towards distance education more important. objectives: to determine the factors affecting the perceptions of nurse instructors towards distance education during the pandemic. design: this is a descriptive and cross-sectional study. participants: a total of 389 nurse instructors working at a university constituted the sample. methods: an information form and the perceptions of distance education scale were used for data collection. the data were analyzed using frequency percentage arithmetic mean cronbach alpha internal consistency analysis t-test one-way anova and kruskal wallis test were used in the analysis of the data. result: the nurse instructors' distance education perception scale score and perception regarding basic perspective and resource access subdimension scores were at a medium level and the education-planning sub-dimension score at a high level. those whose opinions on distance education changed compared to the pre-covıd-19 period those who received education related to distance education those who used new practices in the lessons those who believed that distance education is effective and those who thought that nursing is a suitable program for distance education had higher distance education perception scores. conclusions: ıt was determined that difficulties experienced by nurse instructors in distance education negatively affected the perception of distance education and that positive experiences in distance education affected the perception positively. ıt is recommended to organize trainings for instructors to improve distance education skills to encourage students to participate in classes and to support nurse lecturers in overcoming difficulties.
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the suspension of face-to-face education and its replacement with distance education. This has caused important changes in midwifery education. Objective: To determine midwifery students' opinions about distance education. Design: This qualitative study employed an exploratory case study design. Setting: This study was carried out at a national university in Ankara Turkey between December 2020 and January 2021. Participants: The sample of the study comprised 50 students in the midwifery department. Measurements and findings: Data were collected using a SWOT analysis interview form developed by the researchers. The research findings were grouped into four themes: Satisfaction with distance education barriers of distance education facilitating aspects of distance education and concerns about professional career . Key conclusions and implications for practice: Distance education in midwifery education in Turkey was found to have aspects involving obstacles and concerns in addition to many pleasing and facilitating features. Our findings suggest distance education can be used together with face-to-face education provided that its pleasing and facilitating aspects are supported and the obstacles and factors causing concerns are removed. Inclusion of distance methods in midwifery programs requires curricula to be updated and support from instructors and students for the development of the necessary infrastructure. There is a role for employing bodies to faciliate practice-based learning for new graduates to address their concerns with a lack of practical experience because of COVID-19 restrictions on placement.;2021;background: the covıd-19 pandemic led to the suspension of face-to-face education and its replacement with distance education. this has caused important changes in midwifery education. objective: to determine midwifery students' opinions about distance education. design: this qualitative study employed an exploratory case study design. setting: this study was carried out at a national university in ankara turkey between december 2020 and january 2021. participants: the sample of the study comprised 50 students in the midwifery department. measurements and findings: data were collected using a swot analysis interview form developed by the researchers. the research findings were grouped into four themes: satisfaction with distance education barriers of distance education facilitating aspects of distance education and concerns about professional career . key conclusions and implications for practice: distance education in midwifery education in turkey was found to have aspects involving obstacles and concerns in addition to many pleasing and facilitating features. our findings suggest distance education can be used together with face-to-face education provided that its pleasing and facilitating aspects are supported and the obstacles and factors causing concerns are removed. ınclusion of distance methods in midwifery programs requires curricula to be updated and support from instructors and students for the development of the necessary infrastructure. there is a role for employing bodies to faciliate practice-based learning for new graduates to address their concerns with a lack of practical experience because of covıd-19 restrictions on placement.
Predicting students at risk of academic failure is valuable for higher education institutions to improve student performance. During the pandemic with the transition to compulsory distance learning in higher education it has become even more important to identify these students and make instructional interventions to avoid leaving them behind. This goal can be achieved by new data mining techniques and machine learning methods. This study took both the synchronous and asynchronous activity characteristics of students into account to identify students at risk of academic failure during the pandemic. Additionally this study proposes an optimal ensemble model predicting students at risk using a combination of relevant machine learning algorithms. Performances of over two thousand university students were predicted with an ensemble model in terms of gender degree number of downloaded lecture notes and course materials total time spent in online sessions number of attendances and quiz score. Asynchronous learning activities were found more determinant than synchronous ones. The proposed ensemble model made a good prediction with a specificity of 90.34%. Thus practitioners are suggested to monitor and organize training activities accordingly.;2021;predicting students at risk of academic failure is valuable for higher education institutions to improve student performance. during the pandemic with the transition to compulsory distance learning in higher education it has become even more important to identify these students and make instructional interventions to avoid leaving them behind. this goal can be achieved by new data mining techniques and machine learning methods. this study took both the synchronous and asynchronous activity characteristics of students into account to identify students at risk of academic failure during the pandemic. additionally this study proposes an optimal ensemble model predicting students at risk using a combination of relevant machine learning algorithms. performances of over two thousand university students were predicted with an ensemble model in terms of gender degree number of downloaded lecture notes and course materials total time spent in online sessions number of attendances and quiz score. asynchronous learning activities were found more determinant than synchronous ones. the proposed ensemble model made a good prediction with a specificity of 90.34%. thus practitioners are suggested to monitor and organize training activities accordingly.
e-Textbooks and e-learning technologies have become ubiquitous in college and university courses as faculty seek out ways to provide more engaging flexible and customizable learning opportunities for students. However the same technologies that support learning can serve as a source of frustration. Research on frustration with technology is limited especially in educational settings. This study examined student frustration with e-textbooks and the factors contributing to the frustration within undergraduate general biology courses through the development of an E-Text Frustration scale (ETFS). Exploratory factor analysis of the ETFS revealed a three-factor structure that provides quantified support for frustration with (1) e-textbook interactions on the screen (2) problems with technology and (3) e-text curriculum integration. This structure was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. The construct validity of the scale was established using a correlation analysis that revealed significant relationships among the three e-text frustration measures cognitive load and motivation variables. Furthermore the measurement invariance analyses indicated that the scale measures the same construct in the same way in males and females. Overall the study findings suggest that the ETFS is a useful instrument with high reliability and validity evidence that can be used by researchers and practitioners. Implications for future research on frustration in technology-rich learning environments are discussed. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Prolonged student frustration can be harmful to learning. Educational technology may introduce an additional layer of factors that contribute to end-user frustration with technology. Research on frustration with educational technology is scarce. What this paper adds We developed and validated a scale for assessing students' frustration with e-textbooks. The E-Text Frustration scale includes three factors: frustration with technology e-text screen interactions and e-text curriculum. The three factors correlated with students' e-text cognitive load and motivation to learn. Implications for practice and/or policy The identified factors represent barriers to students' successful learning with e-textbooks. Educators can reduce student frustration by aligning the curriculum with e-text materials. Student sources of frustration with technology should be studied systematically to reduce frustration in technology-rich learning environments.;;e-textbooks and e-learning technologies have become ubiquitous in college and university courses as faculty seek out ways to provide more engaging flexible and customizable learning opportunities for students. however the same technologies that support learning can serve as a source of frustration. research on frustration with technology is limited especially in educational settings. this study examined student frustration with e-textbooks and the factors contributing to the frustration within undergraduate general biology courses through the development of an e-text frustration scale (etfs). exploratory factor analysis of the etfs revealed a three-factor structure that provides quantified support for frustration with (1) e-textbook interactions on the screen (2) problems with technology and (3) e-text curriculum integration. this structure was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. the construct validity of the scale was established using a correlation analysis that revealed significant relationships among the three e-text frustration measures cognitive load and motivation variables. furthermore the measurement invariance analyses indicated that the scale measures the same construct in the same way in males and females. overall the study findings suggest that the etfs is a useful instrument with high reliability and validity evidence that can be used by researchers and practitioners. ımplications for future research on frustration in technology-rich learning environments are discussed. practitioner notes what is already known about this topic prolonged student frustration can be harmful to learning. educational technology may introduce an additional layer of factors that contribute to end-user frustration with technology. research on frustration with educational technology is scarce. what this paper adds we developed and validated a scale for assessing students' frustration with e-textbooks. the e-text frustration scale includes three factors: frustration with technology e-text screen interactions and e-text curriculum. the three factors correlated with students' e-text cognitive load and motivation to learn. ımplications for practice and/or policy the identified factors represent barriers to students' successful learning with e-textbooks. educators can reduce student frustration by aligning the curriculum with e-text materials. student sources of frustration with technology should be studied systematically to reduce frustration in technology-rich learning environments.
The practice of microgame-based learning is relatively new and appears to have the potential to facilitate knowledge and skills acquisition in various educational settings. Questions have been raised recently about possible scenarios in which to use microgames for supporting learning and instruction processes. The present study investigates teachers' perspectives and preferences for using user-generated microgames for facilitating learning in a variety of microgame-based learning schemes. This study is an exploratory research with the participation of Southeast Asian elementary school teachers within an online course on Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. In the study it is found that teachers have positive views about user-generated microgames and they prefer to utilise these microgames in the middle of the main learning sessions or mixing between different scenarios for flexibility to stimulate motivational responses rather than advancing cognitive processes. One of the most practical implications is to introduce teachers to the cognitive functions of playing educational games so that they are able to integrate microgames into their teaching practices in more meaningful manners.;;the practice of microgame-based learning is relatively new and appears to have the potential to facilitate knowledge and skills acquisition in various educational settings. questions have been raised recently about possible scenarios in which to use microgames for supporting learning and instruction processes. the present study investigates teachers' perspectives and preferences for using user-generated microgames for facilitating learning in a variety of microgame-based learning schemes. this study is an exploratory research with the participation of southeast asian elementary school teachers within an online course on science technology engineering and mathematics (stem) education. ın the study it is found that teachers have positive views about user-generated microgames and they prefer to utilise these microgames in the middle of the main learning sessions or mixing between different scenarios for flexibility to stimulate motivational responses rather than advancing cognitive processes. one of the most practical implications is to introduce teachers to the cognitive functions of playing educational games so that they are able to integrate microgames into their teaching practices in more meaningful manners.
This study is aimed to develop a scale that measures university students' perception of using e-learning platforms by using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The sample consisted of 636 university students. The Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) results revealed 5-factors on a 6-items scale. The five factors that were revealed on the EFA analysis were called: Content and Pedagogy of the Platforms Perceived Usefulness Perceived Ease of Use Attitude Toward Using Technology Instructional Design of the Platforms. The scale explains about 52.6% of the total variance. The findings obtained from the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were similar to the results obtained from EFA. Therefore the factorial structure was verified. In terms of reliability the Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was calculated as 0.85 and it was split in half and the reliability was 0.94. The Cronbach's alpha values of five factors were found to be as follows: 0.93 (18 items) 0.92 (12 items) 0.76 (6 items) 0.75 (6 items) and 0.70 (4 items) respectively. Moreover the results for the lower-upper 27% groups confirmed its discriminant validity.

Background Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been challenging for patients and medical staff. Radical changes have been needed to prevent disruptions in patient care and medical education. Methods A web-based survey was sent to European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN) members via the ESPN mailing list to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery of pediatric nephrology (PN) care and educational activities. There were ten questions with subheadings. Results Seventy-six centers from 24 countries completed the survey. The time period was between the beginning of the pandemic and May 30 2020. The number of patients admitted in PN wards and outpatient clinics were significantly decreased (2.2 and 4.5 times respectively). Telemedicine tools electronic prescriptions online applications for off-label drugs and remote access to laboratory/imaging results were used in almost half of the centers. Despite staff training and protective measures 33% of centers reported COVID-19 infected staff and 29% infected patients. Difficulties in receiving pharmaceuticals were reported in 25% of centers. Sixty percent of centers suspended living-related kidney transplantation and one-third deceased-donor kidney transplantation. Hands-on education was suspended in 91% of medical schools and faceto-face teaching was replaced by online systems in 85%. Multidisciplinary training in PN was affected in 54% of the centers. Conclusions This survey showed a sharp decline in patient admissions and a significant decrease in kidney transplantation. Telemedicine and online teaching became essential tools requiring integration into the current system. The prolonged and fluctuating course of the pandemic may pose additional challenges necessitating urgent and rational solutions.;;background coronavirus disease-2019 (covıd-19) has been challenging for patients and medical staff. radical changes have been needed to prevent disruptions in patient care and medical education. methods a web-based survey was sent to european society for pediatric nephrology (espn) members via the espn mailing list to evaluate the effects of the covıd-19 pandemic on delivery of pediatric nephrology (pn) care and educational activities. there were ten questions with subheadings. results seventy-six centers from 24 countries completed the survey. the time period was between the beginning of the pandemic and may 30 2020. the number of patients admitted in pn wards and outpatient clinics were significantly decreased (2.2 and 4.5 times respectively). telemedicine tools electronic prescriptions online applications for off-label drugs and remote access to laboratory/imaging results were used in almost half of the centers. despite staff training and protective measures 33% of centers reported covıd-19 infected staff and 29% infected patients. difficulties in receiving pharmaceuticals were reported in 25% of centers. sixty percent of centers suspended living-related kidney transplantation and one-third deceased-donor kidney transplantation. hands-on education was suspended in 91% of medical schools and faceto-face teaching was replaced by online systems in 85%. multidisciplinary training in pn was affected in 54% of the centers. conclusions this survey showed a sharp decline in patient admissions and a significant decrease in kidney transplantation. telemedicine and online teaching became essential tools requiring integration into the current system. the prolonged and fluctuating course of the pandemic may pose additional challenges necessitating urgent and rational solutions.
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised the need for distance learning in nursing education. The necessary precautions have been taken in nursing schools involving the application of various restrictions including the suspension of face-to-face classes and the closure of educational institutions and this has had a profound effect on nursing educators and nursing students alike. Objectives: The study seeks to answer the following questions: 1) What are the characteristics of distance nursing education during the pandemic? 2) What are the nursing students' views on online education during the pandemic? 3) What difficulties have been experienced by nursing educators during the pandemic? 4) What are the views and suggestions of nursing educators in regards to nursing education during the pandemic? Design: descriptive cross-sectional multicentered and international study. Settings: An online survey was completed by 30 nursing educators working in establishments listed among the top 60 highest-ranked nursing schools in the world. Participants: nursing educators in undergraduate nursing programs. Method: An internet-based survey comprising open-ended and multiple choices questions was disseminated to 60 nursing schools on the 2020 QS World University Ranking list. Results: Survey responses were received from 30 nursing schools in 30 countries. Since the announcement of the pandemic the structure of distance education in nursing has taken different forms from one country to another and nursing educators and students alike have encountered a diversity of problems during this process.

The Flipped Classroom (FC) provides various opportunities to ensure active learning in a student-based learning environment. In the literature it is pointed out that the FC model provided a positive contribution to the teaching process when it was used for learning environments in past studies. Besides this it is seen that FC was integrated into a learning method and the results were generally associated with only FC. From this point of view it is thought that the methodological effect of FC needs to be examined. The aim of this study is to identify whether the use of different models (peer-assisted group: PAL-FC collaborative group: SGCL-FC and individual learning: IL-FC) in FC for computing courses of university students has an effect on academic performances learning motivation academic self-efficacy computer anxiety of the university students and flipped learning readiness. This study is designed with a mixed method. The working group of the study is composed of 242 university students. The application lasted for 14 weeks. In this study data have been collected by a Personal Information Form semi-structured interview form information technologies achievement test and four different data collection tools. As a result of the research it is found out that different applications in the FC model have a significant effect on academic success academic self-efficacy e-learning readiness in FC. FC model application with PAL-FC has proved more successful when compared to other methods in terms of developing performance and reducing technology anxiety. Also it is seen that motivation and academic self-efficacy in FC has improved positively for collaborative group work.;;the flipped classroom (fc) provides various opportunities to ensure active learning in a student-based learning environment. ın the literature it is pointed out that the fc model provided a positive contribution to the teaching process when it was used for learning environments in past studies. besides this it is seen that fc was integrated into a learning method and the results were generally associated with only fc. from this point of view it is thought that the methodological effect of fc needs to be examined. the aim of this study is to identify whether the use of different models (peer-assisted group: pal-fc collaborative group: sgcl-fc and individual learning: ıl-fc) in fc for computing courses of university students has an effect on academic performances learning motivation academic self-efficacy computer anxiety of the university students and flipped learning readiness. this study is designed with a mixed method. the working group of the study is composed of 242 university students. the application lasted for 14 weeks. ın this study data have been collected by a personal ınformation form semi-structured interview form information technologies achievement test and four different data collection tools. as a result of the research it is found out that different applications in the fc model have a significant effect on academic success academic self-efficacy e-learning readiness in fc. fc model application with pal-fc has proved more successful when compared to other methods in terms of developing performance and reducing technology anxiety. also it is seen that motivation and academic self-efficacy in fc has improved positively for collaborative group work.
Objectives Izmir University of Economics Faculty of Medicine's aim is to implement a novel and effective system called Next Generation Medical Education. This system is designed to provide us a modernized medical education which covers the students' requirements. This study is designed to investigate different aspects of this educational system from the student's perspective. Methods Main characteristic features of the educational system was determined and a survey as well as phone interviews have been conducted in order to determine the views of the students of the faculty regarding these aspects. Results The survey and the phone interview results showed that the students are mostly satisfied with current system and all of its components. Conclusions We have determined the key aspects of the system as: integrated curriculum learning to learn advisorship e-learning and feedback mechanisms. We believe that the next generation education system adopted by our faculty is a way of transforming medical education in order to train qualified physicians for tomorrow.;;objectives ızmir university of economics faculty of medicine's aim is to implement a novel and effective system called next generation medical education. this system is designed to provide us a modernized medical education which covers the students' requirements. this study is designed to investigate different aspects of this educational system from the student's perspective. methods main characteristic features of the educational system was determined and a survey as well as phone interviews have been conducted in order to determine the views of the students of the faculty regarding these aspects. results the survey and the phone interview results showed that the students are mostly satisfied with current system and all of its components. conclusions we have determined the key aspects of the system as: integrated curriculum learning to learn advisorship e-learning and feedback mechanisms. we believe that the next generation education system adopted by our faculty is a way of transforming medical education in order to train qualified physicians for tomorrow.
Purpose This study aimed to investigate the students' opinions about the distance anatomy education given in our faculty at the COVID-19 pandemic and present our department's experiences. Methods An online questionnaire designed for medical faculty students. The questionnaire was applied to 355 volunteer medical faculty students. The questionnaire consisted of demographics five-point Likert items and open-ended questions. The questionnaire was applied between August and September 2020. Distance anatomy education activities were evaluated during March and July 2020. Results Results showed face-to-face theoretical anatomy education was found to be more effective than distance anatomy education conducted with recorded lecture videos. Even though the positive aspects of distance anatomy education stand out in topics such as time management it has been stated that cadaver and laboratory education has been disrupted. Most of the students agreed that they spent more time on supplementary resources during distance anatomy education. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an unexpected experimental environment. The demand for a blended method which consists of distance (supported by video recordings) theoretical anatomy education and face-to-face practical anatomy education for the post-pandemic period comes to the fore. Distance anatomy education brings some problems with it due to its nature and it is essential to seek unique solutions to them. Evaluating the perceptions of the parties will play an essential role in solving the problems of distance anatomy education and in the formation of future anatomy education styles.;;purpose this study aimed to investigate the students' opinions about the distance anatomy education given in our faculty at the covıd-19 pandemic and present our department's experiences. methods an online questionnaire designed for medical faculty students. the questionnaire was applied to 355 volunteer medical faculty students. the questionnaire consisted of demographics five-point likert items and open-ended questions. the questionnaire was applied between august and september 2020. distance anatomy education activities were evaluated during march and july 2020. results results showed face-to-face theoretical anatomy education was found to be more effective than distance anatomy education conducted with recorded lecture videos. even though the positive aspects of distance anatomy education stand out in topics such as time management it has been stated that cadaver and laboratory education has been disrupted. most of the students agreed that they spent more time on supplementary resources during distance anatomy education. conclusion the covıd-19 pandemic has provided an unexpected experimental environment. the demand for a blended method which consists of distance (supported by video recordings) theoretical anatomy education and face-to-face practical anatomy education for the post-pandemic period comes to the fore. distance anatomy education brings some problems with it due to its nature and it is essential to seek unique solutions to them. evaluating the perceptions of the parties will play an essential role in solving the problems of distance anatomy education and in the formation of future anatomy education styles.
