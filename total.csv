Does school average achievement explain the effect of socioeconomic status on math and reading interest? A test of the Information Distortion Model;Based on the Information Distortion Model (IDM), we hypothesized higher academic interest among low socioeconomic (SES) Australian children compared to equally able high SES Australian children. We extend the IDM in two ways. First, the IDM is a model of school selection and thus empirical evidence of its effect needs to come from a model that controls for achievement prior to school selection. Second, the mechanism of the IDM is presumed to be the big-fish-little-pond-effect (BFLPE), which has not been tested. We used a longitudinal representative sample of first-year high-school students (age similar to 12, N = 2507). We linked student high-school survey data to the whole of school and individual student administrative records of achievement from high stakes national standardized tests in elementary and high-school. Our results were consistent with IDM for math interest but more mixed for reading interest, suggesting that additional processes may be in operation.
How do student and school resources influence civic knowledge? Evidence from three cohorts of Australian tenth graders;Students from less fortunate families and in less advantaged schools often perform worse than their more advantaged peers. The Australian Labor Government (2007-2013) initiated the Building the Education Revolution to establish a more effective and just education system, reaching a meaningful consensus on the development of active and informed citizens across all Australian states and territories. Using nationally representative data, this study examines how student background, school context, and school composition are associated with civic knowledge, whether students from low-status families are particularly disadvantaged in schools with more advantaged peers (big-fish-little-pond effect), and whether and how these associations have changed between 2007 and 2013. The results of multiple-group multilevel linear regression models suggest that student background and school characteristics are associated with civic knowledge, and that school characteristics moderate the associations between civic knowledge and school composition. Taken together, the data provide little evidence that the disparities in civic knowledge due to socioeconomic inequalities have declined over time. These inequities are problematic as gaps in civic knowledge can affect the quality of democracy, particularly in a country where voting is mandatory. The reproduction of educational inequality remains a challenge for social and educational policy in Australia.
Do Tunisian Children Have an Equal Chance to Access to School 8 Years After Revolution?;Early childhood education is widely considered as the most important indicator of human capital, and it is powerfully related to economic development. In this paper, we try to study the extent of inequality of opportunity when a number of circumstances beyond individual's control, such as family background, gender, and place of birth, can affect the access to basic education among Tunisian children. Using recent data for different periods, we calculate the dissimilarity index (D-index) for the basic education. Inequality gap has been detected between regions in 2018 and tends to increase over time since 2010. Residence area, father's education, and child's sex are the most contributing variables to access education inequality. Without policy intervention, there are a few chances for the next generation to overcome this trap of inequality.
Magnifying inequality? Home learning environments and social reproduction during school closures in Ireland;COVID-19 school closures have seen the homeplace become a school-place for students and their families in Ireland. This paper presents research on the resources and supports available for students to engage with learning in their home environments. Evidence from a nationally representative survey comprising one third of second-level school leaders, conducted during the first school closures in 2020, shows that attendance and engagement appears to be influenced by the educational level of parents/guardians. The association between parental education and student engagement was stronger for Junior Certificate students but was not statistically evidenced for Leaving Certificate students. Qualitative evidence sheds further light on inequalities which characterised students' experiences of online and remote learning. Viewing these developments through a social reproduction framework, this study argues that unequal home learning environments may magnify existing inequalities. To prevent a return to the classroom with more classed outcomes, it is imperative that policy, planning and investment strive to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on educational inequality.
Sorting or mixing? Multi-track and single-track schools and social inequalities in a differentiated educational system;In the Dutch stratified secondary educational system, schools vary in how many tracks are offered. While the tendency in the Netherlands is for schools to become smaller, a relevant policy question is whether multi-track school settings promote equality of educational opportunity. Comparing single-track schools at the pre-university and pre-vocational levels with multi-track schools offering the same exams, and using relative geographical distance as an instrument of school choice, the analyses showed that single-track pre-university schools enhance the probability of obtaining a pre-university diploma without delay, but more strongly so for students from disadvantaged backgrounds (who have a lower chance of going to such schools). The single-track pre-vocational schools were associated with a lower likelihood of achieving a diploma at a level higher than pre-vocational education. Multi-track schools within a varied system will not automatically enhance equal opportunities, as middle-class children will also benefit from the additional options that multi-track schools provide.
Can adolescents provide valid information on parents' educational attainment in standardized surveys? Results from a survey conducted in grade 9 in Germany;"The paper examines the accuracy of students' reports on parental education and discusses the cognitive model of survey response. For the empirical part, we used data from the German National Educational Panel Study collected in grade 9 in 2009/10, and analyzed students' and parents' reports using multinomial logit models. About 20 to 25% of students did not provide any information on their mother's or father's educational attainment; about 25% provided answers that were inconsistent with parents' reports; and close to 50% answered consistently with their parents. In line with theory, better vocabulary skills were connected with lower item nonresponse and a higher number of correct answers. Many students did not answer if their parents had completed their education abroad: Either students did not know the answer or were not able to give the German equivalent. Contrary to theoretical arguments and previous findings, the results suggest that conscientiousness and frequent discussions with parents are irrelevant. Additionally, we compared the degree of social inequality in numeracy using students' and parents' reports on parental education. The results show that models using students' reports significantly underestimate educational inequalities."
Racist-Blind, Not Color-Blind by Design: Confronting Systemic Racism in Our Educational Past, Present, and Future;This History of Education Society Presidential Address comes at the society's sixtieth anniversary and provides a new conceptual framework that foregrounds recognizing a racist-blind, and not a color-blind, ideology in the intentional and unequal design our educational past and present. It highlights systemic racism brought on by the dual pandemic moments of COVID-19 and global racial unrest, with a call to action for educational historians to lead in promoting systemic, institutional changes.
The contribution of the International Baccalaureate Diploma to educational inequalities: reinventing historical logics of curriculum stratification in a comprehensive system;International education options have expanded in most school systems around the world with promises of curricular innovation. However, there has been limited attention given to the consequences of this shift for social inequalities embedded in pre-existing institutional hierarchies. The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma, a two-year high school curriculum, has been prominent among recent private curricula, centred on notions of international mindedness and global preparedness. This article seeks to examine the consequences of the presence of the IB Diploma in a school system that is socioeconomically and academically stratified and shaped by strategies of academic distinction focused on local hierarchies. Using quantitative data on IB Diploma students and schools in Australia, it analyses the interaction of the IB Diploma with social inequalities in a system that combines a high level of between-school stratification and a comprehensive (unified) curriculum. We show how the IB Diploma has been successfully used by socially dominant and academically powerful families to consolidate their academic capital and secure educational advantage, thus contributing to the reproduction of social inequality in domestic circuits of schooling. Against its perceived innovative status, the IB Diploma has paradoxically contributed to fostering traditional forms of schooling - including within-school tracking - and a narrowing of the curriculum - including through its strong focus on examinations. It is argued that the social impact of emerging international curriculum options can only be adequately understood if they are simultaneously contextualised within historically constituted local school and curriculum hierarchies.
Educational ICT use outside school in the European Union: disparities by social origin, immigrant background, and gender;This paper analyzes inequalities in using information and communication technologies (ICTs) for educational activities outside school by social origin, immigrant background, and gender. It examines whether these inequalities just work additively or whether certain combinations of these groups are associated with specific advantages or disadvantages and which factors drive these differences. Data from the EU sample of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 are used for the empirical analyses. The results show that male students with immigrant background and highly educated parents have the highest frequency of educational ICT use, while native female students with less educated parents show the lowest frequency. However, the group categories also interact: An academic family background is more advantageous for students with immigrant background and for boys than for native students and girls. The male advantage can be attributed to a general higher frequency of boys using ICTs in their free time, while the advantage of an academic family background is mainly due to a better endowment with educational resources at home. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
BETTER TOGETHER? HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF TRACKING ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT;I study the effects of early between-school ability tracking on student achievement. My research design exploits institutional differences between German federal states: in all states about 40% of students transition to separate academic-track schools after comprehensive primary school. Depending on the state, the remaining student body is either directly tracked between two additional school types or taught comprehensively for another two years. Comparing these students before and after tracking in a triple-differences framework, I find evidence for positive effects of prolonged comprehensive schooling on mathematics and reading scores. The average effects are almost entirely driven by low achievers, while effects for high achievers are null. Early and rigid forms of tracking can thus impair both the equity and the efficiency of school systems.
Reducing educational inequality through research-practice partnerships;Although researchers have done effective work at describing the inequities that plague schools, they have been less successful at making headway in addressing them, largely because their work remains disconnected from the schools that have to try to use the research. Through research-practice partnerships, researchers are able to stay in touch with the educators on the ground, craft research questions with their actual problems in mind, and help them take action in response to the research. Daniel Potter, Erin Baumgartner, and Ruth N. Lopez Turley describe how, through the Houston Education Research Consortium, researchers from Rice University launched an equity project to uncover inequities within Houston-area schools and track their progress in addressing them. And, because of the ongoing relationship, they were able to launch a research project looking into how the COVID-19 pandemic affected students and produce results while schools where they were still relevant.
Why is inequality higher among the old? Evidence from China;This paper studies income inequality in old age and its development over the life cycle. We show that income is more unequally distributed in old age than in working age. We combine the regression-based inequality decomposition method and the three-step mediating effect test to analyze the transmission of income inequality from initial socioeconomic differences to income inequality in old age. Our study is based on a panel of over 4000 old households from the China Health and Nutrition Survey during 1991?2015. We find that the urban-rural gap and educational inequality are the primary causes of old-age income inequality. The effect of the urban-rural gap is partially mediated by educational inequality. Inequality accumulates with age and is reinforced in old age by the fragmented Chinese public pension system.
Why does this matter? The value of intersectionality;"In this commentary, I explore and elaborate on themes in Maggie Renken, Jessica Scott, Patrick Enderle, and Scott Cohen's (this issue) manuscript It's not a deaf thing, it's not a black thing; it's a deaf black thing: A study of the intersection of adolescents' deaf, race, and STEM identities. Using my own research and experiences, I present a case on the importance of working with students with low-incidence disabilities and how scholarship focused on related student groups can inform and illuminate problems of practice in an underexplored research area. Additionally, I posit that using a lens of intersectionality can help address issues of educational inequality experienced by multiple communities. I conclude with a consideration of how Maslow's hierarchy of needs (Maslow, Psychol Rev 50:370-396, 1943) must be considered before addressing students' STEM identities."
Time trends in socio-economic, urban-rural and regional disparities in prevalence of obesity among non-pregnant women in Lesotho: evidence from Lesotho demographic and health surveys (2004-2014);"BackgroundThe growing rates of obesity in developing countries are alarming. There is a paucity of evidence about disparities of obesity in Lesotho. This study examined socioeconomic and area-based inequalities in obesity among non-pregnant women in Lesotho.MethodsData were extracted from the 2004, 2009 and 2014 Lesotho Demographic and Health Surveys (LDHS) and analyzed through the recently updated Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) of the World Health Organization. Obesity prevalence was disaggregated by four equity stratifiers, namely education, wealth, residence and sub-national region. For each equity stratifier, simple and complex as well as relative and absolute summary measures were calculated. A 95% confidence interval was used to measure statistical significance of findings.ResultsWe noticed substantial wealth-driven (D=-21.10, 95% CI; -25.94, -16.26), subnational region (PAR=-11.82, 95%CI; -16.09, -7.55) and urban-rural (-9.82, 95% CI; -13.65, -5.99) inequalities in obesity prevalence without the inequalities improved over time in all the studied years. However, we did not identify educational inequality in obesity.ConclusionsWealth-driven and geographical inequalities was identified in Lesotho in all the studied time periods while education related inequalities did not appear during the same time period. All population groups in the country need to be reached with interventions to reduce the burden of obesity in the country."
Strive to Succeed? The Role of Persistence in the Process of Educational Attainment;This article examines the role of effort in the process of educational attainment. First, I analyze the impact of effort on future tertiary educational attainment. Then, I test two sociological theories that argue that effort transmits educational inequality across generations. According to the first theory, parental background shapes the effort that children exert in education-related activities. The second theory argues that the drivers of effort in this context are educational expectations. I use a variable for effort that is measured directly over the course of the Programme for International Student Assessment test. Using a longitudinal data set from Australia, I estimate different hierarchical and structural equations models. I find that the measure of effort is positively and significantly associated with the probability of having obtained a tertiary degree 10 years later. Furthermore, the results show partial support for the second theory but not for the first one.
Subtle discrimination: do stereotypes among teachers trigger bias in their expectations and widen ethnic achievement gaps?;Ethnic and racial disparities in educational outcomes, such as test scores, are a core issue of educational research. While the role of student and family factors in the formation of such disparities is well established, existing studies fail to draw a similarly clear picture of how teachers contribute to ethnic and racial achievement gaps. In contrast to previous studies, which focussed on the consequences of rather blatant forms of discrimination, such as in teachers' grading practices, this study investigates rather subtle processes that might result in discrimination of ethnic and racial minority students. In particular, I address stereotypes among teachers and analyse if they induce bias in their achievement expectations for ethnic minority school beginners. Additionally, I analyse if such bias results in a self-fulfilling prophecy and contributes to ethnic achievement gaps at the end of first grade. Multilevel regressions applied to a sample of 1007 children and 64 teachers in German primary schools reveal that different teachers internalize distinct stereotypes regarding ethnic achievement gaps and the achievement-related attributes of ethnic minority students. I also find that teachers with more negative stereotypes expect lower mathematics and reading achievements for ethnic minority students at the beginning of first grade. However, although I replicate the finding that inaccurate teacher expectations result in a self-fulfilling prophecy, I find no statistically significant effects of teacher stereotypes on ethnic differences in the development of students' reading and mathematical skills throughout first grade.
Assimilation-Abitur, separation-lower school-leaving certificate? The relationship of acculturation and the envisaged school-leaving certificate;This study investigates whether there is a relationship between acculturation and the envisaged school-leaving certificate of immigrant students in secondary school. Based on data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) different aspects of acculturation were employed and four acculturation profiles identified conducting Latent Profile Analysis: an assimilated, a moderate assimilated, an integrated, and a separated acculturation profile. Logistic regression models were run to investigate the odds for envisaging an Abitur or a lower school-leaving certificate dependent on the acculturation profiles identified. Before controlling for linguistic competence, results indicate that the separated acculturation profile predicts the envisaged school-leaving certificate. Controlling for linguistic competence, no acculturation profile shows any effects. Effects of cultural background can only be shown for the predicted odds for envisaging an Abitur. Findings are in line with the state of research, that points to the disadvantages of separation in the German school context and indicate the importance of German language skills regarding academic success.
English Learner Labeling: How English Learner Classification in Kindergarten Shapes Teacher Perceptions of Student Skills and the Moderating Role of Bilingual Instructional Settings;"Prior research has shown that English learner (EL) classification is consequential for students; however, less is known about bow EL classification affects student outcomes. In this study, we examine one hypothesized mechanism: teacher perceptions. Using a national data set (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort of 2010-2011 or ECLS-K 2011), we use coarsened exact matching to estimate the effect of kindergarten EL status on teachers' perceptions of students' academic skills. We further explore whether that impact is moderated by instructional setting (bilingual vs. English immersion). We find evidence that EL classification results in lower teacher perceptions. This impact is, however, moderated by bilingual environments. In bilingual classrooms, we do not find evidence that EL classification results in diminished perceptions. This study adds to research on teacher perceptions and the effects of EL classification."
School segregation in Rio de Janeiro: geographical, racial and historical dimensions of a centre-periphery dynamic;This paper examines educational segregation in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro through the lens of a multifaceted centreperiphery relationship involving geographical, racial and historical dimensions. The paper first situates Brazilian racial inequalities historically, drawing on decolonial theory, before examining student enrolment patterns in Brazil's second-largest metropolis. Although Brazil is often held to be a racially integrated society, the analysis shows sharp racial and social divisions between a 'peripherally' oriented mass public school system, a 'centrally' oriented private sector, and selective public schools run by the federal government. The selective public sector is undergoing a period of transition, driven by affirmative action policies, and provoking tensions that are examined through the experiences of two politically-engaged teachers. The findings point to the importance of political mobilisation in effecting change and the need for further affirmative action policies, along with a revised funding model for public schooling.
The shifting powers of educational knowledge: power relations between sociology and economics of education;This paper considers the 'hope' and 'disappointments' experienced over time about the results of rapid educational expansion, as well as the research agenda which aims to improve educational outcomes in the developing world and particularly in Africa. Our interest is in the development and nature of policy-oriented bodies of knowledge that address the issue of educational inequality in poor countries. More specifically, we examine the state of knowledge production in sociology of education in relation to the question of educational inequality. We do this through an exploration of its interface with economics of education, starting with an examination of literature in the developed world. We argue that there was an initial collaboration in the 1950s, shifting to something of a separation from the 1980s, to what could be seen as a colonization of education in research on developing countries. This is facilitated by the way in which sociology of education has developed into silos of topic-based research-reducing its explanatory and political power. Some silos are marginalized, and some are dominated by claims on 'what works' produced by economists.
Inequality in skills for learning: do gaps in children's socio-emotional development widen over time according to family background?;At all ages, a child who can sustain attention, regulate emotions, inhibit impulsive behaviour, and relate appropriately to adults and peers is able to take advantage of learning opportunities in the classroom, and beyond. This study assesses differences in children's socio-emotional development according to family background, and whether early gaps in these skills widen across childhood in a contemporary UK cohort. Applying models replicating a much-discussed investigation of cognitive trajectories, it finds that large gaps in early childhood persist through school, and that children with similar initial skills diverge over time according to family background. The transition to secondary school is identified as a crucial time when disadvantaged children fall behind, and a priority for future intervention.
The (Unequal) Interplay Between Cognitive and Noncognitive Skills in Early Educational Attainment;"Cognitive and noncognitive skills are key indicators of educational success and merit. However, even when accounting for inequalities in skill formation by family socioeconomic status (SES), a wide SES-gap in college enrolment remains. According to the compensatory advantage hypothesis, SES-gaps in educational transitions are largest among cognitively weak students, but little is known on mechanisms. It has long been argued that noncognitive traits such as effort and motivation might be at least as important as cognitive skills over the status-attainment process, and these skills might interact by being complements or substitutes. Thus, I test whether advantaged students substitute low cognitive skills in test scores by high returns to conscientiousness-rated by teachers- in the transition to academic secondary schools. I draw data from the German National Educational Panel Study to study a cohort of students from Grades 1 to 5, when early tracking is enforced. I estimate linear probability models with school fixed-effects and moderation. To account for measurement error, I also use composite latent skills across elementary education. I report three main findings: (a) High-SES students at the same level of cognitive and noncognitive skills than low-SES schoolmates are more likely to attend the academic track bridged to college; (b) in line with the compensatory hypothesis, these SES-inequalities are largest among low cognitive performers; (3) cognitively weak students from high-SES families get the highest educational returns to conscientiousness in comparison to high cognitive performers or low-SES peers, validating the skill substitution hypothesis. These findings challenge the liberal conception of merit as the sum of ability plus effort in assessing equal opportunity in education."
The Inequity of Educational Opportunity During a Pandemic;Educational opportunity has rarely been truly equal in any society, although modern societies have made enormous efforts to assure greater equality. Inequality in education is most often a consequence of existing social differences which structure opportunity. Those individuals with greater financial resources tend to have a wider range of educational choices and access to a higher standard of educational opportunities than those people with lesser financial means. This situation has become increasingly apparent in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper discusses those inevitable differences which have exacerbated educational inequality during this pandemic. Such inequities are examined internationally.
CULTURALLY SUSTAINING MUSIC EDUCATION AND EPISTEMIC TRAVEL;The examination of racist, normalized ideology within American education is not new. Theoretical and practical conceptions of social justice in education have attempted to attend to educational inequality. Oftentimes, these attempts have reinstated the status quo because they were framed within the same Eurocentric paradigm. To address this, Django Paris proposed culturally sustaining pedagogy as a means of empowering minoritized students by sustaining the cultural competence of their communities and dismantling coloniality within educational practices. He, Michael Dominguez, and others argue that epistemic expansion is imperative for equitizing educational spaces and closing the ontological distance between teachers and students. Drawing from their work as well as scholarship from the fields of educational policy, urban education, Afrocentrism, and Indigenous studies, this paper seeks to expand the discussion about culturally relevant and responsive music education to account for students' musical epistemologies and the ways in which epistemic travel might inform normalized musical practices.
I am not a guinea pig: Parental opportunity hoarding and tracking reform in Germany;PISA test data from 2000 to today have shown Germany's education system is one of the most inequitable within the OECD, with high correlations between student background and achievement outcomes. Scholars have identified the highly differentiated school structure, which tracks students as young as 10 years old, as a central cause. This scholarship has not evaluated why German tracking has proved difficult to reform over the last 20 years, despite evidence of negative outcomes. Using a case study of parents' actions in Hamburg, this paper employs a discourse analysis of debates surrounding a tracking reform to argue that opportunity hoarding-that is, parents with more social capital maintaining certain advantages through ingrained systems that are theoretically open to all-may contribute to why Germany's early tracking system persists despite evidence showing that it increases educational inequality. The findings presented have implications for an international discussion of tracking reform and opportunity hoarding.
Why Adequacy Isn't Enough: Educational Justice, Positional Goods and Class Power;Elizabeth Anderson and Debra Satz continue in the tradition of Plato with their work on the role of education in a just society. Both argue that a just society depends on education enabling citizens to realize democratic or civic equality and that this equality depends on sufficiency in the distribution of educational goods. I agree that education is important to preparing democratic citizens, but I disagree about the plausibility of sufficiency here, especially in the educational context. My argument is two-fold: I first reconsider a generic positional goods objection to educational inequality, I then argue that plausible sufficientarian replies to this objection fail insofar as they are premised on an impoverished conception of class and power that treats all statuses more like socio-cultural traits when they should instead be referencing the material conditions someone has inside a social structure. One cannot bring an individual X into the halls of power and simultaneously have X represent or compensate those who are presently disadvantaged in the way that X had formerly been disadvantaged. In short, we should worry about the realistic possibility of securing and sustaining a civic-minded elite because elites have the power and motivation to enrich themselves at the expense of the rest of us. For the sufficientarian story to work, we need more that explains the realistic possibility of a benevolent ruling elite, until then, democratic equality seems to be better realized by aiming for equal educations, adequacy isn't enough.
Relative risk aversion models: How plausible are their assumptions?;This work examines the validity of the two main assumptions of relative risk-aversion models of educational inequality. We compare the Breen-Goldthorpe (BG) and the Breen-Yaish (BY) models in terms of their assumptions about status maintenance motives and beliefs about the occupational risks associated with educational decisions. Concerning the first assumption, our contribution is threefold. First, we criticise the assumption of the BG model that families aim only at avoiding downward mobility and are insensitive to the prospects of upward mobility. We argue that the loss-aversion assumption proposed by BY is a more realistic formulation of status-maintenance motives. Second, we propose and implement a novel empirical approach to assess the validity of the loss-aversion assumption. Third, we present empirical results based on a sample of families of lower secondary school leavers indicating that families are sensitive to the prospects of both upward and downward mobility, and that the loss-aversion hypothesis of BY is empirically supported. As regards the risky choice assumption, we argue that families may not believe that more ambitious educational options entail occupational risks relative to less ambitious ones. We present empirical evidence indicating that, in France, the academic path is not perceived as a risky option. We conclude that, if the restrictive assumptions of the BG model are removed, relative-risk aversion needs not drive educational inequalities.
What enables the meritocratic power of a college degree? Changing labor market outcomes of first-generation college graduates in post-revolution China;Taking advantage of changes in college admissions and the labor market in post-revolution China, this study sheds light on the institutional conditions under which a college degree may equalize the influence of family educational background on labor market outcomes. We examine differences in the first job's occupational attainment and economic returns between first-generation, second-generation, and non-college graduates. We compare birth cohorts with distinctive experiences, some of whom entered college through political recommendation while others did so through objective examination, and some of whom attained their first job through state assignment while others did so through market matching. We find that a college degree only equalized occupational attainment in cohort 1980-1992, who experienced expanded test-based admissions and a developed labor market. Within-occupation economic returns were equalized in cohort 1966-1979, who experienced test-based admissions and yet an underdeveloped labor market, but appeared to be unequal again in cohort 1980-1992, echoing rising social inequality.
What happens when schools shut down? Investigating inequality in students' reading behavior during Covid-19 in Denmark;The outbreak of Covid-19 in spring 2020 shut down schools around the world and placed parents in charge of their children's schooling. Research from the lockdown period documents that families differ in their responses to their new responsibility for their children's homeschooling by socioeconomic status and that the Covid-19 crisis has increased educational inequality. The aim of this paper is to examine inequality in children's reading behavior before, during and after the lockdown of schools in Denmark by analyzing new digital data from a widely used reading app combined with administrative data. Our results show, first, that students' online reading behavior increased significantly as a consequence of the lockdown of schools, second, that there is a socioeconomic gradient in students' reading behavior both before and during the lockdown, and, third, that inequality in reading behavior during Covid-19 increased exclusively during the first lockdown period in which schools were closed and students where taught online. Consequently, our results support the findings from previous research documenting a SES gradient in learning opportunities in homeschooling activities during the Covid-19 induced lockdown. Yet, contrary to prior research, we find only a short-term increase in inequality on children's actual reading activity during Covid-19.
Measuring educational inequality of opportunity: pupil's effort matters;The distinction between effort and other factors, such as family background, matters for correcting policies and normative reasons when we appeal to inequality of opportunity. We take advantage of a purposefully designed survey on secondary schools in rural Bangladesh to offer a comprehensive view of the importance of overall effort when measuring inequalities of opportunity in education. The analysis comprises decomposition exercises of the predicted variance of student performance in mathematics and English by source (effort, circumstances, etc.) and subgroup (within- and between-schools) based on parametric estimates of educational production functions. Pupils' effort, preferences, and talents contribute between 31% and 40% of the total predicted variances in performance scores. The contribution of overall effort falls by 10% when the correlation between effort and circumstances is taken into account. These findings are robust to the choice of estimation strategy (i.e. combined within- and between-schools variation models versus multilevel random-effect models). All in all, these results advocate that social determinism in education can be mitigated by individual effort at school. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
Early tracking and different types of inequalities in achievement: difference-in-differences evidence from 20 years of large-scale assessments;Research to date on the effects of between-school tracking on inequalities in achievement and on performance has been inconclusive. A possible explanation is that different studies used different data, focused on different domains, and employed different measures of inequality. To address this issue, we used all accumulated data collected in the three largest international assessments-PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment), PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study), and TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study)-in the past 20 years in 75 countries and regions. Following the seminal paper by Hanushek and Wossmann (2006), we combined data from a total of 21 cycles of primary and secondary school assessments to estimate difference-in-differences models for different outcome measures. We synthesized the effects using a meta-analytical approach and found strong evidence that tracking increased social achievement gaps, that it had smaller but still significant effects on dispersion inequalities, and that it had rather weak effects on educational inadequacies. In contrast, we did not find evidence that tracking increased performance levels. Besides these substantive findings, our study illustrated that the effect estimates varied considerably across the datasets used because the low number of countries as the units of analysis was a natural limitation. This finding casts doubt on the reproducibility of findings based on single international datasets and suggests that researchers should use different data sources to replicate analyses.
Income, housing wealth, and private school access in Britain;Access to Britain's highly-resourced private schools matters because of concerns surrounding social mobility. Using the UK Family Resources Survey, we document a high and mostly stable income concentration of private school access since 1997. Nevertheless, some low-income participation persists. Bursaries are income-progressive but cannot account for this participation. Housing wealth is, however, found to be greater for private school participants. We estimate that a 10 per cent rise of family income and home value raises private school participation by 0.9 points, respectively. Neither effect changes over time. The income effect, however, falls sharply outside the top income decile.
Academic resilience: underlying norms and validity of definitions;Academic resilience refers to students' capacity to perform highly despite a disadvantaged background. Although most studies using international large-scale assessment (ILSA) data defined academic resilience with two criteria, student background and achievement, their conceptualizations and operationalizations varied substantially. In a systematic review, we identified 20 ILSA studies applying different criteria, different approaches to setting thresholds (the same fixed ones across countries or relative country-specific ones), and different threshold levels. Our study on the validity of these differences and how they affected the composition of academically resilient students revealed that the classification depended heavily on the threshold applied. When a fixed background threshold was applied, the classification was likely to be affected by the developmental state of a country. This could result in an overestimation of the proportions of academically resilient students in some countries while an underestimation in others. Furthermore, compared to the application of a social or economic capital indication, applying a cultural capital indicator may lead to lower shares of disadvantaged students classified as academically resilient. The composition of academically resilient students varied significantly by gender and language depending on which indicator of human capital or which thresholds were applied reflecting underlying societal characteristics. Conclusions drawn from such different results depending on the specific conceptualizations and operationalizations would vary greatly. Finally, our study utilizing PISA 2015 data from three countries representing diverse cultures and performance levels revealed that a stronger sense of belonging to a school significantly increased the chances to be classified as academically resilient in Peru, but not in Norway or Hong Kong. In contrast, absence from school was significantly associated with academic resilience in Norway and Hong Kong, but not in Peru.
From a Sociological Given Context to Changing Practice: Transforming Problematic Power Relations in Educational Organizations to Overcome Social Inequalities;In 2012, the international PISA survey reinforced the observation that the French educational system is one of the most unequal among OECD countries. The observation of serious inequalities in access to educational success for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds could lead to a pessimistic vision suggesting that any possibility of transformation of the system is doomed to failure. Thus, the fight against inequalities in access to educational success is a form of runaway object which constitutes a challenge for research which treats the social context as evolving and susceptible to significant and novel transformations. Developmental work research aims to support the work of professionals in the re-elaboration of their practices by seeking to go beyond the status quo of an unequal school. Drawing on this framework within an institutional network of schools, we seek to show how the intervention has highlighted power issues inscribed in the structures and how the actors, through their commitment in the research collaborative process, seek to go beyond the power issues inscribed in their work routines and enacted during the research process by different kinds of antagonism. We will argue that the fight against educational inequality involves overcoming systemic power relations crystallized in institution. This systemic power is expressed by a form of episodic power. Our results show restrictive and constructive effect on the expansive learning process and on the construction of a collective in the formative interventions. The restrictive side of epistemic power should be linked to systemic power which is historically inherited. We discuss the results in the light of the emergence of a fourth generation of activity theory. Our research makes it possible to make conceptual and methodological progress in the construction of a fourth generation of activity theory by showing the need for analysis and expansively learn about problematic power relations in heterogeneous collectives.
Decomposing educational inequality in maternal mortality in Iran;Given the significance of educational equality as one of the key social determinants of health in maternal health outcomes, the present study aimed to assess maternal mortality inequality and its main contributors based on the level of education amongst mothers living in Isfahan, Iran. In this case-control study, all 171 maternal deaths in the Isfahan Province during 2001-2016 were taken from the national maternal mortality surveillance system (as a case group). For the control group, 523 mothers who were alive were selected from 22 health centers located in 21 cities in the province of Isfahan. Concentration index and curve were used to measure educational inequality in maternal mortality. The chi-square test was used to select explanatory social and health variables to enter the decomposition model. The analyses were performed with STATA 12. Social and healthcare factors accounted for 43.57% and 23.44% of educational inequality, respectively. The normalized maternal mortality concentration index was -0.13 (95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02). Among the social factors, the mother's education level (38.14%) and immigrant status (25.39%) contributed the most to educational inequality. Regarding healthcare factors, proximate medical causes (14.49%) and the number of pregnancies (9.72%) had the highest contribution. Maternal mortality has been distributed unequally among the less and more educated mothers in Iran, which suggests that promoting health literacy is imperative, especially for women with lower education levels.
Primary and Secondary Effects on Long-Term Educational Outcomes of Individuals with Experience of Child Welfare Interventions;It is well known that individuals with experience of child welfare interventions - here conceptualised as placement in out-of-home care (OHC) - tend to have substantially poorer educational outcomes compared to their peers. Numerous explanatory factors have been proposed but few have been informed by mainstream sociological research into educational stratification. Through the lens of primary (ability-driven explanations) and secondary (choice-based explanations, conditional on educational performance) effects on social background differentials in educational attainment, longitudinal data from more than 14 000 Swedes (of which around 9% have been placed in OHC) were used to estimate the relative importance of these two basic explanatory processes. Results from decomposition analyses suggest that the secondary effect is the key driver in creating differentials in midlife educational attainment among individuals of different social origins. Such impacts were found to be even stronger in the OHC population. Interventions aimed at improving educational performance in children with experience of OHC may not sufficiently reduce educational inequalities across the life course if choice-based explanations are not addressed. Key Practitioner Messages Individuals with a history of child welfare intervention are educationally disadvantaged. Causes of educational inequality can be decomposed into primary (ability-driven explanations) and secondary (choice-based explanations, conditional on educational achievement) effects. Secondary effects are particularly strong in child welfare populations. Former child welfare clients will continue to be educationally disadvantaged if secondary effects are not addressed. 'Causes of educational inequality can be decomposed into primary (ability-driven explanations) and secondary (choice-based explanations, conditional on educational achievement) effects'
Attention to diversity during COVID-19: Legislative review of measures according to LOMCE;Following the establishment of the state of alarm caused by COVID-19 and the consequent closure of schools nationwide, formal education has moved from a presential learning context to virtual learning environments in a matter of hours. We present a review of the Spanish educational regulations on attention to students' diversity and the measures to be applied in extraordinary learning contexts, such as the one we live worldwide. For the realization, we have done and analysis of the contents, focus on the measures of attention to the diversity existent on the national organic legislation and on the guidelines of the Education and Vocational Training Ministry. The educational policies, and the responsible administrations, are not prepared for a change in the methodology of attention to the students, that affects in the reduction of the inequalities of the students and provides and equitable access to learning, since the compensatory role of the school (as an institution) cannot be supplied through the virtualization of teaching. In this aspect, teachers and the autonomy of the centers represent and added value in equal opportunities, which is diminished in virtual educational environments due to the socioeconomic conditions of the students, increasing educational inequality.
Trends in the Development of Tertiary Education in the Context of Modern Challenges;"Achievement of stable economic growth and ensuring innovative development, the needs of the creative economy for specialists with digital skills can be considered as one of the main challenges for the sphere of tertiary education. Therefore, the education system should provide a high level of service quality in order to meet the needs of the labour markets. Globalization and international cooperation between the EU and Asia exacerbate these problematic issues. The purpose of the research lies in systematizing the basic challenges of the external environment and their impact on the transformation and development trends of tertiary education on the example of the EU states. Methodology. The research is based on quantitative methodology and statistical analysis. The development indicators of higher education of the EU countries for 2013-2018 from Eurostat and the World Bank database have been used for the analysis. The results prove the complexity of the links between social-economic, environmental, and political issues, which determine the dynamics of tertiary education and transformational changes in tertiary education. The following key challenges have been highlighted in the academic paper, namely: 1) development of creative economy, innovation economy, and knowledge economy; 2) external shocks, such as a pandemic; 3) technological progress and integration of technologies into education; 4) increasing the level of migration flows and strengthening the problem of educational inequality; 5) spreading the practice of commercialization and privatization of tertiary educational institutions (TEIs); 6) globalization and internationalization of tertiary education due to international cooperation between different countries and regions. The following basic trends in the development of tertiary education in the EU countries have been identified, namely: 1) problems of implementing the concept of knowledge and competence; 2) challenges in the management of TEIs and management of the educational process; 3) dynamic development of online and distance learning; 4) the growing importance of academic integrity and ethics; 5) challenges related to achieving the goals of sustainable development within the SDG 4 Quality education; 6) systemic reduction of TEIs' funding under the conditions of slow economic growth; 7) increasing the level of international students' mobility and students' migration, which necessitates the adaptation of TEls and foreign students to a multicultural learning environment; 8) flexibility and adaptability of TEIs; 9) challenges related to inclusive education; 10) challenges related to the integration of technology into tertiary education."
Educational Inequality and COVID-19 Pandemic: Relationship between the Family Socio-Economic Status and Student Experience of Remote Learning;The urgent transition to distance education in March 2020 revitalized the debate on the influence of a new educational reality on the educational inequality. A study was performed to measure the relationship between the difficulties experienced by students during distance learning and their socioeconomic status. Data from a nationwide survey of students administered in late March-early April 2020 by a team of researchers from a few Russian universities was used as empirical basis of this study. Results demonstrate significant differences in obstacles faced by students from families with different levels of income. Students from low-income families were the most likely to have technical and self-regulation problems and to lack skills required for effective distance learning. Findings indicate the importance of finding system-level solutions to ensure equal opportunities for students in distance learning, regardless of their socioeconomic status.
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REMOTE EDUCATION IN PANDEMIC TIMES: ANALYSING THE EXPERIENCE OF THE STATE OF MINAS GERAIS;"The article analyzes the implementation of remote education in the State Network of Minas Gerais through the Regime de Estudo nao Presencial (REANP) in pandemic times. The research took place in three phases: a survey of the program's institutional frameworks; an analysis of the lines of action and comments in the communication channels provided by the Secretariat of Education (SEE). The data were organized into seven dimensions: (1) access to the program; (2) receptivity to REANP; (3) perceptions about the application and its functionalities (4) issues associated with the technology; (5) content; (6) adherence to remote education and (7) connection between the REANP axes. The data show the difficulty that SEE has faced in creating links and multilevel adhesion strategies between institutional actors, instruments, processes, technologies, territories, and their professionals. The data indicate that remote public education links and enhances social and economic issues and that SEE has minimized them in its design, linearizing the offer. No actions or strategies were found for students of special education, quilombola, indigenous and youth and adults. Users' perceptions point to two issues: the risks of remote education deepening social and educational inequalities and the adoption of virtual training strategies, supported by technologies, after the pandemic."
School Socio-economic Composition as a Factor of Educational Inequality Review of Measurement Approaches and Relation with Academic Outcomes;The socioeconomic composition of schools is considered one of the most significant factors of educational inequality at the school level. Most of the reviewed works demonstrate a positive relation between the student population's socioeconomic status and educational outcomes. At the same time, a number of authors confirm that this effect is a statistical artifact and is significant due to the limitations of existing studies' methodology. Despite a fairly large number of works, a few questions remain: How is the composition effect formed? Under what conditions does it occur? What mechanisms involve interconnection? How can the negative effect of school composition be minimized? Is it about causality? In Russian studies, this subject area is out of sight. In this article, the author aims to provide a systematic analysis of relevant works with a focus on developing recommendations and further directions for empirical research. In this review, the author introduces the term socioeconomic composition and describes the main approaches for measuring it, taking into account the choice of the composition indicator, aggregation method, and data analysis method. Following assumptions about the presence of an indirect effect of composition and methodological recommendations, the possible mechanisms of the effect at the peer, teacher, and school levels are described. Based on the analysis of critical works, the prerequisites for research design are formed. The author concludes the paper with a summary of the recommendations and substantiates the scientific and practical importance of studying the causal relation between the school composition and educational results.
'English is always proportional to one's wealth': English, English language education, and social reproduction in South Korea;While quality English language education is not equally accessible in many EFL countries, neoliberalism and its ideology of language as a neutral skill that everyone can acquire has obscured inequalities caused by the heavy emphasis on English as a dominant world language. Using South Korea as an example, I examine how individuals, especially young adults, living in the neoliberal market economy perceive and recognize the overwhelming emphasis on English as a dominant world language and its underlying mechanisms that contribute to social reproduction in EFL countries. In analyzing the popular Korean discourse Theory of Spoon Class (sujeogyegeublon), I examine how English is beginning to be recognized as an active tool to maintain and solidify social class reproduction, and how the construction of English as a purchasable good then results in feelings of despair, hopelessness and resentment among individuals, especially young adults who need to survive in the precarious job market with rising unemployment rates and prolonged economic stagnation.
Attention to Diversity in Spanish Universities by institutional leaders's discourses;Most Spanish universities are in an advanced-initial phase of implementing policies for Attention to Diversity (AD), as part of their social responsibility. In this way, the specific practices of AD are based on ethical and/or political assumptions, a fact that is still under-explored. This work is part of a R+ D+I project that involves eight Spanish universities. The first phase of the project consists of an analysis of the discourses of the institutional leaders, among other university agents. We wanted to approach the pragmatic uses of  diversity made by different types of leaders responsible for AD. Specifically, we have conducted 24 interviews. Through these discourses we wanted to analyze the grammar of educational justice on which difference is constructed and attended in university. One of our main conclusions is related to the identification of a certain semantic shift in the discourses of AD within the university with regard to issues of power, conflict and social justice. Furthermore, it presupposes and integrates them into predominantly pedagogical-functionalist keys.
Extended gender inequality? Intergenerational coresidence and division of household labor;This study investigates the effect of coresidence with the husband's or the wife's parents on division of household labor between the couple in China. We further examine how life course, education, hukou, and the gender composition of coresiding parents moderate the relationship between intergenerational coresidence and division of household labor. Previous research on housework division has looked at nuclear families. Little is known about the effect of intergenerational coresidence on housework division. Despite rapid modernization, intergenerational coresidence remains prevalent in China as families try to adapt to the changing social and economic conditions. While patrilocal coresidence dominates in both rural and urban China, matrilocal coresidence is increasingly common in urban China. Based on panel data from the 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2018 waves of the China Family Panel Studies, fixed effects models are used to account for both observed and unobserved individual-specific confounders. Both patrilocal and matrilocal coresidence seem to widen the within-couple gender gap in housework time among urban hukou holders. Among rural hukou holders, though patrilocal coresidence is associated with reduced housework time for the wife and the couple as a whole, neither patrilocal nor matrilocal coresidence significantly influences how much time the husband spent on housework. Coresidence with the husband's or the wife's parents may exacerbate gender inequality in housework division.
Putting cumulative (dis)advantages in context: Comparing the role of educational inequality in later-life functional health trajectories in England and Germany;"Background The cumulative (dis)advantage (CAD) perspective more and more is examined in a comparative way, to highlight the role of context in generating inequality over the life course. This study adds to this field of research by examining trajectories of activities of daily living (ADL) in later life by educational level in a country comparison of England and Germany, emphasizing differing institutional conditions. Method Data used are the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA; 11,352 individuals) and the German subsample of the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE; 5,573 individuals). Using population averaged Poisson panel regression models, 12-year trajectories of six birth cohorts are investigated, covering the age range of 50 to 90 years. Results Respondents in England have a higher level of limitations at age 50, and more limited increases over age than in Germany. An educational gradient exists in both countries at age 50. Notably, the educational gradient increases for more recently born cohorts, but declines with increasing age in England, while in Germany educational differences increase for more recently born cohort only. Discussion The current study indicates that CAD processes between educational groups are context sensitive. While England showed convergence of disparities with increasing age, in Germany no differential development was found."
Opportunity or inequality? The paradox of French immersion education in Canada;This paper examines the persistent, growing popularity of Canadian French immersion (FI) programmes. Critics charge that FI programmes are elitist, diverting already limited resources from other areas of the education system. We begin with a brief overview of the benefits of FI in Canada and enrolment trends. Next, sources of FI-related inequality - lack of access, transportation costs, funding issues and types of learners most likely to enrol in FI - are scrutinised. Then, available evidence is weighed for and against the charges of FI elitism. Lastly, demand for FI is viewed through a Bourdieusian social reproduction lens to understand the persistence of socio-economic status (SES) inequalities. The paper concludes that higher SES parents are more likely to have the inclination (parentocratic habitus) and resources (economic, social, and cultural capital) to enrol their children in, and benefit from, FI. The paradox of publicly funded FI education in Canada is that as long as demand outstrips supply the benefits will continue to be unequally distributed. The result is a stalemate between proponents and critics, with each camp's solution - whether it be making FI universally available or removing it completely from the public purse - bound to meet with stiff opposition.
On the measurement of educational attainment and inequality with ordinal variables;Data on educational attainments are often qualitative data where the only information available is the highest level of education of the individual. If these levels of education may be ranked, the information available becomes ordinal. It is then possible to use measures of inequality as well as of overall attainment suggested in recent years (mostly in the field of self-assessed health) for the case where only ordinal information is available. This paper adopts these recent suggestions and proposes new measures of educational inequality and overall educational attainment. Our empirical illustration is based on Eurostat data for the year 2011.
Parental stress and children's school performance: Are locals doing better than rural-to-urban migrants in Beijing?;This study provides the first empirical evidence on whether parental stress is associated with children's school performance (measured by academic performance and peer relations) for rural-to-urban migrants (n = 499) and local residents (n = 299) in Beijing, China. Results from regression analyses showed that children of local families systematically scored better than those of migrants on measures of school performance. Correlation between parental stress and academic performance was found among locals but not among migrant households. Further, although children's peer relations were negatively associated with parental stress among migrant families, the duration of their residence in Beijing did not moderate this association. This study probed the structural origins of stressors for migrant parents and discussed implications for community-based social work services in urban China for migrant families.
The Academic Self-Concept of Ninth Graders with a Turkish Background and Ninth Graders Without a Migration Background;Academic self-concepts, i.e., a person's assessments of his or her own abilities at school, play an important role in educational psychology but have so far received little attention in sociological educational research. However, because they influence school performance and educational decisions, the consideration of self-concepts can contribute to a better understanding of educational inequalities. The ambitious educational choices of students with a Turkish migration background indicate that, despite their often rather poor performance, they consider their abilities to be sufficiently high to successfully complete demanding educational careers. In fact, based on data from the National Educational Panel Study, we can show that ninth-graders with a Turkish background assess their academic abilities more positively than comparable pupils without a migration background. This is particularly the case among students attending a Gymnasium. Contrary to theoretical assumptions, the ambitious educational aspirations of parents of Turkish origin contribute only a small part in explaining these differences.
The Effect of Economic, Social and Cultural Status on Academic Achievement A Comparison of PISA 2015 and TEOG 2017 Results;"The purpose of this research; to examine the effects of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) characteristics on students' central examination (TEOG) scores. The research was done on Ankara sample and stratified sampling method was preferred in the research. In the sample schools, information on the characteristics of economic, social and cultural status was collected from 9th grade students. Firstly, an economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) index was calculated for each student. Then, the relationship between students' TEOG scores, ESCS index values and school characteristics were analyzed. As a result of the research; it was determined that there is a strong and mutual relationshipbetween students' academic achievement indicators and economic, social and cultural status index. When the effect of ESCS on students' TEOG scores is examined, it is concluded that this effect is much higher than the rate of effect revealed in PISA research. Research findings; it shows that ESCS affects academic success and supports the reproduction theory in the education system. This research showed that Turkey appears to work less egalitarian than in PISA reality of the education system."
Resist the Covid-19. Intersections in Education in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico;In 2020, Mexico faced the new coronavirus disease declared as a public health emergency of international importance. In response, during the month of March the Ministry of Public Education and the Ministry of Health implemented a set of measures to prevent and contain the spread of the virus. The objectives are: first, to identify the actions implemented by the Mexican government, and to analyze its pedagogical, social and economic implications. A qualitative documentary exercise was carried out, it allowed the location, classification, selection, analysis and comparison of various documents. As a result, three priority actions and 20 primary care measures were identified for their implementation throughout the national territory. It was found that the closure of the schools revealed a set of challenges for the educational authorities, teachers and families, while the execution of these measures is configured in a network of educational, social and economic circumstances that deep in educational inequality. It is concluded that schools and teachers are key agents in health containment, however, the conditions of the schools and the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities define the experience of prevention and confinement.
School Closings and Socio-Educational Inequality in Times of Covid-19. An Exploratory Research in an International Key;The Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has changed the modus vivendi of thousands of people around the world. Exceptionality and emergency have influenced various sectors and areas of the social and institutional life of human beings, such as health, economics, politics or education. The objective of this study is to offer an international perspective on the process of school closure and its educational-social consequences through the perceptions of key informants. With a sample that reaches 23 countries and 4 different continents, perceptions have been analyzed based on seven categories: Timing of execution, anticipation or delay of measures. Democratic-participatory nature of the educational measures taken. Curricular, didactic and methodological adaptation. Infrastructure and resources for adequate distance training. Perceptions about teachers. Perceptions of the family environment. Alternative proposals. The results show a high diversity of ways of facing this situation, but with similar consequences for the most vulnerable population. This implies a wake-up call to managers and agents in the educational field to curb the educational and social inequality that Covid-19 may be generating.
Social Network Replies that Denounce Inequalities of the #AprenderDigital Strategy in Time of Covid-19;The Colombian Ministry of Education publishes the #AprenderDigital strategy on social networks to counteract the massive closure of schools due to covid-19. However, the public makes a dissatisfied reply to this homogeneous initiative. This research with a qualitative approach aims, first, to classify in categories of analysis the citizen replies made to the publications of the National Ministry of Colombia on Twitter and Facebook under the hashtag #AprenderDigital. Second, to discuss, within the framework of citizen replies, the expressions of educational inequality exacerbated by the digital strategy, in addition to offering some lessons learned for post-pandemic digital educational policy in Colombia. The method involved retrieving the citizen replicas and the data with the support of the qualitative analysis software Atlas ti. The replicas were classified into three categories: 1. Access replicas. 2. Curricular replicas. 3. Exhortations. To the end, we discuss the strength of the study to ratify educational inequality in times of covid-19, the homogeneity of emergency educational policies that deny differences, we reflect on the necessary subjectivity policies and we provide some reflections on the direction of post pandemic digital policies. Finally, we value the fertility that means recovering replicas in social networks for research in social sciences.
Exploring the changing dynamics of social class educational inequality throughout the history of state education in England: an analysis of four policy documents;This article contributes a historically reflective critical exploration of the relationship between English state education and social class. In analysing selected historically significant policy documents, the article provides insights into the changing dynamics of social class educational inequality in England. Specifically, how across the life course of English education social class has been 'washed out' or 'erased' from policy documentation and either transmuted into different, sometimes unrelated, ideas or ignored altogether. Firstly, an introduction is locates the contemporary significance of social class to education in England. Thereafter, a section contextualises the history of education in England before the policy documents are analysed. These are: Report of the Schools Inquiry Commission (1868), Report of the Royal Commission on Secondary Education (1895), Secondary Education (1938), and Better Schools (1985). All four documents were not only written at times of policy significance and informed significant government policy but represent important trends in their own right. Through analysing these documents, it is clear how the presence of social class in official policy documents transitioned from unproblematically stated to ignored and 'washed out'. In the final section, this pattern observed is assessed through broader dynamics taking place throughout the twentieth century. What is argued is that although social class was increasingly erased from education policy documentation the significance of it remained but was henceforth misrecognised and hidden. The findings indicate how contemporary social inequalities cannot be addressed in any meaningful way without engaging with the historical genealogies of such inequality and appreciating its historic roots.
'It was more a fear of the school thinking that I'd be a troublemaker'- Inappropriate use of internal exclusion through labelling by association with siblings;Within neoliberal education systems, elements of marketisation are endemic and this brings with it the invasive pressures of performativity. Against this backdrop, discipline in schools is in many instances being more closely monitored and tightly controlled, with the implementation of strict and in some cases 'zero-tolerance' behaviour management policies. Can such an emphasis on compliance and control feed into greater educational inequality and marginalisation and if so through what means? This paper elucidates one possible mechanism through which the enforcement of strict behaviour management policies may fuel marginalisation - namely through inappropriate use of internal exclusions, via an example of courtesy stigma that I term 'labelling by association with siblings. ' This emerges as part of a wider ethnographic study into marginalised students in secondary school. The student participants have each spent time outside the mainstream classroom setting, working instead in an on-site withdrawal unit. Through poignant first-hand telling of his experiences, one marginalised student exemplifies and illustrates such labelling by association with his siblings and its consequences. He is adamant that this indelible association with his brother marked him out and stigmatised him, with very real and profound consequences for his educational trajectory or 'moral career', as well as for his permissible learner identities. Close monitoring of internal exclusions, or reforms promoting a more nuanced approach to behaviour management - preferably in conjunction with a reversal of neoliberal in-roads into education- are needed, to mitigate the barrier to educational equality which internal exclusion though labelling by association with siblings presents.
Educational inequalities in disability linked to social security coverage among older individuals in five Latin American countries;Although Latin American populations are ageing rapidly, many countries have important shortcomings in terms of access to social security coverage. Despite significant improvements regarding access to healthcare, the coverage gap in terms of pensions represents a major challenge for public health and equity in the region. The principal aim of this study was to systematically assess the association between social security coverage and disability among older individuals in five Latin American countries, as well as the extent of existing inequalities and its determinants. To do so we use cross-sectional and comparative data for individuals aged 60 and older in Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Paraguay and Uruguay from the Longitudinal Social Protection Survey (ELPS). We used multivariate regression to assess the association between disability and healthcare as well as pension coverage. Concentration indices (CI) and an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition approach were used to assess overall inequalities in disability according to education as well as their components. With the exception of El Salvador, we find significant inequalities in disability disfavoring lower educated individuals. With regards to healthcare, we find no significant association of healthcare coverage with disability in any of the five countries, nor does it explain educational inequalities in disability. However, pension access was associated with lower risks of disability in Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Uruguay, and explains a substantial share of educational inequality in Chile, Colombia and Paraguay. Whereas significant changes have already been made regarding universal healthcare coverage, the results suggest that expanding access to pensions may not only lead to improvements in health among older individuals in the region, but also substantially reduce socio-economic inequalities in health and successful ageing.
The Caste of Merit: Engineering Education in India;Subramanian's The Caste of Merit addresses the issue of educational inequality in colonial and independent India, focusing on the Indian Institutes of Technology (iits) that have trained the engineering elites since the 1950s. The members of the high caste who initially comprised this group ascribed their personal success to merit, not to background. India's policy of allowing disadvantaged caste groups to enter the (iits), however, challenged the high castes' representation of their educational privilege as simply a matter of talent. Subramanian's view of the upper-caste position as an attempt to forestall progress toward a more egalitarian Indian society opens a methodological debate about the fundamental epistemic demands that scholars must satisfy before they adopt social causes above and beyond the conveying of objective information.
An Empirical Study of Teacher-Student Interaction in College English Classroom from the Perspective of Educational Equality;Educational equality is seen as the cornerstone of social justice. Likewise, ensuring the equality of teacher-student interaction in the classroom plays a crucial part in meeting the requirements of social justice. In college English classroom, teachers are expected to provide students with equal opportunities to interact with one another through communicative and collaborative activities so as to give the full play of students' potential. However, it is worth noting that the unequal status in current teacher-student interaction may pose serious threat to the implementation of educational equality in higher education system. Therefore, taking the 85 students of Zhejiang Yuexiu University as research participants, the study, spanning from September 2019 to January 2020, is designed to investigate the factors that influence teachers' educational equality mindset and to assess whether the significant difference between these variables and inequality in classroom interaction exists by adopting the research instruments of classroom observation, interview and questionnaire. The data collected reveal that the inequality can be discerned in teacher-student interaction in college English classroom, for the teacher's questioning times, question types, and feedback types are closely associated with the differences of genders, personalities, regions and English levels of students. In addition, the root causes for the inequality are also examined discreetly from multi-perspectives through interviews on both teachers and students for better proposing some effective strategies to minimize educational inequality and facilitate students' development in positive directions in college English education.
Getting the Teacher's Attention: Parent-Teacher Contact and Teachers' Behavior in the Classroom;Studies suggest that both parental involvement and support from teachers matter for students' academic success. Although cross-national research has revealed numerous ways in which parents shape the schooling process, less clear is whether parental involvement at school can influence teachers' daily behavior toward students in class. In this study, I draw on data from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS)-a nationally representative survey of Chinese middle-school students with unusually detailed information on parental involvement and teachers' daily behaviors-to test a conceptual model that proposes a link between parent-teacher contact in China and attention students receive from teachers during daily lessons. In support of the conceptual model, I find that students whose parents cultivate relationships with teachers through frequent contact are more likely to be cold-called on and praised by teachers in class, even after controlling for family background, student academic performance, and student behavior. Moreover, I observe social class differences in parent-teacher contact, as well as some evidence that parent-teacher contact is linked to improved student performance through its impact on teachers' attention. Overall, the findings point to a potential new pathway through which social class influences schooling byway of school-based parental involvement and in a broader set of contexts than previously imagined. I conclude with a discussion of implications for social reproduction theory, as well as challenges this situation presents for combatting educational inequality.
Educate and punish. Demands, accessibility and socio-educational trajectories in a maximum security prison in the province of Santa Fe (Argentina);In the present work we will investigate about the coexistence and collusion between the practices of punishing and educating, ideological constructs present in the origin of the modern prison (Foucault, 2004), which still persist in educational processes in confinement contexts. This work perspective will be approached based on an analysis of the conditions of access to socio-educational practices in a maximum security prison, belonging to the Penitentiary Service of the Province of Santa Fe (Argentina), which the socio-educational trajectories of people deprived of their liberty are configured, accompanied by processes of educational inequality that traced their experiences prior to hole prison. Starting from the central hypothesis that these practices, in UP N degrees 11 -although we will address here-are characterized as a potential demand -and expanded- not satisfied (Sirvent, 1998) by the relation of two variables: the educational level attained by people deprived of their freedom, and the institutional conditions of the prison -in relation to the access and excercise to educational and cultural practices-, we will try to elaborate some partial conclusions from the analysis of a series of quantitative data constructed within the framework of a survey carried out in three of the five prisons in the southern province.
Territorialities and inequalities of orientation: what the terrain does to these two concepts and their interrelations. (Reflections from the case of France);Except - and still very rarely - in recent years, the relationships between territorialities, or symbolic territories, and specific inequalities of orientation have hardly been really studied. Francophone, Lusophone and Hispanophone literatures on the subject, dealing specifically with this complex issue, today only brings together a few rare scientific articles, sometimes general (Champollion, 2015), sometimes linked to a particular territorial context, in this case the mountain (Champollion, 2019). The first part of this review article will address the progressive differentiation of the notion of educational inequality which appears today to be more and more multifactorial (contextual, educational in terms of performance, orientation, etc.). The second part, it will deal with the progressive differentiation of the different dimensions of the notion of territory - institutional, lived, symbolic, internalized, in particular - which saw recently, at the end of the XXth century, the emergence of territoriality. The third part, finally, will focus more particularly, once this conceptual framework has been set, on the impact of territoriality on the academic and professional orientation of students.
The politics of educational transitions: Evidence from Catalonia;Transitions to upper secondary education are of crucial importance to understanding educational inequalities. They are also vital in explaining the contemporary dynamics of Early School Leaving. Global hegemonic discourses around educational transitions and Early School Leaving shape student pathways in terms of rational and linear choices, assuming equal opportunities for lifelong learning. Simultaneously, the European Strategy attributes key roles to Vocational Education and Training and to guidance in order to smooth educational transitions, reduce Early School Leaving and meet the needs of the knowledge-based economy. The aim of the article is to problematise the linear relationship between Early School Leaving, Vocational Education and Training, and guidance policies representing the dominant contemporary rhetoric concerned with ensuring smooth transitions and opening up long-term educational pathways for young people. The article provides an in-depth analysis of the political construction of the transition from lower to upper secondary education in Catalonia, identifying how it is conceptualised at a discursive level by policy actors and also how it is implemented at the institutional level. The results aim to be regarded as a useful analytical resource to inform critical policy analyses of educational transitions and their implications in terms of social inequalities.
School-to-school collaboration in England: A configurative review of the empirical evidence;In recent years school-to-school collaboration in the English context has been promoted by a myriad of policy initiatives. Many of these initiatives have been directed at structural reforms seeking to facilitate a 'self-improving system' in which schools support one another to raise standards of teaching and learning and address educational inequality. Yet, at the same time, the English school system remains a deeply marketised and competitive arena while there are debates concerning the extent to which collaboration between schools can meaningfully facilitate educational improvement and equity. Taking these issues as a starting point, this paper reports on findings from a configurative review of the empirical evidence on school-to-school collaboration in England. Drawing on 46 peer-reviewed empirical studies from 2000 onwards, the paper provides insight into the reasons why schools enter into collaborative arrangements and the conditions and factors that can facilitate and hinder such activity, as well as the possible benefits that can result from collaboration between schools. A number of weaknesses within the field are also identified. For example, there is a need for more conceptual and terminological clarity and a stronger theoretical basis for research in this area. We also argue that the field is deficient in respect of critical perspective and interpretation (of collaborative practice). Furthermore, research into school-to-school collaboration is lagging behind policy and practice, presenting a formidable challenge for a system increasingly underpinned by an expectation that schools will work in partnership with one another.
Primary and secondary effects of social background across secondary education: Decomposing effects at three educational transitions;Secondary education is characterised by a sequence of transitions that are linked to educational inequality. Regarding social background effects, inequalities relate to disparities in educational achievement (primary effects) and educational decisions (secondary effects). In the present study, both primary and secondary effects are analysed based on an entire student cohort in the Hamburg school system (KESS study) across the course of secondary education, i.e. from entering secondary school to aiming for higher education. The KHB method is applied in order to decompose the effects, including transitions to upper secondary education. In line with previous research, total social background effects decrease across educational trajectories. No clear pattern emerges concerning an assumed increase in the relative importance of secondary effects. Primary effects operationalised by school grades are slightly predominant in the transition to lower secondary education, and nearly the same ratio is found for the transition to upper secondary education. However, regarding the aim to enter higher education, the relative importance of secondary effects is more clearly discernible.
Ordinal Approaches to Decomposing Between-Group Test Score Disparities;The estimation of test score gaps and gap trends plays an important role in monitoring educational inequality. Researchers decompose gaps and gap changes into within- and between-school portions to generate evidence on the role schools play in shaping these inequalities. However, existing decomposition methods assume an equal-interval test scale and are a poor fit to coarsened data such as proficiency categories. This leaves many potential data sources ill-suited for decomposition applications. We develop two decomposition approaches that overcome these limitations: an extension of V, an ordinal gap statistic, and an extension of ordered probit models. Simulations show V decompositions have negligible bias with small within-school samples. Ordered probit decompositions have negligible bias with large within-school samples but more serious bias with small within-school samples. More broadly, our methods enable analysts to (1) decompose the difference between two groups on any ordinal outcome into portions within- and between some third categorical variable and (2) estimate scale-invariant between-group differences that adjust for a categorical covariate.
School-to-School Differences in Instructional Practice: New Descriptive Evidence on Opportunity to Learn;Background/Context: There is continuing debate among social scientists and educators about the role of school-to-school differences in generating educational inequality. Are some students high achieving because they attend School A, while others struggle because they attend School B, as critical discourse on schools argues? Alternatively, is educational inequality driven largely by social forces outside of the school, in the home and neighborhood environment, or by educational processes that are largely common across schools as much social science research argues? Analyses of school achievement, and in particular test score gains from year-to-year, suggest very small between-school differences. Yet, analyses of test score data alone may fail to reveal important school-to-school differences that affect the quality of the classroom experience and a variety of educational outcomes. Purpose/Objective: We provide evidence on the following research questions. What is the magnitude of school-to-school variation in instructional practice, as captured by multiple measures? Are some domains of instruction (e.g., behavioral management) more variable between schools than others? To what extent are school-to-school differences in instruction associated with compositional characteristics of students and teachers? Research Design: This study relies on the Measures of Effective Teaching Study data, which offer an unprecedented set of observations of teachers' instruction scored on state-of-the-art observational protocols. To examine the extent of school-to-school variation in instructional practice in elementary and middle schools, we conducted a decomposition of variance analysis using summary scores on multiple measures. We further examine behavioral climate as revealed during instruction separately from overall instructional practice. Next, we examine differences in instruction associated with compositional characteristics of students using multilevel models. Finally, we use an innovative two-stage statistical adjustment strategy to more narrowly identify the possible association between composition and teaching practice due to school-to-school teacher sorting. Findings/Results: The basic descriptive results from this study suggest a middle view of school-to-school differences in instruction. We find that substantial school-level variation in instruction exists, with 30% or more of the total variance in instruction lying between schools in these data. Behavioral climate during instruction appears to be particularly salient, and especially in elementary schools. Much of the between school variance we identify, in some cases 40% or more, is readily explained by simple measures of socio-demographic composition, including in particular the racial make-up of schools in the MET districts. Finally, some evidence from a statistical adjustment method suggests that teacher sorting, rather than measurement bias and teacher adaptation, is principally responsible for school-to-school differences in instruction. Conclusions/Recommendations: More than an academic debate, basic differences between schools in the quality of the learning environment, along with parental understandings and beliefs about school effects, are potentially important drivers of school and neighborhood sorting and segregation, and even public investment in schooling. Additionally, this question carries continued policy relevance as states adopt and revise teacher and school accountability frameworks that implicitly attribute school-to-school differences to organizational functioning, and seek to carry out instructional improvement efforts in targeted schools. The basic descriptive results from this study suggest school-level differences are not as great as suggested by critical theory and the public discourse, but neither are they as inconsequential as one might infer from some social science research or the literature on value-added differences between schools.
Black-White Achievement Gaps Differ by Family Socioeconomic Status From Early Childhood Through Early Adolescence;Theory and limited research indicate that race and socioeconomic status (SES) interact dynamically to shape children's developmental contexts and academic achievement, but little scholarship examines how race and SES intersect to shape Black-White achievement gaps across development. We used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (N approximate to 9,100)-which tracks a nationally representative cohort of children in the United States-to investigate how race and family SES (i.e., parental education and household income) intersect to shape trajectories of academic skills development from kindergarten entry through the spring of eighth grade. Results reveal that household income and parental education were differentially related to academic development, with Black-White gaps narrowing (and Black children's skills growing slightly faster) at higher income gradients but widening (and Black children's skills developing more slowly) at higher levels of educational attainment. Despite performance advantages at kindergarten entry, large baseline disparities meant that higher-income Black students underperformed their White peers by middle school, whereas Black students with better-educated parents consistently trailed their White counterparts. Taken together, these findings suggest that failure to examine how race and SES intersect to shape achievement gaps may obscure complex patterns of educational inequality. Educational Impact and Implications Statement This study examines how the Black-White achievement gap among U.S. students develops from kindergarten through middle school. Results indicate that the academic returns to family socioeconomic status (SES) differ for Black and White children. Specifically, gaps narrow at higher income levels but grow at higher levels of parental education. This research indicates that socioeconomic advantage may not bestow the same benefits on Black children that it does on White children whereas socioeconomic adversity may not confer equivalent disadvantages on White children as it does on Black children. These findings suggest that the structural and social privileges and constraints related to SES differ for Black and White children and highlight why we must consider how race and SES intersect to shape children's learning experiences.
Cameroonian responses to COVID-19 in the education sector: Exposing an inadequate education system;"This article presents and interprets Cameroonian responses to COVID-19 in the education sector. The four main challenges the Cameroonian educational authorities found themselves facing at the onset of the pandemic were (1) how to ensure continuity of formal education; (2) how to minimise exacerbation of already existing educational inequalities; (3) which tools to choose for ensuring continuity; and (4) how to enable pupils and students at exam stage to progress to the next level of their academic career. To collect relevant data for his analysis of how these challenges have been addressed, the author used three tools: documentary analysis, interviews, and digital observation of distance learning platforms. His findings form a detailed panorama of educational responses to COVID-19 in Cameroon. These include institutional, community and individual initiatives, ranging from paper-based materials to distance learning platforms, TV and radio communication tools. The implementation of these approaches, however, has revealed that the Cameroonian education system is plagued by disorganisation, educational inequalities and exclusion - problems which affect learners' daily lives on a personal level. The structural and pedagogical deficits revealed by the findings of this study demonstrate that Cameroon must insist on two things if it wants to guarantee educational normality in the event of other similar crises, namely (1) integrating distance-learning technologies; and (2) improving access to essential socio-educational services."
The Effect of Studying in Selective Classes on the Change in Pupils' Action-Control Beliefs During Lower Secondary School in Finland;Tracking pupils based on their abilities or other aptitudes is a common practice in many countries. In Finland, selective classes with a special emphasis have become popular. The societal and individual effects of tracking are a topic of ongoing educational discussion. Tracking has been seen to increase educational inequality, but still it has been defended as an important practice enabling individualised and adjusted teaching. This study examined whether studying in a selective class with a special emphasis has an effect on the development of pupils' action-control beliefs from grade seven to nine. Results showed that pupils who studied in classes with a special emphasis showed greater achievement and were more likely to have highly-educated mothers than pupils in classes without an emphasis. This selectivity explained most of the differences found in action-control beliefs between classes. Pairwise comparisons showed small differences in the change of certain action-control beliefs between classes.
COVID-19 and risks for disadvantaged students: a media coverage analysis from a cultural psychology perspective;The health and social crisis caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had an especially strong impact on the academic prospects the most vulnerable populations in society. This paper focuses on the consequences of the current crisis in terms of their potential to negatively impact school disengagement and early school-leaving rates. First, the author reviews the causes of early school leaving, divided into exogenous and endogenous factors. Second, the key findings of a media coverage analysis are presented. This analysis focuses on key educational aspects and consequences related to the COVID-19 crisis and the potential impact on disengagement, early school leaving and educational inequality gaps. Lastly, in the light of those consequences, a sociocultural model of behaviour is suggested as a useful lens to envision solutions.
Educational Transitions and Educational Inequality: A Multiple Pathways Sequential Logit Model Analysis of Finnish Birth Cohorts 1960-1985;We developed a multiple pathways sequential logit model for analysing social background inequality in completed education and applied it to analyse educational inequality in Finland (birth cohorts 1960-1985). Our model builds on the sequential logit model for educational transitions, originally presented by Robert D. Mare and later extended by Maarten Buis, which disaggregates inequality in completed education into the weighted sum of inequalities in the transitions leading to it. Although the educational transitions framework is popular among educational stratification researchers, its applications have almost exclusively focused on analysing inequalities in separate educational transitions. Buis presented a unifying model of inequalities in educational transitions and completed education, which gives a substantive interpretation to the weights that link them. We applied this to an educational system in which the same educational outcomes can be reached through multiple pathways. Our analysis of Finnish register data shows that intergenerational educational persistence increased, particularly among women. The main reasons are increased inequality in academic upper-secondary (gymnasium) completion and gymnasium expansion that increased the weight of this transition as well as of the transition to university. We discuss the integration of structural and allocative mechanisms in educational stratification research.
Cognitive Homogenization, Educational Achievement and Social Inequality;"Channeling students into different educational tracks based on their cognitive abilities (ability tracking) is assumed to foster educational achievement for all students by creating homogeneous learning contexts in school. Critics however question such beneficial effects and claim that ability tracking aggravates social inequalities. This view could be deemed the standard position of previous research. Starting from a general theoretical model, the present study examines the effects of ability tracking with different degrees of strictness on student achievement in secondary education. Using data of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we compare the educational systems of the German federal states, which differ considerably with regard to the strictness of tracking regulations. Findings indicate that strict ability tracking improves educational achievement in secondary education, without aggravating influences of social origin. Students in cognitively homogeneous classrooms with lower average ability composition particularly benefit from strict ability tracking. The students in cognitively homogeneous classrooms perform worst when liberal tracking is implemented and best under strict tracking regulations. In classrooms with higher average ability levels, by contrast, cognitive homogeneity appears to be less relevant; students in cognitively heterogeneous classrooms here even tend to outperform those with a more homogeneous classroom composition. These results clearly contradict findings of previous studies that support the standard position. This discrepancy might reflect methodological shortcomings of previous studies. Particularly the bulk of contributions that are based on cross-national data, oftentimes lack appropriate means to test the theoretical assumptions and/or are unable to include all relevant factors in the analyses."
Riche comme un argentin: educational inequality in belle epoque Argentina;"In this paper we attempt to show that belle epoque Argentina was, persistently, a geographically unequal country in terms of human capital. Although the distribution of teachers and enrolment rates improved significantly between 1883 and 1914, the distribution of literacy rates did not improve at the same rate. We propose three explanations for this phenomenon: the role of European immigration; differences in regional economies that date back, in part, to colonial times; and, finally, the absence of a labor market that generates incentives for investment in education.

Tracking and inequality: The results from Turkey;This qualitative study aims to analyse the effects of the practice of tracking as the means of placing students in secondary schools on educational inequality in Turkey in light of a set of qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews. Findings indicate that the tracking of all students into different high schools based on their scores on the national high school entrance examination since 2014 poses new obstacles for the academic success of low-achieving poor children due to various unintended consequences posed by the school environments. The study has implications for other educational systems that track students based on exam scores.
Encouraged or Discouraged? The Effect of Adverse Macroeconomic Conditions on School Leaving and Reentry;Existing research generally confirms a countercyclical education enrollment, whereby youths seek shelter in the educational system to avoid hardships in the labor market: the discouraged worker thesis. Alternatively, the encouraged worker thesis predicts that economic downturns steer individuals away from education because of higher opportunity costs. This study provides a formal test of these opposing theories using data from the United States compared with similar sources from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Sweden. I investigate whether macroeconomic stimuli-including recessions and youth unemployment fluctuations-matter for enrollment decisions. Analyses rely on 10 years of detailed individual-level panel data, consisting of birth cohorts across several decades. Across data sources, results show enrollment persistence in secondary education is stronger in response to economic downturns. These patterns differ sharply for tertiary-enrolled students and those who recently left higher education. Surprisingly, U.S. youths display an increased hazard of school leaving and a decreased hazard of educational reenrollment in response to adverse conditions. In contrast, European youths tend to make enrollment decisions supportive of discouraged-worker mechanisms or insensitivity to adverse conditions. The U.S.-specific encouraged-worker mechanism might be explained by the relative importance of market forces in one's early career and the high costs of university attendance, which induces risk aversion with regard to educational investment. The discussion addresses the consequences for educational inequality.
Human rights and education for Gambian young women during COVID-19: Recommendations for social policy and practice;"COVID-19 is not only a global health disaster but a full-fledged social, economic, and political crisis that could disrupt the gains made in women's education and empowerment. In The Gambia, issues of unequal access to educational resources determined by gender, geographical location, and social class; a disproportionate burden of household chores imposed on women and girls; and economic pressures have the potential to expose girls to more violence, exclusion, and abuse. In this article, we use a human rights framework, as conceptualized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW), and discuss increases in educational inequality that young women in a poor, conservative, and patriarchal society will face during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose solutions to mitigate these issues through social protection policies and practices that can ensure the right to education for the most vulnerable and marginalized."
Gaming the no-choice system? School choice and persistent educational inequality in China;The admission policy for public compulsory schools in China is neighbourhood enrolment which entitles children to attend their assigned local school free of charge, and this policy has been rigorously implemented in recent years to prevent school choice. However, driven by disparities in education provision, parents still find ways to make choices in an officially no-choice public educational system. Inspired by a Bourdieusian framework, this study uses the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to explore the relationships between family capital, school choice, and the quality of the school pupils attend. We seek to offer a lens to explore the prevalence and patterns of school choice, and its impact on constructing educational stratification. Findings suggest persistent inequality in the no-choice policy context and that children from more privileged families are more likely to study in higher performing schools.
Vietnam's extraordinary performance in the PISA assessment: A cultural explanation of an education paradox;This paper examines the nature and drivers of Vietnam's paradoxical performance in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - consistently high student achievement despite being the poorest of all participating countries and a centralized education system. We first document 'Vietnam advantage' in a wide-range of supply and demand-related indicators such as school participation rate, educational inequality, inputs and expenditure in cross-country regression models. We then estimate an augmented educational production function to show that these supply and demand-side advantages don't explain away Vietnam's positive deviance in PISA when compared to other participating developing and developed countries. We then conduct student-level analysis to examine Vietnam's performance in PISA 2012 in a regional context, vis-a-vis three high-spending but low-performing ASEAN member countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand) and two high performing Asian countries (South Korea and Singapore). Pooled regression estimates show that, holding differences in various indices of socioeconomic background, the gap in average student test scores between Vietnam and South Korea in Reading and Science becomes statistically insignificant. Moreover, once school-specific differences are also accounted for, Vietnamese students do just as well as Singaporean across all subjects - equalizing for existing socioeconomic differences between countries would give Vietnam an even better advantage in PISA. A similar gain in PISA scores is absent in the case of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The paper concludes by offering a cultural explanation for the significant variation in educational performance among high-spending East Asian countries. (C) 2020 The Society for Policy Modeling.

Main methodological procedures for the analysis of the composition of educational inequality;The study of educational inequality in Spain has been hindered by the lack of appropriate longitudinal datasets on educational transitions. As a result, different methodological procedures common in the study of educational inequality in the international context have been barely implemented in the Spanish case, which contributes to a widespread lack of awareness of their existence. This work intends to offer a pedagogical review of such procedures, exemplifying their use with the expectation of transition to post-compulsory education as it was manifested by the participants in 2015 PISA. In the first place, I present a set of techniques aimed to decompose inequality in an educational transition (expectation of transition in this case) into a primary (via performance) and a secondary effect (directly on the decision-making). Applied to the expectation of transition to post-compulsory education in Spain, just 40% of inequality works through the performance exhibit in PISA. In the second place, I introduce the KHB method, aimed at addressing the rescaling problem in non-linear nested models which, applied to the study of educational inequality, makes it possible to test the participation of specific decision-making mechanisms in the construction of inequalities. Finally, I present the Compensatory Advantage model, where secondary effects are supposed to be non-constant and inequality is supposed to concentrate at low levels of performance. Indeed, we observe that the largest inequalities are found at the bottom of the performance distribution and that this compensation mechanism accounts for 20% of the observed inequality.
Cultural capital in migration: Academic achievements of Chinese migrant children in urban public schools;"The educational inequality faced by migrant children is a great social problem in China. The government has gradually reformed the hukou system, allowing migrant children to attend urban public schools. However, their academic achievements continue to lag behind those of urban non-migrant children. The classic explanation would point to a lack of social capital; this article argues for the importance of cultural capital in children's migration. Drawing upon 10,417 middle school children (14-16 years old), this article examines cultural and social capital as mechanisms through which migration affects education. Results show that the lower academic achievements of Chinese migrant children is mainly due to the mediating effect of objectified cultural capital. Family social capital is also a significant mediator, but the indirect effect is relatively small. Most surprising is the contradictory effects of embodied and objectified cultural capital on academic achievements. Theoretical contributions and policy implications are discussed."
A Metaregression Analysis of the Effects of School Racial and Ethnic Composition on K-12 Reading, Language Arts, and English Outcomes;Racial and ethnic differences in educational outcomes significantly narrowed during the 1970s and 1980s when K-12 public schools were desegregated. However, when schools resegregated starting roughly in the late 1980s, racial gaps in outcomes widened again. Because of literacy's pivotal role in learning, the authors investigate if segregation contributes to racial gaps in K-12 reading performance. Drawing upon structural vulnerability and cumulative advantage/disadvantage theories to frame this study, the authors conduct multilevel metaregression analyses of 131 effect sizes from 30 primary studies to investigate if school composition effects contribute to racial gaps in K-12 reading outcomes and if any effects vary in magnitude or direction for students from different racial/ethnic backgrounds or grade levels. The metaregression analyses control for the primary studies' regression model characteristics and research designs. The results indicate a small, negative, statistically significant relationship between the percentage of a school's disadvantaged minority enrollment and the mean reading achievement of the students who attend it. The negative association is stronger when segregation is measured by percentage Black and is stronger for high school students. These two findings suggest that the disadvantages of segregated education cumulate as more structurally vulnerable students transition from elementary to secondary school. Additional results suggest that a school's racial composition effect is not the same as its socioeconomic status composition effect. The two organizational characteristics have distinct, albeit interrelated, influences on reading scores. Together the findings suggest that racially and ethnically segregated schooling both reflects and helps reproduce racial/ethnic inequality in literacy outcomes.
A century of educational inequality in the United States;The income inequality hypothesis holds that rising income inequality affects the distribution of a wide range of social and economic outcomes. Although it is often alleged that rising income inequality will increase the advantages of the well-off in the competition for college, some researchers have provided descriptive evidence at odds with the income inequality hypothesis. In this paper, we track long-term trends in family income inequalities in college enrollment and completion (collegiate inequalities) using all available nationally representative datasets for cohorts born between 1908 and 1995. We show that the trends in collegiate inequalities moved in lockstep with the trend in income inequality over the past century. There is one exception to this general finding: For cohorts at risk for serving in the Vietnam War, collegiate inequalities were high, while income inequality was low. During this period, inequality in college enrollment and completion was significantly higher for men than for women, suggesting a bona fide Vietnam War effect. Aside from this singular confounding event, a century of evidence establishes a strong association between income and collegiate inequality, providing support for the view that rising income inequality is fundamentally changing the distribution of life chances.
Postsecondary Outcomes of Innovative High Schools: The Big Picture Longitudinal Study;Context: Educational reform efforts have taken the form of different school models intended to reduce educational inequality. Personalized, interest-based schools and academically focused, No Excuses schools are two leading small-school designs with sharply contrasting approaches to innovation. Given mixed research findings about the successes and challenges of school reform models in the United States, it is imperative to understand how educational outcomes of students relate to the philosophy and distinguishing characteristics of particular school models such as these. At the same time, evaluating social mobility effects of high school education across educational reform models requires examination of common metrics such as high school graduation rate and college entrance and degree attainment. Purpose: This study sought to establish whether and how a personalized, interest-based secondary school reform model is associated with graduates' characteristics and postsecondary outcomes-and to place these findings in relation to student outcomes reported by a leading No Excuses school network. Setting: Big Picture Learning is a network of innovative small schools that serves primarily low-income and minoritized students through an individualized, relational, real-world-based high school experience. The Big Picture educational model features individualized learning plans connected to extensive internships, independent learning organized around student interests, authentic assessments, and close, informal relationships between students and adults. Research Design: The Big Picture Longitudinal Study tracked 1900 graduates from six graduating high school classes. Data sources included student and school advisor surveys, National Student Clearinghouse college enrollment data, and interviews with graduates' former advisors. Published outcomes data for KIPP No Excuses schools provided comparative information. Analyses comprised descriptive statistics of survey data and multivariate regression analyses connecting high school exit data to college outcomes. Findings: The Big Picture Learning model is extremely successful in meeting its stated goals of fostering positive relationships, helping students discover and pursue their interests, and promoting high school graduation and college entrance. Results for academic subject achievement and college persistence are mixed, however. Big Picture graduates have similar college matriculation rates but somewhat lower six-year graduation rates than alumni from the KIPP No Excuses school network. Alumni from both networks show high rates of college attrition. Conclusion: When taken alone and in context of other innovative school models, the Big Picture results point to the difficulty of sustaining secondary school gains in the post-high school lives of low-income students and highlight shortcomings of traditional colleges in serving this population.
School Closures, Equality of Opportunity: Some Recommendations;To mitigate the educational disruption, during the coronavirus pandemic, countries work to facilitate the continuity of learning by using mobile technologies for teaching and learning. Despite the development of mobile communication technology and Although distance education has been developed for several years, it is still widely regarded as falling to assure educational equality. Remote learning during this pandemic crisis is challenging. Policy makers, school principals, teachers, students and parents are all juggling unusual responsibilities. This paper reviews the school closures literature, highlights the equality of opportunity challenge and gives some guidance to effectively implement a productive learning programme.
Malnutrition in all its forms and socio-economic indicators in Argentina;Objective: To assess the prevalence of five forms of malnutrition (wasting/underweight, overweight, obesity, stunting/short stature and anaemia) by socio-economic wealth (SEW) and educational level (EL) among children, adolescents and women of reproductive age in Argentina. Design: Analysis from a cross-sectional survey. Anthropometric indicators and prevalence of anaemia were estimated. SEW was classified according to the proportion of contributors in the household, employment status, EL and medical coverage. EL was categorized by years of formal education. Setting: National Health and Nutrition Survey, 2005. Participants: Children (n27 015) <5 years, adolescent girls (n1729) 11-19 years, women (n4401) 20-49 years. Results: In Argentina, 26 % of households lived with unsatisfied basic needs and 23 % received at least one form of food assistance. Any form of malnutrition affected 23 % of children, 36 % of girls and 56 % of women. Children were especially affected by anaemia, overweight/obesity and stunting (15 center dot 2, 9 center dot 9, 7 center dot 4 %, respectively). Girls were affected by overweight/obesity, anaemia and stunting (22 center dot 5, 15 center dot 2, 6 center dot 2 %). Women were strongly affected by overweight/obesity, anaemia and stunting (43 center dot 8, 19 center dot 8, 10 center dot 5 %). Stunting or short stature was higher in low-SEW settings, doubling in prevalence between low and high levels, increasing four times among women in reproductive age (P< 0 center dot 05). Excess weight among children was higher in high-SEW settings, in women the tendency was inverse. Anaemia showed different tendency according to SEW. Conclusions: In 2005, Argentina had high rates of excess weight and anaemia, moderate prevalence of stunting and low frequency of wasting/underweight. All forms of malnutrition showed a strong relationship with socio-economic and educational inequality.
Educational inequality and public policy preferences: Evidence from representative survey experiments;To study how information about educational inequality affects public concerns and policy preferences, we devise survey experiments in representative samples of the German population. Providing information about the extent of educational inequality strongly increases concerns about educational inequality. It also affects support for equity-oriented education policies (which have high baseline support), although effects are quantitatively small on average. However, instrumental-variable estimates suggest substantial effects of concerns on policy preferences among the compliers whose concerns are shifted by the information treatment. There are substantial effects on support for compulsory preschool, which increases further if respondents are informed about policy effectiveness. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Educational Injustice in a High-Stakes Testing Context: A Mixed Methods Study on Rural Migrant Children's Academic Experiences in Shanghai Public Schools;This mixed method study analyzes rural migrant children's academic experiences in two Shanghai public schools when 2012 PISA scores were administered. It contributes empirical evidence on howhukoustatus shapes educational inequality in contemporary China. Since rural migrants are ineligible for the high-stakes test for Shanghai's senior secondary admission, teachers diverted resources towards urban children at the expense of rural migrants, regardless of academic potential. Such successful teaching practices to maximize ranking motivated excessive resource provision to the detriment of urban youth's development. This article argues that it is only possible to understand these patterns through an inequality theory that explicitly considers the diminished integrity of teaching in high-stakes testing contexts. The framework explains educational injustices when the moral assumption of good teaching to benefit a child is no longer valid, with implications on the growing global emphasis on high-stakes testing.
Impact of educational and gender inequality on income and income inequality in South Asian countries;"Purpose- The objectives of this study are threefold: firstly, to measure the impact of educational inequality on income inequality, and per capita income; secondly, to measure the impact of gender inequality in education on income inequality, per capita income and educational inequality; and lastly, to test the Kuznets inverted U-shape hypothesis between inequality in education and average year of schooling. Design/methodology/approach - The study has adopted the Marin and Psacharopoulos (1976) model of human capital in which income earned by an individual can be estimated as a function of number of year spent in schooling or education. Gini coefficient is used as a measure of income inequality, while inequality in education is measured by Gini index of educational inequality. Gender inequality in education is measured by the difference between male and female enrolment ratios as a proportion of male enrolment. The study utilizes the data of six South Asian countries, i.e. Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka from 1980 to 2010 at five-year average and employs fixed effect model (FEM) and random effect model (REM) for estimation. Findings - Result suggests that educational inequality and average year of schooling have positive and significant impact on income inequality. Primary (basic) education and tertiary (higher) education reduce income inequality, while secondary education widens income inequality. Negative relationship exists between educational inequality and per capita income. Unequal distribution of education among boys and girls at primary level increases income inequality, while reduces income inequality at tertiary level. Gender inequality in secondary and tertiary level of education reduces per capita income, while unequal distribution of education among boys and girls further increases the educational inequality. Kuznets inverted U-shape hypothesis does not hold between education expansion and educational inequality, while weak U-shape relationship exists in South Asian countries. Practical implications - Government has to provide free education in poor regions and makes employment programs to reduce the income and educational inequality respectively, while to remove gender inequality in education it is necessary to build more schools especially for girls. Government has to launch different online education programs for expansion in education at all levels. Originality/value - This study adds to the literature by analyzing whether the inequality in income increases (decreases) due to increase (decrease) in educational and gender inequality in South Asian countries. This study contributes in the existing literature by developing a measure of educational and gender inequality in education in South Asian countries. Peer review - The peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/IJSE-04-2020-0226."
Education Inequalities at Uruguayan Middle School;Uruguay has a vocation for educational inclusion since the end of the 19th Century. From a theoretical point of view, educational inequality has always been overlapped by some element of socioeconomic inequality, ergo, most educational claims and policies have been focused on equalizing conditions of the home of origin. However, despite an important series of policies and programs for social inclusion, in one of the countries with the best social and equity indicators on the continent, approximately 60% of the population will never finish High School. The article tries a theoretical systematization and comparison of the main works associated with educational inequality at a national and international level. Among the main conclusions stands out the idea that socioeconomic inequality is only one piece of educational inequality. Therefore, acting solely on socioeconomic inequality is an exhausted theoretical and empirical reduction.
IMMIGRATION, LANGUAGE AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN SPAIN. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW;Since the nineties, publications that deal with the relationships between immigration, proficiency in the language of instruction and academic performance of children of im-migrants have multiplied in Spain. The majority defend the linguistic disadvantage hypothesis when explaining the poorer performance of these students. This paper reviews this literature within the Spanish context in order to assess its contributions, limitations and gaps. Despite the advances, it is concluded that the absence of research that si-multaneously measures the proficiency in the language of instruction and the academic performance precludes rigorous empirical knowledge of such relationship and, hence, the contrast of the aforementioned hypothesis. The size of both the samples and the subsamples of the national origin groups, as well as a proper control for certain relevant vari-ables, are pointed out as other research challenges.
The shape of educational inequality;Hundreds of thousands of students drop out of school each year in the United States, despite billions of dollars of funding and myriad educational reforms. Existing research tends to look at the effect of easily measurable student characteristics. However, a vast number of harder-to-measure student traits, skills, and resources affect educational success. We present a conceptual framework for the cumulative effect of all factors, which we call student capital. We develop a method for estimating student capital in groups of students and find that student capital is distributed exponentially in each of 140 cohorts of community college students. Students' ability to be successful does not behave like standard tests of intelligence. Instead, it acts like a limited resource, distributed unequally. The results suggest that rather than removing barriers related to easily measured characteristics, interventions should be focused on building up the skills and resources needed to be successful in school.
Primary and Secondary Effects of Social Origin in the Transition to Post-Compulsory Education in Spain;The inequality observed in educational decision-making may be broken down into the effect of social origin on academic performance (primary effect) and the educational decision-making process itself (secondary effect). Prior studies on enrollment decisions regarding post-secondary education in Spain have suggested that the relative importance of secondary effects may reach three-quarters of all inequality. However, the performance measure used may have led to an overestimation of these secondary effects. This work examines the potential overestimation using the Survey of Social Classes and Social Structure and the PISA study. It concludes that, while secondary effects explain a significant part of the inequality observed in the transition to post-compulsory education, they do not account for three-quarters of said inequality.
Educational Inequality Quantification in Latin America (2000-2015);The objective of this study is to quantify educational inequality in Latin America in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015, identify which countries had a better ranking during each period and where each country stands today with regards to that position. The assessment is based on a weighted synthetic index that includes data from the Basic Educational Inequity Index (IIEB-2014) proposed by Formichella (2014), a Household Survey conducted by the Center for Distributive, Labor and Social Studies (CEDLAS) and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The index was calculated for the following countries: Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. It was concluded that despite a general reduction in educational inequality in most of the countries studied, the current ranking remains unchanged while the level of educational inequality still continues to remain high.
Educational inequality, are the reinforcement programs the solution? Empirical evidence of the impact at the intra center level;The need to cater to the different learning pace of students still remains a frequent problem for both teachers and the academic community. Among the public policies aimed to solve this problem, two stand out: the grouping of students based on their abilities -tracking- and, more recently, the extracurricular reinforcement programs. This paper evaluates the impact that the PROA, a reinforcement program implemented on a voluntary basis by different High Schools in Spain between 2005 and 2012, had on educational inequality. To measure educational inequality, the gap in terms of results between the students of the same school has been used, as well as the Gini inequality index. The results obtained, which are based on the Propensity Score Matching technique, indicate that the implementation of this program did not bridge the gap in terms of marks between students. They also suggest that average reading scores did not increase in those schools that decided to participate in the program.
Now I know that meritocracy and the American dream are myths: employing critical hope in a teacher pipeline program serving minoritized high school students;The purpose of this teacher action research project is to examine the perspectives of high school youth as they experience an intensive, 45-hours summer course geared toward developing and strengthening students critical consciousness as future teachers. This research study centers on a teacher pipeline program called the Future Educators Program (FEP) focused on preparing a diverse group of students interested in the teaching profession. Employing tenets of critical hope, such as hokey hope and Socratic hope, the teacher-researcher seeks to examine how students make sense of educational inequality as it relates to race and class. Findings from this study illustrate the ways participants debunk misconceptions linked to hokey hope and exercise Socratic hope in their critical self-reflections with regards to their lived and racialized experiences. The author concludes with implications for the recruitment and retention of minoritized youth as future teachers for social justice.
Degrees of influence: Educational inequality in policy representation;Education plays an important role in the political, social and economic divisions that have recently characterised Western Europe. Despite the many analyses of education and its political consequences, however, previous research has not investigated whether government policy caters more to the preferences of the higher educated than to the preferences of the lower educated. We address this question using an original dataset of public opinion and government policy in the Netherlands. This data reveals that policy representation is starkly unequal. The association between support for policy change and actual change is much stronger for highly educated citizens than for low and middle educated citizens, and only the highly educated appear to have any independent influence on policy. This inequality extends to the economic and cultural dimensions of political competition. Our findings have major implications for the educational divide in Western Europe, as they reflect both a consequence and cause of this divide.
Influences of behaviour and attitude on education related inequality in tooth loss: findings from Norway and Sweden over 5 years of follow- up;"Objectives:Following community dwelling cohorts in Norway and Sweden from 65 to 70 years, this study aimed to answer the following questions; Is there cross country variation in educational inequality in tooth loss between the Norwegian and Swedish cohorts? Does oral health behaviours and attitudinal beliefs play a role in explaining educational inequality in tooth loss across time and cohorts? Material and Methods:In 2007 and 2012 Statistics Norway administered mailed questionnaires to all individuals born in 1942 in three counties. The response rate was 58% (n = 4211) in 2007 and 54.5% (n = 3733) in 2012. In Sweden the same questionnaires were sent to the 1942 cohort in two counties. The final response rate in 2007 and 2012 were respectively, 73.1% (n = 6078) and 72.2% (n = 5697). Results:In Norway, tooth loss prevalence was 21.8% in 2007 and 23.2% in 2012. Corresponding figures in Sweden were 25.9% and 27.3%. The prevalence of tooth loss was higher among lower than higher educated participants and the gradient was significantly weaker in Sweden than in Norway. Multiple variable analyses adjusting for oral behavioural and attitudinal variables attenuated education related gradients in both cohorts. Conclusion:Education related inequality in tooth loss was stronger in the Norwegian than in the Swedish cohort across the survey years. Oral behaviours and attitudinal beliefs played a role in explaining the gradients across time. This illustrates a necessity to promote oral health enhancing behaviours and attitudinal beliefs, particularly so in lower educational groups."
Contextualising the achievement gap: assessing educational achievement, inequality, and disadvantage in high-Income countries;We examine the disparities in educational outcomes for highincome countries as they are reported by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), with a specific emphasis on a more nuanced exploration of SES-based achievement gaps. To explore differences in the educational inequality and disadvantages associated with SES-based achievement gaps by country, we analyze three measures: overall average performance, educational inequality (or achievement gaps), and educational disadvantage (comparative achievement gap patterns). We find that, when examined together, these three measures are instructive for understanding the differences in educational outcomes across countries. Our findings offer insight into the PISA results that go beyond average achievement. We recommend that country-level averages should not be emphasised or interpreted without also considering educational inequality and disadvantage.
Experimental Effects of Achievement Gap News Reporting on Viewers' Racial Stereotypes, Inequality Explanations, and Inequality Prioritization;"The achievement gap has long dominated mainstream conversations about race and education. Some scholars warn that the discourse around racial gaps perpetuates stereotypes and promotes the adoption of deficit-based explanations that fail to appreciate the role of structural inequities. I investigate through three randomized experiments. Results indicate that a TV news story about racial achievement gaps (vs. a control or counterstereotypical video) led viewers to express more exaggerated stereotypes of Black Americans as lacking education (Study 1 effect size = .30SD; Study 2 effect size = .38SD) and may have increased viewers' implicit stereotyping of Black students as less competent than White students (Study 1 effect size = .22SD; Study 2 effect size = .12SD, ns). The video did not affect viewers' explicit competence-related racial stereotyping, the explanations they gave for achievement inequalities, or their prioritization of ending achievement inequalities. After 2 weeks, the effect on stereotype exaggeration faded. Future research should probe how we can most productively frame educational inequality by race."
Extent of and trends in inequalities in child stunting in Sierra-Leone from 2005 to 2013: evidence from demographic and health surveys and multiple indicator cluster surveys;BackgroundComprehensive assessment of stunting disparity in Sierra-Leone has not been done so far. We aimed to document extent and over time dynamics of inequality in stunting in Sierra-Leone using approaches that facilitate implementation of interventions aim to eliminate non-justified stunting disparity in the country.MethodsThe data for the study were derived from two rounds of the Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2008 and 2013, and two rounds of the Sierra Leone Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey done in 2005 and 2010. We used the 2019 update WHO Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) to do the analysis. The toolkit makes use of data stored in the WHO Health Equity Monitor database. We analyzed stunting inequality using summary measures: Population Attributable Risk, Population Attributable Fraction, Difference and Ratio. The summary measures were computed for five equity stratifers: wealth, education, child's sex, place of residence and subnational region. We computed 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for each point estimate to show whether or not observed stunting inequalities are statistically significant, and whether or not the disparity changed over time statistically significantly.ResultsThe findings demonstrated stark inequalities in stunting in all the studied dimensions of inequality. While residence and subnational regional related inequalities remain unchanged over time, wealth and educational inequality had seen slight improvement during the same time period. Large sex related stunting inequality remained during the first three surveys time points, but it disappeared in 2013.ConclusionsHuge stunting disparities occurred in Sierra Leone, and the disparity disproportionately affects disadvantaged subpopulations and male children. Nutrition interventions that specifically target the subgroups which suffer more from the burden of stunting are required.
Endogenous Selection Bias and Cumulative Inequality over the Life Course: Evidence from Educational Inequality in Subjective Well-Being;According to theories of cumulative (dis-)advantage, inequality increases over the life course. Labour market research has seized this argument to explain the increasing economic inequality as people age. However, evidence for cumulative (dis-)advantage in subjective well-being remains ambiguous, and a prominent study from the United States has reported contradictory results. Here, we reconcile research on inequality in subjective well-being with theories of cumulative (dis-)advantage. We argue that the age-specific endogenous selection of the (survey) population results in decreasing inequalities in subjective well-being means whereas individual-level changes show a pattern of cumulative (dis-)advantage. Using repeated cross-sectional data from the European Social Survey (N = 15,252) and employing hierarchical age-period-cohort models, we replicate the finding of decreasing inequality from the United States with the same research design for Germany. Using panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (persons = 47,683, person-years = 360,306) and employing growth curve models, we show that this pattern of decreasing inequality in subjective well-being means is accompanied by increasing inequality in intra-individual subjective well-being changes. This pattern arises because disadvantaged groups, such as the low educated and individuals with low subjective well-being show lower probabilities of continuing to participate in a survey and because both determinants reinforce each other. In addition to allowing individual changes and attrition processes to be examined, the employed multi-cohort panel data have further key advantages for examining inequality in subjective well-being over the life course: They require weaker assumptions to control for period and cohort effects and make it possible to control for interviewer effects that may influence the results.
Stuck in Place? A Field Experiment on the Effects of Reputational Information on Student Evaluations;Studies suggest that students' prior performance can shape subsequent teacher evaluations, but the magnitude of reputational effects and their implications for educational inequality remain unclear. Existing scholarship presents two major perspectives that exist in tension: do teachers primarily use reputational information as a temporary signal that is subsequently updated in response to actual student performance? Or do teachers primarily use reputational information as a filter that biases perception of subsequent evidence, thus crystallizing student reputations and keeping previously poor-performing students stuck in place? In a field experiment, we recruited a random sample of 832 junior high school teachers from the second-most populous province of China to grade a sequence of four essays written by the same student, and we randomly assign both the academic reputation of the student and the quality of the essays produced. We find that (1) reputational information influences how teachers grade, (2) teachers rely on negative information more heavily than positive information, and (3) negative reputations are crystallized by a single behavioral confirmation. These results suggest that students can escape their prior reputations, but to do so, they must contradict them immediately, with a single confirmation sufficient to crystallize a negative reputation.
Raising the Stakes: Inequality and Testing in the Russian Education System;Sociologists have argued that high-stakes tests open the door to high levels of educational inequality at transition points: in a high-stakes testing regime, parents and students are able to focus all energy and resources on test preparation, thus enhancing pre-existing inequalities in academic performance. But arguments about a special role for high-stakes tests are often prosecuted without explicit comparisons to other types of tests and assessments, usually because information on other tests is not available. In this article, we analyze a unique dataset on a contemporary cohort of Russian students, forwhom we have PISA and TIMSS scores, low-stakes test scores, and high-stakes test scores. We compare the role each test plays in mediating socioeconomic background inequalities at the important transitions in the Russian educational system: the transition to upper secondary education and the transition to university. We find evidence in favor of a special role for the high-stakes test at the transition to university, but we also find evidence that gives cause to question the standard assumption that high-stakes tests should be a primary focus for those concerned about inequality of educational opportunity.
Youth adversity, parental resources and educational attainment: Contrasting a resilience and a reproduction perspective;In this article, we combine insights from development psychology and educational sociology to investigate to what extent adverse youth experiences harm children's educational attainment and how this impact varies with parents' resources. Youth adversities as parental rejection, parental death and parental divorce are considered. We hypothesize that, on the one hand, youth adversity may hinder the intergenerational transmission of parents' cultural resources. On the other hand, we expect that parents' financial resources promote resilience in children and may buffer the possible impact of youth adversity. We test our hypotheses employing data from the Family Survey Dutch Population, covering 5,760 respondents. Our results suggest that all three adverse youth experiences harm children's educational attainment. Furthermore, children who experience adversity, especially parental rejection, benefit less from their parents' cultural resources. This supports the notion that youth adversity reduces the intergenerational reproduction of advantage. Altogether, our results emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary theoretical approach to understand the heterogeneous consequences of adverse youth experiences for educational outcomes.
The role of the changing social background composition for changes in inequality of educational opportunity: An analysis of the process of educational expansion in Germany 1950-2010;Using new longitudinal data from the Adult Cohort (SC6) of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) this paper examines how the highest educational attainment has changed in the process of educational expansion in Germany between 1950 and 2010. The study focuses on a fairly neglected question of the educational expansion process: Which role does the changing social background composition play in changes in inequalities of educational opportunity? It concludes that, despite a period of substantial educational reform, the overall origin-specific inequalities as well as the demand to earn the highest educational degree within the various social origin groups have remained surprisingly stable across birth cohorts. Instead, the general trend towards educational growth at higher education in Germany seems to be mainly driven by intercohort changes in social background composition.
Educational inequality and state-sponsored elite education: the case of the Dutch gymnasium;"In this paper the authors examine the role the Dutch gymnasium continues to play in the institutional maintenance of educational inequality. To that end they examine the relational and spatial features of state-sponsored elite education in the Dutch system: the unique identity the gymnasium seeks to cultivate; its value to its consumers; its geographic significance; and its market position amidst a growing array of other selective forms of schooling. They argue that there is a strong correlation between a higher social class background and the concern to transmit one's cultural habitus. They further speculate on the moral implications of state-sponsored elite education, both as it concerns the specific role of the gymnasium in the reproduction of social inequality as well as the curious tendency among its supporters to rationalise the necessity of its existence."
The Right Fit? Classroom Mismatch in Middle School and Its Inconsistent Effect on Student Learning;Research on college admissions shows that all students tend to benefit from overmatching, but high-status students are most likely to be overmatched, and low-status students are most likely to be undermatched. This study examines whether mismatching takes place when students are sorted into classrooms in middle school. Given prior research on effectively maintained inequality, we theorize that classroom sorting acts as an opportunity for privileged parents to obtain a qualitative advantage for their children. Our research uses administrative data from Indiana and hierarchical linear models to analyze classroom mismatch in sixth through eighth grades. We find that privileged students are more likely to be overmatched in both math and English language arts (ELA) classrooms but that overmatching is beneficial in math but detrimental in ELA. This suggests that inequality can be effectively maintained only if parents have an accurate understanding of what constitutes an advantage.
Test- or judgement-based school track recommendations: Equal opportunities for students with different socio-economic backgrounds?;Background There are concerns that school track recommendations that are mostly based on teachers' judgements of students' performance ('judgement-based recommendations') are more biased by students' SES than school track recommendations that are mostly based on standardized test results ('test-based recommendations'). A recent policy reform of the Dutch educational system has provided us the unique opportunity to compare the effects of students' SES on these two types of track recommendations. Aims The aim of this study was to examine the differences between test-based and judgement-based recommendations regarding the direct and indirect effect of students' SES at student level and school level. Sample The sample consisted of 8,639 grade 6 students from 105 Dutch primary schools. Methods Data were analysed using two-level multilevel mediation models. Results Track recommendations were higher for high-SES students. This was mostly due to differences in students' prior performance. SES also had a small, direct effect on judgement-based, but not on test-based recommendations. The effects were partly situated at school level. Conclusion Overall, the results indicated that teachers based their track recommendations mostly on students' prior performance without being biased by students' SES.
Educational equity policy as human taxonomy: who do we compare and why does it matter?;Descriptions of educational inequality, or 'gap talk', require principles of categorisation that divide humans into groups between which a 'gap' can exist. The principles used in education equity policies to define groups affect the nature of the educational interventions that these policies propose. Drawing on critical discourse analysis of education policy documents and political speeches, I argue that in New Zealand the dominant categorising principle is indigenous/Maori ethnicity, whereas in England it is socio-economic disadvantage. These two principles result in two very different types of policy interventions, both of which address only part of the problem. Furthermore, both principles are simplistic and one-dimensional, making it easier to blame 'failing schools' for educational inequality, whereas use of more nuanced principles would provide a better basis for determining the kinds of differences that 'effective schools' can reasonably be expected to make. While previous analyses have suggested that recognition-orientated policies can shift attention away from broader social policies that influence educational disparities, I argue here that this can also be the case for distribution-orientated policies.
Normalization of language deficit ideology for a new generation of minoritized US youth;This paper analyzes linguistic deficit discourse as it emerges in language gap research, gets appropriated by language gap foundations, and is reported in the media. Through intertextual analysis, we show how language deficit ideologies combine with neoliberal logic to normalize the marginalization of minoritized families, linguistic and sociolinguistic hierarchies, and the privileging of White middle-class (socio)linguistic norms. Language gap discourse turns parents into scapegoats by blaming them for the linguistic deficiencies of their children and low-income families are encouraged to misrecognize the inherent value of their communication abilities. IN the process, social processes that engender economic and educational inequality are obfuscated. Rather than attempting to find real answers to real problems, language gap discourse emphasizes a quick fix solution (filling your kids up with words) instead of engaging with the real causes of educational inequity.
Traditional Students as Second Class Citizens through Modern Day Tracking;We used a qualitative case study approach to examine the schooling experiences of 40 current high school seniors and 20 alumni from an urban STEAM career academy comprised of 98% African American students from low-income families. Using tracking as a theoretical lens, we found that students in the high school STEAM career academy were stratified using a more modern, dual system approach - and were labeled as traditional and college preparatory. These schooling practices led to the traditional tracked students being treated as second class citizens as well as being denied access to high-quality curricula to prepare them to be college and career ready. Based on our findings, we recommend that school personnel customize curricula based on the interests of students and enable them all to participate in college preparatory activities as well as work-based learning experiences.
Learning Inequality in Francophone Africa: School Quality and the Educational Achievement of Rich and Poor Children;Influential reports about the learning crisis in the global South generally pay insufficient attention to social inequalities in learning. In this study, we explore the association between family socioeconomic status and learning outcomes in 10 francophone African countries using data from the Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems, a standardized assessment of pupils' mathematics and reading competence at the end of primary school. We start by showing that learning outcomes among grade 6 pupils are both poor and highly stratified. We then develop and test a conceptual framework that highlights three mechanisms through which family socioeconomic status might contribute to learning: (1) educational resources at home, (2) health and well-being, and (3) differences in school quality. We find that most of the effect of family background on learning outcomes operates through school quality, which results from a combination of the unequal distribution of resources (such as teachers and textbooks) across schools and high socioeconomic segregation between schools. On the basis of these results, we suggest that most countries in the region could improve equity as well as overall performance by raising the floor in school quality.
What makes a good education? Transitional value patterns of educational preferences in Estonian Middle class families;The competitiveness of middle-class parents' educational strategies has been researched extensively across differing institutional contexts, but evidence from Eastern Europe is lacking. This article examines how Estonian middle-class parents with differing amounts of economic and cultural capital harbour contrasting understandings of good education and good parenting, adopting different expectations to the school system characterised by moderate processes of marketization. 36 in-depth interviews with families from varying middle-class backgrounds expose different enclaves of privilege, created by parents' strong preferences and values. Discourses expressing the importance of a 'natural childhood' and supportive schooling are contrasted with elitist approaches to education and a stark separation between the roles of parents and educators. A Bourdieusian framework suggests that these divergent preferences and choices correspond to the predominance of either cultural or economic capitals that different parents have acquired. It is argued that these areas of 'educational specialisation' enable middle-class parents to divide and conquer the field of education, ensuring the success of their children no matter what.
Affirmative Action and Women in Uganda's Public University Education;"This article examines how Affirmative Action was used to govern access to higher education for the disadvantaged. In 1991, a gender-based Affirmative Action policy was incorporated into college admission in Uganda. Using existing empirical data at district and college levels, the article accounts for the categories of women for whom the Uganda's Affirmative Action policy is most effective. The study found that Affirmative Action had a substantial effect. Sixty-six per cent of the sampled population would not have been admitted, had it not been for Affirmative Action. But the policy did not work for the historically disadvantaged; it worked for specific categories of women from specific regions, districts and high schools; on grounds that it was implemented for competitive reasons. The study provides relevant lessons for policy making in countries grappling with the challenges of high socio-economic inequality and higher returns to higher education."
Education and incident type 2 diabetes: quantifying the impact of differential exposure and susceptibility to being overweight or obese;Aims/hypothesis Educational inequality in type 2 diabetes incidence is evident in many high-income countries. Previous studies have shown that differential exposure to being overweight/obese across educational groups may partly explain this inequality. Whether differential susceptibility to being overweight/obese across educational groups contributes to this inequality has been investigated less frequently, even though it is a plausible mechanism. The two mechanisms may even be highly intertwined. In this longitudinal cohort study, we investigated the simultaneous contribution of differential exposure and differential susceptibility to being overweight/obese to educational inequality in type 2 diabetes incidence. Methods The study population comprised 53,159 Danish men and women aged 50-64 years at baseline who were followed for a mean of 14.7 years. We estimated rate differences of type 2 diabetes by education level per 100,000 person-years. Using counterfactual mediation analysis, these rate differences were decomposed into proportions attributable to differential exposure, differential susceptibility and all other pathways, respectively. We compared this approach with conventional approaches to mediation and interaction analysis. Results Compared with a high level of education, a low education level was associated with 454 (95% CI 398, 510) additional cases of type 2 diabetes, and a medium education level with 316 (CI 268, 363) additional cases. Differential exposure to being overweight/obese accounted for 37% (CI 31%, 45%) of the additional cases among those with a low education level and 29% (CI 24%, 36%) of the additional cases among those with a medium education level. Differential susceptibility accounted for 9% (CI 4%, 14%) and 6% (CI 3%, 10%) of the additional cases among those with a low and medium education level, respectively. Compared with the counterfactual approach, the conventional approaches suggested stronger effects of both mechanisms. Conclusions/interpretation Differential exposure and susceptibility to being overweight/obese are both important mechanisms in the association between education and type 2 diabetes incidence.
SEX DIFFERENCES IN EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN DIABETES PREVALENCE IN THE UNITED STATES (2001-2016);
Public Policies and Equality of Opportunity for Wellbeing in Multiple Dimensions: A Theoretical Discussion and Evidence from Bolivia;Roemer's equality of opportunity (EOp) theory is increasingly used as the framework for assessing the link between public policies and social justice. Most studies focus on a single (monetary) wellbeing indicator and take individual efforts as being randomly distributed. However, recent development theories have uniformly advocated the use of a multidimensional wellbeing measure and the importance of individual responsibility. We propose a theoretical framework and a modelling tool to include these aspects in an assessment of the connection between public policies and inequality of opportunity for wellbeing within a Romerian setting. Using Bolivian data, we demonstrate the empirical usefulness of our framework and find that Bolivian social programmes are strongly associated with the reduction of unfair inequalities arising from ethnicity and family background, although their levels are far away from being optimal. We highlight the role of effort in this connection and show that it is a fundamental mediating factor.
Can greater reliance on test scores ameliorate the association between family background and access to post-collegiate education? Survey evidence from the Beijing College Students Panel survey;We evaluate whether greater reliance on test scores may reduce the extent of educational inequality by family origin as college graduates seek entrance to graduate school. In this article, we present a case study using survey data of colleges in Beijing, China, where students' performance in standardized graduate school entrance examination (the GSEE) is the primary determinant for the entrance to graduate school. Using multiple waves of the Beijing College Students Panel Survey (BCSPS), we fit a series of models to capture the correlations of family socioeconomic status (SES) with the probabilities of seeking entrance to post-collegiate education, registering for and taking the GSEE, and finally obtaining admission to graduate school. After balancing the differential probabilities of seeking graduate level education, we find that family SES is not significantly associated with the likelihood of taking the GSEE, but significantly predicts the probability of applying a foreign graduate program. Although family SES can be marginally correlated with the odds of being admitted by a domestic graduate program, the strength of such an association is significantly weaker than for overseas programs. It is also shown that, for the elite graduate programs, family origin is independent from both GSEE registration and subsequent admission. These findings suggest that the test-oriented evaluations could ameliorate the extent of inequality at the post-collegiate level.
Autonomy, Social Inequality, and Support in Chinese Urban and Rural Adolescents' Reasoning About the Chinese College Entrance Examination (Gaokao);The Gaokao, a mandatory postsecondary entrance examination for all Chinese students, is often associated with psychological stress among Chinese students in their final year of high school. This project was conducted in summer 2017 in urban Beijing and rural Xi'an, China. The purpose is to explore the perspectives of urban and rural secondary school graduates after they have completed the examination, using in-depth clinical interviews. The study draws on Self-Determination Theory and research on moral reasoning to examine several themes surrounding Chinese adolescents' perceptions of the Gaokao, including general perceptions of the purpose of education, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, sources of support and pressure during study for the Gaokao, and issues of fairness and social inequality. The major findings are that students from all backgrounds reported psychological conflict regarding their general views of the aims of education and the extrinsic pressure deriving from the high-stakes Gaokao examination. Inequality was seen as further exacerbated by family background, resources, and quality of teaching. Urban parents tended to provide more support, both academic and interpersonal. Rural students rated their mental health as significantly lower than urban students during their senior year of high school.
Measuring and forecasting progress towards the education-related SDG targets;"Education is a key dimension of well-being and a crucial indicator of development(1-4). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prioritize progress in education, with a new focus on inequality(5-7). Here we model the within-country distribution of years of schooling, and use this model to explore educational inequality since 1970 and to forecast progress towards the education-related 2030 SDG targets. We show that although the world is largely on track to achieve near-universal primary education by 2030, substantial challenges remain in the completion rates for secondary and tertiary education. Globally, the gender gap in schooling had nearly closed by 2018 but gender disparities remained acute in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa and the Middle East. It is predicted that, by 2030, females will have achieved significantly higher educational attainment than males in 18 countries. Inequality in education reached a peak globally in 2017 and is projected to decrease steadily up to 2030. The distributions and inequality metrics presented here represent a framework that can be used to track the progress of each country towards the SDG targets and the level of inequality over time. Reducing educational inequality is one way to promote a fairer distribution of human capital and the development of more equitable human societies. Great progress toward the education-related SDG targets has been made; however, global estimates of within-country distributions of education reveal gender disparities and high levels of total inequality in many parts of the world."
Social Inequalities in Student Employment and the Local Labour Market;This article examines class-specific employment patterns among students in Germany, taking into account how different local labour market conditions affect the quantity and quality of jobs available to students. We argue that the availability of jobs affects social inequalities in student employment. In particular, we expect a stronger correlation between, on the one hand, the rate and quality of student employment and, on the other hand, students' socioeconomic background in towns with a large pool of student labour, due to more competition for (good) jobs. Analysing data from German student surveys, we find that employment rates do not differ by social class background, but there are differences in the quality of their employment in terms of the fit between the job and the field of study. While we find that local labour market conditions affect student employment at a general level, in contrast to our expectation, tighter labour market conditions seem to involve little or no disadvantage for students from less privileged social backgrounds.
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN AVOIDABLE MORTALITY IN OSTEOARTHRITIS: A TEST OF FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES THEORY;
Metacognitive Knowledge, Skills, and Awareness: A Possible Solution to Enhancing Academic Achievement in African American Adolescents;The resegregation of public schools in the United States continues to place African American students at an academic disadvantage with-oftentimes-limited educational resources and fewer qualified teachers. Providing African American students with skills and strategies to succeed has never been more urgent. Metacognition, often defined simply as thinking about thinking, is a construct and process that may explain how students can improve and control their thinking and learning. Given the educational inequality African American students often face, providing strategies-with which they have control-may help empower students to better navigate and make the best of their daily academic experiences and environment composed of limited physical and human resources. Toward this end, recent research on metacognition looks promising and may be one viable option to enhance academic achievement among students. In this article, we consider three related areas that inform African American youth educational experiences: (a) the history of the educational context which African American youth have long faced, (b) the laws that have historically and currently buttress and inform the educational landscape for African American youth, and (c) one potential solution (i.e., metacognitive knowledge, skills, and awareness) to reduce or ameliorate some of the problems outlined in the history and laws that have been implicated in the low levels of academic achievement among some African American youth. Following the review of these related literature bases, we offer recommendations on how the extant literature bases may inform directions for future research that is focused on metacognition and that is ethically and culturally responsive.
School Choice, Neighborhood Change, and Racial Imbalance Between Public Elementary Schools and Surrounding Neighborhoods;The expansion of school choice in recent years has potentially generated demographic imbalances between traditional public schools and their residential attendance zones. Demographic imbalances emerge from selective opting out, when families of certain racial and/or ethnic backgrounds disproportionately choose not to enroll in their neighborhood-based public schools. In this article, we use a unique data set of school attendance zones in 21 large U.S. school districts to show how changes in neighborhood conditions and school choice options influence race-specific enrollments in locally zoned public elementary schools from 2000 to 2010. We find that the presence of more school-choice options generates racial imbalances between public elementary schools and their surrounding neighborhoods, but this association differs by type of choice-based alternative. Private schools, on average, reduce the presence of non-Hispanic white students in locally zoned schools, whereas charter schools may reduce the presence of nonwhite students in locally zoned schools. Increases in neighborhood-school racial imbalances from 2000 to 2010 were concentrated in neighborhoods undergoing increases in socioeconomic status, suggesting that parents' residential and school decisions are dynamic and sensitive to changing neighborhood conditions. Selective opting out has implications for racial integration in schools and the distribution of familial resources across educational contexts.
No! I Can't!: Noise and silence as everyday resistance at a Chinese suburban middle school;Student resistance is one of the central themes in the study of schooling and inequality. This article used sound as a means of inquiry to investigate how China's suburban teenagers-a segment largely overlooked in prior scholarly writing-resist the school values amid the exaltation of success and widening stratification in contemporary Chinese society. Drawing on fieldwork in a suburban middle school in Northwest China, I demonstrated that students utilize a wide range of sound acts-burlesqued shouts, subdued murmurs, and sometimes pervasive silence-to resist educators' moralized lectures on the seriousness of schoolwork and the prospects of education success. Lodged in the liminal space within China's socioeconomic and spatial hierarchy, suburban youths expressed their disbelief and disillusion-both in and through sound-in an environment that offers few avenues for social mobility.
Does educational inequality predict exercise of users' choice? Survey evidence from domiciliary care services among elderly in Oslo, Norway;"The traditional goal of equality in services remains at the heart of the Scandinavian welfare model; however, in recent decades, policymakers have also placed increased emphasis on user influence over services.Voiceandchoiceare two channels to achieve this goal. The possibility to give feedback and voicing dissatisfaction to service providers (voice) is a well-established channel of service users' influence, however it is increasingly supplemented by user choice schemes (choice), where one can choose between different public and private service providers. We use the case of domiciliary care for the elderly to examine how the traditional goal of user equality is associated with the growing emphasis on user influence through voice and choice. The analyses are based on user surveys carried out by the municipality in the city of Oslo, which is arguably the only municipality in Norway where user choice plays a significant role in elderly care. Since the municipality subsidizes the private providers, individual economic resources should have less relevance. However, voicing dissatisfaction and choosing between different providers may anticipate cognitive resources that are not equally distributed among the users. The survey data indicate that there is an association between level of education and propensity to exploit all channels of user influence. Expanding user influence by introducing user choice thus confirms the differences between highly educated and less educated."
Determinants of parental involvement in primary school: evidence from Chile;This article examines the impact of educational expectations, perceived self-efficacy, and the information transmitted by the school on parental involvement at home and at school. A survey was administered to a representative sample of 672 parents and guardians of students attending primary schools located in Santiago, Chile. The analyses conducted, based on OLS regression models with municipality-level fixed effects, reveal that parents' educational expectations and perceived self-efficacy behave as relevant predictors of their degree of involvement at home and at school respectively, even attenuating the importance of socioeconomic status (SES). However, results stress the importance of the information provided by the school, especially due to its impact on parents' involvement at home and on their participation in curricular school activities. Last, the article discusses the implications of these findings for initiatives aimed at increasing educational equality.
Group-based educational inequalities in India: Have major education policy interventions been effective?;Despite seven decades of policy thrust, group-based educational inequalities persist in India. The tenacious social group-based stratification often proves to be a hurdle for educational participation policies to be effectively rolled out. Given these realities, this study reviews all major national education policy interventions since t 1950s. Using four rounds of National Sample Survey (NSS) data, we analysed the pattern of educational attainments in terms of Average Years of Schooling (AYS) and educational inequalities in India for the period 1994-2012. Three indices of inequality - Gini, Theil's enttropy and Atkinson - have been constructed to study inequality by gender, place of residence and social groups. . We also empirically estimated the determinants of educational attainments in India by using OLS and Tobit Models. Further using the Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition technique, we analysed the educational attainment gaps between groups. The study concludes that policy interventions have done little to reduce the group-based educational attainment gap and it's time to place improved focus on secondary and higher education while continuing the efforts in primary education.
Socioeconomic Inequality in Decoding Instructions and Demonstrating Knowledge;Cultural capital may contribute to socioeconomic achievement gaps by shaping how students engage with authority in schools. However, social class shapes academic skills and know-how in other ways. Through classroom observations and interviews with first graders, their parents, and teachers, I find that higher-SES students decode teachers' inexplicit academic instructions and demonstrate academic knowledge more ably, confidently, and frequently than lower-SES students. Lower-SES students demonstrate procedural knowledge (i.e. knowledge of classroom rules) as much as academic knowledge to gain attention and praise from teachers. These patterns are primarily connected to higher-SES parents teaching their children the academic problem solving script teachers expect and reward, whereas lower-SES parents emphasizing rule following as the path to academic achievement. Teachers also give less explicit instruction for academic tasks compared to classroom procedure. Results from this study highlight additional forms of cultural capital and additional ways that social class reproduces these inequalities.
Child population, economic development and regional inequality of education resources in China;There is great inequality of educational resources between different provinces in China due to unbalanced economic development. Despite continued redistribution of financial resources by the central government in favor of poorer provinces, educational inequality remains. In this paper, we argue that focusing on educational resources is far from sufficient. Poorer provinces do not only suffer from a lower level of educational resources, but they also have more children to educate, i.e. a greater need for education. Combining and analyzing the data in the Sixth National Population Census of China and the official statistics on education spending and resources, we found that provincial-level variations in the child population and the child dependency ratio have made access to educational resources even more unequal given the unequal financial capacity at the provincial level. Poorer provinces face a higher child dependency ratio and have lower economic development, and these two factors jointly lead to limited educational resources. Apart from a much higher level of redistribution in favor of less developed provinces, encouraging more balanced distribution of teachers and more broadly promoting economic equality are essential to reduce inequality in educational resources in China.
The Academic Performance of Undocumented Students in Higher Education in the United States;"Our understanding of the sources of educational inequality for the estimated 250,000 undocumented immigrant college students in the United States is limited by poor data. We use student administrative data from a large public university, which accurately identify legal status and include pre-enrollment characteristics, to determine the effect of legal status on GPA and graduation. We find that undocumented students are hyper-selected relative to peers; failing to account for this difference underestimates the effect of legal status on academic outcomes. Our findings also highlight the ways legal status interacts with institutional settings and race/ethnicity to affect educational outcomes."
Distributional Effects of Corruption When Enforcement is Biased: Theory and Evidence from Bribery in Schools in Bangladesh;In many models of corruption where enforcement is unbiased, the rich are more likely to pay bribes for their children's education, implying that corruption reduces educational inequality. We develop models of bribery that reflect the fact that in developing countries, anticorruption enforcement is not unbiased, and higher income of a household is associated with higher bargaining power and better quality of institutions. In models of biased enforcement, the rich are less likely to pay bribes, making bribery regressive. The OLS estimates of the effects of household income are likely to find spurious progressivity in the incidence of bribery in schools. We exploit temporary rainfall shocks to provide suggestive evidence on the ability-to-pay effect, while long-term rainfall differences capture the combined 'poor people' and 'poor area' effects. We find that the poor are more likely to pay bribes, and the amount paid does not depend on household income. The evidence rejects the ability-to-pay and related models based on unbiased enforcement, and is consistent with the 'refusal-to-pay model' of bargaining power where the rich decline to pay bribes. 'Free schooling' is free only for the rich, and corruption makes the playing field skewed against the poor.
Educational inequality: closing the gap;
Educational inequality in patient-reported outcomes but not mortality among cardiac patients: Results from the national DenHeart survey with register follow-up;Aims: This study aimed to explore whether educational level is associated with mental and physical health status, anxiety and depression symptoms and quality of life at hospital discharge and predicts cardiac events and all-cause mortality 1 year after hospital discharge in patients with ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmias, heart failure or heart valve disease. Methods: The DenHeart survey is cross-sectional and combined with data from national registers. Information on educational level and co-morbidity at hospital discharge and cardiac events and mortality 1-year post-discharge was obtained from registers. Patient-reported outcomes included SF-12, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and HeartQoL. Multivariate linear and logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used. Results: A total of 13,145 patients were included. A significant educational gradient was found in patient-reported mental and physical health status, anxiety and depression symptoms and quality of life, with lower educational groups reporting worse outcomes in adjusted analyses. No association was found between educational level and risk of cardiac events or all-cause mortality within 1 year after hospital discharge in adjusted analyses. Conclusions: In a large population of patients with cardiac disease a significant educational gradient was found in mental and physical health and quality of life at hospital discharge. There was, however, no association between educational level and risk of cardiac events or mortality 1 year after hospital discharge.
Theoretically All Children Are Equal. Practically This Can Never Be So: The History of the District Property Tax in California and the Choice of Inequality;"Background/Context: Dealing mostly in aggregate statistics that mask important regional variations, scholars often assume that district property taxation and the resource disparities this approach to school funding creates are deeply rooted in the history of American education. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article explores the history of district property taxation and school funding disparities in California during the 19th and 20th centuries. First, the article documents the limited use of district property taxation for school funding in California and several other Western states during the 19th century, showing that the development of school finance was more complicated than standard accounts suggest. Then, the article examines how a coalition of experts, activists, and politicians worked together during the early 20th century to promote district property taxation and institutionalize the idea that the wealth of local communities, rather than the wealth of the entire state, should determine the resources available for public schooling. Research Design: This article draws on primary source documents from state and regional archives, including district-level funding data from nine Northern California counties, to complete a historical analysis. Conclusions/Recommendations: The history of California's district property tax suggests the need for continued research on long-term trends in school finance and educational inequality. Popular accounts minimizing the historical role of state governments in school funding obscure how public policies, not just market forces shaping property values, create funding inequalities. In turn, these accounts communicate powerful messages about the supposed inevitability of funding disparities and the responsibility of state governments to correct them. Through increased attention to long-term trends in school funding; scholars can help popular commentators and policymakers avoid assumptions that naturalize inequality and narrow the possibilities for future funding reforms."
Navigating Institutions: Parents' Knowledge of the Educational System and Students' Success in Education;This study investigates whether families navigate educational institutions more successfully if they have a higher knowledge of the pathways in the educational system that are available to their children. We also study whether this kind of knowledge mediates secondary effects of social origin, i.e. differences in educational pathways once achievement differences between children are accounted for. The role of parents' knowledge is consistent with various sociological theories concerning educational inequality. Knowledge can affect families' ability to make rational choices for education but it can also be understood as a form of cultural capital. We use longitudinal student cohort data from the Netherlands combined with individual-level register data on educational attainment to study the importance of knowledge for short-term outcomes (up- and downward transitions in secondary education as well as track placement) and final educational attainment. Our results show that parents' knowledge is a significant predictor of educational success net of parents' education, socio-demographic characteristics, and demonstrated ability. If we apply a stricter test to the measure, however, we can see that knowledge matters for downward transitions and obtaining a tertiary degree but that the effect is negligible for upward transitions and track placement if other mechanisms such as cultural capital and aspirations are considered. Further, we conclude that knowledge matters especially for transitions in the educational system that require a move to a new and unknown school environment such as post-secondary or tertiary education. The study shows that knowledge is one useful avenue to investigate when we are confronted with the question why social disparities in educational decision-making arise.
Investigating the impact of interventions on educational disparities: Estimating average treatment effects (ATEs) is not sufficient;In most national education systems, educational attainment depends heavily on parental socioeconomic status, which challenges the notion of equal opportunity. Educational interventions have increasingly become the focus of public and scientific debate as a tool for mitigating these disparities. Establishing appropriate methods for investigating the impact of these programs on inequality is of great interest to researchers, policymakers and practitioners. We help make methodological refinements in this research area. In defining educational disparities as unequal chances for educational attainment of different social groups on the macro level, we suggest considering not only how strongly participating persons from distinct social groups benefit from a program (i.e., group-specific ATEs) but also how many persons from distinct social groups take part in the program under real world conditions (i.e., group-specific participation rates (PRs)). As we define the PR as the share of a sub-population participating in a program under real world conditions, PRs link the real world and macro level to the intervention level, and therefore, its consideration confers external validity. We develop a formula of how group-specific ATEs and PRs jointly contribute to an intervention's effect on disparities, and we simulate their joint contributions to disparities in university enrollment within reasonable limits and by presenting a fictitious yet realistic example. Because the contributions of group-specific ATEs and PRs to disparities have not been formalized yet, our results underscore the essential importance of PRs for understanding the impact of educational interventions on disparities. Furthermore, the illustration helps to correct the misconception that focusing exclusively on group-specific ATEs (or on group-specific PRs) is sensible when drawing conclusions about a program's effect on disparities. More specifically, interventions that appear to mitigate disparities based on a comparison of group-specific ATEs might in fact exacerbate inequality if low-SES persons are underrepresented in the program. We close with recommendations for future research and a review of the study's limitations.
Educational inequalities and institutional response: A research from the territorial perspective;"Spain has high levels of territorial inequality in education. Although the results have been improved during the recent period and the distances reduced, there are still very different values depending on the territory, linked, to a large extent, with the levels of wealth and socioeconomic development. This research analyzes, from a socioeducational perspective, the different autonomous educational systems that exist in our country through the following objectives: to know the distances in the educational results between the different autonomies and the connection with their socioeconomic contexts; deepen the main sociodemographic variables linked to school failure and dropout and assess the autonomic institutional response offered in terms of educational policy. The methodological strategy used is mixed, complementing primary (interviews with professionals) and secondary (statistical analysis, review of studies and documentary analysis) sources. The results show that the autonomies configure their educational policy with different levels of expenditure on education and with different documentary bases. Following the analysis of the variables involved in the conformation of the institutional response models, six types of socio-educational strategies have been differentiated, with different levels of effectiveness and efficiency. In short, Spain presents an educational scenario where large territorial disparities coexist, both in the results and in the intervention measures, which greatly hinders social cohesion."
Educational inequalities in fracture-related mortality using multiple cause of death data in the Skane region, Sweden;Aim: To assess the absolute and relative educational inequalities in mortality from hip and non-hip fractures in Skane region, Sweden. Methods: We conducted a population-based open cohort study. People aged 30-99 years, resident in the region during 1998-2013 (n = 999, 148) were followed until death, their 100(th) birthday, relocation outside Skane, or the end of 2014. We obtained individual-level data from the Statistics Sweden and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare's Cause of Death Register. Death certificates coded with any fracture diagnosis were defined as fracture-related deaths. Educational inequalities were assessed by slope and relative indices of inequality (SII and RII). Cox regression and additive hazard models were used to estimates these indices. Results: During a mean follow-up of 12.2 years, there were 5,121 fracture-related deaths, of which 3,110 were associated with hip fracture. Age-standardized, hip fracture-related mortality rates per 100,000 person-years were 31, 95% confidence interval (CI) (30, 32) and 23 (20, 26) in people with low and high levels of education, respectively (rate ratio 1.4, 95% CI (1.2, 1.5)). Corresponding mortality rates for non-hip-fracture related deaths were 20 (18, 21) and 16 (14, 19) (rate ratio 1.2, 95% CI (1.0, 1.4)). SII and RII revealed educational inequalities in hip fracture-related mortality in favour of highly educated people. For non hip fracture-related mortality, there were statistically significant educational inequalities in people aged Conclusions: We found higher fracture-related mortality with lower education suggesting preventative and therapeutic interventions for fractures should pay special attention to people with low-level education.
(Re)Defining Urban Education: A Conceptual Review and Empirical Exploration of the Definition of Urban Education;Generally, educational studies do not problematize the definition of urban education or examine the positionality of sites along a spectrum of urban districts and schools. This study addresses the definitional gap by (a) examining the conceptualization of urban education through an integrative review of prior definitional research and (b) exploring how an urban district may be defined in empirical terms. Our findings indicate six categories are typically used to define urban education: (a) population/location/geography, (b) enrollment, (c) demographic composition of students, (d) resources in schools, (e) disparities and educational inequality, and (f) social and economic context. The results indicate that deficit-oriented language permeates prevailing definitions of urban education and that large-city-centered conceptualizations of urban education may overlook a substantial number of smaller districts with similar levels of educational inequality and diversity.
When Schools Choose: Evaluation and Educational Inequality;"Educators evaluate students for admission in many oversubscribed and selective public schools. Yet, previous studies have focused on families as school choosers. Little is known about the role that educators play in determining whether students are admitted to sought-after schools in stratified education systems. Through an ethnography of the admissions process, this study examines the evaluation of applicants at an oversubscribed school. The admissions process results in the sorting of students into schools that vary on important measures, including graduation and college enrollment rates. The study reveals that school-level educators treated the evaluation process as an opportunity to increase the status of the school. They did this, in part, by selecting students who activated dominant cultural capital. The school district endeavored to make selective schools more widely accessible; however, a lack of district oversight allowed the school to instead pursue its own status-oriented goals."
Public childcare provision and employment participation of East and West German mothers with different educational backgrounds;By focusing on a period of a major public childcare expansion in Germany, this study investigates whether higher levels of childcare coverage for under-threes have been positively associated with employment among mothers with different educational backgrounds. Both standard economic labour theories and sociological theories presume that the effect of public childcare provision varies with mothers' educational attainment. The analysis links county-level data on annual childcare ratios with individual-level data from the Socio-Economic Panel Study (2007-2016). To match mothers with similar characteristics in counties with childcare ratios above and below the annual median within East and West Germany, entropy balancing is applied. Findings indicate a positive relationship between childcare provision and maternal employment, with more pronounced associations for mothers with at least a vocational degree, those with a second birth and those who receive full-time access to childcare.
The changing value of college education in Korea: Focusing on its heterogeneous wage returns across birth cohorts (1956-1986);This study explores the changing value of college education in Korea using the Education and Social Mobility Survey from KEDI. Specifically, it focuses on how the college degree has affected social stratification by examining its heterogeneous wage returns contingent on individual likelihood of college completion. We perform empirical analysis on data consisting of three birth cohorts with two different treatment conditions. The key findings are threefold. First, the average effects of college on wages drastically decreased across the three birth cohorts. Second, the effects of college on wages significantly varied by individual propensity to achieve a college degree, and the patterns of effect heterogeneity changed from negative selection to positive selection across the three birth cohorts. Third, the effect heterogeneity of elite college degree shows negative selection pattern for all three cohorts. The overall implication is that the college degree in Korea has reinforced social reproduction and that the economic benefits of a college degree have diminished significantly for disadvantaged students.
Poverty and Inequality in Rural Education: Evidence from China;In 1998, the People's Republic of China implemented an education policy, the School Consolidation Policy, which entailed merging small rural schools with larger ones. It has had a massive effect on rural people across China, and as a result of it, over 60% of schools in outlying areas have closed. The policy's implementation and effects have received little scholarly attention, despite its scale and consequences. This article investigates the policy, drawing on the nexus between critical discourse analysis and an ethnographical study conducted from 2007 to 2018. The article reviews trajectories and critical junctures shaping educational change in one rural community in north-western China, as an example of broader changes that have been occurring across the country. This is presented through four thematically interrelated episodes, over a 10-year period, illustrating the conception of the policy, its local interpretation and implementation, and its consequences as perceived by stakeholders. The recontextualisation of rural education is part of the policy, as expressed in political discourse, and is examined together with its wider impacts. Attention is paid to the local adoption of the policy at different levels of government and the challenges faced by villagers in rural China in their efforts to capitalise on educational opportunities and secure a measure of social mobility. Consequences of the policy's implementation are analysed and include rising educational inequality, social marginalisation and a lack of social mobility prospects for families affected.
The peleja for public education in the context of Pandemic: reaching and extending plots;We question how the outcome of the pandemic of the new corona virus has been for public education in the country and in Tocantins, with education as a field of struggles with its actors imposing their political and arbitrary cultural options and their legitimate categories of perception and appreciation. In general, it seeks to discuss how this situation has influenced public education, as well as, from then on, to think about open possibilities for this education. It is based on bibliographic, documentary and hypertext analyzes. The situation rekindles the discussion about the non-priority of education by the State and reveals that the link for its destruction is thin and fragile. In a critical perspective, the conjuncture presents possibilities, implying the organization, articulation and mobilization of a broad political struggle in defense of public education in the country.
FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING IN THE CONTEXT OF EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES IN POLAND;The results of numerous research studies examining educational inequality have indicated that children's school success depends, among other things, on their socio-economic status (SES). Children from socio-economically privileged families also tend to achieve better results in foreign language learning than children from less privileged backgrounds. According to the Survey on Foreign Language Learning and Teaching, differences in SES explain 21 percent of the variation in achievements in foreign language learning. The aim of this paper is to give some insight into the current state of the art of foreign language learning, and to present the results of the author's research into how Polish teachers perceive and evaluate the impact of socio-economic inequalities on language learning and teaching at the secondary school level.
Social and Education-oriented Use of the Funds from the Gute-KiTa-Gesetz [Good Day-Nursery Act] A Conceptual Proposal, Using the Example of Thuringia;On 01.01.2019, the so-called,Further Development of Quality and Participation in Early Childhood Education and Care Act ( KiQuTG), known as Good Day-Nursery Act, came into effect. In this paper we support the position that the related state funding should primarily be used for improving the quality of structure, processes and out-comes of early childhood education and care. Furthermore, we argue that the consequences of social inequality (e.g., less educational and participatory opportunities) can only be effectively reduced by a funding model, which focusses on institutions with a high number of children living in disadvantaged circumstances or located in underprivileged areas. We explain our argument using Thuringia as an example. Such models can also be understood as signals for the school system, as effects of school's social environment have been already pointed out for a long time.
School Socioeconomic Composition as a Factor of Educational Inequality Reproduction;It can be inferred from international findings that school socioeconomic com- position (SEC) is a major factor of educational inequality in secondary education at the school level. SEC is believed to have a positive relationship with student achievement along with individual student characteristics. However, a review of research methods used in most studies calls the existence of an influence into question. A study was carried out to evaluate causal relations between school SEC and student achievement. Multilevel regression analysis and propensity score matching (PSM) methods were applied to the panel study Trajectories in Education and Careers data in order to measure the effects of one year of study at schools with low vs. high socioeconomic composition. Correlational and quasi-experimental effect sizes were compared. Analysis results confirm that school SEC is a key factor of educational inequality in Russian secondary education, the inequality effects of school composition overlapping only partially with those of school location. Within a year of schooling, ninth-graders with similar individual characteristics may lose up to a quarter of standard error in PISA-2012 scores if attending a school with low socioeconomic composition, while attending a high-SEC school would improve their educational outcomes by the end of the ninth grade. Negative effects were observed for two subject areas, which allows suggesting a systematic impact of SEC on student achievement. The final part of the article describes the theoretical and practical significance of the findings and presents the main directions of further research in this field.
Cumulative disadvantage of college mismatch from college admission to graduation in the United States;Using nationally representative data (Educational Longitudinal Study:02), and a quasi-experimental design, this study examines the causal relationship between college completion and undermatching, when a student attends a less selective college than his/her qualification would permit. This study reveals that undermatching negatively influences college completion within a four year span, and a six year span. In addition, undermatching effects vary widely among students based on college selectivity levels. As the findings of this study reveal, disadvantages related to undermatching continue to grow during college, after the admissions process. These findings highlight the crucial need for further analysis of undermatching, in order to decrease educational inequality and improve college completion rates.
Typology of students' academic habitus in lower secondary education: A quantitative operationalization approach with data from the National Educational Panel Study;With a qualitative approach based on Bourdieu's ideas, Kramer et al. (2009) developed a typology of students' academic habitus in order to analyze the reproduction of social inequality in education. So far, however, their approach has been widely disregarded in quantitative studies. With this paper, we aim at connecting both perspectives and propose an approach to operationalize the concept of students' academic habitus with quantitative data from the German National Educational Panel Study. In a series of latent-class-analyses with selected variables, we found formally adequate and meaningfully interpretable models, which describe distinct types of students' academic habitus and show connections to further variables with relevance for educational inequality. However, we also found limits in our analytical approach. These limits are a product of a sophisticated background theory and a broad range of indicators.
Swedish School Results, Student Background, Competition and Efficiency;Sweden's declining results in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for 15-year olds and other international tests between 2000 and 2012 have raised concern about the efficiency of the Swedish school system, even though results improved recently. Furthermore, inequality in educational outcomes between socio-economic groups have widened. A specificity of the Swedish school system is that it allows free choice between public and private schools. This has triggered a lively debate on the implications of competition for school results and educational inequality. Against this backdrop, this paper presents an econometric analysis of lower secondary school performance in Sweden, using a panel covering most schools in the country over the period 2013-17. We find that for-profit private schools underperform non-profit and public schools on average, although with large heterogeneity. School competition is associated with lower results in schools with a high share of pupils from weaker socio-economic backgrounds, which is consistent with negative peer effects in left-behind schools. Panel Stochastic Frontier Analysis points to a relatively narrow distribution of inefficiency across schools, with relatively few schools performing very poorly after controlling for their resources and the socio-economic background of their pupils. These results call for better targeting resources towards supporting the pupils most in need and steering competition and school choice so that they benefit pupils from all socio-economic groups equally.
The Crisis weakens the Weak Why the Corona Pandemic increases the Educational Inequality;
Participation in Education of New Migrant Pupils in North Rhine-Westphalia: Regional Disparities and Supra-regional Allocation Patterns;"This paper discusses the question how the schooling strategies of regional school systems differentially influence the educational participation of new migrant pupils. Based on data from official school statistics, the article reconstructs educational pathways of new migrant pupils in North Rhine-Westphalia: The findings show considerable regional disparities in the distribution of 'newcomers' to secondary school types on the one hand; on the other hand, a supra-regional allocation pattern can be reconstructed contributing to a target group-specific negative selection of these pupils into low qualifying school types."
EDUCATIONAL TRAJECTORIES OF RUSSIAN SCHOOL STUDENTS AFTER 9TH GRADES BETWEEN 2000-2014: TYPES OF REGIONAL SITUATIONS;This study examines territorial differences in Russian students' choice of educational trajectory after secondary school between 2000 2014, between regions in various socio-economic and cultural contexts. The Russian case might be interesting for the social and economic gap between Russian provinces, which is comparable to other countries differences: some regions, equal to Singapore or the Netherlands in GDP per capita, while others are similar to Honduras or Bolivia. These differences in economic development, among other things, are also associated with the gap in human capital, which is traditionally measured through the level of education of the population. In the Russian system of education, the actual choice of educational trajectory takes place at the end of secondary school, when children should choose between the academic track, which presumes admission to the high school and university after that, and the vocational track, which includes admission to vocational college. Since 2000th, the proportion of secondary school graduates, who chose the academic trajectory, has declined in most of the Russian regions, despite growing access to higher education, thanks to the raise in the number of universities between 2000-2008 with simultaneous demographic decline. With the dynamic time warping algorithm and time series cluster analysis, six different types of regional situations were identified, in the dynamics of the percentage of students who chose the academic track after secondary school. In general, in the most economically advantaged regions with a developed infrastructure of higher education, the popularity of the academic trajectory remains at the same high level. But also there were some decreases in 2009 and 2013, which could be a consequence of the world economic crises in those years. These crises became additional factors at the regional level, for the families in the more developed territories, to re-evaluate their children's chances for higher education and the associated costs. At the same time, the proportion of students on the academic track in more economically disadvantaged regions, with lower access to higher education, has gradually decreased since 2000. These students faced a double penalty because they had to plan their education strategy, taking into account higher competition for places in universities, or moving to other regions to enter educational institutions there, which was also associated with growing costs. In this situation, the vocational track becomes a more affordable alternative for students from regions with a lower level of economic and social development. As the result of the analysis, it is possible to determine short and long term prerequisites for further growth in the human capital gap between Russian regions and, consequently, the growing differences in economic development.
Secondary effects and motivation of young people to choose vocational training;This article analyses young people's expectations in their last year of compulsory education regarding which path to choose after completing compulsory education, particularly between academic and professional tracks. Secondly, it analyses the motivations of young people who have chosen the vocational training option. The theoretical framework is grounded in Boudon's theory of secondary effects and identification with the school institution. Bivariate and multivariate techniques are used to analyse data from a longitudinal study that began in the academic year 2013-2014 with a sample of 2,056 young people. The main results are that the family's educational level, but especially grades influence the expectation of going to high school or doing vocational training. The majority of young people who choose vocational training have high expressive and instrumental motivations and generally exhibit a large degree of autonomy in their vocational choices.
What do parents want from preschool? Perspectives of low-income Latino/a immigrant families;With a qualitative approach drawing from four focus groups, this study explored what aspects of preschool were valued most by 30 low-income Latino/a immigrant parents with children enrolled in a state-funded preschool program in Texas. Beyond the push and pull factors of necessity, convenience, and supply, parents reported valuing the responsiveness of the school to families' needs and concerns, the provision of a safe and developmentally appropriate environment, the role of preschool in both care and education, the incorporation of parents within the school, and the school's capacity for developing parents' human and navigational capital. Even though parents saw great value in preschool for preparing their children for school and helping themselves as parents, there was also fear and mistrust in neighborhood schools that was rooted in discrimination and long-term educational inequality.

Transitions to upper secondary education in Catalonia: A sociological analysis of education policy;Transitions to upper secondary education are crucial to explain different degrees of social selectivity in diverse education systems. In Catalonia these transitions are especially relevant as the education system is formally comprehensive until the end of compulsory secondary schooling, and only at this point the system is divided in two different tracks: the academic and the vocational. The aim of the paper is to analyse the structural, institutional and discursive articulation of this transition point from the perspective of the sociology of the education policy. Specifically, the paper explores three dimensions of analysis: the structure of the education system, the planning of the supply, and the guidance models. The analysis is based on 28 in-depth interviews with policy makers and stakeholders in the field of upper secondary education in Barcelona. The results point out to the relevance of the political-institutional articulation, contradictions, tensions and omissions of different education systems in setting unequal opportunities of educational transition.
How adult skills are configured?;This article examines the relationship between family background, education, skills use and direct measures of literacy skills in five countries: the United States, Japan, Germany, Denmark and Spain. The main aim is to contribute to the research on skills acquisition by providing a comprehensive analysis of literacy skills. We employ a structural equation modelling and use PIAAC data. Results show that skills are configured in a highly complex manner and that significant differences emerge across the five countries, reflecting their historical and institutional characteristics. Intergenerational transmission of educational inequality is a crucial factor in shaping skills outcomes, although this factor varies considerably between countries. The effects of family background, educational attainment, and skills use in daily life on literacy respond to country specific equilibria.
The Crisis in Music Education Resulting from the Demise of Educational Institutions;Educational institutions currently face a crisis due to various factors that cast doubt on essential principles of equity and quality. This study reviews value chains in educational institutions, ranging from supranational agencies to schools, based on a music education perspective. The methodology has a qualitative design, with a Grounded Theory approach centered on a Constant Comparative Method. Results show that the decline of educational institutions is replicated in music education and furthermore, what is of greatest concern, is that socio-educational inequality emerges from the curriculum design phase. To conclude, a sociomusical approach is one way of overcoming this crisis since it recognizes the world's cultural complexities by promoting systematic interaction between educational institutions and other social groups throughout the world.
Global Learning from the Periphery: An Ethnographic Study of a Chinese Urban Migrant School;This paper presents an ethnographic study on the global learning practice of teachers and students in a Chinese internal migrant school. Rural children have relocated to urban centers with their parents on a massive scale over the past decades, as China undergoes rapid economic changes. Many migrant children have to attend privately run migrant schools which often function within limited budgets. Drawing on various types of data, this study investigates informal learning in a global context. In particular, the research focuses on a Scout program that is modeled on world Scouting movements and that is tailored for the migrant pupils' educational demands. The data collection tools include participant observation, in-depth interview and document collection. The research finds that, with limited educational resources, the informants learn globally to improve the sustainable development of the migrant pupils, to fight against educational inequality, and to facilitate mutual understanding between the migrant and the urban communities. This paper concludes that global learning plays an important role in the informants' ''up-scaling progress facilitated by their linguistic capacity, computer literacy, and social network.
Educational differences in duration of working life and loss of paid employment: working life expectancy in The Netherlands;Objectives This study aims to provide insight into educational differences in duration of working life by working life expectancy (WLE) and working years lost (WYL) through disability benefits and other non-employment states in the Netherlands. Methods Monthly information on employment status of the Dutch population (N=4 999 947) between 16 and 66 years from 2001-2015 was used to estimate working life courses and loss of working years for specific non-employment states. Across educational groups, bi-directional transitions between paid employment and non-employment states were calculated. Using a multistate model, the WLE and WYL at age 16, 30, 50 and up to 66 years as statutory retirement age were estimated for each educational group, stratified by gender. Results Low-educated men and women had a 7.3 (men) and 9.9 (women) years lower WLE at age 30 than high-educated men and women. Among low-educated men, 3.4 working years were lost due to disability benefit compared to 0.8 among high-educated men. Low-educated women lost 3.0 working years due to disability benefit compared to 1.4 among high-educated women. Conclusions There are large educational inequalities over the course of working life. Among low-educated workers, more working years are lost due to unemployment, no income, and especially disability benefits. The latter reflects large educational inequalities in health and working conditions. The metrics of WLE and WYL provide useful insights into the life-course perspective on working careers.
Regional Differences in Access to Educational Resources, Academic Results and Students' Trajectories in Russia;Today little is known about regional inequality in education in Russia. In this article we analyze regional differences in educational resources in association with regions' socio-economic characteristics, and in addition we assess the relationship of regions' socio-economic characteristics and educational resources with the proportion of students remaining in high school as well as with the average results of the Unified State Exam (end of high school test) in two compulsory subjects-Russian and math. We test theories of effectively maintained inequality and maximally maintained inequality using data of Russia regions that we retrieve from open sources-publications of Rosstat and federal and regional education agencies. To estimate the relationship we use correlation and regression analysis. Our results show that more urbanized regions with higher levels of human capital and GRP are usually characterized by the higher level of school expenditures, more experienced teachers, and higher chances for students to study at the advanced level. The same time, the level of urbanization and human capital is positively related to the proportion of students that choose an academic trajectory after finishing secondary school. Finally, the results of the Unified State Exam are also positively associated with access to educational resources. In both subjects, the average test score is higher in the regions with a higher proportion of students in lyceums/gymnasiums and in schools with advanced study options. In Russian, the exam results are also related to the proportion of students remaining in high school. In general, regional inequality in access to educational resources overlaps with socio-economic differences, which produces a situation of double loss or double advantage. Greater access to better educational resources in regions with higher human capital supports effectively maintained inequality theory. At the same time the fact that a lower proportion of students choose an academic trajectory after grade 9 in regions with less human capital could be evidence of maximally maintained inequality. The article could be interesting to readers whose area of study relates to problems of education inequality and education policy.
Combating educational inequality Competing frameworks;
School Segregation Across the World: Has Any Progress Been Made in Reducing the Separation of the Rich from the Poor?;The segregation of secondary school students into different schools has important implications for educational inequality, social cohesion and intergenerational mobility. Previous research has demonstrated how between-school segregation varies significantly across countries, with high levels of segregation occurring in central European nations that 'track' children into different schools and much lower levels in Scandinavia. This paper contributes to this literature by examining whether industrialised countries have made any progress in reducing levels of between-school segregation over time. Using six waves of data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), this work shows how the segregation of rich and poor students has remained broadly unchanged across OECD countries. This is despite major economic and political events occurring during this period, along with the introduction of numerous policy initiatives designed to reduce socioeconomic gaps. Therefore, the conclusions indicate that structural factors are likely to be the main drivers of between-school segregation (e.g. neighbourhood segregation or long-standing school admission policies) and that education policymakers may need to be much more radical if they are to foster greater levels of integration between the rich and the poor.
Teachers' Implicit Attitudes Toward Students From Different Social Groups: A Meta-Analysis;Teachers' attitudes toward their students have been associated with differential teachers' expectations and, in turn, with students' educational pathways. Theories of social cognition can explain the link between attitudes and behavior. In this regard, the distinction between implicit and explicit attitudes is worth to be considered, whereby implicit attitudes are automatically activated when the attitude object is present and guide automatic behavior. In contrast, explicit attitudes infer deliberation and reflection, hence affecting controlled behavior. As teachers often are required to act immediately in situations that do not allow for thoughtful reflection due to time restraints, teachers' implicit attitudes concerning different student groups with shared characteristics, such as gender or ethnicity, may be especially important when considering teachers' behavior in relation to students' educational pathways. This notion is reflected by an increased interest in adopting implicit methodology in the educational domain. Over the last 10 years, several studies have been conducted in different countries, involving in- and pre-service teachers and investigating their attitudes toward different student groups. Estimates of effects have varied and may be affected by sampling bias. To systematically review and integrate data from different studies, this meta-analysis focuses on teachers' implicit attitudes. Following the systematic search of the database and initial screening, 43 articles were identified from which 22, describing 34 studies, were retained for the meta-analysis after further inspection. First analyses revealed an estimated average effect size of 0.56 for implicit attitudes in favor of non-marginalized groups. As there was a large extent of heterogeneity between studies, several moderator variables were investigated. Results showed that the employed implicit measure and stimulus materials as well as the student target group affected the effect sizes. Low or non-significant relationships were reported between implicit and explicit attitudes. Findings are discussed in terms of theory and future research.
Investigating Inequality in the US School System through Ibn Khaldun's Political Wisdom and the Concept of Asabiyah;"Much of the conversation about inequality in education and society problematizes poor and minority populations, rather than tackling systemic issues. It helps to address these issues through using a lens that exposes dominant ideology. This article examines the exclusion of scholars outside of the ideological center. It also suggests that nondominant lenses support the process of understanding the root of educational inequality. The article specifically examines the work of Ibn Khaldun, a scholar who lived over 600 years ago in what is now Tunisia and who is considered the father of the social sciences. His work, Al Muqaddimah, introduced the concept of asabiyah and outlined guidelines for political wisdom, including suggestions for access to education. Ibn Khaldun understood society as cyclical; all institutions dovetailed and influenced one another. By situating education within the rise and fall of civilizations, one can use the microcosm of the classroom to evaluate the health of society at large, particularly within the United States. Analysis of the case study of the United States based on the statements of political wisdom shows that the United States is a civilization on the brink of collapse. His work also demonstrates the importance of intellectual hybridity and valuing voices from the periphery, including minority children in our classrooms who may grow up to become the next Ibn Khaldun."
Enrolment status disparity: evidence from secondary education in Myanmar;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore individual enrolment trajectories to fully understand the actual disparity in secondary education enrolment statuses among the different socio-economic status (SES) groups in a newly emerged nation, Myanmar. Design/methodology/approach The differences in enrolment statuses among various SES groups (high, middle and low) were examined based on enrolment trajectory diagrams and individual enrolment patterns using longitudinal data. The analyses utilised a sample of 932 students from government schools in the urban Yangon Region. Findings The results revealed that the ideal enrolment trajectory cases (i.e. entering secondary education at Myanmar's official age and completing all grades without repetition) increased for the highest-SES level, whilst the cases with diverse and complex enrolment trajectories increased for the lower-SES levels. Additionally, over-aged students in the lowest-SES level (boys in particular) were more likely to demonstrate worse enrolment patterns. Originality/value By analysing disparities with enrolment trajectories rather than with the cross-sectional parity index, the findings offer clearer and more detailed evidence for the current enrolment status inequalities by SES level in Myanmar. This more complete evidence could allow for an effective accomplishment of worldwide equitable and universal secondary education.
Parental values in the UK;This article investigates the extent to which parental values differ between social groups in the UK at the start of the twenty-first century. The study of parental values is an important area of sociological enquiry that can inform scholarship from across the social sciences concerned with educational inequality and cultural variability in family life. We draw on data from the Millennium Cohort Study to show how parent's social class, religion, religiosity, race and ethnicity, and education are related to the qualities they would like their children to have. Our rank-ordered regression models show that parents in service class occupations place significantly more importance on 'thinking for self' than 'obey parents' compared to those in routine manual occupations. We also show that although class matters, the relationship between education and parental values is particularly strong. Parenting values also differ by parental racial and ethnic background and by levels of religiosity.
EDUCATIONAL GERRYMANDERING: MONEY, MOTIVES, AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS;"Public school funding plummeted following the Great Recession and failed to recover over the next decade, prompting strikes and protests across the nation. Courts have done almost nothing to stop the decline. While a majority of state supreme courts recognize a constitutional right to an adequate or equal education, they increasingly struggle to enforce the right. That right is now approaching a tipping point. Either it evolves, or risks becoming irrelevant. In the past, courts have focused almost exclusively on the adequacy and equity of funding for at-risk students, demanding that states provide more resources. Courts have failed to ask the equally important question of why states refuse to provide the necessary resources. As a result, states have never stopped engaging in the behavior that leads to the funding failures in the first place. This Article argues that states refuse to fully fund low-income students' education because they have ulterior aims and biases-maintaining privilege for suburban schools, lowering taxes for wealthy individuals, and not wasting money on low-income kids. States go to extraordinary lengths to manipulate school funding formulas to achieve these ends. Thus, the various policies that produce inequality and inadequacy are not just benign state failures; they are intentional efforts to gerrymander educational opportunity. Understood this way, school funding manipulations violate federal equal protection and state constitutional rights to education. Reframing school funding failures as gerrymandering can both create a much-needed federal check on educational inequality and reinvigorate the enforcement of state constitutional rights to education."
Determinants of students' idealistic and realistic educational aspirations in elementary school;Although the social stratification of educational aspirations is well documented for parents and adolescents, current educational inequality research largely ignores the perspective of children. To learn more about the involvement of children in the emergence and reproduction of social disparities, we examine children's educational aspirations during elementary school. Based on the Wisconsin model, rational choice approaches, and the theory of cultural reproduction, our explorative investigation aims to identify determinants of young students' idealistic and realistic aspirations. We utilize a sample of 4947 third grade students from Starting Cohort 2 of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). The multivariate results indicate that students' aspirations are influenced by their parents' social position and aspirations, whereby the students' self-rated rational choice indicators assert the greatest impact.
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY AND ITS DETERMINANTS: EVIDENCE FOR WOMEN IN NINE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, 1950s-1990s;This paper examines educational inequality in nine Latin American countries at the sub-country level from the 1950s to the 1990s. Educational inequality is measured by the difference in schooling years between the taller and the shorter half of the female population. Schooling years significantly increased across birth cohorts, especially before the 1980s, regardless of socio-economic stratum, region or country. However, educational inequality persisted. This finding reflects the achievement of the import substitution industrialisation era in educational development and its failure in mitigating the unequal distribution of education rooted in Latin America's social structure. Trade liberalisation and educational expansion are found to reduce educational inequality in capital and urban regions, whereas democracy and tax reform increased it. By contrast, educational inequality in rural regions was hardly influenced by policy changes. This finding urges future explorations into whether the persistence of educational inequality in rural regions is due to endemic social structure.
Achieving more than grades: morality, race, and enrichment education;Affluent parents pursue after-school educational and other extracurricular options for their children in order to instill human capital and cultural capital. Such parents also worry about raising spoiled children with too much entitlement. With this in mind, we would expect parents whose children attend private, after-school learning centers-despite attending well-resourced schools-to appreciate the ability to accrue capital but to regret the moral implications for their children. I have interviewed white professionals who enroll their young children in weekly classes at private learning centers, a site of increasing educational inequality. In contrast to expectations, parents believe it is through such enrollment, not despite it, that they are able to raise children with proper values, separate from instilling cultural or human capital. Parents' conceptions of moral parenting reveal underlying cultural binaries in regard to raising children, of being hard working versus overindulged and of humanistic versus robotic. Here, we see the reach of culture, for even practices clearly motivated by practical considerations have deeper meanings. We also see the reach of race. They mostly praise rather than criticize Asian Americans, and they reserve their harshest critiques for fellow white professionals, whom they frame in line with anti-black stereotypes.
The Prison School: Educational Inequality and School Discipline in the Age of Mass Incarceration;
The re-emergence of educational inequality during a period of reforms: A study of Swedish school leavers 1991-2012;Against the background of a liberalization of Swedish compulsory education, this paper analyses post-1991 shifts in the way compulsory education performance in Sweden has been shaped by parental background, residential context and school context. We can document increasing school and residential segregation of foreign background students and, after 2008, increasing segregation by income, employment status and social allowance reception. Over time, educational performance has become increasingly linked to family, neighbourhood and school context. The greatest change has been for parental background, but the importance of school context and neighbourhood context has also increased. A noteworthy finding is that residential context consistently has a stronger effect on student performance than school context. Student grades were found to be most strongly influenced by the closest (12 or 25) residential peers of the school leavers as compared to larger peer groups. The increase in the influence of family, neighbourhood and residential context has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the between-school variation (intra-class correlation) in student performance, but it was not until after 2005 that this increased variability became clearly linked to the social composition of the schools. This study's results suggest that the restructuring of Swedish compulsory education has had consequences for equality, possibly because disadvantaged social groups have not been as able as advantaged groups to navigate and benefit from the educational landscape created by the school reforms.
The Relation between Inequality and Intergenerational Class Mobility in 39 Countries;We study the relationship between inter-class inequality and intergenerational class mobility across 39 countries. Previous research on the relationship between economic inequality and class mobility remains inconclusive, as studies have confounded intra- with between-class economic inequalities. We propose that between-class inequality across multiple dimensions accounts for the inverse relationship between inequality and mobility: the larger the resource distance between classes, the less likely it is that mobility from one to the other will occur. We consider inequality in terms of between-class differences in three areas-education, wages, and income-and in a composite measure. Building on sociological mobility theory, we argue that cross-country variation in mobility results, in part, from families adapting to different levels of between-class inequality. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find a negative correlation between inter-class inequality and social fluidity, with between-class inequality being a better predictor of mobility chances than conventional distributional measures. We also find that the resource distance between classes is negatively related to the strength of their intergenerational association for some off-diagonal origin and destination (OD) class combinations.
Children's conversion of cultural capital into educational success: the symbolic and skill-generating functions of cultural capital;"A prominent explanation of intergenerational educational inequality is Bourdieu's cultural reproduction theory. Indeed, previous studies have frequently shown that children's cultural capital relates to academic outcomes. However, it remains unclear how children convert their cultural capital into achievement. While Bourdieu argued that cultural capital influences academic outcomes primarily by biasing teachers' grades, other researchers have proposed the alternative explanation that children's cultural capital absorption directly translates into academic skills. Using survey data on 2975 fifth graders from the German National Educational Panel Study, we disentangle these two mechanisms of children's cultural capital conversion; and argue that the main conversion mechanism depends on the cultural capital dimension examined. The results of our structural equation model suggest that both mechanisms are at work and that the main conversion mechanism depends on the dimension of cultural capital examined."
A circle of research on disadvantaged schools, improvement and test-based accountability;This study analyses how studies on disadvantaged schools, improvement and test-based accountability relate to each other. The analysis covers 69 studies on disadvantaged schools reported in prestigious educational journals and conducted in 1995-2015. Educational policies related to evaluation and accountability define the official goals of schooling, and the aim in this article is to analyse how the chosen studies discuss these educational policies and understand school success and failure. The following questions were asked: What typologies related to test-based accountability can be constructed in research on disadvantaged schools? What understandings of good schools are embedded in the identified typologies? Disadvantaged schools are at the centre of improvement and therefore also the target of evaluative policy practices. The results show that research supports test-based accountability practices, and that critical studies on school improvement are in the minority.
Trends in educational and income inequalities in cardiovascular morbidity in middle age in Northern Sweden 1993-2010;Aims: Research is scarce regarding studies on income and educational inequality trends in cardiovascular disease in Sweden. The aim of this study was to assess trends in educational and income inequalities in first hospitalizations due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) from 1993 to 2010 among middle-aged women and men in Northern Sweden. Methods: The study comprised repeated cross-sectional register data from year 1993-2010 of all individuals aged 38-62 years enrolled in the Vasterbotten Intervention Programme (VIP). Data included highest educational level, total earned income and first-time hospitalization for CVD from national registers. The relative and slope indices of inequality (RII and SII, respectively) were used to estimate educational and income inequalities in CVD for six subsamples for women and men, and interaction analyses were used to estimate trends across time periods. Results: Educational RII and SII were stable in women, while they decreased in men. Income inequalities in CVD developed differently compared with educational inequalities, with RII and SII for both men and women increasing during the study period, the most marked for RII in women rising from 1.52 in the 1990s to 2.62 in the late 2000s. Conclusions: The trend of widening income inequalities over 18 years in the middle-aged in Northern Sweden, in the face of stable or even decreasing educational inequalities, is worrisome from a public health perspective, especially as Swedish authorities monitor socioeconomical inequalities exclusively by education. The results show that certain social inequalities in CVD rise and persist even within a traditionally egalitarian welfare regime.
University supply expansion and inequality of opportunity of access: the case of Uruguay;"This paper examines whether opportunity of access to public university has improved over the period 2008-2013 in Uruguay; in which an important territorial expansion of the public university supply, historically located in Montevideo (the capital of Uruguay), to other regions of the country (named the Interior) took place. Results suggest that Uruguay expanded opportunity to access university increasingly towards the more disadvantaged individuals. However, as the coverage rate of students from better-off parental educational background increased more than for those from less-privileged ones, inequality of opportunity worsened in the Interior."
Educational inequalities in all-cause and cause-specific mortality among people with gout: a register-based matched cohort study in southern Sweden;Background: Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis with a rising prevalence around the globe. While educational inequalities in incidence and prevalence of gout have been reported, no previous study investigated educational inequality in mortality among people with gout. The aim of this study was to assess absolute and relative educational inequalities in all-cause and cause-specific mortality among people with gout in comparison with an age- and sex-matched cohort free of gout in southern Sweden. Methods: We identified all residents aged >= 30 years of Skane region with doctor-diagnosed gout (ICD-10 code M10, n = 24,877) during 1998-2013 and up to 4 randomly selected age- and sex-matched comparators free of gout (reference cohort, n = 99,504). These were followed until death, emigration, or end of 2014. We used additive hazards models and Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, marital status, and country of birth to estimate slope and relative indices of inequality (SII/RII). Three cause-of-death attribution approaches were considered for RII estimation: underlying cause, any mention, and weighted multiple-cause. Results: Gout patients with the lowest education had 1547 (95% CI: 1001, 2092) more deaths per 100,000 person-years compared with those with the highest education. These absolute inequalities were larger than in the reference population (1255, 95% CI: 1038, 1472). While the contribution of cardiovascular (cancer) mortality to these absolute inequalities was greater (smaller) in men with gout than those without, the opposite was seen among women. Relative inequality in all-cause mortality was smaller in gout (RII 1.29 [1.18, 1.41]) than in the reference population (1.46 [1.38, 1.53]). The weighted multiple-cause approach generally led to larger RIIs than the underlying cause approach. Conclusions: Our register-based matched cohort study showed that low level of education was associated with increased mortality among gout patients. Although the magnitude of relative inequality was smaller in people with gout compared with those without, the absolute inequalities were greater reflecting a major mortality burden among those with lower education.
The Educational Gradient in Health Among Children in Immigrant Families;"Educational inequality in the health of US children-what social scientists refer to as the educational gradient in health-is present at birth for virtually every marker of health and increases throughout childhood. However, a puzzling contradiction to this pattern has been observed among the growing population of youth in immigrant families. Some evidence suggests an ambiguous relationship between education and health among immigrant families, with a flat relationship between maternal education and maternal health behaviors and children's birth outcomes, and a stronger relationship as children become adolescents. Does an educational gradient in health emerge among children in immigrant families during childhood and adolescence? To date, we lack a prospective examination of how the gradient changes from birth throughout childhood and adolescence among this population. Moreover, while the dominant explanation for a weaker gradient among children with immigrant parents centers on the family setting, we know little about family-level dynamics among the same immigrant families as children age. Using national, longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study, we examine the association between maternal education and children's health (measured by mothers' ratings) over the early life course (birth through age 15) among children of immigrants and children of native-born parents and consider whether changes in children's economic status and family composition contribute to the educational gradient, or lack thereof, in child health. Analyses reveal that: (1) maternal education is strongly predictive of health, even among children of immigrants; (2) immigrant status does not appear to be protective for health within educational groups, as evidenced by poorer health among children of immigrants whose mothers have the lowest level of education, as compared to children of natives; (3) children in the least-educated immigrant families are experiencing better health trajectories as they age than children in similar native-born families; and (4) accounting for household economic conditions and family composition does not reduce the size of the education gradient over time among children of immigrants."
Educational inequality in physician-diagnosed hypertension widened and persisted among women from 1999 to 2014 in Hong Kong;"Gender differences in the trend of educational inequality in hypertension have been observed especially in the Asian populations, indicating the increasing importance of education as a social determinant of hypertension among women. This study examined the gender-specific trends of educational inequality in physician-diagnosed hypertension in Hong Kong between 1999 and 2014. Based on a series of eight government-led territory-wide household surveys conducted between 1999 and 2014, 97,481 community-dwelling Hong Kong Chinese adults aged 45 or above were analysed. The extent and trend of gender-specific educational inequality in self-reported physician-diagnosed hypertension were estimated by regression-based Relative Index of Inequality and age-standardised Slope Index of Inequality. Over the study period, age-standardised prevalence of self-reported hypertension increased in both genders, with the greatest prevalence among the least educated women. Educational inequalities in hypertension significantly widened in female from 1999 to 2009 and persisted thereafter; nonetheless, the respective inequality was negligible in male. Further adjustment for household income did not attenuate the observed inequality. To conclude, a widened and then persistent discrepancy in hypertension across education levels was observed among women, but not among men, in Hong Kong. The gender perspective should be carefully considered when designing hypertension prevention strategies and related health policies."
'If the students don't come, or if they don't finish, we don't get the money.' Principals, immigration, and the organisational logic of school choice in Sweden;School choice is associated with increased educational inequality and across-school segregation. This article documents the organisational practices and logics affecting school segregation and inequality. Through an institutional ethnographic study of principals' responses to school choice within the context of immigration in Malmo, Sweden, I find that principals work to align their schools with generalised conceptions of a 'good' school - a 'Swedish' school without many immigrants. Principals pursue the image or reality of 'Swedishness' through choices about the presentation of the school, approaches to managing enrolment, selection of programmes of study, and even decisions about where schools are located. Through their administrative work, principals write presumed preferences for Swedishness into the structure of the school system. The results suggest that, when addressing the link between school choice and equality, group preferences of school choosers cannot be considered independently of the organisation of schooling accomplished by principals and other organisational actors.
Late-stage educational inequality: Can selection on noncognitive skills explain waning social background effects?;Past research finds that the effect of socioeconomic origin on the probability of making educational transitions decreases over the educational career from primary to graduate school. Some have argued that this pattern of waning is the result of selective attrition, since those of modest social origins who make a given transition may have exceptional cognitive or noncognitive skills while more advantaged individuals may rely less heavily on these skills to continue their education. We study a sample of American 10th graders from 1980 to assess how much the pattern of waning effects is due to selective attrition along noncognitive skills for this cohort. We find that controlling for noncognitive skills does not make the effect of socioeconomic origin more stable across transitions. Still, socioeconomic advantage does not decline uniformly across transitions, and it appears most pronounced at the transition into college, whether accounting for noncognitive skills or not. Our results suggest that origins continue to drive educational attainment even among those who make it to postsecondary transitions.
A SOCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE INEQUALITY OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND EDUCATIONAL. APPROACH FROM THEORETICAL AND SOME ORGANIZATIONS IN CHARGE OF YOUR STUDY;Humanity and its complex existence denote how the inequality of opportunity constitutes one of the most serious and persistent problems worldwide. Human inequality in general consists of the uneven distribution of attributes among a set of social units such as individuals, categories, groups or regions as Charles Tilly points out from a multidimensional look. From a theoretical review of a sociological nature and when contemplating some of the political organizations, it can be categorized according to the form, time, space and people it affects and it is from this categorization that it can be addressed. In this way, inequalities are not the result of a single cause, they have long histories in which many processes have intervened. It is useless to try to find a factor that is the sole determinant of inequality, call it knowledge, wealth or ownership of the means of production.
Where do regional influences matter? The impact of socio-spatial indicators on transitions from secondary school to university;"The paper at hand concentrates on how regional indicators influence school graduates' transitions to university in and outside their home region. Our paper contributes to the literature in three ways: We include not only study opportunities in the region but focus on three distinct regional factors; namely, the economic situation, the university orientation as well as study opportunities. Furthermore, we quantify the spatial radius in which the three regional indicators affect individuals' transition to university. Beyond that, the analyses cover a period of 26 years to infer on developments in the relevance of regional factors over time. To do so, geographic information on regions is used and aggregated within travel-time radii. The data is linked to panel data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). Our findings indicate that, school graduates' chances to enter university depend on labor-market conditions as well as on university infrastructure. We find that spatial radius matters; significant regional associations can only be observed up to radii of 60-minutes of travel time. Regional influences on the chance to enter university and the place of study increase over time."
Educational inequalities in traffic deaths during fluctuations of the economy in four Argentinian provinces, 1999-2013;Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyse how educational differentials in traffic mortality changed during economic fluctuations in four Argentinian provinces. Study design: Retrospective quantitative analysis of secondary data. Methods: Data on fatalities due to traffic injuries (all traffic injuries, pedestrians/cyclists, motorcyclists, car users and unspecified road users) in four Argentinian provinces between 1999 and 2013 were linked to population data and information on the educational level of the deceased to compute mortality rates by educational level. Negative binomial models were estimated using age, sex, year, province of residence, year of economic expansion or recession and educational level as explanatory variables. Results: Annual traffic mortality differentials by educational level were lower during the period of economic crisis. An absolute increase in traffic mortality was observed in in-dividuals of low educational level during economic expansions, but here, there were no traffic mortality differences for individuals of medium to high educational level. The educational gap in motorcyclist mortality widened during the period of quick economic expansion between 2005 and 2013. Conclusions: We found less educational inequality in traffic mortality during an economic crisis in a developing country. However, the educational inequalities for different subtypes of traffic mortality show different patterns of evolution during the cycle of economic expansion and recession. Considering deaths due to traffic injuries, economic growth seems to be riskier for individuals of lower educational level compared with those of medium-high educational level.

The distributions of teacher qualification: A cross-national study;This cross-national study examines how different measures of teacher qualifications are distributed across low-income schools and classrooms. The findings indicate that the magnitude of the exposure rates and gaps to less qualified teachers between low-SES and high-SES classrooms and schools varies remarkably across 32 OECD countries. On average, within-school distribution accounts for a greater share of the total gaps than between-school distribution, especially when it comes to out-of-field teaching. This study also examines the relationships between national contexts and the distributions of teacher qualifications. The findings suggest that income inequality is negatively associated with within-school exposure gaps to out-of-field reading teachers. The findings from this study support the notion that governments play a critical role in narrowing the gaps of teacher distribution. Specifically, equitable teacher distribution relies on government allocations of teachers more equally between and within schools to better ensure equitable distribution across student socioeconomic status.
Hukou identity and fairness in the ultimatum game;The hukou system is a mandatory household registration system in China that assigns an individual either an urban/non-agricultural hukou or a rural/agricultural hukou based on one's birthplace. This system favors urban residents and discriminates against rural residents in accessing state-owned resources such as employment, education, health care, and housing. To better understand how this institutionally imposed hukou identity impacts an individual's sense of fairness in the ultimatum game, we conducted a field experiment in China using 9-12-year-old children and collected 672 observations. Subjects played a one-shot ultimatum game to allocate 20 yuan in groups of two. We employed a 2 (hukou salience) (responder's hukou type) experiment design and used the strategic method ultimatum game. We primed our subjects with their hukou identity before they made their decisions in the experiment. Results of this study show that hukou salience mainly affects rural hukou subjects, who belong to the perceived less-favored social group. On one hand, when the hukou identity is made salient, rural hukou proposers decrease their amount offered regardless of their responder's hukou type. On the other hand, rural hukou responders expect higher offers from their urban hukou proposers when the hukou identity is revealed. We interpret these results as that rural hukou subjects tend to seek compensations for their perceived hukou inferiority to achieve fair distributions.
The Concept of Academic Mobility: Normative and Methodological Considerations;Most of the literature on the development of educational inequality has operated under the achievement gaps paradigm, often assuming that the underlying normative and methodological foundations related to equality and justice in education are a settled matter. In this article, we argue that important normative dimensions are overlooked with traditional mean-based measures, and that metrics that capture students' academic mobility as they progress through school can provide the informational base needed to describe and evaluate these policy and socially relevant aspects. We discuss some key normative principles and methodological dimensions related to academic mobility and provide an empirical example of the mobility metrics presented using a nationally representative data set.
Left behind? Over-time change in the social mobility of children from unskilled working-class backgrounds in Germany;Research on intergenerational social mobility tends to focus on examining the level of overall social fluidity in society. However, from a social justice perspective it can be argued that the type of social fluidity that matters most is upward mobility from the lowest rung of the social ladder. This article examines the labour market chances of children from parents in unskilled working-class positions, relative to children from skilled working-class and higher social class backgrounds, and how they have changed across four birth cohorts in post-WWII Germany. We find that individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds have substantially lower labour market chances than individuals from skilled working-class backgrounds or higher social class backgrounds. Moreover, we find that the gap in labour market chances between individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds and individuals from more advantaged backgrounds has not narrowed but, if anything, has widened across the four birth cohorts we examine. Our results suggest that an important factor underlying this sustained labour market inequality is a persistently high level of educational inequality between these groups.
Missionaries or mercenaries? How teachers in elite private schools embrace privilege;This article is based on a multi-site study of teachers in elite private schools in Australia. Teachers' accounts from this study bring nuance to the reasons one might short-handedly expect they have in working for these exclusive institutions. It is not that everyday motivations don't matter, for example, the financial compensations, the beautiful grounds and the status payoffs, but that teachers bring their own discourses, histories and intentions to bear on the contradictions of their work-lives. This is crucial evidence for understanding how privilege functions, how teachers are not simply co-opted or constrained. Instead, this article brings into view the agency of teachers who embrace privilege in spite of thorny questions around educational inequality that elite private schools cannot avoid.
Disparities in Subjective Wellbeing: Political Status, Urban-Rural Divide, and Cohort Dynamics in China;"This paper investigates disparities in subjective wellbeing in China by analyzing the Chinese General Social Survey (2003-2015). Our hierarchical age-period-cohort models reveal how Chinese Communist Party membership, the urban-rural divide, and cohort differences have jointly shaped levels of happiness. Interestingly, the significance of political status in shaping happiness varies profoundly across birth cohorts and locations of residence. In earlier cohorts (1910-1948), Communist Party members in rural areas have a considerable advantage over nonmembers, but this advantage gradually diminishes later, except the 1977-1985 cohort. The advantage of urban party membership keeps increasing up to the cohort born during 1957-1965 but declines rapidly after that. Findings suggest that in the planned economy, political status plays a central role in promoting subjective wellbeing especially in urban China; the transition to a market economy in post-Mao China has reduced political disparities among younger cohorts, mainly for urban residents."
Mapping inequality in access to meaningful learning in secondary education in Ethiopia: implications for sustainable development;The rapid expansion of primary education in Ethiopia has enabled most children to attend primary education-or at least to start schooling. This expansion, however, is largely symbolic rather than substantive where substantive refers to access that generates meaningful learning. The article explores spatial inequality in access to meaningful learning in secondary education in Ethiopia with a particular focus on the Amhara region, and addresses the question: Is substantive learning equitably distributed? To operationalise this question, access-to-learning is conceptualised using a new method of constructing a learning-oriented measure of educational quality that combines grade survival (access) and test score (quality). Moreover, the zones of exclusion framework has been used to see the systematic loss of students from the education system at different points in time. Using GIS tools, the extent of spatial inequality in access-to-learning was determined by mapping the proportion of students who achieved the required level of performance, and geographical variation in the distribution of inequality factors. The paper concludes with implications for educational policy and planning and recommendations for further research.
The socio-spatial dimension of educational inequality: A comparative European analysis;"Given recent evidence of rising levels of social segregation in European countries, this study uses standardized data from the Program for International Student Assessment (n = 171,159; 50.5% male) to examine the extent to which education systems in Europe are socially segregated and whether social segregation in the school system affects achievement gaps between students of different social origin. Results suggest that the degree of social segregation within education systems varied substantially across countries. Furthermore, multilevel regression models indicate that the effect of socioeconomic status on student achievement was moderately but significantly stronger in more segregated education systems, even after controlling for alternative system-level determinants of social inequality in student achievement. These findings provide original evidence that social segregation in education systems may contribute to the intergenerational transmission of educational (dis)advantage and thus serve to exacerbate wider problems of socioeconomic inequality in Europe."
Human capital and income inequality in India: is there a non-linear and asymmetric relationship?;The article attempts to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between human capital and income inequality in India in a non-linear and asymmetric framework. To capture both long-run and short-run asymmetries, we have employed the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag approach using the relevant data from 1970 to 2016. Findings of the article suggest that education expansion acts as a major factor in reducing prevailing high income inequality, that is an increase in average years of schooling results in more equal distribution of income. In contrast, high economic growth, inflation and trade openness create unequal distribution of income. The asymmetric causality test results indicate that there is unidirectional causality running from female human capital, economic growth and inflation to income inequality. From a policy perspective, we suggest that education expansion should be used as a powerful tool to mitigate income inequality by emphasizing the quality of education. At the same time, policies geared towards social benefits, inclusive education, training for unskilled workers and price stability should be encouraged to attain fair income distribution in India.
Understanding educational inequality in Hong Kong: secondary school segregation in changing institutional contexts;Since the mid-1990s, important education policy changes, such as the growth of Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) schools and the reform of the medium of instruction (MOI) policy, have been made in Hong Kong. Little is known about their impact on school segregation and educational inequality. We address this issue using six successive cycles of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data. We found evidence for rising levels of secondary school segregation in terms of family socio-economic status and mathematics achievement from 1995 to 2011, whereas segregation declined from 2011 to 2015. We speculate that the salience of the MOI policy in expediting the segregating tendencies of the DSS sector might explain a growing magnitude of the effect of family socio-economic status on academic achievement between 1995 and 2011, and the reversed direction of such trends between 2011 and 2015. Implications are discussed.
Comparing inequality in adolescents' reading achievement across 37 countries and over time: outcomes versus opportunities;"This paper assesses two approaches to the measurement of educational inequality in international comparisons between countries and over time. We analyse reading literacy performance of 15-year-old students using data from PISA 2009 and 2015 for 37 EU and OECD countries. We show that inequality of outcome and inequality of opportunity do not necessarily co-vary; they can go in opposite directions both across countries and over time. Our results suggest that indicators of variation in educational outcomes are more suitable to the types of problems that affect international comparisons of educational achievement than the more common approach of measuring of inequality of opportunity."
Signals, Educational Decision-Making, and Inequality;"We propose a model of educational decision-making based on rational choice theory in which students use signals about academic ability to make inference about the costs and benefits of different educational options. Our model is simple, extends ideas from previous models, and has testable implications. We test our model using data on Danish monozygotic twins and find that (i) students who receive a positive signal about their academic ability have a higher likelihood of enrolling in and completing a college-bound track compared with those who do not; (ii) the effect of the signal is stronger for students from low socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds than for those from high-SES ones; and (iii) for low-SES students the effect is stronger on enrolment than on completion. Our results suggest that signals about academic ability affect educational decisions in general; they are more important for students who do not have a family 'push' to avoid downward social mobility; and they affect educational inequality by making low-SES students too optimistic about their likelihood of completing the college-bound track."
The Effect of the Post-Socialist Transition on Inequality of Educational Opportunity: Evidence from German Unification;In 1990, German unification led to an abrupt and extensive restructuring of the educational system and economy of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) as the latter was reintegrated into the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). However, the consequences of this large-scale institutional change for the educational inequality between children from different social class backgrounds in East Germany continue to be poorly understood. This article seeks to shed new light on this question by using a quasi-experimental approach to examine the difference in educational inequality between East and West Germany before and after German unification. We compare changes in the class gradient in the attainment of comparable school and university qualifications in East and West Germany across six birth cohorts, including three cohorts of individuals who completed their schooling after unification. We find that before unification, inequality of educational opportunity at the mid-secondary, upper-secondary and tertiary level was substantially lower in East Germany than in West Germany and that unification led to a substantial and sustained convergence of the level of inequality of educational opportunity in East Germany towards that of West Germany.
Body Mass Index and Educational Inequality: An Update of Crandall (1995);Over 2 decades ago, social psychological research revealed that weight stigma may undermine educational achievement. This study documented that a greater proportion of college students were thin compared with the general population and that heavier females received less college financial support from parents than thinner females (Crandall, 1995). Although frequently cited, there is no current literature on these phenomena despite major changes since the 1990s including a much higher prevalence of obesity and the economic downturn known as the Great Recession. Thus, in the interest of pursuing replicable science, the present study examined the role of weight stigma in higher education in 2 studies using ethnically diverse samples of first-year college students. We found that the average Body Mass Index (BMI) and BMI distribution in our samples were still significantly lower than a nationally representative sample, regardless of gender and ethnicity. We also found that, among females, self-funded students had higher BMIs than parent-funded students. In one sample, this was also the case for males. Together these findings suggest that not only are heavy young adults perhaps less likely to be in college than their thin counterparts, but they may also receive less support from their parents. This points to the possibility that weight stigma may undermine educational achievement in today's youth, which could have negative downstream consequences for lifelong socioeconomic, health, and well-being outcomes.
The end of free college in England: Implications for enrolments, equity, and quality;Despite increasing financial pressures on higher education systems throughout the world, many governments remain resolutely opposed to the introduction of tuition fees, and some countries and states where tuition fees have been long established are now reconsidering free higher education. This paper examines the consequences of charging tuition fees on university enrolments, equity, and proxies for institutional quality. To do so, we study the English higher education system which has, in just two decades, moved from a free college system to one in which tuition fees are among the highest in the world. Our findings suggest that England's shift has resulted in increased funding per head and rising enrolments, with no apparent widening of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students. The role of fees is moderated by other key features of higher education finance which may differ across countries: in contrast to other systems with high tuition fees, the English system is distinct in that its income-contingent loan system ensures that no tuition fees are paid upfront, and provides students with comparatively generous assistance for living expenses. Still, the English experience provides an instructive case for other countries considering implementing or abolishing tuition fees.
Why Desegregation Matters: Educational Inequality and the Pursuit of Democracy;
In Real Life, You Have to Speak Up: Civic Implications of No-Excuses Classroom Management Practices;Conceptualizing educational inequality as equivalent to the achievement gap has fueled the expansion of no-excuses charters, which purport to raise test scores and thereby equalize opportunities for low-income students of color. In contrast, I argue that the individual provision of opportunity is inadequate to address the structural inequalities that create differential achievement, and thus that no-excuses schools cannot be assessed using test scores alone. This ethnographic study examines how no-excuses classroom management shapes students' development as citizens. My findings suggest that no-excuses classroom management is not a supportive structure that enables academic achievement, but a restrictive and often unfair system that reinforces compliance to institutional authority. I contend that the consequences of this system are more likely to perpetuate than to ameliorate inequality.
THE ROLE OF AGE AND GENDER IN EDUCATIONAL EXPANSION: THE SOUTH ASIAN EXPERIENCE IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT;I calculate education Gini coefficients and decompose the overall degree of educational inequality into age, sex, and within-group components for 171 countries from 1970 to 2010. Doing so enables me to analyze the distributional outcomes of educational expansion. I use South Asia as a case study, as the education distribution in the region is among the most unequal in the world. Generally, educational inequality is decreasing over the observed sample period around the globe. Yet, as improvements are initiated by enhancing the educational opportunities of the young, the gap between cohorts widens in transition phases but vanishes thereafter. Gaps between the sexes are reduced substantially, but widen if either males or females are the first to enter higher education levels. Also, gaps within population subgroups follow a similar trajectory. Instead of a Kuznets-curve relation, I thus find evidence for educational inequality to evolve in waves as education expands.
Does the use of migrant languages in German primary schools transform language orders? Findings from ethnographic classroom investigations;Migration-related multilingualism is a core issue of academic discussion regarding educational inequality in German schools. While existing studies have analysed the discrimination against children's languages from linguistic minorities in school, this paper focuses on social practices in a primary school that seeks to recognise and value multilingualism. The aim of this article is to investigate the extent to which the inclusion of migration-related multilingualism can transform language orders in school and classroom. For this purpose, we examined linguistic practices on the micro-level of the classroom based on lesson protocols. The observed practices indicate that the inclusion of the children's languages is meant both as a means of valuing and acknowledging the children's multilingualism and as part of comprehensive language teaching and learning. The question as to the scope of individual schools for overcoming monolingual ideologies within the structural context of the national educational system and dominant societal discourses remains, however.
Parental collaboration in relation to children's school lives - advanced regulation or an opportunity for solidarity?;Parental collaboration is both promoted for enhancing children's performance and criticized for reproducing educational inequality. The issue of parental collaboration, thus, presents an opportunity to discuss theoretical differences in current debates about education, notably the educational consequences of social background and governmentality. The article emphasizes the conflictual nature of children's school lives and analyzes the social interplay between the involved subjects, who are connected through their engagement in common matters and concerns. Our analysis challenges approaches inspired by Bourdieu that analyze the social reproduction of inequality in terms of discrepancies between parental style and the culture of the school. It also raises questions about the Foucauldian perspective which regards policies and practices of parental collaboration as means to govern parents. Through a discussion of these analyses, the article shows how different ways of conceptualizing parental collaboration offer different opportunities for organizing collaboration and dealing with the historical problems of the school.
The Temporal Dimension of Coexistence: Tensions between School Times and Youth Rhythms;In this paper we explore the processes of school coexistence that took place in the last decade in Argentina, particularly in three urban centers (City of Buenos Aires, localities of the Province of Buenos Aires and Comodoro Rivadavia in Chubut). The work allows to account for the tensions between the steps foreseen by public policies and school rhythms, the use of school time as an adjustable aspect, the differences between the time of the actions and that of the sanctions and the role of institutional spaces. The field work was carried out in nine establishments where a survey was applied, interviews were conducted with students and teachers and we used institutional materials such as the Institutional Agreements of Coexistence and the sanction certificates. The results suggest that the policies of school coexistence, while involving proposals that encourage other ways of regulating conflicts, preserve traditional ways of thinking about discipline, aimed at regulating the control of schedules and youth bodies.
Pathways to Inequality: Between-District Segregation and Racial Disparities in School District Expenditures;Recent causal evidence connects levels of per pupil spending and short- and long-term student outcomes. This evidence further suggests that specific types of spending may mediate the relationship between expenditures and student outcomes. Yet race remains related to funding disparities and schooling experiences in ways that raise concerns about the role of school finance in perpetuating racial opportunity gaps. We explore this potential source of educational inequality by asking how racial segregation and racial socioeconomic disparities are related to racial disparities in school district spending over time. We use 15 years of data from the School Funding Fairness Data System on school district expenditures and demographics to explore patterns of racial/ethnic segregation and racial/ethnic disparities across six categories of per pupil expenditures. We find that changes in racial/ethnic segregation within a state from 1999 through 2013 are associated with racial/ethnic disparities in spending, even after accounting for disparities in poverty.
Education inequality in Mongolia: Measurement and causes;Using data from the LSMS 2002 and HSES 2012 in Mongolia, we have estimated the educational Gini coefficients by years of schooling for adults and by school attendance rate for children. The Gini coefficient measured by using years of schooling for the population aged 19 and above decreased from 0.274 in 2002 to 0.178 in 2012. For adults of both genders, educational inequality has declined while the Gini coefficients are consistently higher in rural areas than in urban areas in both periods. The Gini coefficient for children aged 2-18 years and currently attending school has also declined. Between 2002 and 2012, the educational Gini coefficient for preschool decreased from 0.307 to 0.233 and for primary from 0.422 to 0.388. For secondary education, the Gini coefficient decreased from 0.388 in 2002 to 0.201 in 2012. For high school level, the coefficient decreased also from 0.299 in 2002 to 0.254 in 2012. The distribution in higher education remains at the similar level of 0.491. For all levels of education, except for higher education, the distribution is getting closer to the perfect equality line on the education Lorenz curve. Finally, we have shown that child's age, gender, mother's and father's education, household size and income, and urban location are statistically significant determinants of children's school attendance and thus educational equality. The pooled estimates using probit model indicate that the reduction in inequality due to household income and location are major factors which led to lower Gini Coefficient in 2012.
The educational gradient in premature cardiovascular mortality: Examining mediation by risk factors in cohorts born in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s;"Aims Educational inequality in cardiovascular disease and in modifiable risk factors changes over time and between birth cohorts. We aimed to assess how cardiovascular disease risk factors mediate educational differences in premature cardiovascular disease mortality and how this varies over birth cohorts and sex. Methods We followed 360,008 40-45-year-olds born in the 1930s, 1940s or 1950s from Norwegian health examination surveys (1974-1997) for premature cardiovascular disease mortality. Cox proportional hazard and Aalen's additive survival analyses provided hazard ratios and rate differences of excess deaths in participants with basic versus tertiary education. Results Relative educational differences in premature cardiovascular disease mortality were stable, whereas absolute differences narrowed from the 1930s to the 1950s cohorts; rate differences per 100 000 person years declined from 170 (95% confidence interval 117, 224) to 49 (36, 61) in men and from 60 (34, 85) to 23 (16, 29) in women. Cardiovascular disease risk factors attenuated rate differences by 69% in both cohorts in men, and in women by 102% in 1930s and 61% in 1950s cohorts. Smoking had the single strongest influence on the educational differences for men in all three cohorts, and for women in the two most recent cohorts. Conclusion Smoking appeared to be the driving force behind educational differences in premature cardiovascular disease mortality in the 1930s to 1950s birth cohorts for men and in the two recent birth cohorts for women. This suggests that strategies for smoking prevention and cessation might have the strongest impact for reducing educational inequality in premature cardiovascular disease mortality."
Challenges and constraints of the education in Latin America. A comparative analysis;At the height of the Education 2030 agenda, and under the fourth objective of the post 2015 Sustainable Development Goals, an analysis and a current balance of the problems that affect the educational systems of the Latin American region are necessary. These tools would serve the countries as a starting point to establish specific action plans that will address the shortcomings detected with the ultimate goal of promoting the successful achievement of the objectives proposed in the Agenda. In order to do this, we will use the comparative method in education. Taking the countries that make up Latin America as comparison units, and beginning with, among others, variables such as school retardment, enrolment rate or illiteracy rate, we will compare whose results point to the inability of educational systems to mitigate or reverse social background inequalities.
Access to Effective Teachers and Economic and Racial Disparities in Opportunities to Learn;This paper provides detailed description of students' access to one critical educational resource, teachers that effectively promote learning. Using large-scale administrative data from North Carolina in grades 3-8 and value-added measures of effectiveness, I find disadvantages for poor, American Indian, African American, and Hispanic students, but disparities represent less than 2% of observed achievement gaps. Gaps are driven by differential risks of exposure to especially ineffective teachers, which occur between and within schools. The distribution of teacher-related learning opportunities therefore highlights White and higher SES students' advantaged access to important educational resources as well as apparent limits to those advantages.
A bridge or a ledge? The bidirectional relationship between vocational education and training and disability;Although prior research reveals varying levels of inequality in post-secondary attainment for individuals with disabilities, vocational education and training (VET) appears to be more accessible for this group in Canada. Measures of accessibility become more complex, however, when they consider a bidirectional relationship that emphasizes education as a critical juncture that is associated with the later likelihood of developing a disability. The following study deepens insight into VET attainment among people with disabilities by exploring how credential rates differ by disability severity, type, source, and timing. A series of multinomial logistic regression models that examine different operationalisations of disability status demonstrate that greater VET attainment rates for individuals with disabilities are, in part, due to the increased risk of a work-related injury or illness and/or the development of a disability after the completion of education. Nevertheless, compared to attainment at the university degree level, VET is more accessible across different types of disabilities and at higher severity levels. The implications arising from this study suggest that coarsened measures of disability status often obscure the bidirectional nature of educational inequality, from the increased risk of developing a disability at certain levels of education to greater barriers for specific conditions.
Facing social reality together: investigating a pre-service teacher preparation programme on inclusive education;Inclusive education has been put on the global agenda to appreciate diversity on a broader level and reduce educational inequality. In order to optimally prepare secondary pre-service teachers for inclusive education, a highly innovative cooperation of five different teacher training institutes in and around Antwerp (Belgium) developed a collective Inclusion Pathway embedded in the various teacher education curricula. Through an explorative qualitative research study based on content data and semi-structured interviews, we studied (1) the programme's perceived impact on participating pre-service teachers' competences (attitudes, knowledge and skills) with respect to inclusion, and (2) how the pre-service teachers experience the inclusion programme. The results indicate a positive impact of the programme on the participants' attitudes with respect to inclusion. Participants also mention that the theoretical frameworks provided, the classroom observations and the teacher conversations helped them to enlarge their knowledge base and feel more confident to change their teaching practice. However, the participants also made some critical remarks. The teacher training institutes converted these insights into several organisational improvements and content-related action points.
The Transmission of Multigenerational Educational Inequality;"This study explores the transmission of educational inequality across three generations in the United States. It addresses two common problems in analyses of multigenerational inequality: omitted mechanisms of indirect transmissions through grandparents' early influences on parents, and theoretically problematic tests of direct effects based on non-zero residual grandparent-child associations. The first problem leads to upwardly biased direct effect estimates; analyses that control for parents' attributes and experiences during their own childhood eliminate most grandparent-child educational associations. Conversely, the second problem can obscure direct effects. This study avoids inferring direct effects from residual grandparent-child associations by assessing the explanatory power of measured child attributes that constitute likely mechanisms of direct effects. It finds little evidence of direct effects overall, although there is some indication of direct effects on bachelor's degree attainment among those with the most-educated grandparents. The findings also speak to potential mechanisms of direct and indirect educational transmission."
A Disaggregated Analysis of Wealth Status and Educational Attainment in Nigeria Using the Multinomial Logit Approach;"For most studies that have been carried out, a country's level of income and aggregate wealth go a long way in shaping the overall welfare of citizens therein. This study seeks to investigate the relationship between wealth status and educational attainment, as a manifestation of income inequality, especially when the wealth status is disaggregated. With data obtained from the National Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2013 and the adoption of the multinomial logit model, this study captured exogenous variables such as wealth index, the core variable; household sex preference, a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if a household prefers a male child and 0 otherwise; and place, another control variable. This study finds that there is a very significant relationship between wealth status and educational attainment, especially for the individual categories of wealth index, hence, educational inequality hinders the quest to achieve higher educational levels for individuals from low wealth families. This study therefore recommends that the government should engender state-based subsidized education cost programs that will be targeted at poor households, as well as intensify efforts in solidifying the overall educational framework in the country, especially in the rural areas bereft of facilities."
University Tuition Fees and High School Students' Educational Intentions;This paper studies whether higher education tuition fees influence the intention to acquire a university degree among high school students and, if so, whether the effect on individuals from low-income households is particularly strong. We analyse the introduction and subsequent elimination of university tuition fees in Germany across states and over time in a difference-in-differences setting. Using data from the Youth Questionnaire of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we find a large negative effect of tuition fees on the intentions of 17-year-olds to acquire a higher educational degree, with a decrease of around 8 percentage points (10 per cent). Individuals from low-income households mainly drive the results. This study documents that the introduction of relatively low university tuition fees of euro1,000 per academic year can considerably lower young people's educational intentions.
Conditions and Consequences of Unequal Educational Opportunities in the Life Course: Results from the Cross-National Comparative eduLIFE Project;Using longitudinal data, this chapter studies the development of educational inequalities over the life course in 12-17 different industrialized societies. By comparing highly-standardized country case studies in specific phases of the educational career, it provides evidence of major communalities in modern societies. First, the cross-national findings show that educational inequalities are created and perpetuated in family settings, early in achild's life, long before children start school. Children from less privileged families are the ones who are least likely to attend high-quality institutions, and if they do, their gains are only moderate and generally too small to effectively counteract the family influence. When children are in school, the comparative analyses demonstrate that socioeconomically-advantaged families manage to secure the pole positions in education for their children, regardless of the organizational specificities of the school system across different countries. They always succeed in strategically exploiting various opportunities provided by different school systems. Finally, the cross-national comparisons of adult learning over the life course show astrong cumulative advantage: Adult learning tends to reproduce and reinforce the outcomes of initial formal education in the later adult life course. ZusammenfassungDieses Papier vergleicht fur eine gro ss ere Anzahl moderner Gesellschaften deskriptive Befunde zur Entstehung und zu den Konsequenzen ungleicher Bildungschancen im Lebenslauf. Die international vergleichende Analyse basiert auf einer Reihe hochstandardisierter (und damit vergleichbarer) landerspezifischer Fallstudien, in denen jeweils spezifische Bildungsphasen (Kleinkindalter, Schulalter, Erwachsenenalter) mit Langsschnittdaten untersucht wurden. Ziel des Beitrags ist es, gemeinsame Mechanismen des Bildungsverlaufs in modernen Dienstleistungsgesellschaften herauszuarbeiten. Die Ergebnisse des internationalen Vergleichs zeigen zunachst, dass die Bildungsungleichheiten (insbesondere die Kompetenzunterschiede) bereits im fruhen Kleinkindalter in den Familien entstehen, also lange bevor die Kinder uberhaupt beginnen, zur Schule zu gehen. Die Grundlagen der Bildungsungleichheiten werden in modernen Gesellschaften damit weiterhin im Kleinkindalter von einer Generation auf die nachste ubertragen. Kinder aus sozial privilegierten Familien gehen in den meisten modernen Gesellschaften danach auch haufiger in Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen mit hoherer Qualitat. Generell sind die Kompetenzzuwachse fur benachteiligte Kinder in den bestehenden Kinderbetreuungseinrichtungen aber zu moderat und zu klein, um die Kompetenzdifferenzen zwischen Kindern aus verschiedenen Herkunftsfamilien effektiv ausgleichen konnen. In der Schule zeigen die komparativen Analysen, dass sozio-okonomisch privilegierte Familien dafur sorgen, dass ihre Kinder immer wieder die aussichtsreicheren Pole-Positionen erhalten. Mit anderen Worten: unabhangig davon, wie das Bildungssystem in einem Land organisiert ist (als Gesamtschule, in Form interner Schul- oder Facherdifferenzierung oder als dreigliedriges Schulsystem), gelingt es privilegierten Familien in allen Schulsystemen immer wieder, die jeweiligen Chancen und Vorteile, die diese unterschiedlichen Systeme bieten, fur ihre Kinder zu nutzen. Damit sind institutionellen Reformen des Schulsystems zur Erreichung von mehr Bildungsgleichheit enge Grenzen gesetzt. Schlie ss lich zeigt der internationale Vergleich, dass das formale und non-formale Lernen von Erwachsenen im spateren Lebenslauf in modernen Gesellschaften einen starken kumulativen Charakter aufweist. Das Bildungsverhalten von Erwachsenen tendiert damit generell dazu, die Bildungsunterschiede der Erstausbildung im Lebenslauf noch weiter zu verstarken, anstatt auszugleichen.
Global inequality and policy selectivity in the periphery The case of Ukrainian reforms in higher education;"Despite the diversity of socio-political and economic contexts, educational transformations in post-socialist states have some common trends: orientation towards the 'West' and denial of the socialist past; marketisation of higher education through the introduction and extension of paid services, as well as promotion of competition for public funding; economisation of higher education via adjustment to the amount of economic resources and labour market demand. In this article, I analyse how those trends have been reflected in political practices and public discourses in the case of Ukrainian higher education reforms since the 'Euromaidan' events in 2013-2014. The research shows that, in the Ukrainian case, concepts of orientation towards the 'West', marketisation and economisation of higher education are the key elements of local opinion makers' political rhetoric that play a crucial role in the process of legitimisation of neoliberal reforms in higher education."
The Global Increase in the Socioeconomic Achievement Gap, 1964 to 2015;The socioeconomic achievement gap-the disparity in academic achievement between students from high- and low-socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds-is well-known in the sociology of education. The SES achievement gap has been documented across a wide range of countries. Yet in most countries, we do not know whether the SES achievement gap has been changing over time. This study combines 30 international large-scale assessments over 50 years, representing 100 countries and about 5.8 million students. SES achievement gaps are computed between the 90th and 10th percentiles of three available measures of family SES: parents' education, parents' occupation, and the number of books in the home. Results indicate that, for each of the three SES variables examined, achievement gaps increased in a majority of sample countries. Yet there is substantial cross-national variation in the size of increases in SES achievement gaps. The largest increases are observed in countries with rapidly increasing school enrollments, implying that expanding access reveals educational inequality that was previously hidden outside the school system. However, gaps also increased in many countries with consistently high enrollments, suggesting that cognitive skills are an increasingly important dimension of educational stratification worldwide.
Modeling Educational Inequalities: Class, Academic Achievement, and Regional Differences in Turkey;As it has been realized that education is a key to a long-term economic growth and to reducing social and economic disadvantages, educational inequality and its reflections in the geography have become some of the major issues in many countries. Turkey is in many ways a good example to analyze the relations between class, education, and regional inequalities where education is strongly a class-related issue and there has also been a strong dimension of geography as far as the educational provision and performance are considered. The purpose of the article is to contribute to two debates on the relation of education and inequality in Turkey. One is a specific and practical way of understanding about the effect of socioeconomic backgrounds of the students on their educational achievement. The other is an understanding on causal relations based on socioeconomic variables and geographical variations and how these lead to or indeed are partly caused by regional inequalities in Turkey. Using the datasets of PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) database, the datasets of National University Entrance Examination and Census, the article finds that for Turkish students where (the region and the place of residence) and with whom (socioeconomic qualifications of parents) they live are the powerful indicators of academic achievement.
Social Exclusion and School Achievement: Children of Immigrants and Children of Natives in Three European Countries;Ethnic minorities in Europe show diverging patterns of educational success, but in most national contexts, migrants and children of immigrants have lower achievements in terms of grades than their majority peers. This study asks whether social exclusion in the classroom can contribute to explaining this pattern. While limited access to social resources is often assumed to be of significance for educational success, it has rarely been measured explicitly. In this study, social exclusion is measured accurately and on a large, cross-national scale, by using social network data from 731 classrooms in England, Germany, and Sweden (CILS4EU data). Results show that social exclusion is negatively associated with school grades, but this does not contribute much to understanding grade differences between children of immigrant and children of majority background.
Schools are segregated by educational outcomes in the digital space;"The Internet provides students with a unique opportunity to connect and maintain social ties with peers from other schools, irrespective of how far they are from each other. However, little is known about the real structure of such online relationships. In this paper, we investigate the structure of interschool friendship on a popular social networking site. We use data from 36, 951 students from 590 schools of a large European city. We find that the probability of a friendship tie between students from neighboring schools is high and that it decreases with the distance between schools following the power law. We also find that students are more likely to be connected if the educational outcomes of their schools are similar. We show that this fact is not a consequence of residential segregation. While high- and low-performing schools are evenly distributed across the city, this is not the case for the digital space, where schools turn out to be segregated by educational outcomes. There is no significant correlation between the educational outcomes of a school and its geographical neighbors; however, there is a strong correlation between the educational outcomes of a school and its digital neighbors. These results challenge the common assumption that the Internet is a borderless space, and may have important implications for the understanding of educational inequality in the digital age."
The perils of integration: exploring the experiences of African American and black Caribbean students in predominately white secondary schools;Racial minority students who attend predominately white schools in the United States and England face unique challenges in their learning environments that are connected to their status as non-white students. Scholars have documented the experiences of racial and ethnic minority students in mixed-raced schools in the United States and the UK for over four decades. However, the authors explore new research territory by employing critical race analysis to further articulate the similar experiences shared by African American and black Caribbean students' in mixed-race schools. Using data two different studies, one in the United States and one in England, the authors highlight the resemblances between the experiences of African American and black Caribbean students in predominantly white suburban and rural secondary schools. To increase racial equity in education, we must accurately understand the structural and societal barriers that racial minority students face as they continue to access education resources and quality schools.
The association between education and risk of major cardiovascular events among prostate cancer patients: a study from the Diet, Cancer and Health study;Background: High socioeconomic position is associated with better prognosis in prostate cancer patients but it is unknown if part of this association may be explained by socioeconomic differences in severe late effects. We investigated the association between education as an indicator for socioeconomic position and cardiovascular events after prostate cancer and if such associations were mediated by differences in lifestyle, cardiovascular risk factors and prostate cancer treatment.Material and methods: We identified 1980 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1993 to 2014 among participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study. Individual level information on education, lifestyle, cardiovascular risk factors and prostate cancer clinical information were obtained from questionnaires, registries and medical records. The Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the risk of incident acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and heart failure during up to 18 years of follow-up for men with short (<9 years) or medium (9-12 years) compared with long education (>12 years).Results: Compared to men with long education, we found an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction in men with medium and short education (HR 3.14, 95% CI 1.53-6.47 and HR 2.14, 95% CI 0.82-5.58, respectively). Adjusting for stage, first-line treatment, lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors did not change the HRs substantially (adjusted HRs 3.04, 95% CI 1.47-6.31 and 2.07, 95% CI 0.78-5.53, respectively). There were no educational differences in risk for ischemic stroke or heart failure.Conclusions: The risk of acute myocardial infarction was increased in prostate cancer patients with short or medium education compared with long education. Although the educational inequality did not seem to be explained by differences in treatment, lifestyle or cardiovascular risk factors, monitoring of cardiovascular health and health promotion should involve all prostate cancer patients regardless of social position to ensure best prognosis for all.
Alleviating or exacerbating disadvantage: does school attended mediate the association between family background and educational attainment?;Opportunities for social mobility are generated by education systems designed to alleviate the effects of social origin by providing equality of opportunities and resources. The persistence of the strong association between socioeconomic status (SES) and child's educational achievement and attainment suggests that social origin continues to play an integral role in the educational outcomes of successive generations of Australians. Sociologists draw on a range of theoretical perspectives to explain this association including Bourdieu's cultural and social capital theories. Using data collected by the Longitudinal Survey of Australian Youth 2009 (LSAY09) project, I examine the associations between student SES, school SES and two outcome variables: Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) score and university enrolment. The results indicate that low SES students attending high SES schools perform better on PISA tests than low SES students attending low SES schools. After controlling for PISA score, low SES students were less likely than their high SES peers to enrol at university. Furthermore, students attending low SES schools were less likely than their peers attending high SES schools to enrol at university, net of their individual SES and their PISA scores.
Full-day Schooling and Educational Inequality in Vietnam;Full-day schooling was introduced in Vietnam to deal with the lack of instructional time in primary education compared to international standards. Yet full-day schooling could impact educational inequality by filling the gap in instructional time between children from different family backgrounds, given that well-off families tend to offset the lack of instructional time with private tutoring. This paper draws on data from the 2011-2012 Young Lives School Survey to investigate whether the massive rollout of full-day schooling in recent years could improve equality of opportunity in Vietnam. First, it examines the variation in instructional time and school resources between pupils with and without full-day schooling from different social backgrounds. It then investigates the learning progress associated with full-day schooling across social backgrounds. The paper suggests that full-day schooling has not narrowed the inequality of opportunity in learning achievement at this stage of its implementation.
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY TRENDS IN MORTALITY DUE TO PNEUMONIA IN COLOMBIA, 1998-2015;
Does the Development of Information and Communication Technology and Transportation Infrastructure Affect China's Educational Inequality?;Educational inequality is an important factor in the development of human capital, and limits the output of regional economic activities. The unequal distribution of educational resources has become a hot topic noticed by the public, and has restricted sustainable economic growth. This paper provides a better understanding of educational inequality, and explores the impacts of information and communication technology (ICT) and transportation infrastructure on the distribution of educational resources. The panel data models are constructed to discuss the relationship among ICT, transportation infrastructure, and educational inequality, using the data of 31 provinces in China from 2006 to 2016. The empirical results show that there is a positive relationship between ICT and educational inequality, while transportation infrastructure can restrain the unequal distribution of educational resources. Moreover, there is a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between transportation infrastructure and educational inequality. Since China's education reform in 2010, the relationship among ICT, transportation infrastructure, and educational inequality has been significantly changed, as well as the influence mechanism of ICT. In addition, transportation infrastructure in China western regions can effectively alleviate the problem of educational inequality, and its impact will increase with the growth of transportation investments. It is necessary to consider the rational allocation of educational resources, and this is essential to relieve the problem of educational inequality. Therefore, our results demonstrate the key roles of information technology and transportation network in the field of education, and provide some new ideas for the solution of educational inequality.
Mapping schools' NAPLAN results: a spatial inequality of school outcomes in Australia;This article identifies spatial dimensions of educational outcomes using maps of the 2016 Grade 5 reading results for Australia's National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy for all Australian schools. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to overlay schools' results onto suburbs' advantage or disadvantage to visualise spatial patterns. We then examined the extent to which school results cluster in socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged suburbs and considered the consistency of spatial patterns for results across major cities. That work illustrates both how GIS can foreground educational inequality and how the spatial is more than corollary for student socio-economic status. Results show substantial differences between urban and remote areas and towns of different size. Maps of cities visualise spatial clustering patterns of school results, with most schools in advantaged suburbs having high results and almost no schools in disadvantaged suburbs having high results. Educational outcomes strongly align to local socio-demographic characteristics, and parallel host communities' levels of advantage or disadvantage. Differences between public and private schools are less significant than within-sector differences for schools in advantaged or disadvantaged locales. Patterns in all cities are consistent-schools in advantaged suburbs predominantly have high results, whereas non-government schools generally perform better than government schools in disadvantaged suburbs. Most concerning is the persistent and increasing trajectory of results in advantaged, and more so in disadvantaged suburbs, of all cities since the first National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy in 2008. Ameliorating spatial inequality between primary schools is one of the greatest challenges for Australians.
Selectivity of Migration and the Educational Disadvantages of Second-Generation Immigrants in Ten Host Societies;Selectivity of migration varies significantly between ethnic/origin country groups, and between the destination countries which these groups have migrated to. Yet, little comparative research has measured empirically how selective different migrant groups are in multiple destination countries, nor has research studied whether the selectivity of migration is related to the magnitude of ethnic inequalities among the children of migrants in Western societies. We present an empirical measure of educational selectivity of migrants from many different origin countries having migrated to ten different destination countries. We examine whether selective migration of a particular ethnic group in a particular destination country is related to the gap between their children's and native children's educational outcomes. We find that the disadvantage in educational outcomes between the second generation and their peers from majority populations is smaller for ethnic groups that are more positively selected in terms of educational attainment. We also find some evidence that the effect of selective migration is moderated by the integration policies or tracking arrangements in the educational system in the destination country.
Food portion at ages 8-11 and obesogeny: The amount of food given to children varies with the mother's education and the child's appetite arousal;"During childhood, the amount of food consumed, associated with adiposity and overweight risk, depends mainly on the amount of food that is served, especially by parents. This study focuses on the food amount served by parents (Portion), with two objectives: 1/to confirm (or not) its link with the food amount eaten (Intake) by their child; 2/to identify some of its correlates, i.e., maternal education, and child's appetite arousal. Five hundred and three French children aged between 8 and 11 years and one of their parents completed different self-administrated questionnaires online. Results indicated that Portion and Intake were highly correlated, and that mothers with lower levels of education gave larger portions to their child, especially if he/she had a high appetite arousal. Moreover, these mothers, compared to others, were more concerned by taste preferences and less by health with regard to their child's diet. Such differences in taste and health considerations may contribute to underlie the educational inequality in food portion size."
Crossing under the highway: youth-centered research as resistance to structural inequality;This article tells the story of two exploratory youth-centered participatory action research (PAR) projects to consider how youth-centered research can resist inequality. In this paper, I focus on the findings and process of two PAR projects that took place within one geographically isolated neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The studies focused on neighborhood experiences of educational inequality and everyday experiences of crossing the street in and out of the neighborhood. The process and findings of the research identified tensions and connections around the lived experiences of inequality. Ultimately we found the process of conducting research collaboratively and across generation was itself a form of resistance.
The in-between spaces of capital and wealth: creating and sustaining academic success for English learners in middle school;Yosso's community cultural wealth (CCW) shifted conversations about educational inequality from deficit perspectives to those that acknowledge the assets People of Color bring to school. CCW represents the accumulation of students' unique forms of capital, many of which have historically gone unrecognized by schools. This study applies CCW to the schooling experiences of bilingual middle school students who achieved English proficiency and enrolled in advanced coursework. Observations and in-depth interviews with students and their teachers revealed that merely possessing and identifying forms of capital is not enough to guarantee academic success. While students in this study benefitted from some forms of capital, they also possessed resources that lie dormant. Activating capital to transform into wealth required both student agency and support from outsiders. Implications from this study call for educators and researchers to work in spaces between capital and wealth.
Impact of Educational Inequality on the Incidence of Post-stroke Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment - Application of the Previous Study on Stratified Education-adjusted MoCA Assessment;
Social class and educational decision-making in a choice-driven education system: a mixed-methods study;Social class differences in educational decision-making form an important explanation for persisting educational inequalities, particularly in choice-driven systems with early tracking. Nevertheless, little is known about the process preceding these choices, especially when school and track choice are interrelated. Building on school choice literature, this study aims to explore how parents from different social backgrounds shape their decision-making process at the transition from primary to secondary education in Flanders (Belgium). To this end, we adopt an explanatory mixed-methods design. Quantitative findings from a parent survey conducted in 36 primary schools were complemented with 32 in-depth interviews with parents. Our findings show two parental profiles regarding educational decision-making, which can be traced back to differences in social and cultural capital. Although effective navigation of the complex field of educational decision-making proved to be strongly class related, parents' educational and immigrant biographies led to specific approaches, transcending the middle class versus working class binary.
Problems and perspectives of state regulation of system of education in the context of provision of Russia's national security;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the current problems and the main perspectives of the development of state regulation of the Russian system of higher education in the context of the provision of Russia's national security. Design/methodology/approach The research of formation of the system of national security in Russia and the problems of the development of education is based on the methods of Russian and foreign Institutionalists (D. North, S.G. Kirdina, R.M. Nureev, Y.V. Latov, etc.). The research is also based on the theory of inequality in the system of education (D.L. Konstantinovsky), the idea of cultural aspects of social inequality (Pierre Bourdieu) and the theory that connects the problem of the development of the educational system with the system of national security and social inequalities (A.V. Vereshchagina, S.I. Samygina, etc.). Findings The modern state and perspectives of state regulation of higher education in the modern Russian conditions are analyzed in this paper. A complex analysis of risks of the modern state of Russia's educational system is performed, and educational inequality as a risk to national security is studied in this paper. Perspectives of state regulation of higher education in view of the national model of socio-economic activities and principles of national security are viewed in this paper. The main directions of improving the educational system in the context of the provision of national security of the state are given in this paper. Research limitations/implications - The results of the research could be used for correcting the main directions of Russia's socio- economic policy in the long term. The central trend of this policy is the reformation of the development of the sphere of education as a factor of the formation of the system of Russia's national security. Practical implications - The results of the research could be used for correcting the main directions of Russia's socio- economic policy in the long term. The central trend of this policy is the reformation of the development of the sphere of education as a factor of formation of the system of Russia's national security. Social implications - The ideas of the research could stimulate the reconsideration and harmonization of perspectives of the development of social policy of the state, which includes the interaction of the development of higher education and system of national security. Originality/value - Originality of this paper consists in setting the problem of the implementation of social senses of the development of state policy in the sphere of higher education into the discourse of theoretical and practical consideration of the problems of national security.
Is the Generation of fine Differences? Horizontal Distinction and Hierarchy in the gymnasium Field;In this paper we want to raise questions on the establishment of segregation and new processes of hierarchisation in the field of exclusive secondary education. The main foci are pupils of (non-)exclusive secondary schools ('Gymnasien') in two urban regions in Germany. With reference to differences and similarities between exclusive and non-exclusive secondary schools and their pupils, we develop two typologies: a typology on pupils' habitus and a typology about the matching between the school and the pupils. Against this backdrop we will discuss our key findings. Firstly, our empirical results show that exclusive secondary schools nurture pupils with a particular affinity for school and thus generate a very homogenous student body. Secondly, exclusive schools characterised by a harmonious fit between the pupils and the school as well as by processes that foster within-school coherence while creating a distinction towards other exclusive schools. Thirdly, the interplay of selection, school choice and distinction as well as coherence in exclusive secondary schools creates a privileged status for already privileged pupils.
Social inequality at the end of secondary education and the progression to tertiary education. A multinational analysis of cases in southern Europe and Latin America;This article analyzes inequality in educational opportunity (LEO) in the probability of finishing secondary education and accessing tertiary education across birth cohorts of 22 countries, including two Southern European (Spain and Portugal) and three Latin American countries (Argentina, Chile and Mexico). Two of the most influential hypotheses of comparative multinational research are evaluated: Marc's selectivity hypothesis and Raftery and Hout's Maximally Maintained Inequality hypothesis. The results show that both hypotheses are not supported by empirical trends, particularly when measures of IEO are based on relative risks rather than odds ratios. Southern European and Latin American countries show the highest inequality levels, particularly in the conclusion of secondary education, and early industrialized countries experience a displacement of inequality from secondary to tertiary education. In addition, IEO is greatly reduced in the early stages of the educational expansion process. This suggests that it is necessary to revise some of the most influential hypotheses on educational stratification research in light of the experiences of countries with late and more heterogeneous experiences of industrialization.
'It's horrible. And the class is too silent' - A silent classroom environment can lead to a paralysing fear of being put on the spot, called-out, shown up, shamed or humiliated;With the relentless increase in the number of new kinds of schools in the English education system, the already fragmented secondary school system is fracturing still further. Since branching points, partitions and choice are all known to contribute to inequalities, the urgency to fully understand the roots and effects of marginalisation has never been greater. This ethnographic study sheds light on disengagement by giving a voice to marginalized students. The student participants are pupils who have spent some time being removed from the mainstream classroom setting, to work in a withdrawal unit, most commonly following a period of sustained low-level disruption. The research is primarily drawn from semi-structured interviews, with additional participant observation, as well as some small group or one-to-one teaching by the researcher within this unit. The data gathered was analysed through a process of grounded theory. Analysis of emergent categories indicates that students experience many barriers within the secondary education system. One such barrier is the silent classroom environment. Through poignant first-hand telling of their experiences, these marginalized students exemplify enlightening instances of this silent environment, as either constraining and tedious or as anxiety inducing, either of which may feed into academic underachievement. The current trend for a strict classroom prioritises discipline, spawning many a silent classroom in the process. Reforms promoting a more nuanced approach to behaviour management, the greater application of a weakly-framed approach to learning and teaching, or the more comprehensive embracing of critical pedagogies are needed to mitigate the barrier to inclusion which the current silent classroom presents.
Social capital and educational inequality of migrant children in contemporary China: A multilevel mediation analysis;With the unprecedented migration in China, migrant children' wellbeing becomes a great social problem. There is an emerging literature on the educational inequality of migrant children, but most studies focus on either the institutional barriers or the individual factors. This article argues for a holistic perspective, studying the mechanisms of hukou system and social capital through which children's migration affects their education. Based on the China Education Panel Survey and the random-intercept mediation model, the article shows that the educational outcome of migrant children is significantly worse than urban peers. Most of the negative effects are attributed to the hukou related school quality and others are mediated by social capital within the family and the community. Surprisingly, the results show that the child father interactions have a negative effect on children's education. The practical and policy implications for migrant children's wellbeing are discussed.
The effect of parents' education appreciation on intergenerational inequality;The core question for this study is - how can we explain gaps in educational attainment of families with the same initial socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds? This study draws from human capital theory to examine the likely effect of parental attitudes towards the educational attainment of their children, and the implications for intergenerational educational inequality. I utilized longitudinal historical narratives to explore two families in Nigeria with identical socioeconomic backgrounds. The findings suggest that 1.) The perceptions of, and attitudes towards education by the first parents of each family have a lingering impact on the educational attainment of their first, second and third generation. 2.) Children of parents with high value and appreciation to education recorded higher educational achievement and socioeconomic mobility than did those with a lower appreciation of education. This study concludes that in addition to other socioeconomic factors, parents' perception and value of education is fundamental to children's educational attainment, which also determines socioeconomic mobility. This study contributes to our understanding of intergenerational transmission and socioeconomic mobility. It also has implications for policy framing, as well as substantial scope for methodological improvement.
Do Well-off Families Compensate for Low Cognitive Ability? Evidence on Social Inequality in Early Schooling from a Twin Study;This article bridges the literature on educational inequality between and within families to test whether high-socioeconomic status (SES) families compensate for low cognitive ability in the transition to secondary education in Germany. The German educational system of early-ability tracking (at age 10) represents a stringent setting for the compensatory hypothesis. Overall, previous literature offers inconclusive findings. Previous research between families suffers from the misspecification of parental SES and ability, while most within-family research did not stratify the analysis by SES or the ability distribution. To address these issues, I draw from the TwinLife study to implement a twin fixed-effects design that minimizes unobserved confounding. I report two main findings. First, highly educated families do not compensate for twins' differences in cognitive ability at the bottom of the ability distribution. In the German system of early-ability tracking, advantaged families may have more difficulties to compensate than in countries where educational transitions are less dependent on ability. Second, holding parents' and children's cognitive ability constant, pupils from highly educated families are 27% more likely to attend the academic track. This result implies wastage of academic potential for disadvantaged families, challenging the role of cognitive ability as the leading criterion of merit for liberal theories of equal opportunity. These findings point to the importance of other factors that vary between families with different resources and explain educational success, such as noncognitive abilities, risk aversion to downward mobility, and teachers' bias.
Getting Ahead in Singapore: How Neighborhoods, Gender, and Ethnicity Affect Enrollment into Elite Schools;Is education the social leveler it promises to be? Nowhere is this question better addressed than in Singapore, the emblematic modern-day meritocracy where education has long been hailed as the most important ticket to elite status. In particular, what accounts for gender and ethnic gaps in enrollment into Singapore's elite junior colleges-the key sorters in the country's education system? We consider how the wealth of neighborhoods has combined with the elite status of schools to affect the social mobility of gender and ethnic groups. Analyzing data from 40 years of junior college yearbooks (1971-2010), we find persistent differences in educational opportunity. Women and Malays have historically experienced inequality in Singapore, and their student routes to becoming elites differ markedly. For female students, attending an elite junior college in a wealthy neighborhood is associated with wealthy neighborhoods that have a disproportionate number of elite girls' secondary schools that feed into the junior colleges. By contrast, for Malays, not attending an elite junior college in a wealthy neighborhood has more to do with wealthy neighborhoods underrepresenting Malays in demographic composition. Elite families thus now include better educated women as well as men, yet Malays still rarely become better educated elites. These results underscore the need to carefully map the complex associations and mechanisms between gender and ethnic categorizations, the status of schools, and the characteristics of neighborhoods.
An emotional journey: pursuing a bachelor's degree for rural students in four elite universities in Shanghai, PRC;In the People's Republic of China (PRC), educational expansion together with the promotion of market competition is taken as a measure of addressing a structural rural-urban divide in educational inequality. In following the emotional journeys of pursuing a bachelor's degree for 32 rural students in four elite universities in Shanghai, this paper explores an emotive impact of such a measure on rural students. Despite feeling pride at getting into university, many respondents were ashamed because of their perceived academic and social inadequacies vis-a-vis their urban classmates. The stigmatisation of the rural accentuated their feelings of shame and even made many respondents not feel confident about seeking a career in a city. An individualistic approach framed in a self-reliance discourse, even in a socialist society, to address structural educational inequality, is doomed to fail to confront an unequal opportunity structure, but offloads the cost of change, including the emotional cost, to individual students.
Cultural capital and the perception of feedback;This study draws on the concept of cultural capital to determine whether the cultural capital of students is related to their perceptions of classroom interactions, specifically teacher-student feedback practices. The analysis of new data in 'Feedback and Cultural Capital,' a Danish survey of feedback practices among 14-year-old and 15-year-old students (N = 1101), showed a positive and practically linear relationship between the cultural capital of the students and the amount of feedback they perceived in lower secondary mathematics classrooms. Drawing on Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction in education, I argue that this inequality stems from either or both of two mechanisms: differences in treatment by teachers and/or differences in the perceptions of students. I link both mechanisms to the cultural capital of the students. Furthermore, the results indicate that the relationship was stronger for boys than for girls. The implications of the findings for practice and policy are discussed.
Educational and Wealth Inequalities in Smokeless Tobacco Use: An Analysis of Rural-Urban Areas of Bangladesh and India;This study aims to investigate the educational and wealth inequalities in smokeless tobacco (SLT) use in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh and India. the 2 largest global SLT users. Using the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, both absolute and relative measures of inequality were estimated. The analysis reveals that the educational inequalities in SLT use were higher in urban areas of India and in rural areas of Bangladesh. whereas the wealth inequalities in SLT use were higher in urban areas of both the countries. Moreover, the logit model showed that the odds of SLT use declined with an increase in the level of education and wealth in rural and urban areas of India. However, no consistent pattern was observed in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh. The findings clearly delineate the subgroups which require immediate attention for SLT cessation interventions in these 2 countries.
Translanguaging, place and complexity;Prevalent approaches to classroom languaging and bilingual education interpret the practices of multilingual groups of people through a monolingual lens that obscures the fluid languaging and semiotic practices of contemporary communities who engage in dynamic semiotic and linguistic practices, rather than add' one language to another in the form of a double monolingualism. The paper examines the arguments for and constraints upon a translanguaging paradigm as a pedagogic strategy in classrooms and it considers how translanguaging practices have different consequences in Southern settings as contrasted with Euro- or North American contexts. The paper critically examines a spatiotemporal or scalar perspective on language-linked social inequalities and language-evaluation processes in school as an account for why the fluid language practices characteristic of everyday interaction and of certain kinds of learning-helpful interaction in classrooms do not transfer to a rationale for translanguaging becoming the norm in schooling. The research finds that innovative and emerging translanguaging practices happen under the covers' as it were, and make learning possible under constrained conditions. Researching classroom practices as a rhizometically assembled network of actors, materials, resources and practices, in their complexity and particularity, helps us to concretely identify possible points of attack to tackle persisting educational inequality.
Neoliberalism, imperialism and conservatism: tangled logics of educational inequality in the global South;Accounts of neoliberalism in education frequently evoke a universal trend, with insufficient attention to context, as well as routinely presenting the 'pre-neoliberal' as the ideal. This paper argues that studies of neoliberalism, concentrated in the global North, frequently ignore the distinctive forms and histories of neoliberalism in the global South, as well as its connections to other logics of power, which are illustrated using examples of schooling in Brazil. The differing weight of neoliberal politics and policies across geopolitical boundaries suggests caution in casting neoliberalism as a unique institutional setting for contemporary educational inequalities or attributing all educational conservatism to neoliberalism. A conceptual contribution is provided by proposing a multi-scalar approach to educational inequalities, in which educational sites, events and practices are considered in terms of nexus.
Transnational migration and educational opportunities: A case study of migration from Brazil to Germany;Based on a case study, this article discusses connections between educational inequality in Brazil, transnational migration and educational upward mobility. It analyses a young woman's migration from a favela in Brazil to Germany with a focus on the educational aspirations that motivated it, that is, as a case of educational migration. It describes the social trajectories of this young woman and her family and interprets them in the context of recent socio-economic developments in Brazil, thus showing how educational inequality can drive migration. The significance of networks, as well as of migration and educational regimes that shape this trajectory, are taken into account. The analysis aims to show how migrants from disadvantaged social backgrounds actively take part in the transnationalization of education.
Education and expenditure inequality in Myanmar: An analysis with the 2006 and 2012 Household Income and Expenditure Survey in an urban and rural setting;Based on the Household Income and Expenditure Surveys in 2006 and 2012, this study analyses the roles of education in expenditure inequality in Myanmar using three inequality decomposition methods. Expenditure inequality was very high among ASEAN countries and much of the inequality was due to inequalities within urban and rural areas. Expansion of secondary education is important in urban areas, while primary education needs to be strengthened in rural areas to reduce expenditure disparity between the urban and rural sectors. Since expenditure inequalities between educational groups were small in both urban and rural areas, expenditure inequalities within educational groups need to be decreased to reduce overall expenditure inequality. The government needs to strengthen income-redistribution policies and social security programmes, promote the formal sector, and enforce the minimum wage regulation to reduce expenditure inequality. Since older age groups tend to have larger expenditure inequalities in urban areas, the government needs to strengthen social safety net programmes and raise pension coverage in the urban private sector. Since a very high expenditure inequality existed among younger households in the urban tertiary educational group, the government may need to introduce policies that could promote linkages between industry and academia to remove a mismatch between the qualifications of university and college graduates and the needs of employers.
Mitigating the urban-rural educational gap in developing countries through mobile technology-supported learning;"One form of educational inequality is the disparity that exists between urban and rural settings. Equal distribution of quality education is a challenge for developing countries due to the unavailability of resources. Various approaches to equal distribution are distance learning, telecast learning and e-learning; however, these approaches cannot achieve the desired objectives due to their limitations. This research aimed to investigate the interesting question of whether mobile technology can bring urban and rural settings closer together. A mobile application for learning Urdu grammar was designed to measure the learning gains of fourth-grade students at two different schools from urban and rural settings. A quantitative technique, the quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test method, was used to measure the effectiveness of the mobile application. The comparison of the students' performances at the urban and rural schools illustrated the role of mobile technology in mitigating the educational gap. The present study provides evidence that children from different social backgrounds may benefit equally from mobile technology."

The Social Stratification of Environmental and Genetic Influences on Education: New Evidence Using a Register-Based Twin Sample;The relative importance of genes and shared environmental influences on stratification outcomes has recently received much attention in the literature. We focus on education and the gene-environmental interplay. Specifically, we investigate whether-as proposed by the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis-genetic influences are more important in advantaged families. We argue that the social stratification of family environments affects children's chances to actualize their genetic potential. We hypothesize that advantaged families provide more child-specific inputs, which enhance genetic expression, whereas the rearing environments of children in disadvantaged families are less adapted to children's individual abilities, leading to a suppression of genetic potential. We test this relationship in Germany, which represents an interesting case due to its highly selective schooling system characterized by early tracking and the broad coverage of part-time schools. We use novel data from the TwinLife panel, a population-register-based sample of twins and their families. Results of ACE-variance decompositions support the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis: Shared environmental influences on education matter only in disadvantaged families, whereas genetic influences are more important in advantaged families. Our findings support the growing literature on the importance of the gene-environmental interplay and emphasize the role of the family environment as a trigger of differential genetic expression.
Educational inequalities in mortality associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders in Sweden;BackgroundMusculoskeletal (MSK) disorders are less likely to be reported as an underlying cause of death (UCD) and since cause of death studies are generally limited to the UCD, little is known about socioeconomic inequalities in MSK disorders as cause of death in the general population. Using multiple-cause-of-death data, we aimed to quantify and compare educational inequalities in musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders- with non-MSK disorders-related mortality.MethodsAll residents aged 30-99years in the Skane region, Sweden, during 1998-2013 (n=999,148) were followed until their 100th birthday, death, relocation outside Skane, or end of 2014. We identified any mention of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other MSK disorders on death certificates using multiple-cause-of-death data. We retrieved and linked individual-level data from Statistics Sweden on highest level of education. We used Cox regression and additive hazards models with age as time-scale adjusted for sex, marital status, and country of birth to calculate slope and relative indices of inequality (SII/RII).ResultsDuring a mean follow-up of 12.2years, there were 1407 (0.8% of all deaths) and 3725 (2.1% of all deaths) death certificates with mention of RA and other MSK disorders, respectively, and 171,798 death certificates without any mention of a MSK disorder. Age-standardized RA mortality rate was 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0-2.8) times greater in people with 0-9years of education compared with those with >12years of education. Corresponding figure for other MSK disorders was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6). Both RIIs and SIIs revealed statistically significant educational inequalities in RA/other MSK disorders mortality favouring high-educated people. The RIIs of MSK disorders-related deaths were generally greater than non-MSK disorders-related deaths.ConclusionWe found substantial educational inequality in mortality from MSK disorders. Further research is needed to investigate underlying pathways driving these inequalities.
The relevance of parental support at home for educational success at the end of elementary school in Germany;Relying on expectancy-value theory, the study aims to test hypotheses regarding parental participation in homework support and additional exercises by conducting logistic regression analyses. The emphasis is on the fourth grade of primary school. The study is part of the German BiKS project. The findings show that the majority of the pupils receives parental support when their school performance is poor. In addition, parental support is associated with parental locus of control, motives of status maintenance, financial burdens, and other siblings. Separate analyses of parental educational status indicated differences in parental participation depending on the educational level. The importance of parental participation has been investigated with propensity score matching. The findings indicate that pupils, who frequently receive support with their homework, do not differ in terms of educational success from those pupils who do not receive help with their homework. However, if parents frequently practice additional exercises with their children, disadvantages in terms of lower educational success become evident.
Educational Expansion and Schooling Inequality: Testing Educational Kuznets Curve for India;The paper aims to analyses the relationship between educational expansion and schooling inequality in India across states and over the age cohort. The focus of the paper is to verify the inverted-U shaped relationship between the mean and dispersion of schooling. The evidence of an inverted-U shaped relationship between the mean and dispersion of schooling is found when dispersion is measured in terms of standard deviation which indicates that as the average level of schooling increases, educational inequality first increases, and, after reaching a peak, starts declining in latter phases of educational expansion. The turning point occurs when average year of schooling is about 7years. The same inverted-U shaped relation is not observed when inequality in schooling is measured in terms of Gini-coefficient.
Does Education Lead to Pacification? A Systematic Review of Statistical Studies on Education and Political Violence;Does more education lead to less political violence, and may education thus be a tool for peace? This article provides the first systematic review of the existing quantitative literature on education and political violence. Looking at arguments pertaining to levels, expansion, inequality, and content of education, we identify 42 quantitative studies from the time period 1996 to 2016 that test the relationship between various measures of education and political violence. An emerging scholarly consensus seems to be that education has a general pacifying effect. However, this general conclusion is challenged by recent evidence showing above-average levels of education among terrorists and genocide perpetrators. This, as well as other findings, underscore that the relationship between education and political violence is complex and multidimensional, depending on type of political violence, mediating factors, and level of analysis. We conclude with policy implications from our findings and discuss directions for future analysis.
Postsecondary Education, Neighborhood Disadvantage, and Crime: An Examination of Life Course Relative Deprivation;The growing importance of a college degree for economic stability, coupled with increasing educational inequality in the United States, suggest potential criminogenic implications for downward educational mobility. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), this article examines the associations between intergenerational educational mobility, neighborhood disadvantage in adulthood, and crime. Drawing on the few extant studies of educational mobility and crime, as well as social comparison theory, it tests whether the consequences of downward educational mobility are moderated by neighborhood contexts. Results suggest that downward mobility is associated with increases in crime, and most strongly in more advantaged neighborhoods. The implications of these findings for future research on social mobility, education, and crime are discussed.
Educational inequalities between children of marriage migrants and those of local-born parents - quantile regression results from Taiwan;This article studies educational inequalities between children of marriage migrants and those of local-born parents using student test scores from Taiwan. We first find an average raw score gap of 9.5% for children of foreign parents. We then employ quantile regression methodology and find that, after introducing our extensive list of covariates, score gaps vanish for children with a mother from mainland China in all quantiles and for children with a Southeast Asian mother in the highest quantiles. In contrast, we identify large residual score gaps for children with a parent from a culturally more distant country in all quantiles. Different from previous studies which found the largest impact for language usage and parent education, we find that the physical home environment has the highest explanatory power in our analysis.
Inequality of Educational Opportunity in East and West Germany: Convergence or Continued Differences?;Diversity in education systems, and broader political and economic conditions, are commonly credited with international variation in inequality of educational opportunity (IEO). Comparing East and West Germany before reunification allows us to investigate whether vastly different political, economic, and educational systems led to differences in IEO. Postreunification, East Germany adopted the West's systems and experienced an economic recession. IEO had been smaller in East Germany than in West Germany but was on an upward trajectory before reunification. After 1990, IEO in East Germany converged to the West German level as a result of decreased IEO in the west and increasing levels in the east. Postreunification convergence suggests that differences in political context and education policy are crucial for IEO.
Socioeconomic Inequality and Educational Outcomes: An Introduction;International large-scale assessments may be used to understand differences in average student performance across countries over time. Differences in achievement are associated with students' background characteristics and, while the most salient background variables may differ across education systems, a substantial amount of the variance in student achievement is normally explained by family socioeconomic status (SES). Family SES is thus considered an important factor in education research, but there are still challenges regarding how to best measure SES operationally. In addition to measuring student achievement, the IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) has been collecting background information from students, their teachers, and principals at four-year intervals since 1995. This study uses data from the IEA's TIMSS grade eight mathematics and science assessments to examine changes in the achievement gaps between high- and low-SES students between 1995 and 2015 for 13 education systems, as operationalized by a modified version of the TIMSS home educational resources index. The performance of disadvantaged students may also be tracked over time. These measures explain a sizeable amount of variation in the TIMSS achievement scores and, in conjunction with data on the countries' education systems and other macroeconomic indicators, can provide country-specific analyses and an across-country synthesis.
Trends in Socioeconomic Achievement Gaps in the Macroeconomic Context: Discussion and Future Research;"Using the 20 years of comparable data collected by the IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), this study aimed to identify and describe possible relationships between trends in the inequality of educational opportunities related to the differing socioeconomic status (SES) of the students. Thirteen educational systems were assessed as having sufficiently comparable data for the purposes of this research and a modified version of the TIMSS home educational resources (HER) index was developed for the analyses. Country-level indicators, such as centralization of educational systems, gross domestic product per person, government expenditure on education, a country's Gini index, and the top 10% of earners' share of pre-tax national income, provided additional relevant information. The research revealed some tentative patterns that may be worthy of deeper investigation. In the second decade of TIMSS (2003-2015), larger reductions in the achievement gap between low- and high-SES students tended to accompany steeper increases in the overall TIMSS performance in the corresponding education systems. There were also some indications that this may be associated with the level of centralization of an educational system and trends in country-level spending on education; this needs to be confirmed by further research as only broad connections were made with such macro-level indicators. Future research could usefully analyze the measurement invariance of the modified SES index used in the study, or investigate the potential of reconstructing the established TIMSS HER index so it can be confidently applied to analyses across all TIMSS administrations."
Inequality-related Education Research - Children as Reproducers of Educational Inequality Introduction to the Focus;
Higher education graduates with migration background at the transition to doctoral studies;So far, it has mainly been investigated how successful migrants and their descendants are on low and middle educational stages. Against the background of an increased socio-structural relevance of ethnic disparities within higher education, we examine for the first time whether and based on which mechanisms graduates with migration background show different transition rates to doctoral programs. The analyses utilize survey data (KOAB) of 54 578 graduates of the classes of 2011 to 2014 from German higher education institutions. Lower academic achievement (primary effects of migration background), the scientific integration and the choice of major and type of higher education institution are scrutinized as explanatory factors. Controlling for educational background, graduates with a background from Turkey, from other recruiting states, from states of the former Soviet Union, and from Poland enrol less frequently into doctoral studies than graduates without migration background. Decomposition analyses that control for educational background reveal that this lower transition rate can be explained above all by lower academic achievement. Furthermore, a lower scientific integration and differences in choice of major and type of institution contribute to the lower transition rates of specific migration groups. The results are discussed with reference to sociology of education.
School Segregation in France: The Role of Public Policies and Stakeholder Strategies;
Education Reform in Brazil: Multicultural Reflections;The present chapter aims to discuss one of the most recent documents of education reform in Brazil, namely one that affects primary school curriculum, with implications for teacher education institutions-the Base Nacional Comum Curricular-Brazilian National Curricular Guidelines for Primary Education, approved in 2017 and homologated by the Presidency of Brazil. The aim of the chapter is not to delve into the curricular guidelines themselves, but rather to discuss the perceptions gleaned from the analysis made by the National Council of Education (Brazil, Conselho Nacional de Educacao, CNE, Parecer sobre a Base Nacional Comum Curricular, 2017). It is also to argue on reactions expressed by counselors that revealed their judgments. Lastly, it considers the opinions gathered in emails and manifestoes by the National Association of Post Graduate Studies (ANPEd), as well as in Brazilian newspapers about the subject. It argues that a multicultural approach should contribute to link the search for excellence to social inclusion and to the development of citizens that value diversity and have a clear stand against prejudices on the lines of race, gender, ethnicity, and other identity markers. It posits that educational reforms in Brazil should gears to challenge educational inequality and to promote the inclusion of marginalized groups. It also analyses the extent to which the state has been subject to disparate forces that impinge on the present curricular reform.
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AND ASPIRATIONS OF UPPER SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS: THE CULTURAL CAPITAL AND RELATIVE RISK AVERSION PERSPECTIVES;The aim of the article was to address the relevance of cultural capital and relative risk aversion theories for educational outcomes and aspirations of upper secondary school students in Croatia, and to examine whether these approaches are compatible in explaining educational inequalities. Linear and logistic regressions were used to analyze data from 2106 students in their last year of upper secondary school (16-18 years old). Both constructs, cultural capital and relative risk aversion, had positive effects on school performance, enrolment of gymnasium instead of vocational school and aspirations for higher education. The analyses indicated that cultural factors frequently associated with school performance should not be separated from more direct status concerns shaping educational decisions. Rather than seeing them as unrelated, these mechanisms may both be seen as constitutive of students' educational dispositions.
Tracking, School Mobility, and Educational Inequality;School tracking is defined as the placement of students into different school types, hierarchically structured by performance. In the majority of OECD countries, tracking takes place at the age of 15 or 16. In Russia, similarly, students are sorted into academic (high school) and non-academic (vocational training) tracks after Grade 9, at the age of 15. However, even before that split, Russian children are distributed among schools of differing types (regular schools, specialized schools, gymnasiums and lyceums), which some researchers refer to as pre-tracking [Kosyakova et al. 2016]. No empirical evidence as to how often students change school prior to formal tracking at age 15 has been available so far. Using the St. Petersburg administrative school database containing information on all school transitions made in the 2014/15 academic year, this article investigates school mobility among first- to eleventh-graders. In particular, it compares the frequency of changing school across different grades as well as the overall incidence of school transitions. Regression models were constructed for academic/non-academic track choice after Grade 9, which link the share of students transitioning to vocational training institutions with school characteristics. In regard of changing school prior to formal tracking, findings reveal rather low school mobility. Indeed, in spite of having vast school change opportunities in a school system of a Russian megalopolis, 65% students attend the same school from Grade 1 through Grade 9, and 85% stick to one school between Grades 5 and 9. This is consistent with Yulia Kosyakova and her co-authors' inferences on pre-tracking in the Russian secondary school. The implications for building individual educational trajectories and dealing with educational inequality are discussed.
Inequality of Opportunity in Educational Achievement in India: Implications of Earning distribution and Affirmative Action;The objective of this study is to provide a quantifiable measure of the distributional content of education and its implications on earnings distribution by gender across different groups of people by using survey data in India. We analyse educational disparities among the children with age up to 14 years by gender, and household specific characters with Indian data. The study observes that, in the rural economy, the girls have less access to full time education than boys. In the urban region, on the other hand, the access to full time education at primary level is more for girls than for boys. The estimated coverage is less in the rural areas than in urban areas. The HOI is more among the urban children than among the rural children. Parent's education has the highest contribution to inequality of opportunity to full time education at primary or upper primary level.
Socio-Economic Level and its Influence on the Acquisition of Translation Competence;"This longitudinal study (2006-2013), which falls within the field of empirical-experimental translation studies, was conducted in the Language School of the Autonomous University of Baja California, Mexico. The search for paradigms to explain the mechanisms by which students translate, and how to evaluate students' development as they become experts, led me to select the holistic model proposed by the PACTE research group (Process of Acquisition of Translation Competence and Evaluation; PACTE, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2011), which breaks translation competence down into five sub-competences and a psychophysiological component. My working hypothesis was that the higher parents' socio-economic level, the better their children's academic performance. The object of study was the fifth semester of the bachelor's degree in translation, and these variables were measured and analyzed with the aid of a pre-TOEFL exam and the Translog2000 software program. As part of this process, I isolated transfer sub-competence and linguistic sub-competence in L2, which were cross-tabulated with a socio-economic study that recorded monthly family income. The results showed that people with greater purchasing power have a more balanced development in their sub-competences (mainly in their transfer and linguistic sub-competence in L2) and a better holistic translation competence."
Immigration and Disability as Inequality Intersectional Axis in Education;The situations of social inequality, and hence those of educational inequality, are built on different cornerstones. In this work, we reflect on the inequality resulting from the intersectionality of two variables: disability and immigration. These variables have been widely studied separately. For this reason, the aim of this work is to do a literature review of the Spanish research about this subject, in which these variables are both considered. More concretely, in the education field.
A Review of the Literature on Socioeconomic Status and Educational Achievement;The foundations of socioeconomic inequities and the educational outcomes of efforts to reduce gaps in socioeconomic status are of great interest to researchers around the world, and narrowing the achievement gap is a common goal for most education systems. This review of the literature focuses on socioeconomic status (SES) and its related constructs, the association between SES and educational achievement, and differences among educational systems, together with changes over time. Commonly-used proxy variables for SES in education research are identified and evaluated, as are the relevant components collected in IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Although the literature always presents a positive association between family SES and student achievement, the magnitude of this relationship is contingent on varying social contexts and education systems. TIMSS data can be used to assess the magnitude of such relationships across countries and explore them over time. Finally, the literature review focuses on two systematic and fundamental macro-level features: the extent of homogeneity between schools, and the degree of centralization of education standards and norms in a society.
Methodology: Constructing a Socioeconomic Index for TIMSS Trend Analyses;To assess education system trends in the inequality of educational outcomes, a robust socioeconomic index for TIMSS trend analysis is needed. This chapter begins by outlining the TIMSS data and sample design, as well as changes in the sample design over time, with special emphasis on the aspects that are specifically related to family socioeconomic status and student achievement. To analyze trends over the entire 20 years of TIMSS data, the analysis was limited to education systems that participated in the first cycle in 1995, the most recent cycle in 2015, and at least one other administration in between. After assessing the completeness of the data, 13 educational systems were included in the study: Australia, Hong Kong, Hungary, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Singapore, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United States. Items used for constructing the SES index were the number of books at home, home possessions, and the highest level of education of either parent. Students in each educational system were grouped into high- and low-SES groups based on the SES distribution for a given year. Constructing a consistent measure of SES across all TIMSS cycles is an important contribution to research that uses TIMSS for trend analyses. In addition to analyzing the achievement gaps over time, examining trends in performance among low-SES students in each education system provides additional information on how education systems are addressing the issues facing disadvantaged students.
Socioeconomic Achievement Gaps: Trend Results for Education Systems;This study compared the SES achievement gaps of 13 education systems in both mathematics and science over time. Each education system was initially categorized as either a system with increasing SES achievement gaps or decreasing SES achievement gaps, based on 20-year trends in the IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). For example, achievement gaps between low- and high-SES students significantly widened over this time in Hungary, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lithuania, and Singapore, while in Norway, Slovenia, and the United States, student achievement gaps in either mathematics or science narrowed between 1995 and 2015. Education system specific graphs show trends in the achievement gaps between high- and low-SES students, as well as trends for low-SES students reaching the TIMSS intermediate benchmark over time. Monitoring intermediate changes between 1995 and 2003, and between 2003 and 2015, as well as in-depth analysis of relevant country-specific macroeconomic indicators for each education system, provides further context.
Teacher Effectiveness and Educational Equity;Inequalities in teacher quality may be examined using several different lenses. To better investigate the relationships between student equity and teacher quality and instructional metrics, educational inequality in student performance across countries and time was explored as (1) variation in student mathematics scores, and (2) differences in socioeconomic status using descriptive, regression, and fixed-effects techniques. Measures of teacher quality (as measured by experience, education, preparedness, time spent on teaching mathematics, and instructional alignment) appeared to have only a limited effect on aggregate or within-classroom variation in student outcomes. The results also suggest that teacher quality may be more equitable at grade four than at grade eight, as measured by differences between higher and lower socioeconomic status classrooms.
What Does the TIMSS Tell Us About Teacher Effectiveness?;The central aim of this report was to investigate what international comparative assessments could reveal about the role of teachers in influencing student outcomes. A series of analyses attempted to identify potential trends in teacher quality and instructional metrics over time and their relationship with student achievement, but found no strong evidence for consistent predictable relationships between commonly-employed indicators of teacher effectiveness and student outcomes (both within and across educational systems). Further, although inequality in student outcomes remains pervasive across education systems, teacher quality is less subject to inequality, and, indeed, many countries have seen a rise in formal preparation to teach mathematics over the twenty years of IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). While improving conventional measures of teacher quality may not have a significant impact on educational inequality, there is some evidence that increasing the average amount of time spent on teaching mathematics may reduce inequalities in student achievement. Researchers and policymakers should be extremely cautious about applying the associations identified in one education systems to a very different educational context. The results indicate that teachers with similar experience, credentials, and instructional strategies may regardless produce quite different results, indicating that parents, policymakers, community institutions, and cultural context likely play a powerful role in determining student outcomes.
IF YOU GO THERE... IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN The Historical Legacies of Racism, Law Enforcement and Educational Inequality in Covington, Kentucky;
The Organization of Children's Daily Lives as a Determinant of Academic Performance: How are Reading and Playing Videogames Related to Children's Success in Primary School?;In sociology of education, children's out-of-school practices are considered to be a key factor in explaining the persistent social inequality in school success. However, children's perspectives and how they spend their free time when no adults are involved is often overlooked in inequality research. In this study, Bourdieu's theory of cultural transmission is expanded from the perspective of Childhood Studies to conceptualize children as agents of sociocultural reproduction. The paper presents findings from the German EDUCARE study and focuses on two areas of children's daily lives: reading books and playing videogames, i.e. a school-related practice and a practice that is more or less unrelated to skills or content relevant to school success. The main research question is to what extent these practices mediate the correlation between parental cultural capital and school success. The analyses draw on questionnaire data of N = 1069 primary school children and their parents. The results show significant correlations between children's unsupervised practices and school success. However, there is only limited evidence of mediating effects of children's practices. The study highlights the necessity to include children's agency in research on educational inequality on a theoretical level as well as empirically.
Inequality in Primary School Children's Experiences and Practices. A Contribution to Reconstructive Inequality Research from the Perspective of Habitus;There are fundamental and open theoretical and methodological questions in education research in regard to how children actively participate in the (re-)production of educational inequality. This paper addresses these questions from the perspective of habitus. The main focus, empirically and theoretically, is on how children experience their socialization at primary school. Furthermore, I explore the role that the unequal habitual orientations that are shaped by family, school and peers play in the acquisition of the school environment. The goal is to describe how children's experiences at school are inscribed in their habitus and practices. One important finding refers to the experiences that children acquire in terms of recognition, participation and judgments in primary school and how these contribute to the (re) production of educational inequality.
Familial Educational Practice and Student Habitus. Extracurricular Reproduction Mechanisms of Educational Inequality in Primary School;
Inequality and Social Stratification in Postsocialist China;This article reviews research on inequality and social stratification in China since the mid-1990s. Going beyond the theoretical framework of the market transition debate, research in the field has been advanced by paying more attention to the roles of the institutions of Chinese state socialism, such as the household registration (hukou) and urban work unit (danwei) systems, and workers' self-selective mobility. Empirical studies have benefited from the systematic collection of well-designed and high-quality survey data and from the application of advanced statistical methods. Substantive analysis has been extended to new themes related to social class, gender, ethnicity, education, and housing wealth. This review concludes by seeking to identify the wider implications of empirical findings from China for comparative research on inequality and social stratification and by providing some suggestions for the future direction of the field.
Education in East Asian Societies: Postwar Expansion and the Evolution of Inequality;This article reviews research on the coevolution of educational expansion and educational inequality within China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan in the post-World War II period. These societies are often lauded for their spectacular economic growth, widespread commitment to investing in education, and intense competition for academic success. This review first considers organizational sorting and horizontal stratification within the educational system, followed by returns to education in the labor market and then the inequality of educational opportunity, with special attention to the nominal versus positional approaches to measuring education. This combination of regional focus and substantive diversity offers the leverage of an approximately matched comparison. The findings demonstrate that there are significant heterogeneities in the coevolution of educational expansion and inequality among these societies with strong cultural and political ties. The findings also suggest complex causal and contingent relationships among educational expansion, educational stratification, returns to education, and inequality of opportunity.
A HISTORICAL ISSUE OF GENDER. EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY AND LEARNING OF WOMEN IN SPAIN;The treatment of inequality has historically been shown as a topic of vital importance for Social Action, relying on education as an essential tool for the reintegration of the most needy, but always with a differentiated model in terms of gender, limiting women learning, which will result in different societal models, one for men and one for women. Despite new patterns of social intervention that would come with the Enlightenment, training will not be considered as a matter of law, and less for girls, but as a need for the general promotion of the State. We will have to wait until the last third of the 20th century to reach educational parity. However, today there is still much to improve, where there is still wage inequality and limitations in positions of responsibility, despite a continuous advance in the positioning of women in today's society. From this article we intend to reflect on the defense of real and effective equality of men and women, not only in the educational sphere, but in other areas at present, a field in which social work takes center stage.
ALTERNATING SCHOOL-WORK PATHWAYS IN ITALY Some Remarks on the Competence Society;Since the mid-nineties, the European Union and UNESCO have promoted a new form of didactics aimed at developing competences. These key competences, subsequently identified by the Council and the European Parliament, are considered as fundamental for Europe's response to globalisation. Their close link with a neoliberal perspective of the working world. as can also be deduced from the non-random choice of the term competence. is evident. In particular, the competence related to the sense of initiative and entrepreneurship has assumed a strategic role within the Lifelong Learning Programme and the Europe 2020 programme, fostering the spread of a new labour market model no longer based on the prevailing paid employment. Recent Italian legislation on educational institutions, and Law 107/2015 in particular, have acknowledged the European Union guidelines regarding promotion of the key competences, and more specifically of alternating school-work pathways. Although it is too early to make an overall evaluation of the effects these laws have produced, the actions promoted so far do not seem to overcome the existing inequality in Italy's educational and employment opportunities. Furthermore, the objective of promoting competences that can be directly used on the labour market, to the detriment of broader cultural preparation deemed useless for this purpose, risks impoverishing the education of the most disadvantaged, those people who have the fewest chances of acquiring knowledge and critical thinking outside the school context. The transformations taking place in the educational field appear to proclaim the advent of a Competence Society, the last metamorphosis of an epiphenomenon with its roots in the globalised capitalist system which is leaving social reproduction mechanisms unchanged.
Gender differences in adult numeracy skills: what is the role of education?;Previous research suggests that as societies empower women educationally, gender differences in numeracy skills will decline. Using direct measures of 56,142 adults' numeracy skills from the Programme for International Assessment for Adult Competencies (PIAAC), this article studies whether this claim is evidenced across 20 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Results show that in many countries, as education has equalised over generations, gender differences in adult numeracy skills have indeed declined. However, women's advances in education have not always been matched by a reduction in the gender difference in adult numeracy. Contrary to expectations, gender differences in fields of study in further and higher education cannot systematically explain gender differences in adult numeracy. This suggests that to achieve gender equality in numeracy skills, societies must do more than empower women educationally. More research is needed on the educational policies, contextual, and life course factors contributing to gender differences in adult numeracy in post-industrial societies.
Our Separate Struggles are Really One: Building Political Race Coalitions for Educational Justice;In this article, we explore political race theory as a framework for building coalitions between Black and Brown communities as part of a shared struggle for educational justice and community power amid neoliberal reform. Inspired by the Black and Brown alliances for economic justice of the 1960s and 1970s and informed by previous scholarship on the conceptualization of political race and the lived experience of being raced in America and its relationship to power, we draw from the experiential knowledge of African American and Mexican American superintendents to better understand how they interpreted and navigated the politics of race as school district leaders in their advocacy for students raced black or brown. We then discuss how political race, and the racialization of power in schools requires more theorizing in education leadership research and provide examples of how the field can deepen future analyses by recasting educational inequality as a political problem rather than instructional or cultural and valuing the experiential knowledge of those who have been raced.
Primary homework in England: the beliefs and practices of teachers in primary schools;This study examines teachers' views about and practices in homework in primary schools, based on questionnaire data from 235 primary teachers and 19 in-depth interviews. Findings suggest that teachers prioritise contradictory goals and act in ways that support only some of these. Reading with parents is a universal form of homework and other homework focuses either on English or mathematics or takes a project-led approach. Integration of homework into class learning is problematic. Teachers are concerned about the possible effects of homework on educational inequality and questions are raised about teachers' perceptions of homework as a signifier of good parenting.
From Alternative Schools to School Choice in the Vancouver School District, 1960s to the Neoliberal Present;This article examines the transformation over time of alternative secondary school programs in Vancouver, British Columbia (BC). It approaches school choice from a historical standpoint, to make the point that today's choice policies are neither entirely recent nor entirely neoliberal in origin. Instead, they are built on past precedent and policy flowing from the right and left of the spectrum. The article traces the alternative schools that first emerged in the 1960s, and the Vancouver school board's subsequent absorption of them to offer new, alternative programs beyond its regular secondary school curriculum. Vancouver's alternative secondary programs were soon organized into two distinctive types: (1) remedial rehabilitative alternatives, and (2) selective district specified alternatives. New policy, institutional changes, and philosophical changes in the education sector allowed both types of alternatives to exist, but over time encouraged district specified alternatives to thrive. The provincial School Amendment Act of 2002 represented a watershed for choice as we know it today. It opened attendance boundaries across BC and gave districts the tools to generate their own revenues. Freezing the per-pupil funding it provided to districts at the same time, the provincial government induced districts to compete with one another to recruit students domestically and internationally in order to secure revenue. District specified programs in Vancouver became a key to the district's competitive ability. By elucidating some of this history of different alternative and choice programs, at the secondary level in Vancouver, this article adds considerable perspective to the current theoretical discussion about how neoliberal philosophy is changing choice in Canadian schools.
Democracy and education in contemporary local-global contexts;This special issue takes up the call of the 2017 Re-imagining Education for Democracy Summit to seek new ways to resist growing educational inequality and reframe educational policy and practice to better meet the diverse needs of communities. In a time of enormous challenges and complexity, where thick democracy is reduced to thin choice in markets, collective action and resistance is reconstituted as individual competition and civic virtue is measured by likes or clicks on social media, it becomes vital that educators and researchers find ways to speak back and resist the de-democratization of education across the world. In this issue, contributing papers provide a range of local and global perspectives on the problem of democracy in education, across multiple contexts, including schools, universities, and informal and non-traditional learning sites. Added to this are a range of international empirical research evidence from Australia, Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and US, providing rich comparisons between systems, nation-states, and diverse communities. Each paper considers the question of how we might address the issue of democracy and education, applying a range of methodological, conceptual, and empirical tools to specific local-global education concerns. Taken together, they provide international and comparative perspectives on the different ways education might be re-imagined for democracy.
Paradoxes of the higher education modernization: Results of the 20-year monitoring in the Sverdlovsk Region;"The article considers modernization of the Russian higher education based on the data of the regional monitoring (1995-2016). The methodology of the research consists of the multidimensional approach (combination of systemic, institutional, resource and other approaches) and interpretations of modernization of the higher education as an integral part of modernization of the social-economic system of Russia. Modernization of the higher education is defined as a continuous process of transformational changes focused on improving the quality and competitiveness of all subsystems of the higher education. The article aims at explaining how modernization affects the resource potential of students, at showing to what extent students see its results and can use the opportunities provided by it. The authors focus on the question whether modernization is implemented for students, with or without students: how the quality of education changes due to modernization, how it affects the students' satisfaction with the quality of education and professional training. The article reveals the paradoxes of modernization in terms of achieving its main goal - training of highly qualified professionals satisfying the needs of the economy in personnel; and points to the strengthening of material, technical and financial educational inequality of Russian regions and sectors of economy. The quality of the higher education is considered a way of social self-regulation. Its indicators include students' satisfaction with different aspects of education important for the development of professional knowledge. The article presents the students' estimates of the accessibility of the higher education in the Sverdlovsk Region by such basic indicators of modernization as academic mobility, informatization, relationship of education, science and production. Based on the results of the monitoring the authors prove the low impact of modernization changes on the students' satisfaction with the quality of education and professional training."
Substitutability in Human Capital Formation and Education Inequality;This paper shows that substitutability in human capital formation could influence inequality in education. By incorporating a model of self-selection in education where individuals are heterogeneous in initial wealth and innate ability, we show that any increase in the substitutability of innate ability for initial wealth reduces educational inequality.
ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN THE UNIVERSITY: SKETCH AND QUALITATIVE APPROACH FROM THE SOCIAL REPRESENTATIONS OF MAINTENANCE GRANTEES;This research is approaching the Social Representations (RS) of scholarship students on the problem of educational and economic inequality in the university context from a constructionist approach, that is, from the meanings given according to the experience and role they play, their beliefs and culture manifested in their particular and own forms of expression. To this end, a review is made of the lines and fields of study carried out in response to this social problem considered one of the most serious and persistent in Mexico, as well as the various mitigation proposals to the same from the action of public policies Subsequently, the pertinence and use of the aforementioned methodological theoretical approach in the educational field, the Higher level school space and in an institute of the Autonomous University of the State of Hidalgo (AUSH) is explained. With the above, finally the findings obtained through a mixed study are reported with a survey of 123 undergraduate students, beneficiaries of the maintenance grant and who are part of a new way of understanding the factors that are directly related to the unequal types objects of this study.
SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN WITH LIMITED HEALTH ABILITIES: FACTORS OF REGIONS INEQUALITY;The article reviewed trends in the special education in Russia under the conditions of decentralization. It shows the level of regional inequalities in the share of children with special educational needs to the total number of schoolchildren, their distribution by forms of education, comprising the data with developed countries. On the basis of the analysis of foreign studies it identifies the inequality factors characterizing population and territories that feature growing number of children with special educational needs, clue to unsuitable conditions of education. It specifies socio-economic and demographic (including territorial) factors specific for Russia, that are related to high share of children with special educational needs in the number of schoolchildren, selecting a group of regions with low living standards and low population density. Most significant factors are population density and settlement type, that predetermine worse conditions for finding out children with special educational needs. Selected groups of regions are specified featuring significantly high proportion of children with special educational needs, share of children with development delay, share of children with special educational needs in general classes, in special classes or in special schools. The information base of the research in the Russian Federation subjects was the federal statistics data provided by Rosstat and the RF Ministry of Education and Science for the period 2011 to 2015.
Does sibling and twin similarity in cognitive ability differ by parents' education?;Stratification scholars predominantly investigate how differences among children from different families emerge and tend to neglect differences among children from the same family. I study sibling similarity in cognitive ability and examine whether their similarity varies by parents' education. Although economic approaches and their extensions argue that disadvantaged parents reinforce differences while advantaged parents compensate for differences, I argue that parents may also make equal investments and thus accept differences among their children. I refer to the literature on stratified parenting that demonstrates that parents are engaged differently in child-rearing and their children's skill formation processes. Because advantaged parents foster children's talents more individually compared with disadvantaged parents, I propose that sibling similarity is lower in advantaged than in disadvantaged families. Previous studies based on sibling correlations provide conflicting evidence. To account for observable and unobservable differences among siblings, I extend the established sibling correlation approach and study dizygotic and monozygotic twins in addition to siblings. The analyses draw on novel data from a population register-based study of twin families. I find that young adult siblings and twins are less alike in cognitive ability in highly educated families than in less educated families. Hence, my results support the hypothesis concerning equal investments and indicate that stratified parenting has a long-lasting influence on children's cognitive ability.
Critical educational system development research: A normative-analytical research approach to school-based inequality research;It is a main subject of educational monitoring and inequality research to explore social inequalities. But despite of elaborated research methods it should be noted that these studies are usually not informed by normative reflections. So this article argues for a further development from educational system development research to an integrated theory of inequality research and justice-based school theory: critical educational system development research. Theory-based valuation standards may be used to discuss results of educational inequality research as well as to develop criteria of empirical observation by ethical principles. We will illustrate the critical potential of this programme by the example of the national report on education (Education in Germany).
Culture, Education and Mapuche mythology in Argentina (Northern Patagonia). Sociology of acculturation;In these pages we propose to visualize the situation of the culture of the Mapuche people in Argentina in terms of ethnic -cultural and educational inequality in relation to the Mapuche people and culture (Mapuche or Mapuce: people of the earth). This culture is in the context of a more globalized world (culturally standardized) and impacted by (transnational) crosscultural elements. This study is led by a socio-historical perspective, moving beyond the colonizing effects and the acculturation of a culture ignored and treated as a subaltern in the post -colonial era, now target of a process of clarification. Socio-historical circumstances that favor the state of discrimination and social and cultural exclusion, of poverty, of judicialization of indigenous conflicts and of postmodern invisibilization that provoke the existence of a Mapuche culture, worldview and mythology that is hardly recognized by and almost unknown to a large part of the population, even the Mapuche people themselves. Northern Patagonia (Neuquen, Rio Negro and Chubut), currently Argentina, is called Puel Mapu (Eastern land). It is considered that the Mapuche territory is located in Argentina and Chile. Though both countries are separated by the mountain range of the Andes, the territory is referred to, by the Mapuche himself, as one whole: Waj or Wall Mapu (universe or cosmos: Mapuche territory). In mythological and religious terms, the validity of the nguillatim (rogativa) is understood as a religious ceremony, which is still celebrated especially in the month of March, and which means the affection to the land and livestock.
An investigation of social class inequalities in general cognitive ability in two British birth cohorts;The 'Flynn effect' describes the substantial and long-standing increase in average cognitive ability test scores, which has been observed in numerous psychological studies. Flynn makes an appeal for researchers to move beyond psychology's standard disciplinary boundaries and to consider sociological contexts, in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive inequalities. In this article we respond to this appeal and investigate social class inequalities in general cognitive ability test scores over time. We analyse data from the National Child Development Study (1958) and the British Cohort Study (1970). These two British birth cohorts are suitable nationally representative large-scale data resources for studying inequalities in general cognitive ability. We observe a large parental social class effect, net of parental education and gender in both cohorts. The overall finding is that large social class divisions in cognitive ability can be observed when children are still at primary school, and similar patterns are observed in each cohort. Notably, pupils with fathers at the lower end of the class structure are at a distinct disadvantage. This is a disturbing finding and it is especially important because cognitive ability is known to influence individuals later in the lifecourse.
Science or liberal arts? Cultural capital and college major choice in China;Previous studies on major East Asian societies such as Japan and Korea generally fail to find a strong effect of cultural capital in educational inequality, partly due to the characteristic extreme focus on standardized test and curriculum. This study shifts attention to the horizontal stratification of education by investigating the association between family background, cultural capital, and college major choice in contemporary China. Based on analysis of data from the Beijing College Students Panel Survey (BCSPS), we found that, on average, cultural capital significantly mediates the relationship between family background and college major preference. Those with greater endowment of cultural capital are more likely to come from socio-economically advantaged families, and, at the same time, demonstrate a stronger propensity to major in liberal arts fields rather than science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Further analyses reveal that the association between cultural capital and academic field choice comes into being by way of performance in the Chinese test in the national college entrance examination and of the non-cognitive dispositions, such as self-efficacy and self-esteem. Our findings better our understanding of formation of the horizontal stratification of higher education.
School tracking and social selection in northern Italy;The links between tracked secondary schooling and social selection form part of a complex narrative regarding educational inequality in European schools. The relative contribution of family and school to unequal educational outcomes has dominated educational debates across the continent for more than 50 years. This article contributes to this debate by focusing on a sample of students in the final year of schooling in three schools in northern Italy. It asks whether there are social differences in enrolments and aspirations across the three different types of schools. It also considers whether aspirations can be linked to differences in levels of family support or to school-related factors. To examine these links, we consider four main ways of conceptualising aspirations and propose an approach that draws on theories explaining preference formation and choice.
Teacher 'quality' and attainment grouping: The role of within-school teacher deployment in social and educational inequality;Prior research suggests that where pupils are 'tracked', better qualified, more experienced teachers tend to be deployed to higher attainment groups, at the expense of pupils in lower tracks. This is especially pertinent from a social justice perspective, given consistent findings in the UK that pupils from socially-disadvantaged backgrounds are over-represented in low attainment groups. This article draws on data from 380 teachers, drawn from 126 secondary schools in England, and interviews with 118 Year 7 students, to examine whether these findings from prior research in the US and elsewhere extend to the case of England in the present day. Findings show some evidence of these inequitable tendencies: those teachers highly qualified in their taught subject were less likely to be allocated to low sets. We also examine whether an intervention designed to encourage more equitable distribution had any impact on practice, and find tentative evidence that deployment in intervention schools had been impacted in relation to teacher subject qualifications. Pupils believed that teachers of higher sets had higher expectations and standards of behaviour, whereas those for low sets were seen to be unhelpfully indulgent, indicating a need for research attention to pedagogy and tracking. Findings are analysed from a social justice perspective, with interest in the consequences of inequitable distribution of teachers for the reproduction of social inequality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Beyond the global city: a comparative analysis of cosmopolitanism in middle-class educational strategies in Australia and Brazil;The global middle class (GMC) is a theoretical construct that seeks to globalise a set of attributes identified in studies of school choice in the global north, and to a lesser extent in developing nations in Asia. As theorised by Ball a mobile middle class with cosmopolitan sensibilities drives international education options in global cities. This proposition is challenged through analysis of the histories of curriculum and class relations in two national settings (Australia and Brazil) and examination of contemporary class profiles (i.e. economic and cultural properties) in expanding forms of international education in these countries. The paper argues that the forms of cosmopolitanism associated with the educational practices of the GMC must be examined within broader historical relationships of cultural domination. We conclude by arguing that broadening the historical horizon is an important exercise to challenge the claim of the GMC to be a novel category involving exceptional forms of cultural contact generated by the dynamics of the 'global city'.
Cultural Capital and Educational Inequality: A Counterfactual Analysis;We use National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) data and a counterfactual approach to test the macro-level implications of cultural reproduction and cultural mobility theory. Our counterfactual analyses show that the observed socioeconomic gradient in children's educational attainment in the NLSY79 data would be smaller if cultural capital was more equally distributed between children whose parents are of low socioeconomic status (SES) and those whose parents are of high SES. They also show that hypothetically increasing cultural capital among low-SES parents would lead to a larger reduction in the socioeconomic gradient in educational attainment than reducing it among high-SES parents. These findings are consistent with cultural mobility theory (which argues that low-SES children have a higher return to cultural capital than high-SES children) but not with cultural reproduction theory (which argues that low-SES children have a lower return to cultural capital). Our analysis contributes to existing research by demonstrating that the unequal distribution of cultural capital shapes educational inequality at the macro level.
The foreign language profile at school as a category of social segregation - Historical development and present relevance of the foreign language profile at school as a dimension of horizontal educational inequality;Even though the knowledge of modern foreign languages is today indispensable for making acareer, Latin remains popular in German schools. Contrary to its image as auseless relict, the chances of Latin-graduates on the job market are beyond average. How can that be explained? Based on data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), I show that there is apositive correlation between belonging to the educated middle-class and knowledge in Latin. Hence, both the general popularity and the positive impact on the labor market is produced, I argue, by the historically established symbolic meaning of Latin as amarker of cultural distinction. In order to illustrate this argument, the historical developments in higher secondary education in Germany regarding the choice of foreign languages are analyzed and interpreted by means of Bourdieu's field theory. The dominance of modern foreign languages, as prevalent in today's labor market-oriented schooling system, proves to be aproduct of the success of heretical forces in the field that pushed back the orthodox humanist educational ideal. In the course of the inflation of the Abitur through the educational expansion of the past decades, the distinctiveness of the Abitur has shifted to the humanistic Abitur in particular. As aresult, the choice of foreign languages at school is to be regarded as amechanism of social closure.
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS OF CASTILLA Y LEON;"Education is one of the most damaged scenarios during periods of economic crisis. The lack of access to basic educational services on equal opportunities, due to family economic difficulties and readjustments in public spending, continues to cause segregation (Bonal and Verger, 2013). This research examines the perception of children and adolescents of primary and secondary school in Castilla y Leon about educational inequality, implementing a qualitative methodology. Eight discussion groups were held with students from the region. Research results show that children and adolescents perceive that family economic problems make it difficult to purchase books, other school material and access to educational resources; participate in activities organized inside and outside school hours that entail an economic cost and access to reinforcement classes; and that this affects their psychosocial well-being (generates negative Feelings and they are rejected by their peers) and, with this, in their school performance. In conclusion, it is evident that low family income accentuates the loss of rights in access to educational resources with equal opportunities, in addition to impacting the psychosocial well-being of these children and adolescents."
Inequality and Ethnic Conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa;Theories of ethnic conflict predict that between-group inequality should be associated with a greater likelihood of violent conflict, but empirical results have been mixed. One reason might be that different types of inequalities have opposing effects on the likelihood of conflict. In this article, we posit that educational inequalities are likely to incentivize collective action by inducing grievances, while economic and demographic inequalities may actually dis-incentivize collective action by limiting opportunities for disadvantaged groups to engage in rebellion. We test these hypotheses on a new ethnic dyad database, incorporating 1,548 dyads formed by 290 ethnic groups living in 29 Sub-Saharan African countries. The analysis reveals that educational inequalities are indeed positively associated with conflict incidence, while this is not the case for economic and demographic inequalities. The association between educational inequality and conflict is stronger if the groups are wealthier. A higher joint educational level of the groups is associated with less conflict, particularly under more autocratic regimes. These findings demonstrate that to better understand the relationship between inequality and conflict, it is important to disaggregate the effects of inequalities according to the underlying mechanisms and the political context with which they are associated.
Measuring Inequality of Opportunity in Access to Quality Basic Education: A Case Study in Florida, US;Providing all children equal access to essential services, such as primary education, has been set as a priority in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)' agenda during the last two decades. Yet the Global Education Monitoring report in 2016 reveals that wide disparities between the rich and the poor persist in access to education of high quality. This study uses the Human Opportunity Index (HOI) to examine the equality of opportunity in access to basic education of high quality. By using enrollment and admission data from a case study in a large school district in the US in 2015/2016, this research evaluates the capacity of the HOI, in order to reveal disparities in access to school opportunities and examines how much of this inequality is explained by families' pre-determined circumstances. The way of analyzing equality is by disaggregating applications' data into circumstance groups, according to gender, geography, race/ethnicity, and other criteria. To capture the contribution of each circumstance to inequality of opportunity, the Shapley decomposition method is used. Findings show that the HOI is capable of systematically monitoring and examining existing admission policies and identifying inequality problems. Furthermore, the analysis of the contribution of each circumstance group can reveal admission criteria that have the potential to harm the educational opportunities for children. This assessment should provide valuable insights into the capability of the indicators to reveal where policy intervention is necessary and supply points of view on how policy can be improved.
The Effect of Classroom Composition and Size on Learning Outcomes for Italian and Immigrant Students in High School;"Students cannot change the composition and the size of the classroom they attend, and the effect of these variables on achievement is a source of educational inequality. In this study, based on a representative sample of Italian high school students (N = 26,799), a multilevel analysis was performed to: (i) estimate the overall impact of the structural characteristics of the class on achievements; (ii) identify which of the analysed characteristics were more relevant. The results show that the structure of the classroom has a significant impact on academic performance, and they identify group's initial learning level and gender composition as the most important factors. The overall socio-economic level of the class and the percentage of immigrant students proved to have a lower impact, which varied according to different geographical areas, and the group size does not seem to be relevant. In conclusion, if the outcome of interest is academic performance, results suggest that the classroom size and the number of immigrant students attending the class has little or no relevance in high school, while the group's initial achievement, the gender composition and, to a lesser extent, the socio-economic composition of the group should be taken into consideration. Given the complexity of the objectives of the educational system in Italy, which are by no means limited to the improvement of academic results, future studies will have to examine the effects of the structure of the classroom also on non-cognitive outcomes that are closely related to students' personal and social development."
Childhood Inequality in China: Evidence from Recent Survey Data (2012-2014);In recent decades, China has transformed from a relatively egalitarian society to a highly unequal one. What are the implications of high levels of inequality for the lives of children? Drawing on two nationally representative datasets, the China Family Panel Studies and the China Education Panel Survey, we develop a comprehensive portrait of childhood inequality in post-reform China. Analyses reveal stark disparities between children from different socio-economic backgrounds in family environments and in welfare outcomes, including physical health, psychosocial health and educational performance. We argue that childhood inequality in China is driven not only by the deprivations of poverty but also by the advantages of affluence, as high socio-economic status children diverge from their middle and low socio-economic status counterparts on various family environment and child welfare measures.
Educational Inequality, Educational Expansion, and Intergenerational Income Persistence in the United States;The children of high-income parents often become high-income adults, while their low-income peers often become low-income adults. Education plays a central role in this intergenerational income persistence. Because education-based inequalities grew in recent decades, many scholars predicted that intergenerational income persistence would increase. However, previous research suggests that it remained stable across recent cohorts. We address this puzzle. Analyzing National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data, we find that growing educational inequality by parental income, along with rising economic returns to education, increased intergenerational persistence, as scholars expected. However, two countervailing trends offset this increase. The expansion of higher education reduced persistence, because completing college helps low-income children become high-income adults. Yet, this reduction in persistence was far from enough to offset the increase in persistence associated with growing educational inequality and rising educational returns. Intergenerational persistence would have increased if not for another change: within educational groups, parental income became less predictive of adult income. New methodological tools underlie these findings, tools that quantify, for the first time, education's full force in intergenerational income persistence. These findings suggest that to reduce intergenerational persistence, educational policies should focus less on how many people complete college and more on who completes college.
Performing the Nation, Performing the Market: Hybrid Practices and Negotiated Meanings of Chinese Rural Teachers;Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork in two ethnic villages in Southwest China, this article examines rural teachers' performative engagement with education reform, audit culture, and neoliberal market mandates in their daily practices. Teachers are at once pedagogical agents, street-level bureaucrats, and tourism entrepreneurs who both perform to and resist the dominant state and market ideologies. Teachers' creative tactics and hybrid subjectivities challenge the resistance-compliance dichotomy and illuminate the persistent educational inequality in China's rural ethnic margins.
Is post-secondary education a safe port and for whom? Evidence from Canadian data;Previous studies document that adverse labor market conditions, proxied by the unemployment rate, stimulate post-secondary enrollment. This paper shows for the first time that unemployment not only affects enrollment but also changes the composition of the student body and students' educational path, with important consequences for intergenerational mobility. Results show that unemployment stimulates university enrollment especially among individuals with highly educated parents. This has consequences for educational inequality. Students are also more likely to choose university over community college when unemployment rises. Thus, labor market conditions affect the type of education and skills that students acquire. Further, unemployment is shown to affect the decision of workers to return to school and complete their unfinished studies or acquire additional training.
Unintended effects of the language policy on the transition of immigrant students to upper secondary education in Catalonia;This article analyses the effects of the language policy in Catalonia on the transition of immigrant students to upper secondary education in Barcelona by focusing on the language learning experiences and academic trajectories of two case-studies of Pakistani students whose communicative resources remain invisible despite the official celebration of linguistic diversity and which are not properly fostered to ensure their successful incorporation into post-compulsory education, despite their initial success and high aspirations. Although indicators of educational inequality show how young people born outside the EU experience an alarming disadvantage in comparison to their Spanish-born peers, little attention has been paid to factors related to the complex bilingual context of Catalonia. This article aims to shed light on the factors involved in the early school leaving of students from immigrant backgrounds, especially critical in the periods of transition, and the role played by the language policies, beliefs and ideology that they are exposed to.
Implementing computer-mediated intercultural communication in English education: A critical reflection on its pedagogical challenges;Lay Description Integrating computer-mediated intercultural communication (CMIC) activities into language curricula has been discussed as an innovative approach. Despite the increasing number of successful examples reporting positive outcomes of adopting CMIC activities in language-learning environments, it has also been noted that there are significant pedagogical challenges observed when CMIC activities are introduced into classrooms. However, previous studies tend only to briefly mention some of those challenges and to list general solutions to them, rather than deeply engaging with the issues and their educational and social consequences upon students' learning practices. Thus, this qualitative case study documents diverse pedagogical challenges faced by Korean students and teacher in their English-as-a-foreign language classroom, in which a series of CMIC activities were set up and conducted. The challenges analysed in this paper include the unrealistically high implementation cost, the educational inequality issues created by irreducible gaps in students' socio-economic backgrounds, and the unresolved struggles to develop positive student subjectivities and linguistic identities. In conclusion, the article proposes three instructional principles, drawn in turn from the two closely interrelated theories: multiliteracies pedagogy and critical pedagogy. Fundamentally, the author argues that effective adoption of CMIC activities needs a more pedagogically, socially, and culturally sensitive approach.
Kids, College, and Capital: Parental Financial Support and College Choice;Parents vary in both their willingness and ability to pay for their children's college expenses, yet there is little research on how adolescents' expectations of future financial support from parents affect their college enrollment decisions. Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study, I fill this gap in the literature by examining the predictors of parents' plans to pay for college and estimating the effect of having a parent that plans to pay for college on an adolescent's probability of college attendance. The results suggest that after parents' ability to pay is taken into account, social class remains a strong predictor of whether parents plan to pay for their children's college education. Additionally, parent's plans to pay for college have a measurable impact on children's college enrollment as long as the child is aware of or agrees with the parent's plans. Therefore, it is likely that socioeconomic differences in parents' pledges of financial support to adolescents contribute to postsecondary stratification. The results from this study suggest that policymakers and researchers who are concerned about educational inequality should pay greater attention to the role of parental financial support in structuring children's ability to access college.
Early tracking and socioeconomic inequality in academic achievement: Studying reforms in nine countries;Between-school tracking is high on the agenda of academicresearchers and policy makers, as tracking children early in the school career is believed to enhance socioeconomic inequalities in learning opportunities. Contemporary debates on the relevance of inclusive education in the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, England and Germany, may learn from changes in educational inequalities that have emerged after past reforms from early tracking to comprehensive systems. I study educational inequalities by socioeconomic background in nine countries, across time. Using a difference-in-difference design and international student assessment data collected among eighth-graders, it is demonstrated that socioeconomic inequalities are more strongly reduced in systems that have transformed their educational system from tracked to comprehensive education than in systems without this reform. Moreover, the reduction of social inequalities was most eminent at the top of the achievement distribution. Among top-performers, socioeconomic inequality was reduced after the reform. Among low-performing students, the reform did little to the level of inequality by social background. Robustness checks showed that especially the reform in England and Wales was influential on the observed reduction of inequalities in mathematics performance.
The transition from lower to upper secondary education as a descent that is caused by upward mobility Results from a biographical longitudinal study;Efforts to break the link between the school type attended and the qualification awarded are seen as an important step towards more permeability and upward mobility of Germany's tracked secondary school system. Results from abiographical longitudinal study, which explored the transition from the low-ability school type Hauptschule to upper secondary education in general and vocational Gymnasium (grammar schools) yet show that from the students' perspective, it is very challenging to take on the transition from lower-level ability to upper-level secondary school types , even though this may be institutionally possible, and desirable from an educational political perspective. For the students, this transition brings along the experience of severe degradation
'Persistence of the social': The role of cognitive ability in mediating the effects of social origins on educational attainment in Britain;"In this paper, we address two research questions on the basis of the series of British birth cohort studies. First, how large is the part played by cognitive ability in mediating the association that exists between individuals' educational attainment and their social origins, and is there evidence of any change in the importance of its mediating role over recent decades? Second, does the importance of its mediating role change over the course of individuals' educational careers? As regards the first question, we find that only around half of the effects of individuals' social origins on their educational attainment is mediated via their cognitive ability, as measured in early life. There has been some fluctuation in the mediation percentage over time, but no sustained increase. Moreover, this is the case in whatever way we measure social origins. As regards the second question, we find that the mediating role of cognitive ability changes little in importance as individuals' educational careers progress, with the possible exception that it declines in the case of an educational threshold relating to upper secondary qualifications. In the light of our results, we call into question the idea that the intergenerational reproduction of educational inequalities is driven overwhelmingly via the intergeneration transmission of cognitive ability; and also claims such as those made by Marks (2014) of 'the decline of the social' in the determination of the educational attainment of children from more or less advantaged families. While the relative importance of different forms of parental resources for children's educational success may be changing somewhat, our findings indicate a strong 'persistence of the social'."
Structural embeddedness of students' professional expectations: the Czech Republic and Taiwan in comparative perspective;We compare the role of gender, socioeconomic background and measured ability on students' secondary school placement and professional expectations in Taiwan and the Czech Republic, two countries that have experienced substantial reforms in their educational systems in the context of political change and economic development. Using data from the international PISA 2006 survey of 15-year-olds, our analysis reveals that Czech academic upper-secondary schools are much more selective in terms of socioeconomic background and gender than comparable Taiwanese senior high schools. Controlling for measured ability and other factors, students' professional expectations are also more closely linked to socioeconomic background and gender in the Czech Republic than in Taiwan.
Multilayered Analyses of the Experiences of Undocumented Latinx College Students;Being the target of constant discrimination and marginalization can often cause intense negative psychological reactions and shame for undocumented students. The following qualitative study describes past and current undocumented Latinx students' experiences of educational inequality in higher education influenced by labels associated with being undocumented. In this study we used a constructivist theoretical perspective which enabled us to focus on undocumented participants' perspectives, experiences, meaning-making processes, values, and beliefs. Data was collected through hour-long, semi-structured interviews with five undocumented students. Student narratives were analyzed using a multi-layered analysis approach: (1) narrative, (2) thematic, and (3) critical incident analysis. Findings for this study provided insight on the narratives of carrying labels, themes associated with various labels, and critical incidents in the narratives and lives of undocumented students. Through our findings, we are able to contribute to existing literature and provide directions for future research.
Educational inequalities Do they affect the relationship between Internet use and economic growth?;This paper examines the impact of Internet use on economic growth and the extent to which educational inequality modulates this impact for a panel data set of 94 countries between 1995 and 2010. We obtain a positive and significant impact of Internet use on economic growth and a negative influence of educational inequality on the Internet's impact on growth. When we disaggregate by income levels, the results indicate that Internet use is positively associated with economic growth for middle- and high-income countries. Educational inequality influences the impact of Internet use on economic growth only for middle- and low-income countries, although with the opposite sign. For middle-income countries, the impact is negative, while the impact is positive for low-income economies. The research provides evidence for the first time about how inequalities in education may limit the positive economic outcomes and benefits derived from the use of information and communication technologies.
Pygmalion in instruction? Tracking, teacher reward structures, and educational inequality;I combine sociological and economic research to test a new theoretical model of the causes and consequences of teacher responses to students' track location. I examine the impact of teacher reward structures on educational inequality by analyzing how grading practices affect students' effort and achievement across tracks. Differences in grading practices determine incentive structures for student behavior and educational investments and thus may be an important mechanism in explaining track effects on academic achievement. I apply student fixed effects models across tracks to the NELS:88 and find that, first, track placement affects achievement, second, although grading practices affect achievement, they only explain a minor part of the track effect, and, third, teacher expectations and perceived class ability level explain the positive track effect for high-track students. These findings suggest that high-track students have higher achievement because their teachers perceive them as better students.
Social origins, relative risk aversion and track choice: A field experiment on the role of information biases;This study develops and tests the hypothesis that information biases concerning the perceived extent of risk of educational options fuel social inequalities in track choice. In particular, it is argued that low-educated families are more concerned than college-educated families with the risks of dropout in the academic track, even when their children perform well at school. Moreover, they overestimate the risks of low occupational outcomes associated with academic diplomas. These information biases enhance their propensity to select vocational tracks, which are perceived as safer options, even when their children have the potential to succeed in the academic path. Survey data from Italy were used to assess these misperceptions and experimental evidence is presented concerning their causal effect on track choices. To correct these misperceptions, we designed a light information intervention, which was nested in a longitudinal survey to assess the impact of this intervention on students' track choices. Both survey and experimental results corroborated our hypothesis that information biases contribute to social inequalities in track choice.
Admitting a Sense of Superiority: Aggrandized Higher Education Status as an Objection to Educational Inequality;"Recalling the landmark US Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the advancement of educational equality is often associated with the reduction of stigmatizing differences in status or sense of inferiority engendered by separately and differentially educated citizens. This essay takes up the obverse concern, the sense of superiority sustained by educational inequality, with particular focus on the inequality signaled by higher education status (HES). I contend that the presence of aggrandized HES in a democratic society provides reasons to object to educational inequality for which institutions of higher education ought to be held responsible. Aggrandized HES not only demands a questionable deference from citizens in a democratic society; it also weakens HES's signaling of epistemic authority and equality of educational opportunity, which harms the public's motivation to learn by distorting beliefs about education. To address this problem, I argue that the best policy solution for curbing aggrandized uses of HES is to transform the positional aspect of higher education using an admissions policy originally suggested by Elizabeth Anderson, which I term the elite culture strategy. Beyond admissions policies, this essay addresses the larger concern of educating citizens to perceive and assess educational status according to democratic norms and not solely in terms of self-interested gain."
Human capital and income inequality*;This study investigates empirically how human capital, measured by educational attainment, is related to income distribution. The regressions, using a cross-country data between 1980 and 2015, show that a more equal distribution of education contributes significantly to reducing income inequality. Educational expansion is a major factor in reducing educational inequality and thus income inequality. Social benefits spending and price stability contribute to reducing income inequality, while public education spending helps to reduce educational inequality. In contrast, higher per capita income, greater trade openness and faster technological progress tend to make both income and education distribution more unequal. The calibration of empirical results shows that we can attribute the rising income inequality within East Asian economies in recent decades to the unequalizing effects of fast income growth and rapid progress in globalization and technological change, which have surpassed the income-equalizing effects from improved equality in the distribution of educational attainment.
SOCIAL REPRESENTATIONS FROM THE SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS ABOUT FACTORS OF ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY: AN APPROACH;"The scientific field is increasing its growth and becomes more diverse before which multiple approaches are intended to explain the reality and its complexities. The Social Representations as a theoretical-methodological line gives an account of its feasibility in this work because it allows to approach and construct an object of study from the existence of a meaning and utility for a group determined for this reason the inequality in its economic and educational typologies it can be constructed from the social actors. Inequality has been a situation that afflicts humanity persistently since ancient times, the approach and exploration for its treatment is scarce from social psychology, since economics, political science and sociology have been the main disciplines that have studied it. The objective of this article is to publicize the social representations that students have scholarship about the conditions and / or factors of both economic and educational inequality, in addition to the impact that a maintenance grant has on them, from their perceptions and from of your experience. For this, 123 questionnaires were applied; subsequently, the data obtained was systematized to obtain statistical elements. In the same way, semantic networks and the pertinent calculations were made to obtain the opinions of the scholars based on the semantic differential. The conclusions are framed in that there is no differential effect in the amount awarded in the maintenance grant towards economic and educational inequality, this resource represents a support for the beneficiaries and falls more in being a palliative in the economic factors concerning the household and of immediate personal question. The value given is of gratitude to continue studying and completing university studies."
Social Background and Between-track Mobility in the General Education System in West Germany and in East Germany after German Unification;Using data from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), this article investigates how frequent between-track mobility is in the general education system in West Germany and in East Germany after unification. Implementing a multidimensional approach to social background, this paper examines social origin and gender differences in moving up to the academic track in West Germany or down to the non-academic track in West Germany and in East Germany after unification. The empirical evidence indicates that downward mobility is more common than upward mobility in West Germany. Moreover, there is not much overall mobility between the academic and non-academic tracks in the general education system. In addition, it could be shown that children from families with a higher educational background and higher social status background are more likely to move up from the non-academic to the academic track in West Germany. Children from families with a lower educational background in West Germany and in East Germany after unification are more likely to move downwards.
Inequality of opportunity in China's educational outcomes;This paper investigates trends in educational inequality in China, focusing on the contribution of 'inequality of opportunity' to these trends. Utilising the China Family Panel Studies survey for 2010 and 2012, we measure the inequality in individual educational outcomes (measured in years of schooling) in aggregate and for each of ten birth cohorts. We run regressions to identify the key determinants of these outcomes, all of which can be classified as 'circumstances' that lie beyond the control of each individual, and which reveal important variations in the magnitude and significance of key determinants across birth cohorts. The results are then used to calculate the share of 'inequality of opportunity' in overall educational inequality. The lack of equal opportunity for Chinese people with regard to their educational outcomes is shown to stem primarily from the divisive hukou system, with further significant contributions from father's education, birth cohort, province, parents' Communist Party membership, gender, family size and ethnicity, in that order.

Educational inequality and intergenerational mobility in Latin America: A new database;"The causes and consequences of the intergenerational persistence of inequality are a topic of great interest among various fields in economics. However, until now, issues of data availability have restricted a broader and cross national perspective on the topic. Based on rich sets of harmonized household survey data, we contribute to filling this gap by computing time series for several indexes of relative and absolute intergenerational education mobility for 18 Latin American countries over 50 years and making them publicly available. We find that inter-generational mobility is, on average, rising in Latin America. This pattern seems to be driven by the high upward mobility of children from low-educated families; at the same time, there is substantial immobility at the top of the distribution. Significant cross-country differences are observed and are associated with income inequality, poverty, economic growth, public educational expenditures, and assortative mating."
Performance Equity and Educational Inequality;The question of the contribution is whether and how the limitation of freedom of choice by binding recommendations for the transition to higher educational tracks after elementary school changes the effects of prior performance on the one hand and of social background on the other. Aim is the systematization of different approaches and findings by acomprehensive theoretical model for effects of ability tracking and its empirical test using data of the of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) for the different regulations in the German country states. The central finding is that effects of social background are not changed with binding recommendations, but that performance equity, understood as degree of the coupling of attainment with performances in elementary school resp. cognitive abilities of the children, increases. Asystem that aims to improve educational competencies through cognitive homogenization of schools and school classes should therefore strive to strengthen the selectivity by cognitive abilities and achievements instead of trying to open and liberalize regulations, especially in order to prevent deviations in transitions from recommendations for the higher track to alower oneespecially for the talented children from lower classes with such arecommendation for the higher track.
Effects of Political Reforms on the Participation of Children with and Without a Migration Background in External Childcare Under the Age of Three;Expanding the supply of family external childcare for children under the age of three is con-sidered an important (political) instrument to increase equal opportunities by reconciling family and working life. Moreover, it is regarded as an instrument to reduce educational inequality. Especially, potentially positive effects of external childcare for the language and cognitive development of children with amigration background are emphasized. Increasing their participation in external childcare is therefore considered an important goal. We use data of the official Kinder- und Jugendhilfestatistik of the years 2006 to 2015 to analyse in how far political reforms introducing ageneral legal claim for childcare under the age of three as well as changing its costs have influenced the participation rates of children with and without amigration background. To this end, we use the difference-in-differences technique to compare trends of various groups of children that were affected differently by institutional changes. Overall, the empirical results indicate that as long as there is ashortage in the supply of childcare places for children under the age of three, it is of primary importance to increase this supply to avoid access barriers for children with amigration background. Monetary incentives will most likely only reach their full potential once the demand for childcare places is largely satisfied.
Performance-related Justice and Educational Inequality Effects of the Liability of the Primary School Recommendations during the Grade Crossing to the High School.

Institutional change and parental compensation in intergenerational attainment;Previous research has shown how institutional changes, such as educational expansion, have weakened parental influence on educational attainment. We extend this analysis to occupational attainment and put forth a parental compensation hypothesis: as the origin-education (OE) association weakens, parents act to compensate for this in order to maintain their influence on the child's occupational attainment. We should see this as a strengthened origin-destination association net of education (net OD). Further, we study whether these compensatory actions are triggered by changes in educational institutions and whether the institutional changes that reduce educational inequality are the same ones that prompt parental compensation. We have linked data from five waves of the European Social Survey (2002-10) with data on educational institutions matched to birth cohorts born 1941-80 in 25 countries. We find weakened OE and strengthened net OD associations, supporting our parental compensation hypothesis. Multilevel mixed effects regression analyses reveal that reforms lengthening compulsory education, and the increased access to and the attainment of higher education have had a positive influence on parental compensation. As a conclusion, a later school leaving age seems to secure increased parental influence on children's occupational attainment, while parents seem to have reacted to a lesser extent on the changes in higher education.
Social origin and school processes in Paraguay. Factors associated to the academic performance in reading and mathematics of third grade students;This is a quantitative study of explanatory scope realized with information provided by The Latin American Laboratory of Evaluation of the Educational Quality (LLECE)-UNESCO with the purpose of establishing and comparing context and process factors associated with performance in the TERCE assessment of Reading and Mathematics learning by 3rd graders in school institutions of the Republic of Paraguay during the year 2013. For this purpose, 2759 exams were analyzed together with the information of self-administered questionnaires to the student, his family, the classroom teacher and the director of 200 educational establishments. For the estimation of the associated factors a hierarchical linear model was used that established as factors of greater association, with the performance in the Reading and Mathematics assessments, the Cultural Capital of the student, the School Resource Materials and to a lesser extent the Class Climate. In addition, reading is significantly associated with the director's management -with negative effect-, the social origin of the student and the school's habitat. Likewise, the differential incidences of the categories (high / low) of the contextual factors (social origin, cultural capital, classroom environment, habitat, dependency and material resources) among the test performances were significant (p <0.01).
Inequity and Excellence in Academic Performance: Evidence From 27 Countries;Research suggests that a country does not need inequity to have high performance. However, such research has potentially suffered from confounders present in between-country comparative research (e.g., latent cultural differences). Likewise, relatively little consideration has been given to whether the situation may be different for high- or low-performing students. Using five cycles of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) database, the current research explores within-country trajectories in achievement and inequality measures to test the hypothesis of an excellence/equity tradeoff in academic performance. We found negative relations between performance and inequality that are robust and of statistical and practical significance. Follow-up analysis suggests a focus on low and average performers may be critical to successful policy interventions.
Stratification in China's Education;A large body of research has shown growing class inequalities in educational attainment in post-Mao China. The more advantaged families have benefited more from educational expansion and development. This article argues that class inequalities in education are unlikely to decline under the Xi Jinping leadership. While Xi makes frequent references to Maoist ideas and concepts, he is also pushing for the innovation-driven development strategy, which will continue to stratify China's educational system in favour of elite schools and universities. At the policy level, there will be initiatives seeking to reduce educational inequality. However, there will not be an overhaul as radical as in the Mao era.
Multiple dimensions of social background and horizontal educational attainment in Sweden;We follow Swedish cohorts born between 1976 and 1984 through their educational career and analyze how different dimensions of parents' socio-economic standing (SES) in education, occupation, income, and wealth structure horizontal attainment in secondary tracks and tertiary fields. Our results show that there is strong horizontal segregation by parents' SES. However, the influence of social background dimensions on educational attainment is not uniform, but differ by combination of dimension and track or field. We identify a main contrast between parents' education, and to some extent occupation, on the one hand, and the economic dimensions of income and wealth on the other. When we assess the total contribution of all dimensions, we find that net of previous achievement about 35% of the attainment of different upper-secondary tracks, and 25% of attainment of different tertiary fields is due to social background. Despite the non-uniform pattern, this segregation is also linked to future inequality, i.e. in chances of tertiary graduation linked to upper-secondary tracks and in expected earnings linked to tertiary field choices.
Convergence or Divergence? Educational Discrepancies in Work-Care Arrangements of Mothers with Young Children in Germany;This study examines how educational differences in work-care patterns among mothers with young children in Germany changed between 1997 and 2013. Since the mid-2000s, Germany has undergone a paradigm shift in parental leave and childcare policies. Our comparative analysis of East and West Germany provides new evidence on whether the long-standing gender regime differences interact with recent developments of social class inequalities in the changing family policy context. The analyses include pooled binary and multinomial logistic regressions based on 17,764 observations of 8604 children below the age of three years from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). The findings point to growing educational divergence in work-care arrangements in East and West Germany: employment and day-care use increased more strongly among families with medium and highly educated mothers compared to those with low education. This has critical implications for the latter's economic security. The decline in the use of informal childcare options was, however, fairly homogenous.
Does schooling actually perpetuate educational inequality in mathematics performance? A validity question on the measures of opportunity to learn in PISA;International assessments of mathematics have shown persistent and widely intensified socioeconomic inequalities in achievement worldwide over the last decades. Such achievement gaps may partly be due to the differences in students' personal and family characteristics. They may also be attributed to the schooling itself if school systems provide differentiated opportunity to learn (OTL) for children from privileged versus disadvantaged backgrounds. Previous research on the mechanism of the joint relationship among socioeconomic status (SES), academic achievement, and OTL produced inconclusive results. The main aim of the present study is to test whether schooling actually perpetuates social inequality in achievement, by reanalyzing PISA data. Specifically, we scrutinize the construct validity of the OTL measure in PISA that has been used in previous research. Our analyses reveal two latent dimensions of the OTL indicators in PISA, namely an unbiased OTL dimension and a self-concept dimension. The relationship between social background and mathematics achievement was only weakly mediated by OTL, when effect of students' self-concept was controlled for. Our results suggest that the previous research finding that schooling perpetuates social gaps in mathematics performance suffers from a construct validity problem.
The financing system of Brazilian education as instrument for the deepening social inequality;Education and its financing, fundamental to the development of a people, presents itself as a complex theme whose difficulties are seemingly insurmountable in our country. The present article aims to analyze the current constitutional federative arrangement of cooperative funding of the fundamental right to education, its relevance to the country's development and recovery from the current fiscal crisis, as well as to what extent educational financing has impacted inequality. In this perspective, the constitutional conformation of education will be evaluated, the ADCTs that directly affect the theme and the information related to educational inequality. The data and analyzes, components of a larger research, were extracted from the Brazilian Basic Education Yearbook 2017, the Education at a Glance 2017 report and the Brazilian-OXFAN inequalities report. The information linked to education shows a contradiction between the spirit of the Constitution and the national reality, where Brazil occupies the uncomfortable setting of the tenth most unequal country in the world.
The Music Education Crisis as a Consequence of Educational Institution Decay;The educational institution suffers a crisis due to diverse elements are casting of doubt essential principles of equity and quality. This study aims to review the values' string in educational institution, which encompasses from the Supranational agencies to school, according to music education perspective. The method is framed to qualitative design, according to grounded theory, which is centred on the Constant Comparative Method. The results show that educational institution decay is replicated on music education and, the most serious, the socio-educational inequality arises during curriculum design. In conclusion, sociomusical approach makes possible the crisis overcoming, since it recognises complexity of the cultural world by promoting a systematic interaction between the educational institution and the rest of social groups in the world.
Educational inequality in Tasmania: evidence and explanations;In this article, we map the extent of educational inequality within Tasmania, and between Tasmania and the rest of Australia, using National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) and senior secondary attainment data. This analysis yields some surprising findings, showing the success of Tasmanian primary and high schools and that Tasmanian educational inequality is most strongly expressed at the senior secondary level. We conclude that using such publicly available data to identify differential achievement within and between jurisdictions would strengthen public policy and practitioner interventions aimed at achieving more equal educational outcomes for students in all schools. Our findings also have implications for research directions in this field, suggesting that by analysis of NAPLAN and My School data across individual schools and jurisdictions academic researchers could assist practitioners gain a deeper understanding of inequalities reproduced by the systems they are working within, while finding examples of schools and systems which show a greater level of success in ameliorating disadvantage.
Growing Wealth Gaps in Education;Prior research on trends in educational inequality has focused chiefly on changing gaps in educational attainment by family income or parental occupation. In contrast, this contribution provides the first assessment of trends in educational attainment by family wealth and suggests that we should be at least as concerned about growing wealth gaps in education. Despite overall growth in educational attainment and some signs of decreasing wealth gaps in high school attainment and college access, I find a large and rapidly increasing wealth gap in college attainment between cohorts born in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. This growing wealth gap in higher educational attainment co-occurred with a rise in inequality in children's wealth backgrounds, although the analyses also suggest that the latter does not fully account for the former. Nevertheless, the results reported here raise concerns about the distribution of educational opportunity among today's children who grow up in a context of particularly extreme wealth inequality.
Naturally Occurring Mentorship in a National Sample of First-Generation College Goers: A Promising Portal for Academic and Developmental Success;"Attending college is increasingly important to compete in this global world; however, young people whose parents did not attend college are significantly less likely to enroll in and finish college. Formal programs to support first-generation college goers are common, but not scalable to provide support to all young people who need it. Instead, mentoring that naturally occurs on these students' journeys into and out of college may be a more practical avenue for supporting their success. This study investigated the role community members, relatives, and educators play in first-generation college goers' educational outcomes. Data from 4,181 participants of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Adult Health were used to test differences in supports received between first-generation, continuing-generation, and non-college goers. Results demonstrated that mentorship in adolescence moderated the relationship between parental college attendance and educational attainment in adulthood. Next, findings suggested that first-generation students received less support for identity development from their mentors than continuing-generation students. This study has program implications for facilitating college attendance and fostering the development and success of first-generation students. Moreover, this project continues to concretize an emerging taxonomy of mentoring functions for youth and emerging adults."
Dare to Dream: A Vignette Survey on Self-Selection in Secondary Education Track Choice;This article investigates applications to schools on the highest secondary track in Hungary (grammar schools). In Hungary, primary school pupils can apply to any secondary school. Pupils' primary school grades play a crucial role only in the admissions procedure, and the exact cut-off point for admission is not known at the time of application. Pupils, however, might adjust their preferences according to their school grades and thus may not apply to schools on their preferred track. Dealing with the endogeneity of pupils' preferences, the article applies an experimental vignette study. The respondents are primary school pupils who will shortly be applying to secondary schools. They assess the likelihood of a hypothetical pupil (described in the vignette) applying to schools on the highest track. The characteristics of the vignette-person' (such as his or her grades and preferences) are randomly allocated, and thus preferences are exogenous to grades. The results show no interaction between preferences and grades, which means that a clearly positive preference for grammar school does not compensate for poor grades. This may lead to self-selection, if pupils with a clearly positive preference for grammar school but poor primary school grades do not apply to their preferred secondary track. Since admission cut-off points are not known ahead of application, ignorance of the schools' requirements is assumed to lie behind this self-selection. The article discusses the implications of the findings and suggests that schools should provide transparent information for applicants about the grades of pupils who have been admitted to those schools in the past.
The institutional conditions of inequality in credential and skill attainment and their impact on occupational placement;This study comparatively analyses inequalities in educational outcomes as well as education effects on the occupational status of prime-age workers across 21 countries. Considering two distinct aspects of educational outcomes-credentials and measured worker skills-the study's main role is to assess their partial effects on occupational placement, contingent on social origin. Overall, parental education effects on educational achievement in terms of both credentials and skills are large. Likewise, occupational status is strongly associated with educational certificate attained. Labor market placement based on worker skills is significant as well, but to a lesser extent. The individual-level path dependencies of origin-education and education-destination vary considerably across countries. In part, this variation is associated with a country's skills formation system in terms of vocational specialization and the degree of economic coordination as measured by bargaining coordination. In line with prior research, vocational specificity relates to increased educational inequality. In addition, the study finds that economic coordination mitigates educational inequality as it reduces the inter-generational transmission of certificates and skills. In systems in which vocational specificity is accompanied by a high degree of coordination, the detrimental inequality effect of vocational specificity tends to level off. Moreover, economic coordination facilitates occupational placement based on worker skills. A concise discussion of the policy implications concludes this paper.
Religiosity as a bridge or barrier to immigrant children's educational achievement?;"Immigrant children in Europe remain in a position of educational disadvantage. Most studies underscore the role of the parents' education level and their socio-economic status in the educational achievement of their children. This paper adds to the literature by exploring other factors that reduce or contribute to educational inequality among immigrant children. Using research from the United States as a reference point, we specifically examine religiosity as a device for social mobility. Religiosity may be conducive to educational attainment in two ways: (1) religious organizations may provide guidance, support and beneficial social norms that foster the formation of social capital and sanction deviant behaviour; (2) religious participation may induce an internal locus of control that encourages students to focus on learning and resist counterproductive peer influence. Other scholars argue that ethno-religious in-group ties can be a mobility trap when human capital and socio-economic status in an immigrant community is low. Using the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we take a cross-sectional perspective to test these arguments for Christian and Muslim students of immigrant origin living in Germany. Our analyses reveal that religiosity is primarily relevant for Muslims' mathematical test performance. We find that students and parents' religiosity are not necessarily a barrier to good mathematical test performance. Yet our multidimensional measure of religiosity consisting of religious engagement, praying and subjective religiosity allows us to uncover distinct relationships depending on the form of religiosity. Christians' and Muslims' frequency of praying is positively linked to academic performance. Self-rated religiosity, however, is correlated with worse performance. Finally, we find that religious community engagement is related to better academic performance only when the share of co-ethnics in a residential area is low."
Nudging the Gap: Introduction to the Special Issue Closing in on Discipline Disproportionality;This special issue of School Psychology Review, entitled Closing in on Discipline Disproportionality, examined promising approaches and critical challenges to closing racial and ethnic gaps in schools' use of exclusionary and punitive discipline practices. In this introductory article, we briefly review the rationale and urgency for a focus on disproportionality in discipline and highlight some of the most salient findings from the five empirical studies in this special issue. We identify directions for the field going forward, with particular attention to measurement dilemmas and structural factors that shape differential disciplinary outcomes. Consistent with the National Association of School Psychologists' position statement, we emphasize the need to build the science of discipline disparities intervention through more systematic empirical research. Taken together, these new directions are intended to catalyze scientific rigor in the next generation of evidence-based interventions to close the discipline gap.
Women's political participation and gender gaps of education in China: 1950-1990;"Does women's political participation have long-lasting impacts on gender equality? Using female membership in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a measure for women's political participation and relying on data provided by Chinese county chronicles, we show that female political participation in 1950 had a long-term and positive impact on gender equality of education in 1990. Relying on individual-level data provided by the 1990 census, we construct a panel dataset comprising of people of different age cohorts in individual counties and find that contemporary women's political participation significantly narrows the gender gap by raising girls' probability of enrollment and completion of school relative to those of boys. The positive effects remain when we use the time of liberation, i.e., the time when the CCP got control of a county, to construct an instrument for the female party membership in 1950 and future periods. These effects also remain significant when the period of Cultural Revolution is studied. Finally, we test two channels, the policy channel and the perception channel, by which these effects were possibly exerted. For the policy channel, public spending on education is studied; and for the perception channel, parents' aspiration and investment for daughters' education are studied. The paper finds supporting evidence for the perception channel, but not for the policy channel. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Competition in the Family: Inequality between Siblings and the Intergenerational Transmission of Educational Advantage;Research on educational mobility is concerned with inequalities between families. Differences in innate abilities and parental responses lead, however, to educational differences between siblings. If parental responses vary by family socioeconomic background, within-family inequality can affect between-family inequality (i.e., educational mobility). This study uses data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) to test whether sibling similarity in education varies by family socioeconomic background. In addition, I test whether the effects of birth order, birth spacing, and maternal age on education vary by family background. Results show that sibling similarity in education is similar in low-and high-socioeconomic status families. The negative influences of a higher birth order and a younger maternal age on educational attainment, however, are concentrated in socioeconomically disadvantaged families. These findings suggest that socioeconomically advantaged families do not generally compensate for ability differences between their children but that they compensate for disadvantageous life events.
The Prison School: Educational Inequality and School Discipline in the Age of Mass Incarceration;
Education expansion and its effects on gender gaps in educational attainment and political knowledge in Taiwan from 1992 to 2012;This study investigates whether increasing the availability of education for women would minimize gender gaps in educational attainment and political knowledge in Taiwan. Seven waves of nationally representative survey data were analyzed to assess the effects of the national education expansion on gender equity in educational attainment and political knowledge. The empirical analysis in this study indicated that the extension of compulsory education and expansion of higher education in Taiwan offered more educational opportunities for women, especially those in the older cohorts, and substantially corrected the educational inequality between genders in the younger cohorts. Furthermore, the improvement in educational equality between genders diminished the gap in political knowledge among younger people in Taiwan.
The Prison School: Educational Inequality and School Discipline in the Age of Mass Incarceration;
Education and inequality: a meta-synthesis after the 50th anniversary of Coleman's report;"In 2016, the 50th anniversary of the publication of the so-called Coleman Report was celebrated. Under the title Inequality of Educational Opportunities, this report had a great impact on American society, research and educational policies. Its impact spread to other countries. In the year 2016 the publications that, commemorating the anniversary, took stock of their results to date. With the objective of obtaining an overview of all the contemplated, the present article presents a metathesis of 45 articles published in the year 2016 on the Coleman Report. There are six broad categories: a new framework for analyzing results; Changes in methodology; The social and political context; The socioeconomic conditions of the neighborhood and the community; Inequalities of ethnicity, social class and gender and, finally, the analysis of the actors involved: family, teachers and students. The synthesis of the 45 articles gives an overview and more complete the state of the matter."
Territorial and individual educational inequality: A Capability Approach analysis for Italy;This paper aims to investigate territorial and individual inequality in education according to Sen's Capability Approach that focuses on how public and private resources may be converted into educational attainments. We analysed the Italian case by constructing a new longitudinal dataset from 1993 to 2012 using repeated cross sections of the main social survey by the Italian Statistical Institute. We examined the educational divide between the Centre-North and the South using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and we estimated the Educational Kuznets Curve through a dynamic panel model. According to the results, the Southern educational gap is mainly influenced by the relative ineffectiveness of public expenditure in Southern Italy, where private economic wealth has a stronger educational impact. We verified Kuznets's hypothesis concerning the inverted U-shaped relationship between educational inequality and attainments. Moreover, individual educational inequality appears to be path dependent, positively linked to economic inequality and negatively influenced by educational public expenditure.
Educational inequality and achievement disparity: An empirical study of migrant children in China;The study examined academic disparity between migrant and local urban children and its associations with family socioeconomic status, parental involvement, and school settings using the survey data conducted in 2014 from a sample of children and their families in Beijing, China. The analytic sample (N = 687) included 431 migrant children and 256 local urban children. Structural Equations Models (SEM) were used to test research questions. Results suggest that migrant children, in particular, those in private migrant schools, have much poorer academic performance than their urban counterparts. This performance gap is mainly explained by different schools that migrant and local urban children attend (public vs. private migrant schools). Family socioeconomic status and parental involvement, while are positively associated with academic performance, do not remove the disparity between migrant children in private migrant schools and local urban children. When school satisfaction is included in analyses as a proxy of school quality, the difference in academic performance between two groups becomes insignificant. The study sheds light on the potential pathway that institutional inequality in education affects migrant students' educational achievement through the quality of educational services and financial, human, and social investment. Findings suggest that, to address academic disparity between migrant and local urban children in China, it is important to change the institutional inequality faced by migrant children.
School Strictness and Education: Investigating Racial and Ethnic Educational Inequalities Associated with Being Pushed Out;"There are racial and ethnic disparities associated with school discipline practices and pushout rates. In addition, research suggests that urban schools have stricter school discipline practices and higher pushout rates. What remains unknown, however, is the relationship between racial and ethnic inequality, school discipline practices, and pushout rates across urban, rural, and suburban schools. Therefore, this study draws from the Texas Education Agency's (TEA) Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS) to address two questions about the relationship between racial and ethnic inequality, school punishment practices, and academic progress that remain unanswered by the previous literature. First, is the relationship between stringent or lenient discipline practices and pushout rates similar in urban, rural, and suburban school contexts? Second, is the relationship between stringent or lenient discipline practices in urban, rural, and suburban contexts associated with racial and ethnic differences in pushout rates? This study seeks to contribute to racial and ethnic educational inequality research by investigating if there is a relationship between school discipline practices and pushout rates and establishing if there are racial and ethnic differences in urban, rural, and suburban contexts. Findings indicate that there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in pushout rates across all school contexts, particularly for Black/African American and Latina/o American students. Findings indicate that both stringent and lenient school punishment practices have effects on pushout rates; however, there are important and distinctive nuances that are presented and examined."
Getting to the genetic and environmental roots of educational inequality;"Pavlovian aversive conditioning is a fundamental form of learning helping organisms survive in their environment. Previous research has suggested that organisms are prepared to preferentially learn to fear stimuli that have posed threats to survival across evolution. Here, we examined whether enhanced Pavlovian aversive conditioning can occur to stimuli that are relevant to the organism's concerns beyond biological and evolutionary considerations, and whether such preferential learning is modulated by inter-individual differences in affect and motivation. Seventy-two human participants performed a spatial cueing task where the goal-relevance of initially neutral stimuli was experimentally manipulated. They subsequently underwent a differential Pavlovian aversive conditioning paradigm, in which the goal-relevant and goal-irrelevant stimuli served as conditioned stimuli. Skin conductance response was recorded as an index of the conditioned response and participants' achievement motivation was measured to examine its impact thereon. Results show that achievement motivation modulated Pavlovian aversive learning to goal-relevant vs. goal-irrelevant stimuli. Participants with high achievement motivation more readily acquired a conditioned response to goal-relevant compared with goal-irrelevant stimuli than did participants with lower achievement motivation. However, no difference was found between goal-relevant and goal-irrelevant stimuli during extinction. These findings suggest that stimuli that are detected as relevant to the organism can induce facilitated Pavlovian aversive conditioning even though they hold no inherent threat value and no biological evolutionary significance, and that the occurrence of such learning bias is critically dependent on inter-individual differences in the organism's concerns, such as achievement motivation. npj Science of Learning (2019)4:4; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-019-0043-3"
Accountability as a Design for Teacher Learning: Sensemaking About Mathematics and Equity in the NCLB Era;Using a learning design perspective on No Child Left Behind (NCLB), I examine how accountability policy shaped urban educators' instructional sensemaking. Focusing on the role of policy-rooted classifications, I examine conversations from a middle school mathematics teacher team as a best case because they worked diligently to comply with the NCLB. Using discourse analysis, I identify instances of torque in their conversations: when educators' compliance with accountability logics pulled them away from humanistic goals of education in ways that stood to exacerbate existing educational inequality. This article contributes to documentation on unintended consequences of accountability policies while identifying features that contribute to torque.
Educational inequality across three generations in Australia;"The transfer of advantage and disadvantage across multiple generations is receiving increasing attention in the international literature; however, transfers of resources across multiple generations in Australian families are less well understood. Using a longitudinal dataset of Australian children, we have the opportunity to not only investigate the transfer of educational resources across three generations in Australia, but also investigate the gendered nature of these transfers, which has been a limitation of other studies. We find no evidence of individual grandparent education effects on numeracy and reading scores for grandchildren in Year 3, independent of parent educational attainment and other covariates. However, significant effects on numeracy and reading scores were observed for children in families where both the grandmother and grandfather in maternal and paternal grandparent sets had high educational attainment (a diploma or university qualification), and where either or both the mother and father had a university qualification. These results suggest that the contribution of grandparents to the academic achievement of grandchildren cannot be fully explained by the parent generation and that the concentration of human capital in families contributes to educational inequalities across multiple generations that can be observed by eight years of age."
Neighborhood, race and educational inequality;Education is critical to poverty reduction and upward mobility, and rising education inequality has drawn broad concern in the United States. However, the role of neighborhood context in education remains under-studied. This paper integrates the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, spatial filtering regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to explore determinants of student performance in Salt Lake County, and better understand the underlying causes. Path analysis is used to examine the interactions among school performance, student background, and neighborhood environments. We find that over 60% of the variation in student performance can be explained by school resource, student background and neighborhood environments using OLS and spatial filtering regressions. The GWR model further reveals that student performance in the eastern region with a higher percentage of whites, higher household income and higher education levels, is more sensitive to the neighborhood environment than in poorer and more diversified northwestern regions. Finally, path analysis finds that household income and population density influence student performance indirectly by attracting more whites to the neighborhoods. These findings confirm the significance of neighborhood context in students' academic performance, and the importance of integrating GIS spatial analysis tools into studying education inequality.
The Prison School: Educational Inequality and School Discipline in the Age of Mass Incarceration;
Higher Education and Urban Migration for Community Resilience: Indigenous Amazonian Youth Promoting Place-Based Livelihoods and Identities in Peru;This paper offers an ethnographic analysis of indigenous Peruvian Amazonian youth pursuing higher education through urban migration to contribute to the resilience of their communities, place-based livelihoods, and indigenous Amazonian identities. Youth and their communities promoted education and migration as powerful tools in the context of educational inequality, racial discrimination, and threats to their communities' ways of life from colonization and natural resource extraction.
Public transport and school location impacts on educational inequalities: Insights from Sao Paulo;In many large Latin American urban areas such as the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR), growing social and economic inequalities are embedded through high spatial inequality in the provision of state schools and affordable public transport to these schools. This paper sheds light on the transport-education inequality nexus with reference to school accessibility by public transport in the SPMR. To assess school accessibility, we develop an accessibility index which combines information on the spatial distribution of adolescents, the location of existing schools, and the public transport provision serving the school catchment area into a single measure. The index is used to measure school accessibility locally across 633 areas within the SPMR. We use the index to simulate the impact of a policy aiming at increasing the centralisation of public secondary education provision, and find that it negatively affects public transport accessibility for students with the lowest levels of accessibility. These results illustrate how existing inequalities can be amplified by variable accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. The research suggests that educational inequality impacts of school agglomeration policies should be considered before centralisation takes place.
Literacy skills gaps: A cross-level analysis on international and intergenerational variations;The global agenda for sustainable development has centred lifelong learning on UNESCO's Education 2030 Framework for Action. The study described in this article aimed to examine international and intergenerational variations in literacy skills gaps within the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For this purpose, the author examined the trend of literacy gaps in different countries using multilevel and multisource data from the OECD's Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning survey data from the third edition of the Global Report on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE III). In this article, particular attention is paid to exploring the specific effects of education systems on literacy skills gaps among different age groups. Key findings of this study indicate substantial intergenerational literacy gaps within countries as well as different patterns of literacy gaps across countries. Young generations generally outscore older adults in literacy skills, but feature bigger gaps when examined by gender and social origin. In addition, this study finds an interesting tendency for young generations to benefit from a system of Recognition, Validation and Accreditation (RVA) in closing literacy gaps by formal schooling at country level. This implies the potential of an RVA system for tackling educational inequality in initial schooling. The article concludes with suggestions for integrating literacy skills as a foundation of lifelong learning into national RVA frameworks and mechanisms at system level.
Educational inequality in cardiovascular diseases: a sibling approach;Aims: Educational inequality in diseases in the circulatory system (here termed cardiovascular disease) is well documented but may be confounded by early life factors. The aim of this observational study was to examine whether the associations between education and all cardiovascular diseases, ischaemic heart disease and stroke, respectively, were explained by family factors shared by siblings. Methods: The study population included all individuals born in Denmark between 1950 and 1979 who had at least one full sibling born in the same period. Using Cox regression, data were analysed in conventional cohort and within-sibship analyses in which the association was examined within siblings discordant on education. Assuming that attenuation of associations in the within-sibship as compared with the cohort analyses would indicate confounding from factors shared within families. Results: A lower educational status was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease and stroke. All associations attenuated in the within-sibship analyses, in particular in the analyses on ischaemic heart disease before age 45 years. For instance, in the cohort analyses, the hazard rate of ischaemic heart disease among women less than 45 years who had a primary school education was 94% (hazard ratio 1.94 (1.78-2.12) higher than among those with a vocational education, while it attenuated to 51% (hazard ratio 1.51 (1.34-1.71)) in the within-sibship analysis. Conclusions: Confounding from factors shared by siblings explained the associations between education and the cardiovascular disease outcomes but to varying degrees. This should be taken into account when planning interventions aimed at reducing educational inequalities in the development of cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease and stroke.
Joint effect of education and age at childbirth on the risk of caesarean delivery: findings from Germany 2008-2015;Objectives: This article aims at assessing the joint effect of maternal age and education on the risk of having a caesarean delivery. As high maternal education is often associated with lower caesarean-birth rates, but high-educated women tend to postpone motherhood, these effects may offset each other in traditional analyses. Study design: Secondary analysis of the data from the German Family Panel pairfam. Methods: The interview-based data refer to 1020 births between 2008 and 2015. We analyse only reports from mothers and calculate logistic regression models. Results: The caesarean delivery rate differs strongly between education levels, and low educated women are at higher risk of having a caesarean delivery when controlling for parity and age. A positive age gradient is found, indicating a higher risk of caesarean section for older mothers. Without controlling for age, the association of education and caesarean section risk is weaker, i.e., effects of age and education partially level each other out. A model including an interaction term between age and education confirms this result. Conclusions: The risk of having a caesarean delivery does not differ between levels of education when maternal age is not taken into account. Lower maternal education and higher age are both positively associated with the risk of experiencing a caesarean section in Germany. However, as higher educated women tend to have their children later, effects of education and age weigh each other out. Preventive campaigns should target women with lower education and raise women's awareness on the risks associated with late motherhood. (C) 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health.

Suburban Black Lives Matter;This article explores the range of experiences and meanings of Black life in suburban space. Drawing from educational, historical, and sociological literatures, I argue that an underconsideration of suburban space has left many portraits of educational inequality incomplete. The article outlines the emergence of American suburbs and the formation of the city suburb divide which governs much framing of educational inequality and why this frame has limited thinking about what suburbs are and who lies within them. I follow with a discussion of the contemporary state of the suburbs which are now often more racially, ethnically, and economically diverse than their proximal central cities. There are a variety of suburb types, and this article explores three: majority-minority suburbs, exclusive enclaves, and gateway communities. Each suburb type leads to unique challenges such as demographic mismatch between leadership and school population to considering how ethnicity and race interact with Afro-Latino communities. A discussion of how racialized poverty in suburbia shapes the school and social experiences of Black youth is offered. The article closes with the consideration of the directions researchers should consider and areas of policy that are ripe for reengagement given the diversity of Black experiences in suburban schools.
Staying Close or Going Away: How Distance to College Impacts the Educational Attainment and Academic Performance of First-generation College Students;It is widely documented that first-generation college students attain bachelor's degrees at lower rates than their peers. First-generation students also consistently prioritize distance to college in their school decision-making process. How distance impacts their educational performance, however, is an issue that has not received sufficient research attention. This study uses the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) to investigate whether the distance between the permanent residence of first-generation students enrolled in four-year degree programs and their attending college impacts their educational attainment and grade point average (GPA). We find that first-generation students who attend colleges at a greater distance from home are more likely to graduate from college with a bachelor's degree. We do not find strong support for the relationship between distance and a student's GPA in most years of enrollment. We discuss the way college accessibility reinforces inequality within higher education along with the theoretical implications of our findings.
Counteracting Victimization in Unequal Educational Contexts: Latin American Migrants' Friendship Dynamics in Chilean Schools;"This article addresses the role of friendship dynamics among newcomer Latin American migrant youth during their transitions to Chilean secondary schools. Drawing on qualitative life history interviews, we discuss ethnic minority well-being in two high-ethnic mix schools, and how power inequalities and racial discrimination are managed through social capital in the courtyard. In particular, we demonstrate the importance of ethnic diversity for counteracting victimization. We found few instances of internal segregation (homogenous or bonding forms of friendship groups); instead cross-ethnic friendships were more common, enabling participants to navigate gendered and class-based cleavages within the schools. Although concentrations of ethnic students in low-quality municipal schools represent deeper social justice issues, the research argues for the need to move beyond dichotomized notions of integration and segregation. Creating greater equity in these spaces, we suggest, does not depend on ethnic mix, but on the opportunities to develop social capital support."
Social origin and structured doctoral education: Which influence do they exert on performance during the doctoral phase?;The paper addresses the impact of the parental socio-economic status (SES) on the performances during the conferral of a doctorate in life sciences (medicine and biology). Further, it investigates the question how structured doctoral programs affect this relation. A standardized survey of life science doctorates showed that SES solely had minor effects on the performances. However, occupations linked to the graduation, e.g. being a research assistant or having a scholarship, are very important for a better performance. The participation in a structured doctoral program neither affects the performance, nor has it a moderating effect on the relationship between SES and performance.
The Transition from Lower Secondary Education to Upper Secondary Education - an Opening-up or Closing-down of Educational Opportunities?;Efforts to break the link between the school type attended and the qualification awarded are seen as an important step to greater transparency in Germany's multi-track school system. However, the effects of these efforts on individual educational biographies and whether these efforts achieve better individual upward mobility through education are aspects than remain unclear. To address these issues, this article presents some of the key findings of a biographical longitudinal study that investigated educational climbers from the low-level-school type Hauptschule to upper secondary education in general and vocational gymnasium schools. The findings show that from the perspective of the students, the transition from lower secondary education to upper secondary education with a general and vocational university admissions certificate is difficult to realize and linked with very difficult experiences of degradation and high biographical costs of the educational success.
Made-to-measure learning paths for school dropouts. Current approaches considered from Kohnstamm's vision;Kohnstamm paid special attention to unemployed young people, a vulnerable group currently described as school dropouts. He applied his ideas about learning and development to projects for these youngsters in the 1930s. An individual rather than a classical approach typified his programmes for this group. With made-to-measure education Kohnstamm wanted to give these young adults, who had been unable to develop in initial education, another chance to gain a qualification. In this article we outline how the policy concerning school dropout has developed since then. We then look at research and the development of theory on this problem, its causes and how it can be prevented. Lastly we focus on the design and effect of a recently implemented programme and relate the developments to Kohnstamm's vision.
Coresidence in the Transition to Adulthood: The Case of the United States, Germany, Taiwan, and Mainland China;This paper compares the prevalence and age-specific changes of coresidence patterns, by means of a classification of 12 coresidence types, for the age range from 16 to 30 in the United States (US), Germany ( GE), Taiwan (TW), and mainland China ( CN). Panel data were used in separate nested logistic regression models to estimate transitions in coresidence for individuals in each society in the transition to adulthood. On the first level, decisions to move from different types of family-of-origin-households were modeled, depending on intergenerational solidarity and parental resources. On the second level, target household types were modeled, depending on others' trajectory events and their interaction with gender. The analysis used the National Longitudinal Study of Youth ( NLS Y97) from the United States, the German Family Panel (pairfam), the Taiwanese Youth Project (TYP), and the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Age-specific coresidence patterns were pooled and transitions probabilities were estimated for a two-year period. The systematic comparative approach makes it possible to correct misinterpretations based on analyses from single societies. Our results demonstrated that differences in coresidence patterns within the patrilineal, collectivistic societies ( CN and TW), and within the bilineal, individualistic societies (US and GE) were as important as the differences between these two groups of societies.
The Economic Costs of Educational Inequality in Developing Countries;This paper demonstrates that education can be an effective policy instrument to mitigate economic inequality among marginalized gender and identity groups in developing countries. We characterize the disparities in economic opportunity between gender, identity (ethnic or religious), and gender-by-identity groups in relation to disparities in educational attainment. We employ a Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to determine the extent to which these gaps are attributable to education inequality. The analysis covers 18 countries from Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Sub Saharan Africa. We show that about half of the identity group disparities are explained by gaps in education and only about 15-17% of the gender employment and wage gap. However, on aggregate, eliminating identity group and gender education disparities, relative to the most advantaged, yield substantial increases in the total number of salaried workers and in the total wage bill.
Measuring (In) Equality in Education;Educational inequality is a key factor leading to future social and economic inequality, suppressing social mobility and accelerating the trend of future poverty. The consequences of educational inequality are key issues in many social and economic aspects, and therefore, highlight the importance of our research. The objective of this research is threefold. First, this research conceptualizes an innovative framework for measuring educational inequality. Second, trends in educational inequality are measured over time, using Israel as a case study. Israel constitutes an interesting case study, given its educational achievement distribution characterized by large disparities in comparison with other OECD countries. Third, the underlying origins of inequality in education are analyzed, based on an educational equality index developed in this chapter. A nationwide, unique database of students was especially developed for this research by the Ministry of Education. The data consists of student background characteristics (e.g., parental education), student learning data (e.g., educational choice of program), and student achievement (e.g., achievement in mathematics matriculation exam) throughout the decade 2001-2011. The research method is based on a Logistic-Regression model enabling the identification of the sources of inequality. The findings of this study indicate that student background characteristics, ethnicity, parental education, gender, and the number of siblings are related to the achievement gap. This work is useful for policymakers around the world who may use the index developed to measure inequality in education and the extent to which equal opportunities in education exist in their country.
Japanese Public Education: A Comparative Perspective of Attitudes Toward Educational Inequality;"This chapter examines Japanese people's attitude toward an educational policy for socially disadvantaged students in order to consider the reasons for the low public spending on education in Japan. Although 1.5% of the country's total GDP is spent on tertiary educational institutions, which is equivalent to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average, it is the lowest among the OECD countries. Thus, the total expenditure on tertiary education is sustained with the help of large private educational funds. Since educational financial issues are associated with people's attitude toward educational policies, this chapter analyzed the data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) by adopting a comparative perspective and specifically focusing on Japan. The results indicated that people with relatively higher socioeconomic status were less likely to recognize inequality in advancing to university; this trend became stronger as public spending on tertiary education increased. In Japan, the trend of socioeconomic background effects was generally in accordance with the comparative analysis. However, there may be a conflict between generations because of the small governmental financial resource in Japan."
Inequality in top performance: an examination of cross-country variation in excellence gaps across different levels of parental socioeconomic status;This article examines the extent to which parental socioeconomic status (SES) affects the likelihood of a child becoming a top-performing student, offering an international perspective by reporting this relationship in 31 developed countries. The impact of 3 important educational system characteristics (differentiation in terms of early tracking, standardisation, and private schooling) on the relationship between parental SES and top performance was determined. We employed multilevel logistic regression models on data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 (N=216,980) to reveal that children with low parental SES have a lower probability of becoming a top-performing student than those with high parental SES, although this association differs between countries. The negative relationship between a disadvantaged parental background and top performance was not affected by the educational system characteristics under investigation.
Fighting words as revolutionary pedagogy: a Freirean reading of young people's experiences of a socially-engaged creative writing centre;The present climate of standardisation and quantification compels schools to deliver outcome-based curricula that measure educational success in terms of academic attainment and students' ability' to perform according to set criteria. Efforts to tackle educational inequality encourage conformity rather than address the underlying issues of the varied economic, cultural and social capital of diverse populations. Drawing on Paulo Freire's theory of critical pedagogy, this paper examines the impact of a Freirean-inspired Dublin-based participatory arts initiative on youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in Ireland. Focusing on the Freirean concepts of dialogue, democratic relations, voice, creativity and imagination, the authors present a case study of Fighting Words Creative Writing Centre, a socially-engaged participatory arts organisation currently operating in the non-formal education sector in Ireland. The research, a qualitative study conducted over a 12-month period, presents data gathered from participants and other key stakeholders through interviews and questionnaires. The findings indicate that participants in Fighting Words demonstrate increased levels of engagement and motivation, improved confidence and self-esteem, recognition of and pride in creative ability, a stronger sense of self, a greater ability to work collaboratively, and improved literacy.
Differences in General Education in Vocational and High Schools: Characteristics of Teachers and Teaching Practices in Mathematics;Every year, more and more middle school graduates opt for vocational high schools. They are normally less academically successful students from lower economic and cultural backgrounds. Still, the vocational education system must provide the chance to have a quality high school education to anyone who follows this track after the ninth grade. The article uses findings of the Trajectories in Education and Careers longitudinal study to compare the key conditions of obtaining a mathematics education in high schools, i.e. the professional and demographic characteristics of vocational and academic high school teachers and their teaching practices. The comparison reveals an inequality in students' access to educational resources depending on the chosen trajectory. The differences revealed are related to the institutional characteristics of the two tracks and make it possible to say that those tracks offer high school education of different types.
Height, education and nutritional inequality in Extremadura since the mid-nineteenth century;"Objective: it is intended to know the historical evolution of adult height in Extremadura and deepen, from it, in the footprint of nutritional inequality, especially that linked to education. Methods: the military documentation conserved in 32 municipalities of Extremadura for the population born between 1857 and 1957 (recruited between 1878 and 1978) is used and, with it, an annual series of statures is elaborated that, besides being standardized and disaggregated according to the level of literacy, is subjected to two dispersion tests: coefficient of variation and Gini coefficient. Results: a sustained growth of the net nutritional state, interrupted only by the agrarian crises of the last decades of the XIX century and by the inflation unleashed as a result of the First World War, is observed; the difficulty of perceiving the incidence of the Civil War and the post-war period without taking into account the gains in nutrition achieved subsequently is noted; it is also noted the inability of statistical dispersion to capture the true face of nutritional inequality, which is, however, remarked through the gap that is detected between the literate and non-literate population. Conclusion: the expansion of adult height in Extremadura is interpreted as a test of the economic and social modernization of the region, especially of the culmination of the nutritional transition, at the same time as the suitability of literacy is verified to know not only the dynamics of educational inequality, but also the evolution and the degree of intensification of nutritional inequality."
CULTURAL CAPITAL AND EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN CROATIA, GERMANY AND DENMARK: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PISA 2009 DATA;"Starting from Bourdieu's theory of cultural and social reproduction, the paper seeks to examine the relationship between socioeconomic background, cultural capital and academic achievement in three national educational systems: Croatian, German and Danish. Me analyses are based on PISA 2009 survey data (N(C)=4 994; N(G) =4 979; N(D) =5 924). Regression analyses were performed in order to examine the effects of students ' socioeconomic background on their scientific literacy, the mediation of this relationship by cultural capital, and the effects of cultural capital for students of lower or higher socioeconomic status. The results indicate a positive correlation between students' socioeconomic status and scientific literacy in all three countries, with the correlation strength in German students 'sample being the highest. Cultural capital of students in all three countries mediates the effect of family's socioeconomic status on scientific literacy, although the mediator effects vary significantly between the Croatian, German and Danish students. Interaction effects of socioeconomic status and cultural capital are present in the German and Danish students 'samples, in which educational exclusion occurs primarily through embodied cultural dispositions."
The role of Intergenerational Relationships in Challenging Educational Inequality: Improving Participation of Working-Class Pupils in Higher Education;"Analysis of data on school leavers in the UK points to considerable inequality in access to higher education. This is particularly acute in Scotland where access to the most competitive courses remains extremely difficult for those young people who are first in their generation to try and enter university or from low-income households. Programs to address this issue have had varied approaches framed around policy ambitions to close the attainment gap or raise aspirations. However, research has argued that these approaches have largely conceptualized the problem at an individual rather than structural level (Cummings et al., 2012; Gorard, Beng, & Davies, 2012). The Intergenerational Mentoring Network is an ongoing research and development project which recruits retired professionals as volunteer mentors and matches them with 15-18 year old secondary school pupils from lower-income areas of the city. This paper draws from research within this project to demonstrate the difficulties these young people face surrounding their interaction with very different social and cultural worlds, of which they have limited understanding and very restricted access. The paper illuminates the crucial role that intergenerational relationships can play in supporting young people in their journey into higher education. These are roles that, collectively, are enabling more young people to move into university and professional careers and through increasing social mobility are challenging inequality."
Positive Effects of Early Entrance to Preschool on Turkish Immigrant Children's German Language Acquisition:A Latent Change Analysis;"We employed a latent difference score approach to investigate the development of German language competencies among Turkish immigrant (n=85) and German children (n=89) in preschool. Language development was measured twice at the age of 57 and 68 months (T1 and T2 respectively; prachentwicklungstest fur drei- bis funfjabrige Kinder [SETK 3-5]; Grimm, 2001). We controlled for sociodemographic variables, children's cognitive abilities, language exposure at home, and ethnic class composition at preschool. Results revealed that immigrant children scored lower at both time points yet had a steeper increase when compared to non-immigrant children. We found no longitudinal association between children's participation in language support programs and their language development. Age of entrance to preschool moderated the growth in language competencies for immigrant children: Children who entered preschool at the age of 36 months or earlier showed a significant increase in performance and achieved T2 values about the lower limit of the German mean range, whereas children who entered preschool at the age of 37 months or later did not improve significantly over time. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of an early start into preschool for Turkish immigrant children."
Educational inequality in Rio de Janeiro and its impact on multimorbidity: evidence from the Pro-Saude study. A cross-sectional analysis;"BACKGROUND: Information about multimorbidity is scarce in developing countries. This study aimed to estimate the association of educational attainment with occurrences of multimorbidity in a population of public employees on university campuses in Rio de Janeiro. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted cross-sectional analyses on baseline data (1999-2001) from 3,253 participants in the Pro-Saude study, conducted in Brazil. METHODS: The prevalence of multimorbidity, defined as a self-reported history of medical diagnoses of two or more chronic conditions, was estimated according to sex, age, smoking, obesity and educational level. The association between education and multimorbidity was estimated using odds ratios (OR) and the relative and slope indices of inequality, in order to quantify the degree of educational inequality among individuals with multimorbidity in this population. RESULTS: Greater age, female sex, smoking and obesity had direct associations with multimorbidity; and tobacco exposure and obesity also showed direct relationships with poorer educational level. There was a monotonic inverse linear trend between educational level and the presence of multimorbidity among women, with twice the odds (OR 2.47; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.42-4.40) between extremities of schooling categories. There was excess multimorbidity of 22% at the lowest extremity of schooling, thus showing that women with worse educational status were more affected by the outcome. No trend and no excess multimorbidity was seen among men. CONCLUSIONS: Educational inequality is an important determinant for development of multimorbidity. Men and women experience its effect differently. Researchers need to consider that sex may be an effect modifier in multimorbidity studies."
Tackling inequality? Teacher effects and the socioeconomic gap in educational achievement. Evidence from Chile;Although teacher quality is usually signalled to be the most relevant school-level factor impacting students' learning, little is known about the relevance of teacher effects explaining educational inequality. By using a value-added model for a cohort of 10th graders, in this work we examine the socioeconomic gap in teacher effects across Chilean secondary schools, and its importance in explaining socioeconomic inequality in students' achievement in math and language. We found an important proportion of highly effective teachers in low-socioeconomic-status (SES) schools, but also much bigger variation in teacher effects across those schools. Variability in teacher effects decreases when moving towards higher SES schools, where there is also a smaller proportion of low-performing teachers. All in all, teacher effects have a levelling impact for students in low-SES schools when compared to those in middle SES schools, but no significant impact when compared to students in high-SES schools.
Development of Educational Inequalities in Political Participation in Czech Republic and Slovakia and their Implications for Representation of Attitudes;Citizen participation in the political process is a key tenet of democratic government. Using data from post-election surveys covering all post-communist elections and European Social Survey 20022014, this paper studies how political participation in the Czech Republic and Slovakia has been stratified based on educational attainment. Educational inequalities in turnout increased substantively in both countries and are currently much more pronounced than in established western democracies. Educational inequalities in non-electoral participation are greater than inequalities in turnout. University graduates participate significantly more often than people of lower educational attainment. In combination with significant differences in attitudes towards income redistribution, gender equality and immigration, unequal participation constitutes conditions for unequal political voice. Nevertheless, this paper shows that educational inequalities in political participation and differences in attitudes do not automatically translate into equally strong distortions in attitude representation.
Segregation effects on Australian Indigenous primary school achievement;Australia and its Indigenous peoples have experienced what one commentator has called a juxtaposition of first and third worlds, manifest, among other aspects, in lower levels of education achievement compared with other Australians. Specifically, profound levels of educational inequality have been observed for Aboriginal Australians because of the colonial experience, and this has resulted in on-going challenges in terms of their collective histories. This paper examines the interrelationship between Indigeneity and socioeconomic status (SES) in the primary school years, and analyzes the association between a school's location, levels of segregation, school SES and literacy and numeracy achievement. I argue that relatively high levels of school segregation and clustering structure and maintain Indigenous children's inequality in schooling outcomes in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Characteristics of low SES neighbourhoods and schools are examined, using 2011 Population Census and National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) data to assess the effect on reading and numeracy mean achievement levels of Year 5 students in schools across several states. Analyzes of the data demonstrate relationships between school socioeconomic composition and school segregation, and have important implications for Indigenous people in a majority of low SES communities.
THE INFLUENCE OF STANDARDIZED TESTING OF ENGLISH SUBJECT IN SECONDARY EDUCATION IN CHINA;The goal of this research is to point out the negative influence of standardized testing in secondary English education in China. It has been acknowledged that most educators hold a negative attitude towards standardized testing. This paper will focus the drawbacks from teacher's voice via literature review. Because of standardized testing, the quality of education is damaged, the pressure on teachers is huge and the educational inequality issue between urban and rural areas is becoming more serious. As one of the three main disciplines in China, English education is particular affected by standardized testing. English as a lingua franca is becoming more and more crucial in global stage, however, standardized testing of English discipline in China does not really improve students' English learning. This paper highlights main harmful weaknesses of standardized tests from the perspective of educational quality, stress and inequality, illuminates the interactions of these drawbacks and calls for a more effective and equal evaluation system. Also, as the most important standardized test which is paid attention by the whole Chinese society, The National College Entrance Examination will be mentioned often in this paper as an instance. Finally, suggestions and advices about how to educate students' English better on the condition of standardized testing are considered and proposed through insightful introspection and reflection in this paper. In this paper, literature review plays an important role. A lot of secondary sources from different countries are collected, contributing to this topic in a theoretical and methodological way. The objects considered for this study are students and teachers from several secondary schools in non-English speaking countries, especially China. They indicate their own opinions. Some of them support English standardized tests, some of them consider it as a 'killer' of students' learning quality. Both provide convincing argument. However, I take a stand against those who support English standardized tests and give amount of counter-arguments to refute them. The result is clear that standardized testing in English discipline is destructive for both teachers and students' development, especially for rural students. The unequal issue is also exposed and becoming worse because of standardized testing of English.
Educational inequality and transitions to university in Australia: aspirations, agency and constraints;This paper is based on research into the destinations and aspirations of school leavers in Australia. It investigates the relationship between the transition to university for different groups of students and their own and their parents' and teachers' expectations. It draws on Bourdieu, Boudon, Nussbaum and others to investigate the way young people construct their aspirations. It examines the limits of young people's agency, which is bound by their understanding of the hidden and informal rules that govern access to different spaces within the curriculum as well as access to post-school destinations. Navigating these transitions is becoming more important and more complex with the increasing emphasis on higher level qualifications in an education market.
Taking the Long View: Longitudinal Surveys and the Construction of Educational Inequality in America;
Types of Parental Involvement in Education, Socio-Economic Status of the Family and Students' Academic Results;The article gives an overview of the theoretical models of parental involvement in education. The peculiarities of parent involvement in Russian education are correlated with the typologies proposed by J. L. Epstein. Comparison typologies of parent involvement for different parents' socio-economic categories was carried out. Low-income families were especially identified. It is shown that despite the fact that children from the poorest families have lower than average educational outcomes, parent involvement promotes their increase in attainment. By increasing the level of involvement that parents have, the more leveled the difference in educational results becomes. Children from the poorest families are significantly less likely to plan go to university after school. At the same time the percentage of children planning to get into higher education considerably increases when parents are involved in their education. The higher the level of parent involvement, the greater the percentage of children oriented towards getting higher education. And the higher the level of parent involvement in education, the less the gap between the low income families and average values for the sample is.
Unequal at the college door: Career construction among freshmen at an elite Chinese university;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the inequality in career constructions among freshmen in an elite university in Shanghai, China. The authors first investigated whether rural students and those from municipalities (zhi xia shi) and provincial capitals differ in their career awareness when arriving at college. After finding the difference, the authors explored how this initial difference in career awareness evolves and influences the career construction process in the freshman year. Design/methodology/approach This study used a complementary mixed-methods approach to monitor a cohort of students' career construction process and the evolvement of their career awareness throughout the freshman year (n=210). Data collection included two surveys: students' self-reflections and in-depth interviews to capture a holistic story. Findings The findings revealed that students differed in career awareness when arriving at college. This initial difference further evolved in the first year of college: students from municipalities and provincial capitals considered college a part of their career paths and began timely to construct their careers, whereas students from rural areas lagged behind. This study suggests that college maintains inequality, reinforcing the initial gap in career construction based on students' family background. Originality/value College students differ in career prospects and associated skills when transitioning from school to work. Only a few studies have explored the role of college in shaping the career construction process during the college years. By exploring the process of career construction among freshmen, this study contributes to the growing literature on school-to-work transition and educational inequality in China.
Researching pedagogy in high poverty contexts: implications of non-representational ontology;The enduring nature of the problem of inequality in education suggests that new ways of understanding and ameliorating it are needed. Non-representational ontology is yielding new insights in other fields but is yet to gain traction in education. The requisite ontological shift would attend to inequality as a specific material effect of practices of knowing, rather than a social, natural, or discursive reality requiring representation. In this paper, we investigate the potential of such a shift to advance our fundamental commitment to social change through equity and justice. Drawing mainly upon the work of Karen Barad, we offer a reconceptualistion of educational inequality as a doing, not a thing, which becomes meaningful as it is defined by the circumstances required to measure it. We re-examine data collected during a recently completed longitudinal study of schools in the northern-rustbelt-suburbs of Adelaide, specifically the phenomenon of teaching literacy in the classrooms of two teachers in one school in our completed study.
The Prison School: Educational Inequality and School Discipline in the Age of Mass Incarceration;
Precarious Employment in the Regions of Russian Federation: Sociological Survey Results;This article presents the results of the study on precarious employment, which represents a multilevel phenomenon of the instability in the socio-economic positions of workers. This phenomenon has various forms. Precarious employment can be identified both in terms of the quality and nature of employment contract, working conditions, and in terms of the standard of living of households of precarious workers, their self-perception and behaviour models in labour market and other spheres of life. The purpose of the research is to study precarious employment using sociological indicators. We characterize precarious employment of workers, in general, and also define their profiles. Depending on the type of contractual relations and the implementation of their requirements, the profiles of employees differ in the socio-demographic, age, educational and economic characteristics. As a research method, we chose a mass survey. The sampling frame is the Russian population aged from 15 to 72 years. The selection included 1002 respondents, which were quoted by sex, age, region and socio-demographic status on the labour market. During the survey, we investigated the various aspects of precarious employment including respect for the rights of employees, level of their income, prevalence of various forms of precarious employment by profession, sex-age structure. The results of the study are the demographic, socio-labour and economic characteristics of the surveyed population as well as the description of five profiles identifying the different groups of precarious workers. The results may be applied in social-labour relations regulated by contractual agreements and working conditions of employees. Restrictions are connected with the need to change the legislation and the enforcement of the current labour and civil legislation. Future research should be focused on the reasons of the differentiation in precarious employment.
English Medium Instruction (EMI) as Linguistic Capital in Nepal: Promises and Realities;This article reports on a critical qualitative case study of an EMI-based, underresourced public school in Nepal through Bourdieu's lens of linguistic capital. As the data analysis revealed, parents, students, and teachers regarded EMI as a privileged form of linguistic capital for developing advanced English skills, enhancing educational achievements and access to higher education, and increasing the chance of upward social and economic mobility. In contrary to these rosy perceptions of EMI with overtly superficial promises, switching to EMI, without enough teacher preparation and infrastructure support in the school, had contributed to several unplanned negative outcomes, including a contested process of developing the English proficiency. Despite the school's claim of offering EMI education, Nepali was the actual language of instruction in the school due to teachers' lack of proficiency in English and the school's inadequate resources and preparedness for a shift to EMI. As a result, the students developed neither the content knowledge nor English language skills. Therefore, rather than being an educational equalizer, EMI has served to (re) produce linguistic marginalization and educational inequality and injustice for children from a lower socioeconomic status. We suggest critical reflection on EMI adoption and reenvision sustainable additive multilingualism in such contexts (Erling et al., 2016).
Denying systemic inequality in segregated Chilean schools: race-neutral discourses among administrative and teaching staff;This article addresses the educational context in which ethnically segregated high poverty schools operate in Chile, and the ways that inequalities within these establishments are understood by members of their administrative and teaching staff. In particular we draw attention to the unwillingness of the majority of these employees to name or recognize specific forms of institutional inequality. Following critical pedagogy literature we argue that the Chilean education system reproduces a fear of talk among teachers working in areas with high density indigenous populations, which obscures unequal social structures and opportunities for specific (class, gender, ethnic) groups in school contexts. Based on data from 12 interviews with school staff and observations from four schools in southern Chile, we analyze how intersecting inequality is discursively reduced by predominantly white teachers to individual deficit, de-politicized geographical problems of access to schooling, and the normalizing of low achievement across schools with students from similar backgrounds.
Early parenting and the reduction of educational inequality in childhood and adolescence;Socioeconomic status (SES) differences in parenting are often implicated in widening the SES-achievement gap. Using nationally representative data (N = 12,887), the author tested for variation across SES in the types and intensity of parenting behaviors utilized and then examined SES differences in the relationship between parenting and student achievement growth from kindergarten to Grade 8. Exploratory factor analysis identifies three dimensions of early parenting: Educational engagement, stimulating parent-child interaction, and discursive discipline. Regression results indicate that all three are used most heavily by high-SES families. However, only educational engagement consistently predicts achievement growth. Surprisingly, it is positively associated with achievement for lower-, but not higher-SES students in Grades 1-8. Further, educational engagement is beneficial for low-SES children because it is particularly beneficial for low-achieving students, consistent with a compensatory hypothesis.
INEQUALITY IN THE SCHOOL EDUCATION SYSTEM;The article discusses the issue of inequality in accessibility and quality of education, which is rightly considered to be one of the most significant and current in contemporary socio-political and pedagogical research. It reveals the deep connection between inequality, ontologically rooted in the foundations of society and the institutional nature of education. Various constraints and barriers on the way to obtaining a quality school education are outlined. The situation in Bulgaria is characterized, where educational inequality has become one of the persistent institutes in the post-communist period in the development of the country.
Distributional properties of the PIRLS-home resource for learning scale and observed effects on reading achievement: are measurements of educational inequalities by latent indices without bias?;In Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) educational inequalities are measured, amongst others, through the relationship between students' reading achievements and the home resource for learning (HRL) scale. By applying the partial credit model and using the WLE estimates for the person parameters it is accepted that the distribution of this latent variable is asymptotically normal within participating countries. This assumption is challenged from a theoretical perspective and through empirical findings. To find out how far the distributional properties of the HRL index influence the results of educational inequality measurements, the HRL index is rescaled for 21 European countries who participated in PIRLS 2011, assuming three different prior distributions of the latent index and using the EAP estimates for the person parameters. The predictive effects of these latent indices on students reading achievement were estimated with spline regressions. A positively skewed distribution of the latent index in the marginal maximum likelihood for estimating the item parameters results in the best fit of the scaling model in most countries. In addition, the pattern of signs of the estimated spline coefficients across the knots and the non-linear correlation between the latent index and student reading achievement varies considerably across the prior and empirical distributional properties of the latent index. Thus, by interpreting educational inequalities measured through the relationship between students' reading achievements and the HRL scale in PIRLS, distributional properties of the HRL index should be taken into account.
Configurations of multiple disparities in reading performance: longitudinal observations across France, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom;Research provides evidence that gender, immigrant background and socio-economic characteristics present multiple disadvantaging characteristics that change their relative importance and configurations over time. When evaluating inequalities researchers tend to focus on one particular aspect and often use composite measures when evaluating socio-economic characteristics. Neither can fully represent the complexity of students' various disadvantaging characteristics, which have autonomous associations with attainment and with each other. This paper investigates how the relative importance and configurations of different disadvantaging factors have changed over time to form educational inequalities and how these changes differ across countries. Data from five PISA cycles (2000-2012) for France, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom are used and configurations of gender, immigration background, parents' occupational and educational levels, and the number of books at home evaluated. Results enable us to relate changes (or lack thereof) in configurations of disadvantaging factors to recent reforms targeted at reducing educational inequality after the first PISA results.
Student employment: social differentials and field-specific developments in higher education;In this article, we examine social origin differences in employment patterns across different stages of higher education and compare these differences between vocational and academic fields of study. Using data from a large-scale German student survey, we study the development of inequality, according to social origins, in student employment from first-year to graduating students. We show that inequality in job quality exists and is partly attributable to the need for students from lower social origins to work in order to finance their studies. We hypothesise that initial inequalities decrease as students progress through higher education. While we find evidence for this hypothesis, we also show in multivariate models that the reduction of inequality in the student labour market is explained by prior differences between social origin groups.
How the right continues to do wrong by our young people: contemporary reflections on Michael Apple's analysis of the rightist turn in education;Michael Apple's 2005 article, Doing Things the 'Right' Way: Legitimating Educational Inequalities in Conservative Times, is a seminal piece of writing that highlights some of his core concerns with the effects of neo-liberal and neo-conservative ideologies on education. Since its publication, this article has incited much debate about the increasingly right-wing economic and political factors that have influenced educational policies during the last four decades. Apple's theories have been highly influential in shaping the research interests of those who work towards more socially just education systems. This paper reflects upon the degree to which things have actually changed since Apple's original article was published over a decade ago.
Departing from the beaten path: international schools in China as a response to discrimination and academic failure in the Chinese educational system;"International schools are commonly depicted in the academic literature and popular press as offering elite educational credentials to an elite, oftentimes international, student body. In this paper, I draw on a case study of a Canadian international school to argue that a new form of international school is emerging in China - one that offers a haven for domestic students from certain competitive and discriminatory features of the Chinese educational system. Fieldwork was conducted at a Canadian curriculum high school for Chinese citizens in Beijing. Most students at the school were internal migrants or children of China's new rich' entrepreneurial class; that is, their families had economic resources but occupied precarious social positions in contemporary Chinese society. Analyses reveal that the international school offers a pathway to obtain baseline academic credentials in the absence of other opportunities for progress in the Chinese educational system. Together with evidence of dramatic growth in international schools and tracks in China, this case study suggests the emergence of a new type of international education programme that departs from a picture of international education as elite' in terms of student body, academic environment, and expected educational trajectories of graduates. The paper also develops our understanding of class and educational strategies in contemporary China."
Working at a different level? Curriculum differentiation in Irish lower secondary education;Young people in Irish schools are required to choose whether to sit secondary exam subjects at higher or ordinary level. This paper draws on a mixed methods longitudinal study of students in 12 case-study schools to trace the factors influencing take-up of higher level subjects within lower secondary education. School organisation and process are found to shape the extent to which young people actually have a choice'. Streaming practices, which are more prevalent in schools serving socio-economically disadvantaged communities, constrain the degree of choice young people have over their subject levels, with those in lower stream classes usually allocated to ordinary level. Even where schools have mixed ability base classes, schools influence access to higher level subjects. In the middle-class and socially mixed schools, teachers are more likely to expect and encourage all students to take higher level. In contrast, in working-class schools there are sharp declines in the proportion taking higher level subjects as they approach the national exam taken at the end of lower secondary education. Early decisions about not pursuing higher level are found to have long-term consequences. The findings contribute to our understanding of how curriculum differentiation reinforces social class differences in educational pathways.
Does ethnic bias affect kindergarten teachers' school entry recommendations?;BackgroundEthnic educational inequality is present in almost all Western societies. One possible explanation for the persisting disadvantages of children from immigrant family backgrounds is discrimination. Individual ethnic discrimination has been reported in the form of ethnic bias in school teachers' evaluations and recommendations. Children of immigrant families tend to be disadvantaged with regard to both school teachers' evaluations of their competencies as well as to recommendations of further steps in their educational career.PurposeThe aim of this research paper is to analyse whether ethnic bias is also present at earlier stages of the educational career, in kindergarten teachers' recommendations. The study, conducted in Germany, investigated (a) whether kindergartens' recommendations of school entry (early, regular or delayed school entry) differed with respect to whether the child had a Turkish migration background or was a child of German origin and (b) whether these potential differences can be explained by children's individual skill levels and family background characteristics.Design, sample and methodsThe research was carried out from a quantitative secondary analysis, using data from the longitudinal project Preschool education and educational careers among migrant children', conducted in Germany since 2006. The sample consists of 742 children, with around half of the sample being children of Turkish origin and half being children of German origin, and their parents. Parents were interviewed and children's individual skills were tested using standardised instruments from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. The effect of Turkish origin on kindergarten teachers' school entry recommendations is analysed, controlling for children's social background, individual skills (non-verbal cognition, German language, mathematics) and children's social behaviour, using a stepwise multinomial logistic regression analysis.ResultsThe analysis indicated that, although kindergarten teachers' school entry recommendations differed according to a child's ethnic background, there was no ethnic bias evident. Children of Turkish origin were significantly less frequently recommended for early school entry than children of German origin and significantly more often for delayed school entry, but these differences vanished when the parents' educational level was controlled and disappeared when children's individual skills and social behaviour were additionally considered in the model.ConclusionsWe conclude that, in the sample studied, there was no ethnic bias in kindergarten teachers' school entry recommendations. The disadvantage of children of Turkish origin as compared to the children of German origin can be fully explained by differences in parental educational level and children's individual skills and social behaviour. The remaining effect of social background, however, should be studied further to clarify whether this effect captures other characteristics such as unobserved skills of the children and differences in parental engagement.
Neoliberal contradictions in two private niches of educational choice';"This article brings together ethnographies of two privileged educational settings in the United States - a private school in California's Central Valley following the progressivist Sudbury model, and an affluent New England boarding school's summer enrichment program. Each of these institutions serves as an alternative to and/or extension of publicly accessible education institutions during a neoliberal era of marketization and growing educational inequality. By comparing findings from ethnographic studies of each institution, we find that both celebrate open access and socially responsible pedagogical values in ways that obscure mechanisms of exclusion and an entrenched individualist ideology. We discuss two particular contradictions that manifest in both settings: first, a discourse of openness and inclusivity that belies the ways in which access is mediated by constructions of who best fits' the special learning community; and second, an outspoken allegiance to socially engaged values of diversity and democracy that belies the ways in which these values are commodified and appropriated for students' individual advantage(s). In comparing such sites, we argue for the importance of tracing the mechanisms of advantage in under-researched niches' of the dynamically shifting and unequally accessed neoliberal marketplace for educational opportunity."
The ability-track glass ceiling of Israeli schooling: lessons from a comparative analysis of Israeli and Australian PISA 2012 data;Israeli students ranked in the bottom third of the countries surveyed by PISA 2012 in mathematical literacy, while the gap between the highest and lowest scores was the second largest in the OECD. This paper explores which variables led to disparities in mathematical literacy between different socioeconomic levels and between Israeli Arabs and Jews as well as in comparison with Australian students. Different instructional approaches that are known in the literature to have a positive impact on students' achievement are not observed in the relationship between teachers and students in Israel. In Israel, schools contribute to the perpetuation of socioeconomically driven educational inequality by using tracks that are characterised by different teaching pedagogies and different content, with little or no upward mobility between tracks, leading to structural exclusion. By comparison, in Australia, ability tracking is less rigid and mathematical literacy far higher than in Israel. The policy implication is that either teachers must work differently in a track-based system to overcome the process of exclusion dictated by the structure itself or the system must reduce the use of tracking.
The Multidimensional Problems of Educational Inequality Require Multidimensional Solutions;
Electricity Supply, and Access to Water and Improved Sanitation as Determinants of Gender-Based Inequality in Educational Attainment in Africa;The central hypothesis of this study is that gender-based inequality in education in Africa depends to a significant degree on electricity supply, and access to water and improved sanitation. Gender-based educational inequality is operationalized in terms of the proportion of females to males within any given group of educated people. Three groups, people with basic literacy skills, people with primary education, and people with a secondary education, are considered. Logarithmically-transformed multiple regression analyses, with R-2 values ranging from .26 to .55, confirmed the central hypothesis in all but one instance. The instance concerns the hypothesized positive link between access to improved sanitation and females with a secondary education. An analysis of the data revealed this relationship as negative. This paradoxical revelation is explained as follows. Recent positive trends in African economies have occasioned improvements in sanitation that are unmatched by a corresponding increase in female secondary education. The confirmed positive link between access to basic services and female education is easy to explain. The availability of basic services facilitates execution of domestic chores hence, free up time for girls and women to pursue educational opportunities. The article's significance resides in its empirical validation of the following widely-held but hardly interrogated view. The progress of women in Africa is significantly retarded by the fact that they are overburdened by domestic chores.
THE EFFICIENCY OF EMERGING INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS ADDRESSING EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY AND STUDENTS' DROPOUT IN A ROMANIAN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION;The landscape of higher education is continuously changing - from an institution for elites a few decades ago to one addressing the masses nowadays. In the context of globalisation and the increasing internationalisation of higher education institutions (HEIs), certain aspects like equity have become an important factor when considering recruitment, motivation and retention of students. A strategic project addressed this issue in Romania and formulated in 2013 several recommendations for higher education institutions. However, few concrete interventions materialised since, and even fewer reached an impact assessment phase. In this context, our aim was to monitor and adjust further interventions based on a recent (2017) experience in addressing this educational inequality issue through an institutional-level project. The institution concerned is Babe.-Bolyai University, one of the largest in the country, and the one with the best overall performance in international rankings. The purpose of our paper is threefold. (i) First, we present the results of testing the robustness of the socio-economic predictors in identifying first year bachelor students' vulnerability to academic drop-out - in terms of targeted recruitment fitting two profiles at the same time: the one of university of proximity and also of university of prestige. (ii) Secondly, we will present the preliminary results of the efficiency of a 2017 government funded academic support program aiming to increase the ratio of academic success in the case of students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. (iii) Thirdly, we used correlational and multilinear regression analysis in order to explain the academic performance and possible dropout for the first assessment period of 2017-2018 academic year. The highest variance explained by the socio-demographic variable along with academic variables was 48%. The more important predictors of the academic performance were the background and social subsidizing. However, our results confirmed previous evidence in the literature that no direct link is obvious between some sociodemographic variables and the dropout but the impact of their interaction could be strong.
Long-Term Trends in Private School Enrollments by Family Income;We use data from multiple national surveys to describe trends in private elementary school enrollment by family income from 1968 to 2013. We find several important trends. First, the private school enrollment rate of middle-income families declined substantially over the past five decades while that of high-income families remained quite stable. Second, there are notable differences in private school enrollment trends by race/ethnicity, urbanicity, and region of the country. Although racial/ethnic differences in private school enrollment are to a large extent explained by income differences, the urban/suburban and regional differences in private school enrollment patterns are large even among families with similar incomes. Factors contributing to these patterns may include trends in income inequality, private school casts and availability, and the perceived relative quality of local schooling options.
Policies, skills and earnings: how educational inequality affects earnings inequality;We study the impact of dispersions in education (both in student test scores and final educational attainment) on earnings inequality, in a country-cohort design. Neo-classical economic theory would predict a positive association between skill inequality (as measured in student test scores) and earnings inequality, while educational attainment inequality adds little on top of skills inequality. A sociological theory of social closure, however, argues that inequality in educational attainment is more important than skills inequality in the prediction of earnings inequality. Using educational policies as instruments, we find causal effects of skills inequality and educational attainment inequality, suggesting that a simple human capital model is insufficient to explain rising earnings inequalities. Nevertheless, skills inequality appeared a more important predictor of earnings inequality than educational attainment inequality. Some educational policy reforms (like public preschool provision or introducing standardized tests) led to reduced educational dispersions, and thereby reduced earnings inequality in adulthood.
The teacher labour market, teacher turnover and disadvantaged schools: new evidence for England;We study the market for teachers in England, in particular teacher turnover. We show that there is a positive raw association between the level of school disadvantage and the turnover rate of its teachers. This association diminishes as we control for school, pupil and local teacher labour market characteristics, but is not eliminated. The remaining association is largely accounted for by teacher characteristics, with the poorer schools hiring much younger teachers on average. We interpret this market equilibrium allocation as either deriving from the preferences of young teachers, or as reflecting the low market attractiveness of disadvantaged schools.
Producing youth Out of sync:' the intersectional social relations of educational inequality;This article investigates intersecting institutional and policy relations that influence divergent developmental trajectories among young people. Beginning with young people's experiential knowledge of key institutional contexts shaping their lives, the article illuminates socially organized disjunctures whereby young people come to see themselves as developmentally out of sync with institutional expectations for youth development, which organize everyday life in public schools. This institutional ethnography explicates the intersecting social relations that shape how young people grow up, the choices that are available to them, their participation in public sector institutions and ultimately, the race and class-based patterns of inequality perpetuated by public schools and other public sector institutions.
The MacBurger, Non-State Universities and the Changing Landscape of Higher Education in Sri Lanka;In the present moment of global capitalism, the marketisation of higher education is a reality in the Global South and North. Yet, the Southern experience of marketisation differs from that of the North. This article examines how market-based development in Sri Lanka since the economic liberalisation of 1977 has reshaped Sri Lankan university education. It revisits the historical evolution of free (higher) education and critically analyses the influx of global brands into the country's education market . Using the MacBurger as a metaphor-for posh  food in Sri Lanka-the article shows how the influx, together with the rise offee-levying non-state (and state) universities, endangers the legacy of Sri Lankan (university) education as a public good . In conclusion, the article emphasises the widening educational inequality in the country and argues that higher education cannot be left to the free market in the peripheral countries of the South.
Micro-Educational Reproduction;This study analyzes the persistence of educational inequality in advanced industrialized societies with expanding and differentiated education systems. Using Denmark as a case, we investigate changes in immobility patterns for cohorts born 1960-1981 and develop a new micro-educational classification capturing both hierarchical and horizontal forms of educational differentiation. To investigate the association between parents' and children's educational status, we apply log linear models and control for four types of educational immobility: gradational (by returns to education), aggregated (5 macro-educational levels), horizontal (19 fields of study), and disaggregated (62 micro-educations). Our findings show that while macro-educational immobility has decreased across the period, micro-educational immobility at the university and university college levels remains high and stable, in particular for sons. We also find great variation in immobility for specific micro-educations within the university level. Studies of educational immobility would therefore benefit from paying attention to micro-educational classifications, because they capture patterns of multidimensional, disaggregated forms of reproduction. In addition, the micro-educational approach far better explains the immobility of sons than it explains that of daughters, revealing important gender differences in the immobility patterns for sons and daughters.
Tracking and the intergenerational transmission of education: Evidence from a natural experiment;Proponents of tracking argue that the creation of more homogeneous classes increases efficiency while opponents point out that tracking aggravates initial differences between students. We estimate the effects on the intergenerational transmission of education of a reform that delayed tracking by two years in one of Germany's federal states. We argue that while the reform had no effect on educational outcomes on average, it increased educational attainment among men with uneducated parents and decreased attaimnent among men with educated parents. We also present some suggestive evidence that the reform improved the selection of boys into secondary tracks.
Educational Pairings, Motherhood, and Women's Relative Earnings in Europe;As a consequence of the reversal of the gender gap in education, the female partner in a couple now typically has as much as or more education compared with the male partner in most Western countries. This study addresses the implications for the earnings of women relative to their male partners in 16 European countries. Using the 2007 and 2011 rounds of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (N = 58,292), we investigate the extent to which international differences in women's relative earnings can be explained by educational pairings and their interaction with the motherhood penalty on women's earnings, by international differences in male unemployment, or by cultural gender norms. We find that the newly emerged pattern of hypogamy is associated with higher relative earnings for women in all countries and that the motherhood penalty on relative earnings is considerably lower in hypogamous couples, but neither of these findings can explain away international country differences. Similarly, male unemployment is associated with higher relative earnings for women but cannot explain away the country differences. Against expectations, we find that the hypogamy bonus on women's relative earnings, if anything, tends to be stronger rather than weaker in countries that exhibit more conservative gender norms.
Family context and individual situation of teens before, during and after pregnancy in Mexico City;Background: In the last 20 years, adolescent pregnancy has become one of the most critical problems affecting women in Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods: This qualitative study was based on in-depth interviews with 29 teen mothers. All of the pregnant teens were from low-to lower-middle-class social strata in the Mexico City metropolitan area. The family (living with the girl) and the individual context of pregnant teens were analysed on the basis of data from at least three interviews: during pregnancy and at approximately 6 and 24 months following delivery. Additionally, six mothers, four fathers, and four partners of the pregnant girls of the group were interviewed. The information on the individual and family situation before, during and after the pregnancy was recorded and transcribed, then analysed in three phases, comprising pre-analysis, exploration and interpretation. Results: The pregnant teens had a family background of teen pregnancy. The girls disclosed feelings of repression, loneliness and indifference to their parents, leading them to unprotected sexual relations without fear of pregnancy. After the pregnancy, communication improved between the girls and their parents, but became worse with their partner. Consequently, these teens returned to feeling as they did before getting pregnant. They stated that they would make their situation work for the sake of their child, and regretted dropping out of school and getting pregnant so young. Almost all said they were seeking love outside the family, which revealed a scenario of limited communication and unsatisfactory relations within the family. Conclusions: Understanding how communication works between parents and children is necessary to avoid teenage pregnancy, as well as early marriage or cohabitation, resulting in dropping out of school and financial constraints, which lead to great frustrations between the couple and affects the child. In addition, it is vitally important that adolescents be motivated in the family setting in order for them to continue their studies. There is also an urgent need to implement measures that compensate for educational inequality, as well as to strengthen strategies aimed at adolescent mothers and pregnant teens that encourage their school performance through the support of scholarship programs and day care centres. Many of the problems inherent in adolescence are related to the lack of affection and support, and in many cases are a reaction to authoritarian rules or limits established unilaterally by parents with little or no dialogue involved.
A Growing Rift in Values? Income and Educational Inequality and Their Impact on Mass Attitude Polarization;ObjectivesCompeting theoretical models from economics and social psychology would suggest either a negative or positive association between income inequality and attitude polarization. In order to address the conflicting nature of the predictions made by these theoretical accounts, this analysis tests whether inequality indeed impacts polarization in Left-Right ideological self-placement for a diverse sample of democracies. MethodsI use World Values SurveysEuropean Values Surveys 1981-2008 combined data for obtaining a large time-series cross-sectional data set of indicators of attitude polarization. I rely on mixed-effects models to test whether there is any connection between income inequality and polarization, after controlling for additional relevant factors, such as educational inequality. ResultsFindings point to no effect of income inequality on any measure of attitude polarization once educational inequality is controlled for. The latter type of inequality, on the other hand, has a consistent effect on two indicators of inequality, spread and bimodality, in the expected direction. ConclusionsIn spite of a highly plausible posited connection between income inequality and Left-Right attitude polarization, this analysis has failed to find any connection between the two. Instead, educational inequality appears to exert a consistent effect on attitude polarization. The findings point to the need for a more nuanced view of connections between economic inequality and political attitudes and behaviors, and to the possibility that shifts in inequality of the magnitude observed in OECD countries might not lead to social tensions.
The problem is bigger than us: Grappling with educational inequity in TeachFirst New Zealand;This article utilizes phenomenological research approaches to trace the experiences of participants within TeachFirst New Zealand (TFNZ), a member of the global network, Teach for All, as they grapple with their role in addressing educational inequality on a national scale. Specifically, I argue that TFNZ participants struggled within and against thin equity (Cochran-Smith et al., 2016) explanations of persistent inequality by focusing on how they (1) understand their role as individual teachers working in an educational system marked by a history of colonization and systemic racism, and (2) grapple with the ability of an individual teacher to effect lasting change.

The Coleman Report, 50 Years On: What Do We Know about the Role of Schools in Academic Inequality?;Achievement outcomes for U.S. children are overwhelmingly unequal along racial, ethnic, and class lines. Whether and how schools contribute to educational inequality, however, has long been the subject of debate. This article traces the debate to the Coleman Report's publication in 1966, describing the report's production and impact on educational research. The article then considers the field's major findingsthat schools equalize along class lines but likely stratify along racial and ethnic linesin light of current policy debates.
Means-Tested School Vouchers and Educational Achievement: Evidence from Chile's Universal Voucher System;Chile features a universal school choice system, in which a government voucher provides families an opportunity to send students to public or private schools of their choosing. Since its implementation in 1981, the amount of the voucher was flat without adjustments for family income, creating incentives for schools to enroll students from economically advantaged families. In 2008, a policy change adjusted voucher values by the poverty level of students and the proportion of poor students attending each school. We evaluate the effect of this policy on primary school students' standardized test scores, using time-distributed fixed effects models. We find a positive and significant effect of the means-tested voucher policy on Math and Language achievement. The effect is much larger among private-voucher schools serving poor children, and it increased over the years after the policy change, suggesting that schools require some time to realize the benefits of the policy. Our findings show that moving from a flat to a means-tested voucher improves achievement and equality.
School Segregation and Disparities in Urban, Suburban, and Rural Areas;Much of the literature on racial and ethnic educational inequality focuses on the contrast between black and Hispanic students in urban areas and white suburban students. This study extends the research on school segregation and racial/ethnic disparities by highlighting the importance of rural areas and regional variation. Although schools in rural America are disproportionately white, they nevertheless are like urban schools, and disadvantaged relative to suburban schools, in terms of poverty and test performance. Native Americans are most affected by rural school disadvantage. While they are a small share of students nationally, Native Americans are prominent and highly disadvantaged in rural areas, particularly in certain parts of the country. These figures suggest a strong case for including rural schools in the continuing conversations about how to deal with unfairness in public education.
Learning in Harm's Way: Neighborhood Violence, Inequality, and American Schools;Is a school's geographic proximity to violent crime related to characteristics of its student body and to students' academic performance? Our understanding of the educational impacts of students' exposure to violence has been constrained because of various technical and financial limitations that have made research in this area problematic. The work presented here leverages advances in the availability of geo-coded data on incidents of crime to overcome the limitations of prior research in this area, showing that a school's proximity to violent crime is associated with common measures of educational inequality and also with school performance. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research and public policy.
The Prison School: Educational Inequality and School Discipline in the Age of Mass Incarceration;
Maternal Education, Changing Family Circumstances, and Children's Skill Development in the United States and UK;Maternal education influences families' socioeconomic status. It is strongly associated with children's cognitive development and a key predictor of other resources within the family that strongly predict children's well-being: economic insecurity, family structure, and maternal depression. Most studies examine the effects of these variables in isolation at particular points in time, and very little research examines whether findings observed among children in the United States can be generalized to children of a similar age in other countries. We use latent class analysis and data from two nationally representative birth cohort studies that follow children from birth to age five to answer two questions: (1) How do children's family circumstances evolve throughout early childhood? and (2) To what extent do these trajectories account for differences in children's cognitive development? Cross-national analysis reveals a good deal of similarity between the United States and UK in patterns of family life during early childhood, and in the degree to which those patterns contribute to educational inequality.
Paternal Incarceration and Children's Schooling Contexts: Intersecting Inequalities of Educational Opportunity;Research on the collateral consequences of mass imprisonment has focused on the interactions that families and communities have with the criminal justice system. Less attention is paid to interactions that children of the incarcerated have with another important social institution: schools. This article describes the types of schools that children with incarcerated fathers attend. Using newly available data on children's early elementary environments from a longitudinal birth-cohort sample of urban families, the analyses show that children of the incarcerated are more often in disadvantaged schools and in schools with climates worse than the schools of same-age peers with no histories of paternal incarceration. I offer a first exploratory step toward understanding the interplay among three of America's most powerful social institutionsfamilies, schools, and the criminal justice systemand the ways that they interact to structure the educational trajectories of what scholars are calling children of the prison boom.
Intended college enrollment and educational inequality: Do students lack information?;Despite increasing access to university education, students from disadvantaged or non-academic family backgrounds are still underrepresented in universities. In this regard, the economics literature has focused on the role of financial constraints as a cause of these observed differences in educational choices. Our knowledge of potential effects of other constraints regarding university education is more limited. We investigate the causal relationship between information and educational expectations using data from a German randomized controlled trial in which students in high schools were given information on the benefits of as well as on different funding possibilities for university education. We find that the provision of information increases intended college enrollment for students from a non-academic family background, both two to three months and one year after the intervention. In contrast, it leads students from academic backgrounds to lower their enrollment intentions in the short run. However, this effect does not persist. Our results suggest that educational inequality can be reduced by providing students from non-academic families with relevant information. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Fostering Equality of Opportunity? Compulsory Schooling Reform and Social Mobility in Germany;There is an ongoing debate in the field of social mobility research about whether intergenerational social mobility can be increased by way of education policy. However, evidence on the effects of specific education policies on social mobility continues to be scarce. This article analyses the effect of one specific policy reform, the extension of compulsory schooling in Germany, which has been argued to have led to a decrease in educational inequality and an increase in social mobility. Using a difference-in-difference design, the article exploits the variation in the timing of the reform across German states to estimate the reform effect on the educational attainment and labour market chances of individuals from different social class backgrounds. We find that the reform resulted in a substantial narrowing of the gap in educational attainment between different social origin groups. This decline in educational inequality further translated into a reduction in the inequality in labour market chances between people from different social class backgrounds, thus increasing intergenerational social mobility. Our findings suggest that educational policy can lead to substantial increases in intergenerational social mobility, which may have been overlooked in past research on societal-level, long-run trends in social mobility.
Does Poverty on Youth Affect Poverty in Adulthood? An Analysis for Spain;The correlation of economic, social and educational achievements between generations of the same family is a matter of great interest for the analysis of equal opportunities in society. The aim of this article is to quantify the impact and extent of the intergenerational transmission of poverty in Spain. Using data from the specific module on the intergenerational transmission of economic disadvantage in the 2011 Life Conditions Survey, propensity score matching was used to study the relationship between the economic disadvantage of one generation and the next. The results show that having economic disadvantage during adolescence increases the probability of poverty in adulthood. This impact has been reduced in younger generations.
Equity Efforts as Boundary Work: How Symbolic and Social Boundaries Shape Access and Inclusion in Graduate Education;"Background/Context: Education scholars have examined how state policy and informal practice can widen or reproduce racial and gender inequalities in graduate education. Just one empirical study, which focused on psychology programs, has identified organizational practice that supports recruitment and retention of graduate students of color. Focus of Study: To identify organizational conditions and specific activities that support diversity in STEM graduate programs, the authors conducted a yearlong case study of a physics program that, for the last decade, has trained about 10% of the Black Ph.D.s in physics, nationally. They identified and described concrete efforts to enhance access and inclusion, and sought to understand how this program distinguished itself from a traditional physics department. Participants: Study participants consisted of 16 faculty, administrators, administrative staff, and students affiliated with the Applied Physics program at the University of Michigan. Research Design: Data for this qualitative case study was collected through eighteen interviews, two student focus groups, observations of everyday life and special events in the program, and a large amount of documentary data. Guided by the constant comparative method, the analysis assessed convergence and divergence across types of data and across faculty, administrator, staff, and student perspectives. Major findings represent four areas of consensus across participant roles. Findings/Results: Four themes explain how Applied Physics has increased access to and inclusion in a field known for its inequality. The program institutionalized a flexible, interdisciplinary intellectual paradigm; they reconceputalized their vision of the ideal student and reformed admissions accordingly; they empowered administrative staff to serve as cultural translators across racial and faculty-student boundaries; and they worked to create a family-like climate that gave them a competitive advantage over other physics programs. Conclusions/Recommendations: We interpret the findings from the perspective of Charles Tilly's boundary change mechanisms, and conclude that the common thread among the four themes was the program's willingness to erase, relocate, and/or deactivate boundaries that had implicitly created barriers to access and inclusion for underrepresented students. The paper recommends specific steps that graduate programs can take to analyze the symbolic boundaries operating in their own programs, and invites scholars to utilize the boundaries perspective in future research on educational inequality."
Schooling in France: From Organizational to Informal Inequality;This article presents a broad historical perspective on inequality in French primary and secondary public schooling (from age 6 to 18), with emphasis on policy debates and institutional consequences of public policy. During the Third and Fourth Republics (1870-1959), schooling was provided in three gender-segregated tracks for different social classes. Under the Fifth Republic (since 1960), educational tracks after age 16 have been coeducational and ostensibly indifferent to social class origin, focusing instead on previous academic achievement and students' prospects for higher education or for jobs. Recent changes have seen a massive expansion in schooling, and have sought but failed to produce greater social class equality. I argue that recent attempts to mitigate inequality have failed because success in school depends on the cultural and educational background of students' parents and also because upper-middle-class parents use various means-economic means and ability to capitalize on social connections-to enable their children to go to the best schools.
The Dimensions of Racialization and the Inner-City School;The articles in this issue together articulate the varied ways in which inequality and urban education intersect and interact. Woven throughout is a common denominator that binds these particular investigations-the concept of race. Heretofore, scholarly analyses of race and educational inequality have reached heterogeneous conclusions: from race as a reified identity correlated with educational disparities, to urban education as an institution that promotes virulent ideologies, to racialized patterns of interaction that reproduce educational stratification. We draw upon these articles to synthesize these perspectives and articulate the relationship between urban education and race as an ongoing feedback loop: race (re)produces the phenomena of urban education, while urban education (re)forms race. The intertwining of these two reproduces both the dominant meanings of race and the hierarchical location of racial groups in the social order across five key domains: ideologies, institutions, interests, identities, and interactions.
Applying to college: Do information deficits lower the likelihood of college-eligible students from less-privileged families to pursue their college intentions? Evidence from a field experiment;Information deficits are considered an important source of why students from less-privileged families do not enroll in college, even when they are college-eligible and intend to go to college. In this paper, we examine whether correct and detailed information on the costs of and returns to higher education increases the likelihood of college applications of less privileged high school graduates who expressed college intentions in their junior high school year. We employ an experimental design with a randomly assigned 25-minute information treatment about funding opportunities for, and returns to, higher education given at Berlin schools awarding university entrance qualifications. Our analyses show that our information treatment indeed substantially increases the likelihood of treated less-privileged students to apply to college. Our study indicates that our low-cost provision of financial information not only increased their college knowledge but also substantially changed their college application behavior, despite other existing barriers, like economic constraints.

The Role of Education for Intergenerational Income Mobility: A comparison of the United States, Great Britain, and Sweden;Previous studies have found that intergenerational income persistence is relatively high in the United States and Britain, especially as compared to Nordic countries. We compare the association between family income and sons' earnings in the United States (National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979), Britain (British Cohort Study 1970), and Sweden (Population Register Data, 1965 cohort), and find that both income elasticities and rank-order correlations are highest in the United States, followed by Britain, with Sweden being clearly more equal. We ask whether differences in educational inequality and in return to qualifications can explain these cross-country differences. Surprisingly, we find that this is not the case, even though returns to education are higher in the United States. Instead, the low income mobility in the United States and Britain is almost entirely due to the part of the parent-son association that is not mediated by educational attainment. In the United States and especially Britain, parental income is far more important for earnings at a given level of education than in Sweden, a result that holds also when controlling for cognitive ability. This goes against widespread ideas of the United States as a country where the role of ascription is limited and meritocratic stratification prevails.
Educational inequality in cancer mortality: a record linkage study of over 35 million Italians;"Large studies are needed to evaluate socioeconomic inequality for site-specific cancer mortality. We conducted a longitudinal census-based national study to quantify the relative inequality in cancer mortality among educational levels in Italy. We linked the 2011 Italian census with the 2012 and 2013 death registries. Educational inequality in overall cancer and site-specific cancer mortality were evaluated by computing the mortality rate ratio (MRR). A total of 35,708,445 subjects aged 30-74 years and 147,981 cancer deaths were registered. Compared to the lowest level of education (none or primary school), the MRR for all cancers in the highest level (university) was 0.57 (95% CI 0.55; 0.58) in men and 0.84 (95% CI 0.81; 0.87) in women. Higher education was associated with reduced risk of mortality from lip, oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon and liver in both sexes. Higher education (university) was associated with decreased risk of lung cancer in men (MRR: 0.43, 95% CI 0.41; 0.46), but not in women (MRR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.92; 1.10). Highly educated women had a reduced risk of mortality from cervical cancer than lower educated women (MRR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.27; 0.56), but they had a similar risk for breast cancer (MRR: 1.01, 95% CI 0.94; 1.09). Education is inversely associated with total cancer mortality, and the association was stronger in men. Different patterns and trends in tobacco smoking in men and women account for at least most of the gender differences."
De Facto Privatization and Inequalities in Educational Opportunity in the Transition to Secondary School in Rural Malawi;"There has been a recent, rapid de facto privatization of education in many African countries, as the number of private secondary schools operating in the region has grown. The majority of these schools are low-cost private schools where tuition and fees are set as low as possible to cover operating costs and still generate profit. Proponents of low-cost private schools argue that these schools have proliferated in impoverished areas to meet unmet demand for access to education and where private schools may offer better quality than locally available public schools. Theories of inequality of educational opportunity suggest that if private schools offer better-quality education, students from more advantaged families will be more likely to enroll at these institutions, potentially exacerbating educational inequality in the region. This analysis uses data from a school-based longitudinal survey, the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Study, to examine socio-economic inequalities in the transition to secondary school and on-time enrollment in upper secondary. My findings indicate that youth from non-poor households are not only more likely to enroll in secondary school than poor youth, but they are also more likely to substitute enrollment in private schools for enrollment in second-tier government schools. Enrollment at private schools, however, does not yield schooling advantages; relative to both tiers of government secondary schooling, students who initially enrolled at private schools were the least likely to enroll on time in upper secondary school. These patterns suggest that these schooling circumstances may yield less segregation of opportunity than might otherwise be assumed."
Thirteenth Annual Brown Lecture in Education Research: Public Education and the Social Contract: Restoring the Promise in an Age of Diversity and Division;"Building on the premise that closing achievement gaps is an economic imperative both to regain international educational supremacy and to maintain global economic competitiveness, I ask whether it is possible to rewrite the social contract so that education is a fundamental righta statutory guaranteethat is both uniform across states and federally enforceable. I argue that the federal government was complicit in aggravating educational inequality by not guaranteeing free, public education as a basic right during propitious political moments; by enabling the creation of a segregated public higher education system; by relegating the Department of Education and its predecessors to a secondary status in the federal administration, thereby compromising its enforcement capability; and by proliferating incremental reforms while ignoring the unequal institutional arrangements that undermine equal opportunity to learn. History shows that a strong federal role can potentially strengthen the educational social contract."
Do learning rates differ by race/ethnicity over kindergarten? Reconciling results across gain score, first-difference, and random effects models;The question of whether students' school-year learning rates differ by race/ethnicity is important for monitoring educational inequality. Researchers applying different modeling strategies to the same data (the ECLS-K:99) have reached contrasting conclusions on this question. We outline the similarities and differences across three common approaches to estimating gains and heterogeneity in gains: 1) a gain score model (with intercept), 2) a first-difference (FD) model (in some cases equivalent to regression-through-the-origin [RTO] and student fixed effects models), and 3) a student random effects (RE) model. We show via simulation that FD/RTO and RE models produce estimates of learning rates - and group differences in learning rates - with more favorable RMSD compared to the gain score model with intercept. Using data from the ECLS-K:99, we demonstrate that these precision differences lead to contrasting inferences regarding learning rate heterogeneity, and likely explain the inconsistencies across previous studies.

Explaining socioeconomic inequalities in exclusive breast feeding in Norway;Background and objective In high-income countries, lower socioeconomic position is associated with lower rates of breast feeding, but it is unclear what factors explain this inequality. Our objective was to examine the association between socioeconomic position and exclusive breast feeding, and to explore whether socioeconomic inequality in exclusive breast feeding could be explained by other sociodemographic characteristics, for example, maternal age and parity, smoking habits, birth characteristics, quality of counselling and breastfeeding difficulties. Methods We used data from a questionnaire sent to mothers when their infants were five completed months as part of a trial of a breastfeeding intervention in Norway. We used maternal education as an indicator of socioeconomic position. Analyses of 1598 mother-infant pairs were conducted using logistic regression to assess explanatory factors of educational inequalities in breast feeding. Results Socioeconomic inequalities in exclusive breast feeding were present from the beginning and persisted for five completed months, when 22% of the most educated mothers exclusively breast fed compared with 7% of the least educated mothers: OR 3.39 (95% CI 1.74 to 6.61). After adjustment for all potentially explanatory factors, the OR was reduced to 1.49 (95% CI 0.70 to 3.14). This decrease in educational inequality seemed to be mainly driven by sociodemographic factors, smoking habits and breastfeeding difficulties, in particular perceived milk insufficiency. Conclusions Socioeconomic inequalities in exclusive breast feeding at 5 months were largely explained by sociodemographic factors, but also by modifiable factors, such as smoking habits and breastfeeding difficulties, which can be amenable to public health interventions.
The Closing Door: The Effect of Race on Charter School Closures;Charter schools are promoted by policy makers and advocates as a way to reduce educational inequality. Charter schools tend to enroll higher proportions of black students than do traditional public schools. However, the accountability function of charter schools means that these schools are also more likely to close than traditional public schools. A high incidence of closure can lead to educational instability with students moving in and out of charter schools and traditional schools. We use critical race theory to build on prior work, examining the factors that may promote or constrain charter school closure. Specifically, we ask, how do the racial demographics of a charter school affect its likelihood of closure? Our findings reveal that as the proportion of black students in a charter school increases, so too does its likelihood of closings. Our work suggests that the promotion of charter schools as avenues of racial equity may be misleading.
Finishing secondary school in Cordoba: educational inequality and high school in the last decade;This text aims to focus on the graduation of the secondary educational level as a guide for the set of agents' opportunities to access to decent living conditions. From the specificity of the Cordoba's empirical case, this article attends to the unequal distribution of secondary school capital between different social classes, and to the behavior that it acquires in the labor market. Starting from a quantitative approach, in which the social space for Gran Cordoba 2003-2011 is constructed, it can be observed the configuration of the school investments of the different social classes of Cordoba. To do this, the study uses the third quarter data exploration of the Permanent Household Survey in the periods 2003-2011, characterizing the present differences in terms of secondary level graduation, and the inequalities associated with possession of the secondary title in the labor market, as well as the evolution during the study period.
Schools at the Rural-Urban Boundary: Blurring the Divide?;Schools often mirror the communities in which they are located. Research on rural-urban school inequality tends to focus on the contrast among urban, suburban, and rural schools, glossing over the variation and similarities within these areas. We provide a richer description of the spatial distribution of educational inequality by examining school composition, achievement, and resources in all U.S. public elementary schools in 2010-2011. We take the traditional census categories derived from residential and commuting patterns, and apply them to schools across the country in analyses that reveal gradual transitions and blurry boundaries among the traditional zones. The results show high levels of variation within the suburbs and substantial commonality between rural and urban areas and suggest that census-defined metropolitan areas are not ideal when considering the geography of educational opportunity.
On 'emotional education': subjectivity and psychologization in late modernity;This paper analyzes a series of discourses that promote the so called emotional education, which rely on contributions from positive psychology, theories of theories of emotional intelligence and competences. This inquiry enables exploration of the type of subject these discourses seek to shape, the characteristics and abilities promoted among students, as well as the way emotions are conceived and manners to deal with them. The paper hypothesizes that these discourses are part of what some authors refer to as therapeutic ethos, which postulates that through knowing and managing one's emotions it is possible to take advantage of them in order to achieve success and emotional well-being. Additionally, this paper holds the view that by focusing on the individual and the development of specific competences, these approaches leave in the shadows institutional, socioeconomic and cultural conditions, therefore overlooking the relational nature of individuals' emotions, both in general and in educational settings in particular. The paper concludes with a series of questions about the relationship between these approaches and the implications of their implementation when working with children and young people, as well as about their connection with processes of socio-educational inequality.
Class differentials in getting parental assistance for seeking a second chance of getting into university: an illustration of community-college students in Hong Kong;While a class gap remains in obtaining a degree despite an expansion of higher education, a variety of second chances have become available. How class matters in receiving parental assistance for seeking a second chance is of increasing importance to understanding educational inequality in an altered context of higher education, but it is under-researched. This article seeks to fill this gap by referring to a qualitative study of 85 community-college students in Hong Kong for illustration. First interviews with respondents recruited from a community college were conducted between the year 2006 and 2009 where they discussed how they desired a second chance option by studying an associate degree in community college. Encouragement and emotional support to seek this new, costly, and risky second chance was provided by parents of most respondents. And yet, as a deficit approach would have us believe, middle-class respondents received more relevant information and academic advice with financial support from their parents than working-class respondents. In spite of that fact, it seems to remain whether the middle class are indeed better able than the working class to get transferred to university through the transfer of an associate degree in Hong Kong. This illustration suggests that the availability of a second chance does not immediately imply that the middle and the working classes are equally capable of taking advantage of it to rectify their previous educational failure. This article will be concluded by discussing the implications of this study for educational inequality.
The Trifurcation of the Labor Markets in the Networked, Knowledge-Driven, Global Economy;This conceptual, interdisciplinary paper will start with an introduction to the new, networked, knowledge-driven, global economy. The objective of this paper, using a narrative review of the economic, business, and management literature of labor markets and human capital, will be to negate the notion that we have, at present, one labor market for human capital, and will conjecture that we currently have (or are about to have) three autonomous markets for labor that are driven by different market dynamics and mechanisms. The three markets are identified as follows: routine labor, skilled labor, and talent. Each one of the markets will then be discussed, including future trends, issues, and remedies. This trifurcation of the labor markets is mostly the combined result of phase transition resulting from three major impetuses. The first is the effect(s) that technological revolutions have on the supply and demand of/for multidimensional skills of human capital. Second is the winner take all market structure enabled by the industrial economy's framed legislation and social norms. The third impetus is the context (for the technological revolutions and the nature of the markets) of a networked global economy that is driven by knowledge developing at an accelerated pace. The narrative multidisciplinary literature review used was a modified version of the integrative literature review. The review confirmed that the three labor markets' dynamics are to a considerable degree dissimilar and that legislating, conducting monetary, and fiscal policies that treat them as one labor market could (and probably already does) cause more harm than good, resulting in destabilizing the labor markets (as indicated by the growing unemployment rate of the young generation worldwide) and by extension, the social fabric of the new economy (as indicated by the growing economic and educational inequality worldwide). The paper concludes with a framework of the three labor markets, followed by a summary, including the need for a new legal and social paradigm regarding labor and the need for a new formal model for value creation. Finally, the limitations of the study as well as potential research gaps are identified.
Student-centered instruction and academic achievement: linking mechanisms of educational inequality to schools' instructional strategy;Research in the sociology of education argues that the educational system provides different learning opportunities for students with different socioeconomic backgrounds and that this circumstance makes the educational process an important institutional context for the reproduction of educational inequality. Using combined survey and register data for more than 56,000 students in 825 schools, this article conducts the first empirical test of the argument that instructional strategies which emphasize student responsibility and activity, also referred to as student-centered instruction, increase educational inequality. We analyze whether the impact of student-centered instructional strategies on academic achievement differs for students with different socioeconomic backgrounds. Results suggest that a student-centered instructional strategy has a negative impact on academic achievement in general, and for students with low parental education in particular. Our findings support the argument that the instructional strategy of schools is an important mechanism in generating educational inequality through the stratification of learning opportunities.
Is university education worth the investment? The expectations of upper secondary school seniors and the role of family background;This study assesses students' expectations about the profitability of the investment in university education. We consider Italy as a test case and provide fresh high-quality data on students' expectations concerning the costs, economic returns and chances of success of this investment. These are compared with data on the corresponding actual values. We find that the estimates provided by upper secondary school seniors are highly inaccurate, highly uncertain and systematically biased. Students overestimate the returns to university degrees, while they are over-pessimistic regarding university costs and drop-out risks. These results confirm previous studies on perceived university costs, but they challenge the dominant view that students can realistically forecast graduate earnings. We trace this discrepancy to two methodological shortcomings of several previous studies on expected graduate earnings. Moreover, we find that information barriers are not equally distributed among social groups. High-status students overestimate the economic returns to university more, and they are more optimistic regarding their chances of success in Higher Education, even after allowing for their higher objective returns and chances of success. Our interpretation of the importance of information barriers focuses on the interaction between cognitive biases and institutional constraints.
Follow the Yellow Brick Road: Teach For America and the Making of Educational Leaders;This article reports findings from a study that explores how Teach For America (TFA) alumni interpret the causes of and interventions for educational inequality, the leadership pathways for remedying inequality, and the career opportunities available to them as TFA affiliates. Analyzing data from 117 alumni interviews, we find that the majority of participants attribute the roots of educational inequality to perceived managerial shortcomings of the public school system. We also demonstrate how TFA alumni embrace largely managerial, technocratic responses to inequality. Finally, we reveal how the majority of alumni who work in education do so in privatized settings that emphasize management, entrepreneurship, and accountability. These findings contribute to the literature on school reform, the politics of educational policy and leadership, and the discourse and policy environment in which the organization is embedded.
Irregularly-shaped school attendance zones and racial integration;This paper investigates how much the geographic shapes of school attendance zones within urban school districts are associated with levels of attendance zone racial segregation (while holding constant levels of residential segregation). Based on an analysis of 304 school districts, findings show that more irregularly-shaped school attendance zones are correlated with lower levels of racial segregation in attendance zones after accounting for residential segregation. In fact, not one school district contains both highly irregularly-shaped attendance zones and unusually high levels of attendance zone racial segregation although there are several school districts with irregularly-shaped zones and unusually high levels of racial integration. These findings undermine recent claims that irregularly-shaped attendance zones generally serve to segregate students by race. In addition to these empirical findings, this paper introduces a variation of the spatial information theory segregation index H that is useful for predicting segregation in school attendance zones and other types of geographic boundaries containing roughly equal populations.

THE PRISON SCHOOL Educational inequality and school discipline in the age of mass incarceration;
Standardized curriculam matrix for employability, sociocultural identities, inequality and educational exclusion in Costa Rica;"This paper aims to provide an analysis and critical discussion around three issues that today represent problem situations in the context of Costa Rican educational system: a) the educational project based on a standardized curriculum matrix, aimed favors educational training for employability; b) the bracketing of the cultural identities of student populations and, instead, the establishment of a single guideline cognitive and attitudinal encodings; c) educational inequality, and exclusion in force today in the national education system. It is concluded that the inculcation of the so-called National Core Curriculum has resulted in a standardized curriculum matrix for employability and that it leads to a systemic situation of inequality and exclusion for diverse student populations in the country."
DIFFERENT TEACHERS FOR DIFFERENT STUDENTS? EVIDENCE ON TEACHER-STUDENT MATCHING AND ITS CONSEQUENCES IN THE ITALIAN CASE;We present novel evidence for Italy thanks to a unique dataset linking students standardized achievement measures and their teachers' characteristics, both for language and mathematics. First, we explore the extent to which teachers are allocated to students from different family backgrounds, focusing on observable teachers' characteristics that parents and school leaders could interpret as signals of their effectiveness. We test whether these characteristics affect achievement by means of student fixed-effects models that exploit the within students-between subjects variation in test scores. For each teacher, we compute a summative measure of Cumulative Contribution to Student Achievement (CCSA) and we study its allocation among students from different educational backgrounds. Results show that classes with students from a lower social background are more frequently staffed with teachers possessing less desirable traits, especially in secondary schools and for language teachers. These traits affect achievement and also teachers' CCSA is unequally allocated among students. Our analyses also show that teacher-students matching is stronger in Southern regions, although not for all grades and subjects. Evidence suggests that also in Italy, unequal allocation of students to teachers could be a hidden form of educational inequality.
Educational inequalities in smoking among Japanese adults aged 25e94 years: Nationally representative sex-and age-specific statistics;"Background: Few studies have investigated differences in age-and gender-specific educational gradients in tobacco smoking among the whole range of adult age groups. We examined educational inequality in smoking among Japanese adults aged 25-94 years. Methods: Using a large nationally representative sample (167,925 men and 186,588 women) in 2010, prevalence of current smoking and heavy smoking among daily smokers and their inequalities attributable to educational attainment were analyzed according to sex and age groups. Results: Among men aged 25-34 years, junior high school graduates had the highest current smoking prevalence at 68.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66.0%-70.6%), and graduate school graduates had the lowest at 19.4% (95% CI, 17.2%-21.9%). High school graduates had the second highest current smoking prevalence (e.g., 55.9%; 95% CI, 54.9%-56.8% in men aged 25e34 years). Among men aged 75-94 years, the difference in current smoking across educational categories was small. A similar but steeper educational gradient in current smoking was observed among women. Among women aged 25-34 years, junior high school graduates had the highest current smoking prevalence at 49.3% (95% CI, 46.3% -52.3%), and graduate school graduates had the lowest at 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9%-7.4%). Compared with older age groups, such as 65-94 years, younger age groups, such as 25-54 years, had higher estimates of inequality indicators for educational inequality in both current and heavy smoking in both sexes. Conclusions: Educational inequalities in current and heavy smoking were apparent and large in the young population compared with older generations. The current study provides basic data on educational inequalities in smoking among Japanese adults. (C) 2016 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.

Mapping, measuring and monitoring achievement: Can a new evaluation framework help schools challenge inequalities?;"While mainstream schools have seen an increasing focus on performance and attainment in recent years, this focus has often been resisted by special and alternative educational provision in the United Kingdom. However, concern is now growing about the low levels of achievement for children and young people educated outside mainstream schools. This article reports the findings of an evaluation which examined the work of one group of special school head teachers who set out to develop an alternative framework for mapping, tracking and evaluating achievement; one which would be recognisable to, but not limited by, the pressures on the mainstream. The findings suggest that, if adopted more widely, such a framework could contribute to the search for common ground and common understanding across different educational settings, with the potential to bring direct benefits to pupils but also to make a contribution to addressing under-achievement and educational inequalities more broadly."
International Student Recruitment: Trends and Challenges;This paper provides a review of current trends in international student recruitment. Focusing specifically on recruitment of Chinese students, important aspects of China's educational system relevant to recruitment are presented. Barriers to Chinese student recruitment are then discussed. Successful, employed, international graduates validate domestic institutional value to prospective foreign students and their parents. In that regard, guidance is then offered for domestic universities to use to assist international students to achieve their desired outcomes as an integral part of the institution's international student recruitment strategy.
The Next Needed Thing The Impact of the Jeanes Fund on Black Schooling in the South, 1900-1930;I estimate the impact of two large-scale interventions aimed at improving the quality of black schooling in the South between 1900 and 1930. The first, The Julius Rosenwald Fund, focused on physical infrastructure by building nearly 5,000 schoolhouses. The second, The Anna T. Jeanes Fund, built a corps of trained supervisors whose contributions ranged from teacher training to fundraising, hence their motto: The next needed thing. Variation in the timing and placement of these programs allows me to evaluate impacts of each, and to compare per-dollar effects of investments in human resources (Jeanes) versus physical capital (Rosenwald) on educational inequality.
Inequalities in the Pathway to College in China: When Do Students from Poor Areas Fall Behind?;Inequalities in college access are a major concern for policymakers in both developed and developing countries. Policymakers in China have largely tried to address these inequalities by helping disadvantaged students successfully transition from high school to college. However, they have paid less attention to the possibility that inequalities in college access may also arise earlier in the pathway to college. The purpose of this paper is to understand where inequalities emerge along the pathway to college in China, focusing on three major milestones after junior high. By analysing administrative data on over 300,000 students from one region of China, we find that the largest inequalities in college access emerge at the first post-compulsory milestone along the pathway to college: when students transition from junior high to high school. In particular, only 60 per cent of students from poor counties take the high school entrance exam (compared to nearly 100 per cent of students from non-poor counties). Furthermore, students from poor counties are about one and a half times less likely to attend academic high school and elite academic high school than students from non-poor counties.
Educational Inequality in Obesity-Related Mortality in Korea;The prevalence of obesity has been increasing worldwide, which raises concerns about the disease burden associated with obesity. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been suggested to be associated with obesity and obesity related diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the time trend in socioeconomic inequality in obesity-related mortality over the last decade in Korean population. We evaluated the influence of education level, as an indicator of SES, on obesity-related mortality using death data from the Cause of Death Statistics and the Korean Population and Housing Census databases. The rate ratio of the mortality of people at the lowest education level as compared with those at the highest education level (relative index of inequality [RII]) was estimated using Poisson regression analysis. Between 2001 and 2011, RII (95% confidence interval) for overall obesity-related disease mortality increased from 2.10 (2.02-2.19) to 6.50 (6.19-6.82) in men, and from 1.94 (1.79-2.10) to 3.25 (3.05-3.45) in women, respectively. Cause-specifically, the same trend in RII was found for cardiovascular mortality and mortality from diabetes mellitus, whereas the RII of mortality from obesity-related cancers in men did not show the similar trend. Subgroup analysis stratified by age revealed that the RII of obesity-related mortality was much higher in younger people than in older people. In conclusion, there has been persistent socioeconomic inequality in obesity-related mortality in Korea, which was more evident in younger people than in older people and has been deepened over the last decade especially for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Ethnic differences in the effects of institutionalized childcare for children under the age of three;Institutionalized childcare for children under the age of three has come into the focus of public and political debates in Germany in recent years. However, there is a lack of scientific research regarding the potential of institutional childcare to enhance children's skill development. Using data from the project Preschool Education and Educational Careers among Migrant Children collected in 2007, our study examines the relationship between early childcare attendance and the cognitive abilities and language skills of children in Germany, specifically focusing on ethnic differences. There is no correlation between the time spent in childcare before the age of three and the general cognitive abilities of native German children or children from immigrant families. However, for the latter we find a positive relationship between the duration of early childcare and German vocabulary if children come from a multilingual family. Our findings indicate that early institutionalized childcare is indeed suited to reduce early ethnic educational inequality.
Intergenerational Education Effects of Early Marriage in Sub-Saharan Africa;This paper analyzes the evolution of the effects on educational inequality of early marriage by looking at the impact of whether women had married young on their children's schooling outcomes for 25-32 countries (Demographic and Health Surveys) in 2000 and 2010 for Sub-Saharan Africa. We also explore indirect pathways-mother's education, health, and empowerment as well as community channels-operating from early marriage to child schooling and assess the presence of negative externalities for non early married mothers and their children on education transmission in communities with large rates of child marriage. In our econometric analysis we employ OLS, matching, instrumental variables, and pseudo-panel for a better understanding of changes over time. Our results show that early marriage is still a significant source of inequality, though its impact has decreased across time: girls born to early married mothers are between 6% and 11% more likely to never been to school and 1.6% and 1.7% to enter late, and 3.3% and 5.1% less likely to complete primary school, whereas boys are between 5.2% and 8.8% more likely to never been to school and 1% and 1.9% to enter late, and 2.3% and 5.5% less likely to complete primary school. Second, child marriage increases gender inequality within household's with girls losing an additional 0.07 years of schooling as compared to boys if born to early married mothers. Third, our estimates show that mother's education and health mediate some of the effect of early marriage and that the large prevalence of child marriage in a community also impairs educational transmission for non-early married mothers. Fourth, empowering of young wives can weaken other channels of transmission of education inequalities. Overall, our findings highlight the need to target these children with the appropriate interventions and support to achieve the greater focus on equity in the global post-2015 education agenda.

Late School Tracking, Less Class Bias in Educational Decision-Making? The Uncertainty Reduction Mechanism and Its Experimental Testing;"A long-standing hypothesis in the sociology of education is that the timing of ability tracking impacts the inequality of educational opportunity. While earlier studies mainly focused on how early tracking impacts the primary effect of social origin (systematic performance differences due to social background), the impact of early tracking on the secondary effect of social origin (class-specific educational decision-making) has been neglected. Recently, the idea has been put forward that late tracking decreases uncertainty in educational decision-making, thus enabling more rational decision-making by lower-class individuals. Extending this idea, we propose the uncertainty reduction mechanism (URM) as a theoretical foundation; this mechanism can be derived from a decision-theoretic model on educational decision-making based on prospect theory. Moreover, we perform a first empirical test of the URM by means of a computerized laboratory experiment. The evidence is in line with the model predictions and the results support the intuition that a postponement of tracking could reduce the negative bias of lower-class individuals in educational decision-making, thereby reducing educational inequality with respect to social background."
Universal higher education and positional advantage: Soviet legacies and neoliberal transformations in Russia;The great expansion of participation in higher education in Russia in the post-Soviet period was the layered and contradictory result of both conditions established in the Soviet period, and the structuring of reforms after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992. The Soviet government was strongly committed to the expansion of education across the country, and gender equality was achieved at that time. In the 1990s and 2000s enrolments more than doubled, though the growth of numbers has been reversed since 2008 because of demographic decline of the relevant age cohorts. Employing Trow's analysis of the growth of higher education systems and Hirsch's concept of positional goods, among other conceptual approaches, as well as statistical, national, and comparative survey data, this paper analyses social dynamics of the process of increasing participation and equalization of opportunity in Russia. The dramatic higher education expansion in Russia was largely associated with the positional value of higher education credentials, in a society in which the Soviet system of social status had been discontinued, and a new system of status was being built on the basis of post-Soviet rules (which are still evolving). Driven by family aspirations and resources, massification has largely rested on the part-privatisation of the costs of higher education, part of a neoliberal reform package common to the post-Soviet countries. However, higher education expansion has not brought about greater social equity. Expansion, fee-based financing and policy measures such as university excellence initiatives have tended to strengthen the institutional and social stratification of the higher education system, weakening social mobility and social equality.
Educational Expansion and the Role of Education in Expenditure Inequality in Indonesia Since the 1997 Financial Crisis;"Based on the National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas) from 1997 to 2011, this study examines the role of education in expenditure inequality in Indonesia under educational expansion since the 1997 financial crisis. This is achieved using the three decomposition methods: the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition; the decomposition of the Gini coefficient; and the hierarchical decomposition of the Theil index. The expansion of education, particularly basic education in rural areas, appears to have not only lowered educational disparity between the urban and rural sectors but also educational inequality within the rural sector. Due in large part to the declining educational disparity between the urban and rural sectors, the urban-rural expenditure disparity has narrowed since the mid-2000s. On the other hand, the expansion of higher education in urban areas appears to have played an important role in the recent rise in overall expenditure inequality by raising not only disparity between educational groups but also inequality within the tertiary education group. Basic education policies would still serve as an effective means to mitigate expenditure inequality, as they could reduce not only educational gap between the urban and rural sectors but also educational inequality within the rural sector by raising general educational levels. Since the expansion of higher education in urban areas seems to be one of the main factors of the recent rise in overall expenditure inequality, higher education policies would also be crucial."
IMMIGRANT STUDENTS IN COMPULSORY SECONDARY EDUCATION: PEDAGOGICAL VULNERABILITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM;"The high percentage of immigrant students who do not successfully complete compulsory education is of great concern, as is the increasing trend among teachers of ascribing this failure to personal, social, family or cultural factors. Nevertheless, the potential deficiencies of the educational system for addressing this situation should also be investigated. Thus, the main aim of this study was to identify the weaknesses or vulnerabilities of the system (Reimer, 1973) for responding to this situation, focusing on curriculum policy approaches and examining the institutional and educational roots of school dropout and school failure. The study had a naturalistic design based on eight instrumental case studies carried out in eight different schools and was developed according to what Stake (2007) called a collective case study. The results lead us to place special emphasis on what we call intrinsic vulnerability (dominant attitudes and practices mediated by the entrenched professional culture at this level) and structural vulnerability (educational and curriculum policies). Through mutual feedback, these vulnerabilities create symbolic and regulatory resistance as well as resistance in pedagogic practice, hindering innovative attempts to reorient educational action towards more inclusive, multicultural, and intercultural dimensions. Both stereotyping and the previous educational culture experienced by families and children are also important vulnerability factors. Due to the intrinsic design of the study, the findings cannot be generalized; however, it is highly transferable, and may provide interpretations and assertions that will continue to deepen our understanding of the complexities of the current education system and shed light on decision-making regarding policies and practices in this area."
The more, the better? The impact of instructional time on student performance;Building on earlier work that explored within-student variation in hours of instruction across school subjects, we investigate the impact of instruction time on student test scores in Switzerland, as measured by the PISA 2009 test. Our results confirm the results of previous studies of a positive effect of instruction time on student performance. Moreover, we find considerable heterogeneity in the effectiveness of instructional time across ability-related tracks, with the more able students benefitting more. Additional instruction time increases the within-school variance of subject-specific test scores, indicating an increase in educational inequality.
Pororoca: Conceptual Framework of a Science Diffusion Platform for Primary and Secondary Schools;Science experiments and research are effective approaches for scientific education and developmental experiences in primary and secondary school students. However, developing countries still face the barrier of educational inequality and insufficiency of science laboratories in schools. In order to face this actual worldwide challenge, we designed a conceptual platform using smart cities framework for interfacing and supporting research programs, laboratories implementation, publishing and spreading science for youth.
Irritable bowel syndrome is concentrated in people with higher educations in Iran: an inequality analysis;OBJECTIVES: Like any other health-related disorder, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has a differential distribution with respect to socioeconomic factors. This study aimed to estimate and decompose educational inequalities in the prevalence of IBS. METHODS: Sampling was performed using a multi-stage random cluster sampling approach. The data of 1,850 residents of Kish Island aged 15 years or older were included, and the determinants of IBS were identified using a generalized estimating equation regression model. The concentration index of educational inequality in cases of IBS was estimated and decomposed as the specific inequality index. RESULTS: The prevalence of IBS in this study was 21.57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.69 to 23.44%). The concentration index of IBS was 0.20 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.26). A multivariable regression model revealed that age, sex, level of education, marital status, anxiety, and poor general health were significant determinants of IBS. In the decomposition analysis, level of education (89.91%), age (-11.99%), and marital status (9.11%) were the three main contributors to IBS inequality. Anxiety and poor general health were the next two contributors to IBS inequality, and were responsible for more than 12% of the total observed inequality. CONCLUSIONS: The main contributors of IBS inequality were education level, age, and marital status. Given the high percentage of anxious individuals among highly educated, young, single, and divorced people, we can conclude that all contributors to IBS inequality may be partially influenced by psychological factors. Therefore, programs that promote the development of mental health to alleviate the abovementioned inequality in this population are highly warranted.
BLENDING ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS EDUCATION RESEARCH WITH DEVELOPMENT FOR EQUITY - AN ETHICAL IMPERATIVE ENABLING QUALITATIVELY RICHER WORK;South Africa, as a result of its apartheid history, is a nation of extreme socio-economic and educational inequality. Three aspects of this context are important in understanding why it is essential that educational research and development be intertwined. The first is South Africa's post-apartheid (1994) education context in which performance and opportunity gaps still persist along racial lines. The second is the in-service teacher education context, which - while aiming to support teachers in implementing three post-1994 cycles of curriculum revision - has attracted criticism for having failed to provide appropriate kinds of support, and thus, of largely alienating teachers. The third is the education research context, and particularly mathematics education research, which mostly tells deficit stories both of learner performance and of teacher practice. In relation to each of these contextual aspects, establishing non-exploitative and trusting partnerships with teachers and communities in which meaningful dialogue and joint investigation, informed by a range of stakeholder perspectives, is essential for navigating what might be possible within our current context of a stubbornly persistent education crisis. In this paper I briefly explain each of these aspects. I then share the design of the South African Numeracy Chair Project (SANCP). This project was set up to enable a powerful dialectical relationship between research and development through merging the two in a network that has created multiple opportunities for dialogue across stakeholders, dialogue that has focused on mutual learning towards addressing the challenges of elementary mathematics learning. While beyond the scope of this paper in the presentation I share the learning trajectories of three SANCP participants. I argue that establishing a network of development programs is not just an ethical 'nice to do give-back' to research participants. These partnerships enable access to data and stakeholder perspectives that would be inaccessible without the relationships developed in these spaces of collaboration, thereby strengthening the design of more appropriate research projects and leading to richer and more valid research findings. In these collaborative spaces dialogue and active participation among all participants is critical in the joint enterprise of finding sustainable ways forward to the educational challenges.
Toward a New Understanding of Community-Based Education: The Role of Community-Based Educational Spaces in Disrupting Inequality for Minoritized Youth;"Community-based educational spaces (CBES; afterschool programs, community-based youth organizations, etc.) have a long history of interrupting patterns of educational inequity and continue to do so under the current educational policy climate. The current climate of education, marked by neoliberal education restructuring, has left community-based educational spaces vulnerable in many of the same ways as public schools. Considering the current political moment of deep insecurity within public education, this review of research illuminates the role community-based educational spaces have played in resisting forms of educational inequality and their role in the lives of minoritized youth. With a review of seminal education research on community-based spaces, we intend to capture the ways these diverse out-of-school spaces inform the educational experiences, political identity development, and organizing and activist lives of minoritized youth. Further, this piece contends that reimagining education beyond the borders of the school is a form of resistance, as community-based leaders, youth workers, and youth themselves negotiate the dialectical nature of community-based educational spaces within a capitalist and racialized neoliberal state."
Intersection of Language, Class, Ethnicity, and Policy: Toward Disrupting Inequality for English Language Learners;This chapter proposes a conceptual framework that merges intersectionality and policy analysis as an analytical tool to understand the nuanced, multilayered, compounded educational inequality encountered specifically by low-income, Latino Spanish-speaking students in Arizona K-12 public schools as a function of intersecting educational policies. In addition, it provides a conceptual framework that counters and provides an alternative to the Arizona model that strives toward interrupting inequality. The conceptual framework is grounded in culture, language, and learning that provides a pathway to interrupt inequality by acknowledging the intersectional social constructs of an English language learner (ELL).
The Myth about Universal Higher Education: Russia in the International Context;It is widely believed that higher education in Russia has become almost universal and more people go to universities in Russia compared to most European countries. In this paper we explore this issue empirically with the Russian and European census data and the data from the Trajectories in Education and Careers (TREC), a longitudinal cohort study. According to the 2010 census, only 34% of people aged between 25 and 34 in Russia have university degrees, which is near-ly the same as in most Eastern European countries and slightly fewer than in Western Europe. The TREC data show that only about 50% of 2012 ninth-grade graduates were university students in 2015. The expansion of higher education in Russia has been in line with the overall European trends. Similar to other countries, there have been changes to the gender composition of university students in Russia over the last two decades, with girls being more likely to attend university than boys. The analysis of social backgrounds of students with different educational trajectories reveals a considerable social inequality within the Russian education system. Eighty-four percent of school graduates with university-educated parents are admitted to university, as compared to only 32% of children from less-educated families. Graduation from ninth grade represents an educational fork that is crucial for inequality, as children from less socially advantaged families tend to opt for vocational education at this stage. Graduation from eleventh grade is a less important educational transition: at least 80% of high school students get admitted to university after graduating from 11th grade.
Parental Teaching-to-Read Practices and Children's Reading Literacy in Russia according to PIRLS2011;It is well known that reading literacy of a child is related to the family cultural capital. Parents involvement in their children education is what explains this relationship to a large extent. In this paper, we analyze what teaching practices parents of different cultural capital choose to teach their children to read before school and in the fourth grade. For this purpose, we use PIRLS2011 data. Formal (ABC games, word games, writing) and informal (reading together, discussing a book, storytelling) practices are explored. We find that parents with different level of education choose different teaching-to-read strategies. College-educated parents engage in their children preschool education more often and prefer informal practices. They are also more likely to use a compensation strategy if their children do not attend a kindergarten. Lower-educated parents support their child's reading more actively in the fourth grade. Their preschool support is largely restricted to the reinforcement strategy of involvement in learning-they are more involved if their child attends a kindergarten. This paper also investigates the relationship between various teaching-to-read practices and children's reading literacy before school and at the fourth grade.
A summer of distinction: Exploring the construction of educational advantage outside the academic year;Sociologists of elite education have argued that understanding educational inequality requires looking beyond persistent class-or race-based gaps in academic achievement at the ways in which privileged youth and families construct their advantages. Meanwhile, scholars focused on summer learning have argued that understanding educational achievement requires looking into what happens to youth learning during the summer months. This paper brings these two literatures into contact, calling for inquiry into the multifaceted ways in which educational advantage is constructed during summer. As an initial contribution to this line of inquiry, I present findings from an ethnographic case study of a six-week summer enrichment program at an elite US boarding school. Focusing on daily routines and the language through which participants articulated the value of the program, I apply several established notions about elite schools and educational advantage to the time-space of summer. I then turn to features of Summer Session that suggest unique affordances of a summer program being unlike school, elite or otherwise. This balance - of a summer experience being advantageous when it is both like and unlike school in particular ways - is one of many possible contributions from bringing the sociology of elite education together more fully with out-of-school time research.
Cracks in the Schoolyard: Confronting Latino Educational Inequality;
Equal access to early childhood education in South Korea using the Geographic Information System;While the importance of early childhood education is well documented, scant attention is afforded to the access to institutions for early childhood education. Uneven distribution of institutions for early childhood education in segregated metropolitan areas can cause inequality of educational opportunity. By using the Geographic Information System tools, this paper investigates the extent to which both demand and supply in early childhood education is geographically balanced across Seoul, Korea. The analysis finds that kindergartens and daycare centres authorised by the government are evenly distributed across Seoul according to the demand. Yet, market-oriented English kindergartens are disproportionately concentrated in the southern areas of Seoul where families with higher income levels are clustered. These findings suggest that because market-driven institutions for early childhood education are not uniformly distributed corresponding to the demand, home residence according to parents' income and occupation creates a type of educational inequality.
A Regional Socio-Geographic Atlas of Secondary Education: Can the Power of the Territory Be Surmounted?;A socio-geographic atlas of secondary education in Kaliningrad Oblast has been made after testing new instruments designed for measuring educational inequality at regional and local levels, its reasons and consequences, and the factors affecting its manifestation. The data for the atlas was obtained from open databases on education quality, information on the region's attractiveness as a location for real estate investments provided by real estate agents, and the results of measuring the distance of schools from the hubs of social wellbeing. The main assumption at the base of the study is that the influence of environment (factors external to school) on education quality dominates the importance of internal processes. A comparative analysis of the resulting maps of education and territory quality has revealed not only individual resilient schools and schools that require support but also the low quality zones and socio-geographic anomalies of academic resilience. The article offers methods for studying and overcoming the curse of the territory and educational inequality at regional and local levels.
Educational inequality in the United States: can we reverse the tide?;Educational inequality is a pressing problem in much of the English-speaking world and especially in the United States, as the last three decades have witnessed rising inequality on several measures. This is an appropriate subject for a special issue commemorating the contributions of David Raffe, whose career of scholarship greatly enhanced our understanding of educational inequality. Although research publications on inequality have increased, especially internationally, studies of youth inequality still lag, and studies of ways to reduce inequality are more the exception than the rule. Advancing beyond these trends requires a stronger capacity for research on reducing inequality, including more research funding, more diverse voices calling attention to inequality, and broader and more integrated approaches to studying inequality. These insights are applied in this paper to the case of research on career and technical education (CTE), one of David Raffe's central concerns. We argue that progress in CTE research will require more funding, greater diversity in perspectives and new approaches to scholarship, and enhanced synergies across disciplines and in connecting research and practice.
The benefits of paid employment among persons with common mental health problems: evidence for the selection and causation mechanism;"Objectives The aims of this study were to (i) investigate the impact of paid employment on self-rated health, self-esteem, mastery, and happiness among previously unemployed persons with common mental health problems, and (ii) determine whether there are educational inequalities in these effects. Methods A quasi-experimental study was performed with a two-year follow-up period among unemployed persons with mental health problems. Eligible participants were identified at the social services departments of five cities in The Netherlands when being diagnosed with a common mental disorder, primarily depression and anxiety disorders, in the past 12 months by a physician (N=749). Employment status (defined as paid employment for >= 12 hours/week), mental health [Short Form 12 (SF-12)], physical health (SF-12), self-esteem, mastery, and happiness were measured at baseline, after 12 months and 24 months. The repeated-measurement longitudinal data were analyzed using a hybrid method, combining fixed and random effects. The regression coefficient was decomposed into between-and within-individual associations, respectively. Results The between-individuals associations showed that persons working >= 12 hours per week reported better mental health (b=26.7, SE 5.1), mastery (b=2.7, SE 0.6), self-esteem (b=5.7, SE 1.1), physical health (b=14.6, SE 5.6) and happiness (OR 7.7, 95% CI 2.3-26.4). The within-individual associations showed that entering paid employment for >= 12 hours per week resulted in better mental health (b=16.3, SE 3.4), mastery (b=1.7, SE 0.4), self-esteem (b=3.4, SE 0.7), physical health (b=9.8, SE 2.9), and happiness (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.9). Among intermediate-and high-educated persons, entering paid employment had significantly larger effect on mental health than among low-educated persons. Conclusions This study provides evidence that entering paid employment has a positive impact on self-reported health; thus work should be considered as an important part of health promotion programs among unemployed persons."
Bernstein in the urban classroom: a case study;Despite a long-standing concern within the sociology of education for ameliorating educational inequality, the challenge of improving educational opportunities for disadvantaged students remains deeply entrenched. While macro' issues such as segregation and systemic inequalities in school funding and access to qualified teachers must be addressed as matters of social and educational justice, Basil Bernstein's novel focus on relations within' education as the site of pedagogic discourse offers teachers and those working inside school systems a particularly powerful vision for promoting more equitable outcomes for students. This paper examines this assertion through a case study of the mixed' pedagogical practice of a successful teacher in a fifth-grade urban classroom in the United States.

PATHOLOGIZING THE WHITE UNTEACHABLE: SOUTH LONDON'S WORKING-CLASS BOYS' EXPERIENCES WITH SCHOOLING AND DISCIPLINE;In terms of education attainment in the United Kingdom, the white working class remains the lowest performing ethnic group, and their academic underperformance has ominous implications for their long-term life chances. This chapter investigates how white working-class boys experience pathologization and deficit discourses in their schooling as they negotiate the discipline structures in three educational sites in South London (two state comprehensive schools and one Pupil Referral Unit). Drawing upon empirical data from an in-depth sociological study of 23 white working-class boys (Stahl, 2015), this chapter makes theoretical connections between how pathologization - both within the school and wider society - contributes to how these young men become constructed with and through deficit discourses contributing significantly toward low academic achievement. Where whiteness often equates to power and entitlement, in the schooling contexts of this study whiteness was often socially constructed as undesirable and equated with low aspirations, stagnation, and antieducational stances.
Utilization of extended education offerings at all-day schools in the German-speaking part of Switzerland;There is an expectation that all-day schools - schools that provide regular compulsory school instruction and in addition extended education offerings for voluntary participation - will reduce existing education inequality. This study focuses on whether utilization of extended education offerings varies in dependency on family background (migration background and socioeconomic status) or whether all-day schools are utilized equally by all students. In the framework of the research project EduCare-TaSe - All-Day Schools and School Success? this study examined utilization of extended education offerings in 1,099 students in Grade 1 at 53 all-day schools in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. The main finding is that the odds of utilizing extended education offerings are higher for students with a migration background and, further, that the odds of utilizing extended education offerings increase with higher socioeconomic status. Among children who utilize extended education offerings, intensity of utilization was higher for students with a migration background and for students with low socioeconomic status. But there are no indications that these two (risk) factors mutually influence each other with respect to intensity of utilization. For children at risk in the Swiss education system that have both migration background and low socioeconomic status only an additive effect can be detected.
THE EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES OF TEACHERS IN LARGE CITIES AND THE DIFFERENTIATION OF SCHOOLS;In this article we discuss the strategies used by teachers in job-seeking as one factor behind uneven access levels of higher and lower-achieving schools when hiring qualified teachers. Our central hypothesis is that these job-seeking strategies vary depending on qualification level and professional achievement. Empirical data for the study was collected in Saint Petersburg in schools with varying levels of achievement and prestige. We conducted interviews with teachers (N=49) on their professional biography. For analysis we used two points in an individual teacher's career: the choice of the first school in the teacher's career path and decision-making when switching schools. The results of the study show that several models of job seeking coexist on the teaching job market. We distinguish two narrative perspectives that a teacher may take when telling of her employment. Within an outsider's perspective schools are regarded as organizations that may be potential employers. One model is similar to the market of other qualified jobs, where professionals compete for more or less prestigious positions. The other model, which is more similar to the unqualified job market, is based on the tacit assumption that all schools are equal and places more importance on the workplace's geographical proximity. Within an insider's perspective teachers regard their potential employing schools primarily as professional communities they may wish to join. There are several types of social bonds that may be used by a person seeking employment as a school teacher. These includes seeking a job in a school one has graduated from ('inbreeding') and seeking a job in a school where one's children study. Both strategies may lead to the social background of school's teachers being reproduced. We argue that the job seeking strategies of teachers based on social ties can be understood as a mechanism that supports the movement of qualified teachers to disadvantaged schools.
Does School Admission by Zoning Affect Educational Inequality? A Study of Family Background Effect in Estonia, Finland, and Sweden;We indicate the size of family background effects in Sweden, Finland, and Estonia- countries that differ in both the rhetoric and extensiveness of the system-level school choice policies. Family background effect is defined as the dependence of student achievement on family background characteristics, such as parental education, income, and social status. The number of books at home is used as a proxy when operationalising family background, and its effect is measured as a percentage of individual-level PISA scores. Fixed-effect regression results reveal that family background remains a powerful determinant in the educational results of 15-year-old students in all three cases, being largest in Sweden. Furthermore, we show how the family background effect is moderated by school-level choice policy, that is, how students and schools are matched. The analysis reveals that zoning policies have statistically significant negative effects on the impact of the family background effect, independent of country-level policies.
The Importance of the Family in the Educational Attendance and Success of Children with a Migration Background in Germany;In contrast to autochthonous children, children with a migration background achieve poorer results at every level of the educational system in Germany. They gain access to pre-school education later, are more likely to be deferred before entering school, achieve lower levels already in elementary school levels and less often obtain recommendation to attend a secondary school. These ethnic disparities continue through post-secondary education. This research addresses the question of the extent to which family background is relevant to educational attendance and success of children and young adults with a migration background. The literature review is based on findings relating to ethnic disparities and inequality in Germany. The theoretical basis is the structural and individualistic approach of Boudon (1974), who identified differences in the origin of children and young adults as a consequence of social inequality. Following the educational trajectories in Germany in a chronological way, this paper starts with pre-school education, then focuses on elementary and secondary education before concluding with a consideration of post-secondary education.
Mass Incarceration in California Counties: A Mechanism for Educational Inequality;Although there is substantial evidence of the negative effects of being incarcerated or having a father imprisoned, there is little research on the spillover effects created by the concentration of incarceration within disadvantaged communities. This article addresses this limitation by investigating the association between mass incarceration and the educational outcomes of all Black and White children living in a community where many of its members were incarcerated across counties within California from 2009 to 2013.
Egypt: inequality of opportunity in education;The paper examines the levels and trends in access to education and educational outcomes across generations of Egyptian youth. Examination of four cohorts of individuals aged 25-29 shows that, although basic education has democratized, some inequities in access to general secondary and college education have persisted over the past 25 years. The analysis of test scores from TIMSS and national examinations in the late 2000s shows that more than a quarter of learning outcome inequality is attributable to circumstances beyond the control of a student, such as parental education, socioeconomic background, and birthplace. The high level of overall achievement inequality observed makes inequities in learning opportunities between Egyptian youth high compared to other countries in absolute levels. Moreover, learning gaps among pupils from different backgrounds appear at early grades. High and unequal levels of household expenditures in private tutoring and tracking into vocational and general secondary schools that depend on high stakes examination substantially contribute to unequal learning outcomes.

Gender-specific Grading? The Influence of Behavioral Features as Evaluated by Teachers on Grading;This paper investigates the role of teacher-rated work habits and social behavior on school grades during primary schooling. Based on the German school law it is shown that teachers' scope of discretion might be an indication for gender differences in grading. We use longitudinal data from the study Competence development and educational trajectories within the school system (KOALA-S). Our results show that in contrast to social behavior, work habits have a substantial positive effect on grades in both major subjects, German and mathematics. While gender differences for grades in German are completely mediated by work habits, there remains a gender gap to the disadvantage of girls for grades in mathematics. We discuss our results with regard to possible processes of gender-stereotyping in grading and related consequences for the subject-specific self-perception of girls.
Technological literacy for teachers;"Ongoing developments in educational technologies place increasing demands on teachers who have to make decisions on a daily basis concerning how, when, and where to make use of technologies in classrooms. Building on results from the Danish project Technucation, this paper argues that there is a marked need for a teacher-specific version of the technological literacy developed by the International Technology Education Association (ITEA). ITEA defines technological literacy as the ability to use, manage, assess, and understand technology'. The Technucation project found that teachers were not simply in need of knowledge about how to manage technical challenges, they would also benefit from awareness of how new technologies change relations, identities, and complex power structures. The paper explicitly addresses this issue of the new skills and analytic capabilities that teachers need in order to engage effectively with technological development. The type of enhanced technological literacy teachers may benefit from is represented in the paper through its presentation of the TECS-model, developed in the course of the Technucation project: hands-on skills in handling Technology (T); capability to analyse changes in Engaged relationships (E); capability to analyse Complex power-informed pathways (C); and capability to analyse long-term Shifts in professional identities (S). The paper argues that attention to all of these areas should be included in the education of technological literacy to pre-service teachers."
Ahead of the pack? Explaining the unequal distribution of scholarships in Germany;This article investigates to what extent scholarships are unequally distributed among students in Germany and how these inequalities can be explained. Following sociological theory, the article argues that elites seek qualitative ways of distinguishing themselves in a mass higher education system. Using student surveys, we demonstrate that class effects cannot merely be explained with reference to class differences in academic achievement but that higher classes have better access to scholarships independent of earlier school performance. Class differences were particularly persistent when the intermediate classes were compared with higher classes with more education. These findings illustrate that social classes have different strategies when it comes to participating in higher education and suggest that information about and access to scholarships is important in gaining a class advantage.
The operation of grade retention and educational inequality: who gets retained in Macao and why?;While the existence of a class, gender, or ethnic gap in educational attainment is well documented for many societies, how the practice of grade retention contributes to these patterns of educational inequality has been inadequately addressed. Given that grade retention is commonly practised in Macao, Macao is used as a case for illustration. Using data from PISA 2009 and a qualitative research project, we seek to demonstrate how inadequate state regulation could make possible the manipulation of grade retention institutionally and individually in Macao. This, in turn, illustrates how the specific contextualized structural operation of grade retention could serve as a mechanism for social differentiation and thus play a role in contributing to the observed educational inequality.
Social inequality in access to higher education: grade inflation in private schools and the ineffectiveness of compensatory education;"Access to higher education is affected by inequalities worldwide. Here we present a longitudinal study based on large databases of scores in upper secondary education and access to higher education in Portugal. Our findings show how access to higher education builds on and reinforces social inequalities: (1) private, fee-paying secondary schools inflate their students' scores; (2) this inflation unfairly improves their chances of accessing higher education; (3) the Portuguese national compensatory education programme is ineffective in bridging the gap in academic performance between the less privileged and the rest of the schools. This study, then, provides further insights into how the upper classes are disproportionately benefited by the massification of higher education. To achieve greater equity, issues such as the State supervision of grading practices, the assessment and reconfiguration of compensatory education programmes, and the admission process into higher education have to be addressed."
The Influence of Teachers' Competency Test Score Inequality, Government Expenditure in Education Sector, and Specific Allocation Fund of Education Against National Exam Inequality in Indonesia;In the end of 2015 is the time for Indonesia to enter the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) that will integrate with 10 Southeast Asia countries. AEC itself is expected can bring Indonesian economy to be better by expanding the market share. The applicability of AEC not only affects the free trade sectors, but also makes a various workers from ASEAN countries can compete to fill a variety sectors across the ASEAN countries. To be able to compete with other ASEAN countries, Indonesia must have qualified human resources. One of the ways that could be done is through the development of education in Indonesia in order to make high quality human resources. Meanwhile there are still a lot of inequality in Indonesia, both educational inequality and economic inequality itself. This study aims to determine the inequality of education and economic development within the framework of the preparation of AEC. The research methods used are descriptive statistics and statistical inference to know the relationships between the variables. The variables are National Exam on the other variables: Teachers' Competency Test score, government expenditure in education sector (GE), Specific Allocation Fund of education. The study was conducted in 33 provinces of Indonesia in 2012-2013. From the results of the estimation using Eviews 7 software, are known that economic inequality education inequality variable positively affects UN inequality.
Educational inequality and its relationship to income distribution in the Mexican states;"This paper addresses the issue of educational inequality in Mexico quantifying the Gini coefficients for education by state for 2015; then this data is used as input to inquire about the relationship between inequality in the distribution of quarterly household income and the degree of educational inequality in these entities, using the ordinary least squares method. The results suggest the existence of deep inequality gaps between entities, locating the most adverse conditions in Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero and Michoacan. Also a minor influence of educational inequality on income inequality in the Mexican states is proven."
Educational Inequality in Apartheid South Africa;In this article, I explore the utility of effectively maintained inequality theory in examining educational inequality in South Africa at the end of the apartheid era. As an obviously unequal country, South Africa provides an excellent opportunity to test the claim that even with large quantitative differences in achievement, qualitative differences will matter. Using data from the early 1990s, I find that there were extensive quantitative differences in secondary school transitions across respondents in different racial categories. The minority White population was consistently able to achieve both more and better education. At the same time, though, qualitative distinctions mattered. For the majority of the population, particularly Africans, the quality of education attained varied across parental background. These outcomes are important not only for examining the veracity of effectively maintained inequality, both in terms of racial and class differences but also because they illustrate how educational differences have served to perpetuate inequality over time in a society that no longer allows for the explicit denial of opportunity by race.
Seven Principles for Assessing Effectively Maintained Inequality;Effectively maintained inequality (EMI) was proposed as a general theory of inequality, but the theory flows from a decades-long tradition of studying social background effects on educational attainment. After an orienting discussion of several historic challenges of the study of social background effects on educational inequality, proposed and adopted solutions to those challenges, and subsequent critiques of those solutions, we offer and justify seven principles that, if followed, produce a solid assessment of EMI. After conveying the seventh principle, two illustrative ways in which EMI addresses historic challenges with studying inequality are conveyed.
Immediate Context, Life Experiences, and Perception: How Do Rural Migrants in Urban China Perceive an Unfair Policy?;"This article examines how rural migrants in China perceive a policy that deprives their children of the opportunity for a high school or college education. In-depth interviews with migrant families in Shanghai reveal that many remain unconvinced that the future of their children is strongly affected by this policy. Rather, they devalue the importance of formal education and emphasize individual effort and alternative pathways to success. By drawing on theories of cognition and the sociology of understanding, I argue that their perceptions of this policy are formed through three processes of validation: recognition of certain views by authorities such as school teachers, social workers, and the media; corroboration with the daily experiences of living in a modern city; and resonance with past experience. This study asserts the importance of immediate context and overall everyday life experiences in shaping perception toward policies. This case also provides insight as to how structural oppression that situates certain individuals in disadvantaged positions is subtly achieved through mechanisms at the microlevel."
Transition from school-based training in VET;Purpose - This paper assesses the drop-out rate among disadvantaged students within vocational education and training. The purpose of this paper is to examine the probability of dropping out after school-based training for child welfare clients - a particularly disadvantaged group of youth. Child welfare clients' drop-out rate is compared with students from a representative sample of their peers. Design/methodology/approach - Average marginal effects were calculated from multinomial logistic regression models. Data were from public registries (n = 10,535). Findings - The results show that differences in observed characteristics cannot explain differences in drop-out rates between child welfare clients and the majority peers. It is argued that this drop-out rate is likely a result of employers favoring apprenticeship applicants who are similar to them or that child welfare clients lack networks, which previous research has identified as crucial in finding an apprenticeship. Practical implications - The results suggest a need for action targeting disadvantaged youths in the transition that follows school-based training. Originality/value - The paper adds to the very scarce literature on transition from school-based learning to apprenticeships.
The determinants of repetition rates in Europe.: Early skills or subsequent parents' help?;"In this paper, we examine the factors that are associated with the probability for a student to be retained in primary school; understanding such phenomenon is very important, because the literature points at claiming that retention perpetrates socioeconomic and educational inequality, instead of reducing it. Empirically, we estimate a multivariate logistic regression with the aim of identifying cross-country determinants of grade retention using data about 16 European countries participating in PIRLS 2011 using data about entry age at school and grade enrollment to identify retained students. Our results highlight that socioeconomic background is not the only factor that plays a role. Early-acquired skills do reduce the probability for a child to become a repeater; thus, the policy-makers should devote their effort in helping families to undertake preschool activities that develop skills also before starting formal schooling. Later assistance with homework is helpful as well, but with a lower magnitude and effect, which is offset if early skills are properly accounted for. (C) 2016 The Society for Policy Modeling.

Families, Schools, and Student Achievement Inequality: A Multilevel MIMIC Model Approach;This article examines inequality in different dimensions of student academic achievement (math, science, and reading) by family background and school context in three East Asian (Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea) and three Western (United States, Germany, and the Czech Republic) nations. Building on Hauser (2009), we develop a novel multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) model with a two-level hierarchical linear modeling specification, which allows us to explicitly test whether the several academic achievement constructs respond similarly to variation in family background and variation among schools and countries. The two-level MIMIC model is specified in detail and applied to 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment data. The analysis reveals new empirical insights, such as substantive differences within countries in performance inequality by subject, particularly among East Asian countries. While the data do not support the view of a virtuous relationship between excellence and equity in education, nor do they lend strong support to a vicious relationship either.
Occupational segregation and earnings inequality: Rural migrants and local workers in urban China;This article examines the central role of occupation as the reward packages in creating earnings disparities between rural migrants and local workers in urban China's labor markets. Analyses of data from the population mini-census of China in 2005 show that, rural migrants' earnings disadvantages are largely attributable to occupational segregation (between-occupation variation) by workers' household registration status (hukou) rather than unequal pay within the same occupations, but surprisingly they enjoy a slight earnings advantage in lower-status occupations (within-occupation variation). Even after controlling for education and other characteristics, occupational segregation by hukou status continues to exist. The occupational segregation is the most severe in government agencies/state institutions and the least severe in the private sector, leading to earnings disparities between rural migrants and urban local workers in different work unit sectors. Our findings shed new light on how government discriminatory policies could affect occupational segregation and thereby create inequality among social groups in urban China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Key concepts: education policy, economic necessity and education reform;The Government believes that we need to reform our school system to tackle educational inequality, which has widened in recent years, and to give greater powers to parents and pupils to choose a good school. We want to ensure high standards of discipline in the classroom, robust standards and the highest quality teaching. We also believe that the state should help parents, community groups and others come together to improve the education system by starting new schools. (Cabinet Office, 2010, p 28)

Education systems, school segregation, and second-generation immigrants' educational success: Evidence from a country-fixed effects approach using three waves of PISA;Many countries are increasingly being challenged to integrate their growing immigrant populations. A major key to successful integration is the educational attainment of immigrant offspring. According to the results of comparative studies, second-generation immigrant students often lag behind their non-immigrant counterparts even though the host countries perform very differently with respect to the education of immigrant offspring. This study investigates how the interplay between the degrees of stratification and standardization in education systems and the degree of ethnic school segregation affects the performance gap between non-immigrant and second-generation immigrant students in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Based on data from three waves of the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study (2003, 2006, and 2009), this article presents a country fixed effects approach to analyzing repeated cross-sectional data by investigating how changes in education policies and institutional contexts are associated with non-immigrant-immigrant reading performance gap. Between-school stratification was associated with lower performance of second-generation immigrants relative to native students, particularly when paired with ethnic school segregation, whereas within-school stratification (ability grouping) was associated with higher relative performance of the immigrant students. In addition, the non-native students benefited from less standardization of educational input, because performance gaps were smaller when a country's educational resources were distributed unequally.
Who Benefits from the Possibilities of Correction in Secondary School?;Based on SOEP (German Socio-Economic Panel) data this paper analyzes late student transfers to school types that lead to a university entrance qualification. In addition, possible variations between the states of Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia, which differ in the openness of their school structures, are examined. The central questions are whether greater educational opportunity leads to a lessening of the educational inequalities which were found to exist for these students at the beginning of secondary school and whether the school systems of the four states differ in this regard. The analysis of educational inequalities distinguishes between a conditional and an unconditional perspective. The empirical results show that there is no strengthening of the effects of social origin during the students' school careers. In fact, young people with a migration background tend to be able to reduce their disadvantages. Overall, the four states differ only marginally with respect to origin effects. However, in general, young people in Baden-Wuerttemberg seem to enjoy better advancement opportunities than in the other states.
Educational stratification after a decade of reforms on higher education access in Brazil;The policies Brazil has implemented in the last decade to increase social inclusion-based on both socioeconomic status and race-might have reduced the educational disadvantages associated with being non-white and poor. Recent research on Latin America has found a strengthening of the association between social origin and educational attainment-at least for early educational transitions-among cohorts who grew up in the 1980s, and a weakening of the association for cohorts growing up in the 2000s. This pattern aligns with signs of declining economic inequality in the continent. However, the decline in economic inequality coupled with an unprecedented expansion of education, including higher education, would suggest a weakening of the influence of social origin on educational opportunity for multiple educational transitions, not only early transitions. The goal of this paper is to examine recent changes in educational inequality by social origin and race in Brazil. We use a unique nationally representative data set collected by ILO in 2013 from respondents age 21-29 to answer the following two questions: As Brazil achieved universal enrollment in primary education and consistently high enrollment levels in secondary education, have the effects of social origin on secondary schooling entrance, secondary schooling completion and college access changed? Has the extent of the non-white disadvantage in education declined for younger cohorts? We provide the first assessment of inequality of opportunity in late educational transitions conducted after these key changes in Brazilian educational policy. The results show that while younger cohorts enjoy more egalitarian educational opportunities relative to older cohorts, important bottlenecks linked to persistent inequalities based on both social origin and race remain, particularly for the completion of secondary schooling.

Weapons of the dissatisfied? Perceptions of socioeconomic inequality, redistributive preference, and political protest: Evidence from South Korea;This paper explores how perceptions of socioeconomic inequality, attitudes about redistribution, and experiences of social upward mobility shape the level of participation in political protests. The dramatic widening of income inequality in Korean society since the 2007 financial breakdown and the new surge of political protests has continued to attract attention. However, scholars have not clearly examined how Korean views about socioeconomic inequality and redistribution affect political activism in protests. This study reflects on the hypotheses of the grievance theory and the resource theory, and investigates survey data to explore whether dissatisfaction with inequality and attitudes about redistribution have a systematic impact on the level of political activism in protests. Using data from the 2009 South Korea Social Survey Program, this study concludes that dissatisfaction with income disparity, dissatisfaction with educational inequality, and redistributive preferences, have a systematic impact in fostering active political engagement in protests.
Understanding Hypergamous Marriages of Chinese Rural Women;In China, hypergamy is a socially desirable marriage but an understudied topic. Less has been written on how personal traits and structural factors are intertwined to shape such marriage. Using national-survey data and employing a binary endogenous regressor probit model, this paper investigates three forms of hypergamous marriages: women marrying men from more prosperous families, women marrying men who are more economically established, and women marrying men with an urban hukou. We assess the interaction of ascribed and achieved personal traits with institutional factors in explaining these upward marriages. Particular attention is paid to the role of hukou status in the making of hypergamy. Our results suggest that most of rural women have to stick to endogamy within their socioeconomic category. Ascribed and achieved traits work on marital outcomes in different ways in the changing socioeconomic contexts, mediated by the endogeneity of hukou status conversion. The likelihood of hypergamous marriages of Chinese women is largely constrained by the role of hukou status.
Educational inequalities in hypertension: complex patterns in intersections with gender and race in Brazil;"Background: Hypertension is a major public health issue worldwide, but knowledge is scarce about its patterns and its relationship to multiple axes of social disadvantages in Latin American countries. This study describes the educational inequality in the prevalence of hypertension in Brazil, including a joint stratification by gender and race. Methods: We analyzed interview-based data and blood pressure measurements from 59,402 participants aged 18 years or older at the 2013 Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS). Sociodemographic characteristics analyzed were gender (male, female), racial self-identification (white, brown, black), age (5-years intervals), and educational attainment (pre-primary, primary, secondary, tertiary). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmHg, and/ or self-reported use of antihypertensive medications in the last 2 weeks. We used logistic regression to evaluate the age-adjusted prevalences of hypertension (via marginal modeling), and pair-wise associations between education level and odds of hypertension. Further, the educational inequality in hypertension was summarized through the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and the Slope Index of Inequality (SII). All analyses considered the appropriate sampling weights and intersections with gender, race, and education. Results: Age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 34.0 % and 30.8 % among men and women, respectively. Black and brown women had a higher prevalence than whites (34.5 % vs. 31.8 % vs. 29.5 %), whereas no racial differences were observed among men. White and brown, but not black women, showed graded inverse associations between hypertension and educational attainment; among men, non-statistically significant associations were observed in all racial strata. The RII and SII estimated inverse gradients among white (RII = 2.5, SII = 18.1 %) and brown women (RII = 2. 3, SII = 14.5 %), and homogeneous distributions of hypertension in educational subgroups among black women and among men. Conclusion: In this representative sample of Brazilian adults, the association between educational attainment and hypertension was influenced by gender and race -a topic still poorly understood. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing intersections of multiple sociodemographic characteristics in health inequalities research. The use of comprehensive measures of inequality, such as RII and SII, provide useful insights for monitoring health inequalities in an intersectional perspective."

Polarisation of high-performing and low-performing secondary schools in Victoria, Australia: an analysis of causal complexities;Applying qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), this study explores the configurations of conditions that contribute to the polarisation of high-performing and low-performing secondary schools in Victoria, Australia. It is argued that the success and failure of schools can be understood in terms of causal complexity, where one or several configurations of conditions can cause a given outcome. The study identifies that there is no single condition alone that produces high or low performance. However, the study does reveal the existence of multiple configurations or causal relations that tend to produce school success or school failure. Relative to the dataset considered in this study, three configurations related to success and almost twice that many configurations underpinning failure are identified. The polarisation of the high-performing and low-performing schools and persistent inequality are complex phenomena. This study presents QCA as a useful and alternative methodology for researchers to uncover such complex phenomena over and above large-scale quantitative and classical analysis.
The risk of delayed school entry in relation to migration background in different institutional settings Can reformed school entry procedures buffer ethnic educational inequality at school start?;In Germany, children of immigrants are faced with delayed school entry about twice as often as children of native-born parents because they are more often diagnosed not being ready for school. We investigate these early educational inequalities, focusing on the interplay of individual competencies and the institutional context in terms of the school enrollment procedure. We compare the conventional procedure, where school enrollment is supposed to be bound on school readiness, with reformed procedures where school enrollment is not supposed to be bound on school readiness. Data of school entry examinations from Hesse, Germany from 2008-2012 are analyzed (N = 50,717). The results show that children of immigrants from all origin groups have a substantially higher risk of obtaining a recommendation for delayed school entry than children of native-born parents. However, these ethnic differences are strongly reduced in the reformed procedures as compared to the conventional school enrollment procedure, indicating that these procedures could be an effective measure to reduce ethnic educational inequalities at school start.
Racialized classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school: the silencing, disparagement, and discipline of students of color;In both Europe and the US, racial and ethnic minority students experience discrimination at the hands of teachers that negatively impacts academic achievement. In the US, scholars have documented how a predominantly white teaching force racializes students of color through discipline and low expectations, which impact educational attainment. But in Europe, the denial of race's existence hinders research regarding structural explanations for minority educational inequality and often explains low educational attainment as a function of cultural differences. Examining classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school, this article documents racializing mechanisms that found minority students disproportionately disparaged, disciplined, and silenced. In addition, many were students under-recommended to higher level secondary school tracks. These findings reveal that Dutch schools are not racially meritocratic institutions and are relevant for scholars in the Netherlands and all other nations with educational institutions dominated by colorblind ideologies, white norms, and large immigrant populations.
The Socioeconomic Determinations of the Distribution of School Learning. The TERCE Data;Based on the data from the Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (Tercer Estudio Regional Comparativo y Explicativo, TERCE), the degree of educational inequality, defined as the strength of the association between the socioeconomic and cultural levels of the students' families and the performance on math and reading standard tests, is analyzed in this study. The correlations between the results in math and reading tests of students in 6th grade, and the indicators of both the socioeconomic level of the students' families and the socioeconomic composition of the schools, are analyzed. Multilevel models of three levels (country, school and student) are used. The analysis also allows to estimate the extent to which the school factors may influence the unequal distribution of learning. The study concludes that the socioeconomic composition of student population in school is the main factor explaining the inequalities in performance among schools. After discounting the effect of socioeconomic variables, the proportion of learning inequalities that could be affected by the proper educational variables is drastically reduced in the countries participating in the TERCE as a whole. The image for the countries as a whole is also observed for most of the participating countries.
Adult education and the challenges of regional development: Policy and sustainability in North Denmark;Adult education is governed at many levels - internationally, nationally and locally. The authors of this paper look at the challenges, structures and practices of adult education policy at the local level, more specifically in North Denmark (Northern Jutland), one of the five administrative regions of the Danish nation-state. In many ways, the current educational challenges in this remote region of Europe are similar to what can be observed worldwide and especially in countries which are generally considered welfare states. The authors see the growing social and educational divide between the region's peripheral areas and its largest city centre as a major challenge - for society as a whole and for adult education in particular. It is from this perspective that the authors describe the present structures of adult education in the region and the strategies employed by local authorities and educational institutions. This is followed by an evaluation of both structures and efforts in terms of their ability to cope with the challenges.
Dead Languages as an Profitable Investment?;How does the selection of a classical language at school affect prospects on the labor market? Even though research on the impact of horizontal educational inequalities on labor market outcomes has become prominent recently, this question has not yet attracted scholarly attention. Based on several differing approaches (Human Capital Theory, Signaling Theory, Homophily Principle), hypotheses are derived about the impact of the language profile at school on labor market prospects at career entry. To test these assumptions, a field experiment was conducted in which applications were submitted in response to job advertisements. Results show that choosing Latin and Ancient Greek has a positive impact on the chances of being invited to a job interview.
Reformist Distractions and Educational Labor: Two Perspectives on Paying for Grades;In this essay Bryan Warnick examines two recent analyses of the practice of paying students for grades, with a focus on educational justice. Philosopher Derrick Darby argues against cash-for-grades programs on the grounds that such programs leave educational inequality intact. Warnick contends that Darby's arguments are incomplete. Increasing levels of educational adequacy is morally desirable, Warnick argues, even if inequality remains unchanged. There is also an obligation to engage in localized practice reforms that benefit small groups of disadvantaged students, even if such reforms do not change the structural problems that lead to inequality. At the same time, engaging in a close analysis of cash as an incentive does reveal specific reasons why the inequality that persists under cash-for-grades might be particularly troublesome. In contrast to Darby, Alexander Sidorkin argues that paying students for learning is not only allowed, but ethically obligatory. Schooling, for Sidorkin, is a form of labor and labor demands fair compensation. Warnick challenges the idea that schooling is a form of exploited labor by looking across a range of issues, including the nonpecuniary benefits of schooling. At the same time, it seems that schooling could become a form of exploited labor, given current trends. Overall, the justice of cash incentive programs remains an open question. The essay concludes with a discussion about how we can move forward with a philosophical analysis of cash-for-grades programs.
Is plurality renounced in educational research?;"This paper discusses whether research following PISA might constrain the plurality of empirical and theoretical approaches in empirical educational research. The significance of plurality in the field of science is reviewed initially; followed by the paper's central thesis. It is argued that qualitative and new quantitative empirical educational research seldom considers each other in key areas of the field, e.g. investigations on educational inequality. Though, 'dimming out' perspective-wise is marked rather a distinct feature of new quantitative educational research. Using the example of research on selection-based learning environments, students' habitus and the family's role in educational inequality, it is shown how a reflected linkage of both perspectives and mutual reception can be substantially beneficial to the findings of both paradigms."
Presentation and interpretation of PISA results in the light of evidence base;This paper investigates the presentation and interpretation of PISA results by educational researchers, whereby the topics Development of student performance in international comparison, Social background and competence acquisition, Acquisition of competencies of students with a migration background and Identification of a risk group were selected for analysis. The findings indicate that the presentation and interpretation of PISA results by educational researchers do not provide a solid basis for evidence-based educational policy: the researchers present different and partially contradictory interpretations, as well as various and partial incompatible recommendations. Moreover, particular results are not robust, and concerning some research areas the embedding into competing findings is not offered. In view of this analysis, the paper closes with a skeptical appraisal regarding the concept of evidence-based educational policy.
From a virtuous cycle of rural-urban education to urban-oriented rural basic education in China: An explanation of the failure of China's Rural School Mapping Adjustment policy;This paper explores the historical transformation of the rural education system and the mapping of rural schools in ancient, modern and contemporary China to explain the problems of the Rural School Mapping Adjustment (RSMA) policy. The value and purpose of the rural basic education system and school mapping adjustment are urban priority and urban oriented, which is the fundamental reason for the failure of the RSMA. A diachronic study of the history of China's urban-rural relationship indicates that the relationship of traditional China's urban-rural education was a virtuous cycle in which the city and the countryside were completely equal and reinforced each other. The promotion of modern education in the late Qing Dynasty severely undermined that virtuous cycle, leading to an urban-oriented rural education and the destruction of traditional values and a loss of the traditional ways of teaching. Although China has attempted to reduce the disparity between cities and the countryside by increasing the public financial investment in rural basic education after achieving a universal basic education, our case study in a village in North China demonstrates that the urban-oriented school mapping adjustment takes a toll on the rural area and exacerbates the problem of educational inequality, which actually increases the gap between urban and rural areas and between the rich and the poor. The conclusion is reached that the Chinese government should strive to develop a rural-oriented and rights-based rural basic education system and school mapping adjustment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Educational Inequality, Educational Expansion and Intergenerational Mobility (May, pg , 2016);
Educational Inequality, Educational Expansion and Intergenerational Mobility;The distribution of education by social background and the mobility prospects of society are intimately connected. To begin to predict future trends in mobility in the UK we bring together evidence on educational inequality by family background for cohorts from 1958 to 2000 for a range of educational outcomes. There is evidence that educational inequalities have narrowed among recent cohorts as the overall level of educational achievement has increased. This could be promising for mobility provided the labour market returns to these qualifications are maintained. However, stubborn inequalities by background at higher attainment levels imply that narrowing inequalities and expanding equality of opportunity throughout the educational distribution is a difficult task.
Absolute and relative educational inequalities in obesity among adults in Tehran: Findings from the Urban HEART study-2;Background: The prevalence of obesity is increasing in Iran. Previous studies showed mixed results in relation to association between socioeconomic status and obesity in the country. The current study aimed to examine educational inequalities among adults in Tehran in 2011. Method: Data on 90,435 persons 18 years and older from Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART-2) were analyzed. The Slope Index of Inequality( SII) and the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) were used for assessing educational inequalities in obesity. These measures were quantified using generalized linear models for the binomial family adjusted for sex and age. Subgroup analysis was conducted across sex, age groups and the 22 districts of Tehran. Results: Both SII and RII showed substantial educational inequalities in obesity in favour of more educated adults [RII and SII (95% CI were equal to 2.91 (2.71-3.11) and 0.12 (0.12-0.13)), respectively]. These educational inequalities were persistent even after adjusting for employment, marital status and smoking. Subgroup analysis revealed that educational inequalities were more profound among women. While among men educational inequalities were generally increasing with age, an inverse trend was observed among women. Educational inequalities were observed within all 22 districts of Tehran and generally there were no statistically significant differences between districts. Conclusion: An inverse association between education and obesity was observed in the current study. To decrease educational inequalities in Tehran, priority should be given to younger women and older men. Further analyses are needed to explain these inequalities.

Youth and High School: the contrast between two fragments of the Argentine education system;I intend to address the problem of educational inequality, which is strongly related to the issue of inclusion and exclusion of young people, as part of a fragmented educational system and a spatial or territorially segregated society. It seeks to make a comparison between the educational experiences of young people from two fragments of the Argentine educational system from the point of the socio-cultural perspective. Four interviews are taken as empirical elements done to people related to an educational institution called elite educational institution: it is a school located in a country of Berazategui (Buenos Aires, Argentina), and it is compared to what bibliography refers about vulnerable sectors in society
The under-recognition of the significance of social class conceptions of education in Piketty's Capital;Piketty's Capital has created enormous interest around the world, not least in educational circles. One reason for this may be his readiness to refer, in a book largely focused on economic history, to the ways that education has, and might, contribute to better and more equal social outcomes. This article welcomes this approach, but argues that Piketty's suggestions remain somewhat limited due to his adherence to a more or less distributional, rather than relational, approach, and then sets out to address this issue by arguing that the assumption that it is the distribution of credentials which accounts for their contribution is mistaken. Instead, the article advances arguments which recognize the separate contributions of the content of credentials, and their valorization. The main focus of this article is thus on the different ways educational credentials are realized, which, it is argued, is a major basis for the maintenance of educational inequality.
Parental Choice of School, Class Strategies, and Educational Inequality: An Essay Review of School Choice in ChinaA Different Tale?;Given the increasingly global nature of marketized school choice policies, this makes it even more crucial to investigate how the multiple scales, forms, and emphases of school choice in different countries are influenced by particular political, economic, and cultural conditions. While much of the critical research on school choice policies has focused on examining the complex processes of school choice in the education market in Western contexts, this essay review of School Choice in China applies Bourdieu's concepts of capital and conversion strategies to demonstrate the practices of market-based parental choice in China.The essay highlights the importance of the recontextualization of school choice within the Chinese historical, political, economic, and social landscape in order to better understand how choice policy is interpreted differently in the Chinese context. Such historical and social specificities include, but are not limited to, the Chinese government's insufficient investment in education, the existing key school system, and significant social class changes in contemporary China.
Who Joins Teach For America and Why? Insights Into the Typical Recruit in an Urban School District;Building upon previous research on how personal and demographic characteristics of teachers are correlated with larger issues in teacher recruitment and retention, this study contributes unique insight into the personal attributes, characteristics, and career aspirations of new teachers brought into teaching in Los Angeles through the Teach For America program. Drawing from ethnographic interviews with 25 current Teach For America teachers, this study finds that teachers in this study perceive themselves as embodying personal characteristics that prior research would support as less common among teachers in urban schools: That is, they see themselves as being competitive, high-performing, and enthusiastically committed to ending educational inequality. However, these participants tend to come from privileged backgrounds and colleges and consequently view their time teaching in urban schools as an interim period before pursuing other more high prestige careers. Implications of these findings are discussed.
Opportunity without Equity: Educational Inequality and Constitutional Protections in Egypt;The claim that the law can be an inequality-reducing weapon is a staple of legal and political discourse. Although it is hard to dispute that legal provisions sometimes work to reduce inequality, we argue that, at least in the domain of equal opportunity in education, the pattern of these effects can be more perverse than has typically been appreciated. Positive laws implemented in the name of promoting equality of opportunity may yield only a narrowly formal equality, with the goal of substantive equality undermined because a high-profile reform will often expose the pathway to educational success. The pathway, once exposed, can then be navigated and successfully subverted by the socioeconomically advantaged. We illustrate such pitfalls of a positive legal approach by examining educational inequality in Egypt, a country with long-standing constitutional protections for equality of opportunity in education. Using data recently collected from a cohort of young people, we show that despite the institutional commitments to equality of opportunity present in Egypt, privileged families have a range of options for subverting the aims of positive legal provisions. We argue that the pattern of educational inequality in Egypt is distinctive relative to countries without similar legal protections.
Behavioral and statistical models of educational inequality;This article addresses the question of how students and their families make educational decisions. We describe three types of behavioral model that might underlie decision-making, and we show that they have consequences for what decisions are made. Our study, thus, has policy implications if we wish to encourage students and their families to make better educational choices. We also establish the conditions under which empirical analysis can distinguish between the three sorts of decision-making, and we illustrate our arguments using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study.
Exclusion from school and recognition of difference;There has been an overall decrease in exclusion rates and numbers in recent years across the UK. This change has often been heralded as evidence that national inclusion policies are working' and that schools themselves are becoming increasingly inclusive. This article examines findings from a recent study on school exclusion in Wales, noting that exclusion is falling here in line with UK wide trends. However, exclusion rates of children with special needs and others who face multiple disadvantages remain stubbornly high. Given these findings, and the evidence that this is the case across the UK, an important question arises about the broader relationship between school exclusion and inequality. This article seeks to address this question, and asks whether and to what extent the politics of recognition of difference, in Nancy Fraser's terms, can help explain the continuing over-representation of some groups of marginalised and vulnerable children in exclusion figures, despite this overall downward trend.
Educational inequality among Chinese urban schools: the business ethics of private schools;This study explores the institutional history of the urban school system in Chinese cities and tries to explicate the complex social, economic, political and institutional forces over recent decades that help to create such a divergent pattern among urban schools. To do so, it first reviews the origins of modern Chinese education, market reform in 1980s and 1990s, an increase of migrant workers in big cities, and subsequent institutional changes in Chinese urban schools. A key characteristic of Chinese urban schools is unequal provision of public education between legal residents and migrant workers. The state has played a crucial role in the change of Chinese urban schools by allowing private schools for the children of migrant workers. Private schools, focusing on a manufacturing model of reducing costs and streamlining the education production process, are highly profitable businesses. However, the business ethics run contrary to the values of public education, ignoring necessary educational conditions and the bond between teachers and students in the process of education. Private schools for migrant students, therefore, stand in sharp contrast to the good public schools that are mainly for city residents.
Do migrant children benefit from migrant teachers?;This paper tests the assumption that a stronger presence of migrant teachers in preschool can help to reduce ethnic disadvantages and contribute to more equality of opportunity. To this end, migrant children who are taught by teachers with a migration background are compared to those who are confronted with only autochthonous teachers in their day-care centre. The outcome variables include competencies in German language, mathematics, science, as well as social competencies of the children. In addition, the study investigates the contact frequency of migrant parents with the day care centre to test whether contact is enhanced in centres which employ migrant teachers. Contrary to expectations, propensity score matching analyses based on the Kindergarten cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) show that migrant children do not achieve higher competencies when being taught by migrant teachers. Similarly, contact to migrant parents is not improved. More teachers with a migration background will hardly reduce ethnic disadvantages in educational outcomes.
Gamoran Comment on Downey and Condron;
The Informational Significance of A-F School Accountability Grades;Background/Context: Despite problems with accountability systems under No Child Left Behind, the policy has been widely commended for exposing the depth and breadth of educational inequality in the United States. As states implement new accountability systems, there is growing concern that attention to achievement gaps and the performance of marginalized children has faded. Many approved accountability plans no longer report achievement by student subgroups or include subgroup performance in the calculation of accountability indicators. Research Purpose: This study examined the informational significance of Oklahoma's A-F accountability grades relative to the policy objective of achievement equity. Informational significance as explained in self-determination theory provided a framework to explore the usefulness of an A-F grade for understanding achievement differences within and between schools. Research Design: We evaluated the informational significance of Oklahoma A-F school grades by analyzing reading and math test scores from over 25,000 students in 81 elementary and middle schools. The study was designed to address two questions: Do students in A and B schools have high average achievement and small achievement gaps compared to students in D and F schools? What is the difference in average achievement and achievement gaps between school grades when holding constant contextual school conditions? Results: We found test score gaps attributed to Free and Reduced Lunch qualification and minority status. Free and Reduced Lunch and minority students average about one standard deviation lower in math and reading than their peers. Test score gaps varied across A-F school grades with the largest gaps existing in A and B schools. HLM results showed that A-F grades do not differentiate schools by effectiveness levels. For reading, we did not find statistically significant main effects attributed to letter grades. For math, the only statistically significance difference was between students in A and B schools and students in F schools. This difference had a small effect size. School grades did moderate achievement gaps, but gaps moved in a direction opposite from what would be desired of an accountability system that measured achievement equity. Conclusions: Progress made under NCLB in exposing achievement inequity in the U.S. has taken a step back with Oklahoma's A-F school grades. Our evidence suggests that a composite letter grade provides very little meaningful information about achievement differences.
Initial teacher education: What does it take to put equity at the center?;"This article addresses the question: What would it take to put equity front and center in initial teacher education? Drawing on research and innovative programming, the authors argue there are four essential tasks: conceptualizing educational inequality and the role of teacher education in challenging inequality; defining practice for equity; creating curricula and structures that are equity-centered and tailored to local patterns of inequality; and, engaging in research for local improvement and theory building about the conditions that support candidates' equity practice. The article conceptualizes each of these tasks and illustrates how they have been addressed in one context. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Some Notes about the Educational Inequality in Latin America;The purpose of this paper is to analyse the ways in which different Latin American countries have faced the permanent tension between include and differentiate the schooling population. Each country has generated historical conditions and traditions that determine the ways of processing this tension. For some countries, merit and exams are the criteria for justifying the unequal distribution of diplomas and awards. Other countries have chosen a system of open competition where actors mobilize different personal resources that define the unequal results. Finally, the conception of knowledge of modern schooling and its discriminative potential is discussed.
Equality of opportunity and achievement in social change. Primary and secondary Effects of social origin at secondary school transition in Hesse 1969 and 2007;"The positive impact of families' higher social origin on the transition into more demanding secondary school forms can be split up into two effects: the primary effect, which is conditioned by higher achievements of children from privileged social origin, and the secondary effect, which is independent of achievement differences and can be explained by the fact that higher school curricula are less costly and promise more benefits for parents of higher social status than for parents of lower social status. It is examined how the relative size of both effects has changed in Germany between 1969 and 2007 using two comparable studies in the federal state Hesse, which measure students' achievement and their social origin in very similar ways. The transition to the Gymnasium, the most prestigious track of the German tripartite secondary school, is investigated applying the method by Karlson et al. (2012). The primary effect has increased, specifically because of an increasing impact of achievement; and the secondary effect decreased such that school has gained more impact compared to the child's parental home."
Shadow education and educational inequality in South Korea: Examining effect heterogeneity of shadow education on middle school seniors' achievement test scores;We examine the heterogeneous effects of private supplementary education, often called shadow education, on math test scores by propensity to use shadow education among middle school seniors in Korea. Our approach moves beyond existing studies that mostly assumed a uniform effect of shadow education across students of different characteristics. By applying two different propensity models stratification-multilevel and smoothing-differencing methods, we find that the effect of intense shadow education significantly varies by the likelihood of using shadow education. Specifically, the positive effect of intense math shadow education is much stronger for students who have a lower propensity to use shadow education than their counterparts with a higher propensity. Considering that students who are least likely to use shadow education tend to have disadvantaged social backgrounds, we discuss implications for educational inequality of our findings that show the largest benefits of shadow education for most disadvantaged students.

New dimensions of educational inequality: Changing patterns of combining college and work in the US over time;Expansion of an educational system is often accompanied by differentiation. In the U.S., expansion of higher education included an increasing reliance on work. For a growing proportion of students, including those of traditional college-going age, going to college also involved going to work. This raises a crucial question of whether this form of differentiation has altered the patterns of inequality in higher education. While growing proportions of disadvantaged students are entering higher education, are they increasingly depending on work during their studies? We address this question using data from two waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79 and NLSY97). We begin by presenting longitudinal profiles of engagement in school and work for young adults in the 1980s and 2000s. Following, we conduct multivariate analyses predicting the number of hours students are working while enrolled in college in two time periods. Presented analyses reveal a substantial amount of stability in social class inequality over time, with a modest increase in inequality among students attending four-year institutions full-time. Implications of these findings for policy and research on social stratification are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Social Bonding to School and Educational Inequality: Race/Ethnicity, Dropping Out, and the Significance of Place;"Social bond theory suggests that strong bonds to school influence better outcomes on measures of educational progress and success. However, we know little about the relationship between social bonding to school and dropout for racial/ethnic minorities, or how this relationship varies across school settings. We examine how five types of social bonding (attachment, academic and sports involvement, commitment, and belief) influence the likelihood of dropout for racial/ethnic minorities in urban, suburban, and rural schools using national survey data. Results suggest that strong social bonds to school have the potential to mitigate some of the observed racial/ethnic gaps in dropout risk; however, the opportunity to form such bonds, as well as the strength of their protective effects, vary by student race/ethnicity, type of social bond, and school location."
Health Expenditure Concentration and Characteristics of High-Cost Enrollees in CHIP;Devising effective cost-containment strategies in public insurance programs requires understanding the distribution of health care spending and characteristics of high-cost enrollees. The aim was to characterize high-cost enrollees in a state's public insurance program and determine whether expenditure inequality changes over time, or with changes in cost-sharing policies or program eligibility. We use 1999-2011 claims and enrollment data from the Alabama Children's Health Insurance Program, ALL Kids. All children enrolled in ALL Kids were included in our study, including multiple years of enrollment (N = 1,031,600 enrollee-months). We examine the distribution of costs over time, whether this distribution changes after increases in cost sharing and expanded eligibility, patient characteristics that predict high-cost status, and examine health services used by high-cost children to identify what is preventable. The top 10% (1%) of enrollees account for about 65.5% (24.7%) of total program costs. Inpatient and outpatient costs are the largest components of costs incurred by high-cost utilizers. Non-urgent emergency department costs are a relatively small portion. Average expenditure increases over time, particularly after expanded eligibility, and the share of costs incurred by the top 10% and 1% increases slightly. Multivariable logistic regression results indicate that infants and older teens, Caucasian children, and those with chronic conditions are more likely to be high-cost utilizers. Increased cost sharing does not reduce cost concentration or average expenditure among high-cost utilizers. These findings suggest that identifying and targeting potentially preventable costs among high-cost utilizers are called for to help reduce costs in public insurance programs.
Educational Expansion and Inequality in Taiwan and the Czech Republic;This article presents a comparative analysis of educational inequality by family background and gender in Taiwan and the Czech Republic, which have both experienced substantial educational expansion in the last half-century under different educational systems. We highlight the specific institutional histories of both countries and examine the role of dead-end tracks in mediating educational inequality by family background. Pooling the most recent data available, we use probit analyses of inequality in secondary and tertiary educational attainment across 5-year birth cohorts from 1956 to 1985. In terms of secondary educational attainment, we find that the gap in inequalities by family background between the countries is large, with a decline in inequality in Taiwan but persistent inequality in the Czech case. We attribute these findings to differences in educational expansion and characteristics of the secondary school system. However, in tertiary educational attainment, we find similarities in educational inequality between the two countries.
Educational inequality in cardiovascular disease depends on diagnosis: A nationwide register based study from Denmark;"Background: Social inequality is present in the morbidity as well as the mortality of cardiovascular diseases. This paper aims to quantify and compare the level of educational inequality across different cardiovascular diagnoses. Design: Register based study. Methods: Comparison of the extent of inequality across different cardiovascular diagnoses requires a measure of inequality which is comparable across subgroups with different educational distributions. The slope index of inequality and the relative index of inequality were applied for measuring inequalities in incidence of six cardiovascular diagnoses: ischaemic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation and stroke in the period 2005-2009. All individuals in the general Danish population aged 35-84 years were followed in national registers regarding hospitalisation, death and education from 1985 to 2009 (annual average of 2.9 million people) to define incident cases. Results: Marked educational inequality was found in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke (relative index of inequality: 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.34; 0.40) to 0.60 (0.57; 0.63), absolute index of inequality: -241 (-254.4; -227.4) to -37 (-42.7; -31.1)) while inequality in atrial fibrillation and, in particular, in valvular heart disease was small and insignificant (relative index of inequality: 0.57 (0.49; 0.65) to 0.97 (0.88; 1.08), absolute index of inequality: -29 (-35.1; -21.9) to -1 (-4.8; -3.8)). Conclusion: The degree of educational inequality in cardiovascular diseases depends on the diagnosis, with the highest inequality in ischaemic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. Small differences were found between men and women."
Educational inequality as a predictor of rising back pain prevalence in Austria-sex differences;Background: Back pain (BP) represents a widespread public health problem in Europe. The morbidity depends on several indicators, which must be investigated to discover risk groups. The examination of trends in socioeconomic developments should ensure a better understanding of the complex link between socioeconomic-status and BP. Therefore, the role of social inequalities for BP has been investigated among Austrian subpopulations over a 24-year period. Methods: Self-reported data from nationally representative health surveys (1983-2007) were analyzed and adjusted for self-report bias (N=121 486). Absolute changes (ACs) and aetiologic fractions (AF) were calculated to measure trends. To quantify the extent of social inequality, the relative index of inequality was computed based on educational levels. Results: The prevalence of BP nearly doubled between 1983 and 2007. When investigating educational groups, subjects with low educational level were most prevalent. Obese persons generally showed higher rates of BP than non-obese subjects. Continuously rising trends across the different educational groups were more evident in men. The AC was highest in obese men with high education (+32.9%). Education-related inequalities for BP were more evident in men than women. Conclusion: Educational level is an important social indicator for BP. A gradient for low to high educational level in the trends of BP prevalence was clearly identified and stable only among men. We presume that the association 'education' and 'physical workload leading to BP' is more relevant for men than for women. The implementation of effective approaches to BP, in combination with target group-specific interventions focusing on educational status, is recommended.
Transition to higher education in contemporary China: A study of high school graduates in urban Nanjing;China has undergone an expansion of higher education in the 1990s. The university enrollment rate among high school graduates increased from 27.3% in 1990 to 87.6% in 2013. At the same time, Chinese universities are stratified into key universities and non-key universities, which differ significantly in resource input and prestige. Chinese parents are found to play an increasingly active role in preparing their children for the competition to get into elite universities. Researchers argue that in the era of mass education, social inequality is effectively maintained through school stratification and raising entrance bars for prestigious institutions. Thus, the focus of educational inequality should move from quantitative to qualitative differences. While educational inequality in China has attracted much research attention in the past decade, little is understood about educational inequality in China in qualitative terms. The present study aims to fill this research gap. Data come from a panel survey of 759 high school graduates in urban Nanjing initiated in 2010. A vast majority of these students (98.4%) were enrolled in post-secondary education in 2012, among whom 96.6% attended colleges or universities in China. Our findings do not show inequality in mere access by family background or high school prestige. However, family backgrounds make a difference in educational destinations (local vs. overseas as well as prestige of the institutions) but the family impact tends to be mediated by high school ranking. The findings suggest meritocratic elitism in mass education in China, which legitimizes the intergenerational transfer of social advantages and mediated role of school in producing educational inequality.
Getting Serious About Inequality;Sociologists have spent a great deal of energy studying social inequality, but in this presentation I suggest that we need to refocus our efforts a bit. I examine four popular myths among the general public, and among some in sociology, regarding the drivers of extreme inequality: (1) that most inequality is generated by race and gender, (2) that most inequality is driven by educational inequality, (3) that most inequality is driven by differences in family structure, and (4) that most inequality results from face-to-face interactions. I provide preliminary evidence that our explanations need some work. That work involves recognizing that most inequality is generated within demographic groups and that this inequality is growing rapidly. It also involves recognizing that there are few ways to incorporate underrepresented groups into the mainstream of a social and economic system where extreme inequality is getting worse and substantial percentages of the population face economic stagnation and downward mobility. The conclusion represents a call to focus on the most important group gapthe widening gap between the wealthy and the poorand the mechanisms through which most people gain access to economic goods, services, and social respectjobs and money.
Structure of the education system and educational inequality: the relevance of regional differences in the institutional conditions for educational attainment;The relevance of institutional arrangements concerning the German school system for social inequalities remains comparatively unclear, due to the prevalent use of only simple and mostly static categories. The present study adds to this debate and analyses the effect of different regulations at the transition to upper secondary schools on educational achievement and social inequality. Duration of primary schooling and tracking recommendations are taken into account. Empirical analyses are based on information of the related Education Acts (1985-2010) as well as data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). This approach constitutes a significant advancement as it allows for an overall identification of changes in the institutional features between and within states. Results indicate that children who attend primary schools that cover six instead of four years are more likely to be enrolled in an academic-track Gymnasium. These effects are especially strong for children with lower social background. There is no significant difference between secondary school systems with overall pure early tracking and school systems with fewer school tracks and delayed tracking in the sense that only students who don't attend upper secondary school aren't tracked after the fourth grade. Furthermore, the results reveal that the relative importance of (mandatory) track recommendations tends to be lower for children of parents with higher socioeconomic status, even if children in general are more likely to attend the Gymnasium at age 15, when the parents' freedom of choice isn't restricted by teachers' recommendations.
Challenging Boundaries, Changing Fate? Metropolitan Inequality and the Legacy of Milliken;Background: This article examines the contemporary implications of the Milliken v. Bradley (1974) decision for educational inequality between school districts in U.S. metropolitan areas. We focus upon four metropolitan areas that were highly segregated in the 1970s but which met different fates in court: We first examine Detroit and Philadelphia, where plaintiffs sought but ultimately failed to obtain a metropolitan-wide desegregation ruling. We then examine St. Louis, where a court imposed a metropolitan desegregation remedy. We finally include Jefferson County, where the court order resulted in a merger of city and suburban schools. Objective: Through this comparative analysis we seek to tease out the effects of the ruling on patterns of inequity between urban and suburban school districts over time. We specifically examine how districts within these metro areas differed over time in terms of patterns of school segregation, fiscal resources, and academic performance. Research Design: We employed qualitative case study methodology. We purposively selected three case study districts within each of the four metro areas (total of 12 school districts) based on their contextual status in 1970, i.e., whether they were in each of these three categories: urban, segregated suburban, or affluent suburban. We compared them along three dimensions: patterns of segregation, academic outcomes, and fiscal resources. Conclusions: We found that the segregated and high poverty districts in the three metro areas where courts left districts intact (Detroit, Philadelphia, and St. Louis) have been, since Milliken, increasingly hemmed in by their boundaries: struggling with growing concentrations of need, low resources to meet those needs, and as a result falling into fiscal and academic decline. In contrast, the maintenance of district boundaries by the courts has allowed the affluent suburbs in these contexts, over time, to benefit from a number of policies and practices that allowed them to accrue and protect advantage through exclusionary zoning policies and housing discrimination. Together, these policies have promoted and protected the affluence and advantage in each of these contexts, which has in turn attracted investment and allowed these districts to maintain strong financial standing over time. Our study suggests that socially constructed political boundaries, like school district boundary lines, by carving up political geography along the lines of race and class, can take on an active role in the reproduction of inequality.
Civil Rights, Educational Inequality, and Transnational Takes on the U.S. History Survey;
The Constitutional Challenge to Teacher Tenure;Reformers argue that ineffective teaching is the linchpin of educational inequality and failure. Starting in 2010, they successfully sought important changes in teacher evaluation systems at the state and federal levels. But tenure, a fundamental source of teachers' strength to resist more aggressive reform, remained in place. Thus, in 2012, reformers theorized a novel constitutional strategy to eliminate tenure. They argued that tenure leads to the retention of ineffective teachers, and that ineffective teaching deprives students of the constitutional right to education embedded in state constitutions. This theory immediately caught hold, with a California trial court striking down tenure in 2014 and litigation commencing in other states weeks thereafter. The outcome of this litigation movement will determine both the future of the teaching profession and the scope of the constitutional right to education. To date, however, no high court or scholar has thoroughly analyzed the theory. This Article offers that first analysis, concluding that the constitutional challenge to tenure raises a theoretically valid claim but lacks a sufficient empirical basis. At the theoretical level, the tenure challenge easily falls within broadly worded precedent that establishes students' constitutional right to an equal and adequate education. If ineffective teaching deprives students of equal or adequate education, state constitutions should protect against it. But in the context of school funding cases-where the relevant precedent first developed-courts have demanded that litigants precisely demonstrate multiple aspects of causation and harm. Evidence on causation and harm is lacking in regard to tenure. This split between theory and fact requires courts to proceed cautiously. Rejecting current tenure challenges on their face would unfairly prejudice future legal challenges to teacher quality, particularly those predicated on potential empirical advances in social science. A facial rejection would also require courts to narrow the existing scope of the constitutional right to education. This narrowing would negatively affect education rights in other important and developing contexts. The solution is to insist on more detailed evidence to support plaintiffs' causal theories and presumed remedies. By doing so, courts can validate students' constitutional right to education without venturing into unsettled policy debates.
Family Socioeconomic Status, Immigration, and Children's Transitions into School;Family scholars have contributed a great deal to the growing literature documenting how children's transitions into elementary school serve as a critical period in their educational careers and, more broadly, in socioeconomic and demographic disparities in long-term educational attainment. The purpose of this review is to describe how this school transition works, why it has short- and long-term ramifications for educational inequality, and how it may be amenable to policy intervention. The review then elucidates how research that looks inside childrenincluding neurosciencemay deepen and build on what is already known in meaningful ways. Throughout, the discussion focuses on children from low-income families and children from Latin American immigrant families, two groups of children who are central to child- and family-focused efforts to understand and remedy educational inequality.
Scaling as a Literacy Activity: Mobility and Educational Inequality in an Age of Global Connectivity;"This article takes up an area of central concern for educators in an era of global connectivity: how to account for the mobility of people, texts, and practices while simultaneously addressing persistent educational inequalities. In attending to the ways people participate in unequal globalized contexts, even educational contexts constructed to bring students and teachers together; we examine how resources such as time, space, materials, national identity, genre, and language are all unequally distributed and unequally ordered in various hierarchies. We propose the notion of scale to offer literacy researchers a flexible conceptual tool with which to examine educational inequities by capturing how movement and mobility are not simple processes of relocation; rather, literacies and texts are always dynamically constructed in relation to hierarchical orders of varying spatial and temporal dimensions. Through multisited ethnography, we engage in a scalar analysis of teachers' cross-cultural collaborations to illustrate how they produced various categories of space and time (e.g., local, national, global) through routine literacy engagements. In explaining how different scales are invoked, implicated, and constructed in interaction, we find that participants engaged in six scalar moves upscaling, downscaling, aligning, contesting, anchoring, and embedding and offer these in response to the pressing need to develop sensitive analytical tools that can bring to the surface the ways inequalities are inscribed in literacy practices and texts. Implications of conceptualizing scaling as literacy activity include disrupting smooth narratives of global connectedness in educational collaborations and highlighting the multiscalar nature of all literacy practice."
A Multination Study of Socioeconomic Inequality in Expectations for Progression to Higher Education: The Role of Between-School Tracking and Ability Stratification;Persistent inequalities in educational expectations across societies are a growing concern. Recent research has explored the extent to which inequalities in education are due to primary effects (i.e., achievement differentials) versus secondary effects (i.e., choice behaviors net of achievement). We explore educational expectations in order to consider whether variations in primary and secondary effects are associated with country variation in curricular and ability stratification. We use evidence from the PISA 2003 database to test the hypothesis that (a) greater between-school academic stratification would be associated with stronger relationships between socioeconomic status and educational expectations and (b) when this effect is decomposed, achievement differentials would explain a greater proportion of this relationship in countries with greater stratification. Results supported these hypotheses.
Patterns and trends in achievement gaps in Malaysian Secondary Schools (1999-2011): gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status;Educational inequality is a highly debated yet empirically understudied topic in Malaysia. This paper examines the patterns and trends of academic achievement gaps by student social groups in Malaysia, drawing upon nationally representative data for the most recent four cohorts (1999, 2003, 2007, and 2011) of eighth-grade Malaysian students from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. Results show that while the achievement gaps by gender (female vs. male) and ethnicity (Malay vs. non-Malay) existed at various time points and have changed over time, the magnitudes of change were small. Most alarmingly, the achievement gaps both in math and in science between students from high and low socioeconomic families have rapidly widened and became more prominent than gender and ethnicity gaps in recent years. If this trend continues, it will have dire consequences for economic equality and social stability in the society. To reduce educational achievement gaps, policymakers and educators should play a more active role in supporting academically disadvantaged students, especially those who are from underprivileged backgrounds.
Social class and educational inequality: the impact of parents and schools;
Class, capital, and competing academic discourse: a critical analysis of the mission/s of American higher education;In this paper, we critically analyze institutional mission statements as discursive texts replete with symbolic meaning, as we believe these texts reveal a great deal about the ways in which higher education remains increasingly stratified. We argue that beneath the generalized rhetoric of institutional mission statements, lie powerful messages seemingly coded with varying forms of class-based academic capital. We further argue that these messages reflect two distinct, competing discourses surrounding the purpose and value of higher education, that parallel the stratification of the larger system itself. Findings reveal evidence of these competing discourses and contribute to larger discussions surrounding educational inequality.
Lessons in educational inequality: successful approaches to intractable problems around the world;
STRIVING TOWARDS THE BIG QUESTIONS;
DISCRIMINATION-RELATED STRESS AND BEHAVIORAL ENGAGEMENT: THE MODERATING EFFECT OF POSITIVE SCHOOL RELATIONSHIPS;Purpose - This three-wave longitudinal study explored the relation between discrimination-related stress and behavioral engagement among urban African-American and Latino adolescents, and the moderating effect of school-based social support. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 270 African-American and Hispanic/Latino adolescents attending urban public high schools completed three annual surveys starting with 10th grade. Findings - Growth curve analysis revealed that discrimination-related stress was associated with decreased behavioral engagement over time. School-based social support moderated this effect in that discrimination-related stress had less of an impact on behavioral engagement as level of school-based social support increased. Practical implications - School-based supportive relationships serve as a protective factor for urban African-American and Latino youth, helping them remain engaged in school as they deal with the negative effects of discrimination-related stress. Originality/value - The findings reveal that the development of positive, supportive relationships in school seems to be a malleable variable that interventionists and educational advocates can focus on in an effort to bolster academic achievement among academically stigmatized youth.
EDUCATIONAL ISSUES AND INEQUALITIES: EXPERIENCES OF INDIGENOUS CANADIAN STUDENTS;Purpose - Educational achievement gaps between Indigenous and nonIndigenous peoples exist as a critical issue and a policy challenge in most countries. This chapter examines contemporary schooling issues and inequalities experienced by Canadian Indigenous students in order to further understand the challenges that impact their schooling experiences. Design/methodology/approach - This chapter draws on interviews with 50 participants (26 educators and 24 parents) within four southern Ontario school boards. Of those interviewees, 20 teachers and 20 parents identify as Indigenous (mainly Haudenosaunee, Anishinaabe, and Metis). Four non-Indigenous parent interviewees have children with Indigenous ancestry and six non-Indigenous teachers have Indigenous education as an area of specialization. Findings - Findings suggest that Indigenous students encounter schooling challenges associated with: racial discrimination, feelings of not fitting in, and desires to blend in with the majority student population, as well as inequalities in Indigenous-focused programs and initiatives. Originality/value - Given the historical context of discrimination against Indigenous Canadians in schooling, Indigenous students are challenged with distinct barriers that shape educational experiences as they advance in their academic careers. Interviewees described how embedding content based on Indigenous cultures, perspectives, and histories into public schools can not only counter negative experiences for Indigenous students, but also facilitate respect for cultural diversity among non-Indigenous students, and serves as a mechanism to combat racism and prejudice in the school community.

PRESCHOOL ENROLLMENT, CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CONTEXT, AND THE READING ACHIEVEMENT OF CHILDREN FROM LOW-INCOME FAMILIES;Applying sociological and developmental theoretical perspectives to educational policy issues, this study analyzed data from 7,710 children from low-income families in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort. The goal was to examine how much the association between phonics instruction in kindergarten classrooms and children's reading achievement during the first year of school in the low-income population would depend on whether children had previously attended preschool as well as the socioeconomic composition of their elementary schools. Lagged linear models with a series of sensitivity tests revealed that this association was strongest among children from low-income families who had not attended preschool and then enrolled in socioeconomically disadvantaged elementary schools and among children from low-income families who had attended preschool and then enrolled in socioeconomically advantaged elementary schools. These findings demonstrate how insights into educational inequality can be gained by situating developing children within their proximate ecologies and institutional settings, especially looking to the match between children and their contexts. They are especially relevant to timely policy discussions of early childhood education programs, classroom instructional practices, and school desegregation.
PERFORMANCE, INEQUALITY, AND THE ORGANISATION OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS: AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF THE DYNAMICS OF SCHOOLING;This work aims to identify the main dynamics of education in a transnational and trans-regional perspective. It proposes, therefore, a diachronic approach over a time span of more than half a century, pondering the meaning of different categories in these processes, in particular those relating to gender and age. In addition, considering the weight of education - taking into account their dynamics and spatial locations - in social opportunities and their relationship with inequality of various types. Thus, in a first interpretative line, it proceeds to the characterisation of the most significant moments of enlargement, relating them, simultaneously, to an identification of processes of educational inequalities. The verification of the gradual increase of the access to and certification in educational and training systems, with a historical depth of more than half a century, still referring to a reading of educational inequality associated with other inequalities, such as the regional and national, age/generation and gender. A second analytical axis is related to the capacity and performance of education systems to operate in these dynamics. How do systems have been creating policies and cultures of functioning that will encourage impulses or, on the other hand, make use of discouraging mechanisms, being faced with real difficulties in producing basic skills and sustainable learning paths to operate in knowledge-based societies and economies. Finally, and in a complementary way, it also seeks to produce some relationship between inequality and the fundamental guidelines prevailing in education systems, reflected in their performance and in the context of integration and success of various social groups of students, particularly regarding social origins. The findings of this study point to the relationship between education and the opportunities of life and social inequalities and how education systems promote greater equity in the success and construction of school paths. Several references and empirical sources are used and articulated, such as those relating to the OECD, UNESCO, etc., which allow the deepening of these issues and, at the same time, comparisons between countries and regions in diachronic perspective.
Russian Educational Policy of the Late 1980s-Early 2000s: Declarations and the Actual Impact on Inequality in General Education;This article analyses Russian educational policy of the late 1980s-early 2000s through the study of official documents related to the reforms, educational statistics, legislation and direct in-depth interviews with experts in the field. It is shown that the goal of reaching equity in education was supported neither legislatively nor organizationally. On the contrary, the adoption of neoliberal approaches to managing education stimulated the growth of educational inequality in terms of the differentiation of schools by level of resource provision and performance. Several similarities are found in the outcomes of the measures pursued by Russian policy-makers and the effects of neo-liberal, meritocracy-oriented strategies in countries with high social inequality. However, the specifics of the Russian context also played an important role. Instead of allowing free and fair competition in Russian general education, the reform stimulated the growth of informal relationships, which enabled access to high quality schools on the basis of status privileges and socioeconomic standing and which perpetuated inequality in access to resources for different types of schools.
Critical review and creative suggestions for the native English speaking teacher policy in South Korea;In order to invigorate communicative language teaching, until recently the South Korean government actively promoted the hiring of native English speaking teachers (NESTs) at state schools. However, mainly due to constrained budgets, many local offices of education have now started to rapidly cut the number of NESTs. This paper takes a critical approach to examine possible impacts of the recent variation in NEST policy on the disparity in learning opportunities between financially privileged and underprivileged students. We begin with a brief review of the history of NEST employment in South Korean state schools. Then, we delve into whether there are pedagogical advantages in team teaching over sole Korean English Teacher teaching. Later, the current policy's driving forces, potential beneficiaries and victims, and outcome of the policy will be discussed. On the basis of the analysis of the recent trend in NEST policy, suggestions for future policy reforms are provided.
A DECADE OF PROEJA: ITS GENESIS, STOCKTAKING AND PERSPECTIVES;This study explores, from the broader context of social fights, the Proeja's path during the last decade, searching for the connections to the Decree n. 5.154 of 2004, in the process of the redemocratization of the country. Thus, it analyses the program's relation to the State reform in the 90's, to the Brazil's commitment to the international organizations, since Jomtien Conference, towards the world declaration on education for all, that has been guiding the investment on focus and compensatory policies for the public considered vulnerable, which produces and supports the maintenance of educational inequality. Moreover, this study questions Proeja as a lasting public policy, marked by struggles and contradictions, as well as by some advances through the searches developed meanwhile. The results show the challenges that Instituto Federal (IFs) administration still faces to maintain the ongoing offering of Proeja and the perspectives that open from the experiences coming from its continuity, which brings back the flection of the meaning of Youth and Adult Education insertion at IFs according to the current legislation.
Educational Inequality in Migrant Children in China: From Visible Exclusion to Invisible Discrimination;
Accounting for children's agency in research on educational inequality The influence of children's own practices on their academic habitus in elementary school;The role of children's agency in the socio-cultural reproduction of educational inequality is mostly overlooked by quantitative research in education. This is problematic because a potentially important source of variance in children's educational success is not included in the analyses. Childhood Studies offers different ways to conceptualise children's agency. To address the role of children's agency in educational inequality, the authors outline a conceptual framework that merges socio-cultural reproduction theory following Bourdieu with the idea of children's agency. Using quantitative data on elementary school children and their parents, the authors ask how children contribute to the reproduction of educational inequality. They explore the links between children's dispositions towards school, their out-of-school practices and social class, and they discuss the implications of their findings for investigating children's agency in both Childhood Studies and educational research.
Is there a differentiation of teachers in Russian school system?;"Through the last 25 post-soviet years with the rise of economic inequality, Russian school system became highly stratified, and numerous studies have demonstrated that so called 'elite' schools (i.e. schools with advanced curriculum gymnasiums, lyceums, specialized schools) are very different from schools with standard curriculae. The differences pertain to socio-economic status of students as well as to a number of academic outcomes: achievement on standardized tests, particularly Unified State Exam; percentage of students pursuing higher education; quality of chosen higher education institutions. However it is unknown whether teachers from standard and 'elite' schools do differ. We undertook our study to answer this question. Data and method: Data was collected in St.Petersburg in 2014-2015. In total, we surveyed 769 teachers from 39 schools (18 schools with standard and 21 with advanced curriculum) randomly selected from two city boroughs. The questionnaire included items on education and professional trajectories, social capital, self-efficacy and professional commitment, attitudes towards teaching profession and students, lifestyles, cultural consumption, socio-demographics. We used ANOVA for statistical analysis of differences between categories of teachers, and factor analysis (PCA) for multi-itemed scales. Results and conclusion: In spite of existing differentiation between 'ordinary' and 'elite' schools, differences between their teachers are almost non-existent and concern mainly cultural preferences. Teachers tend to stay in the same school for many years, horizontal mobility is rare. However, mobility between schools of different types occur as often as within the same type. It is important to emphasize that such essential characteristics as self-efficacy, professional commitment, attitudes towards students, disciplinary practices are the same for all teachers regardless the school type or socio-economic composition of schools. We conclude that professional group of teachers is not stratified. Results are discussed in the framework of educational inequality."
THE POLITICS OF MARKET-BASED EDUCATION REFORM;At this writing, there exists a growing educational policy consensus amongst policy elites from Washington, DC, to the states, and from philanthropies and policy entrepreneurs in urban school districts that a menu of neoliberal reforms will result in greater equity, quality, and efficiency. At the same time, significant opposition movements have emerged to challenge the expansion of high-stakes testing, school choice, and privatization. This chapter examines common sense understandings in education reform, which are supported by assertions that market-based schooling options are superior for children of color, and argues that a primary reason for the popularity of such reforms is an under-examined advocacy coalition, formed nominally around school choice advocacy, but encompassing several other entrepreneurial educational reforms. The chapter describes the structure of this network, arguing that its dominance has precluded an understanding of counter advocacy against school choice and related reforms. It then describes several past and current movements that challenge commonsense understandings of the reforms' currency, and to push back against the reforms' expansion. The chapter also discusses the activities of grassroots community groups in response to market based reforms, and argues that these efforts can help to expand the public deliberation on complex matters of educational policy. The chapter concludes with recommendations for further examination of these efforts to highlight the concerns, strategies, and solutions to educational inequality being articulated within communities of color and between them and their allies.
The consequences of educational inequality;
LITERACIES ACT IN TWO CLASSES OF AGRICULTURAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. A MEDIA CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY;How inequalities are produced and reinforced through the development of educational and and course material dedicated to students? Based on two years of observation in two types of schools in agricultural vocational education, our investigation used content analysis to study such inequalities. The use of concepts of literacy and school form highlights the divergent and recurrent expectations of teachers based on their degree of proximity to the work of the place of destination. The overvaluation of the professional point of view in one of the two schools, to the detriment of the demands of the school environment, always implicitly present, negatively impacts upon learning objectives of students who experience academic difficulties. The two mechanisms observed reflect a distribution of knowledge that shapes, over time, the writings of the students analyzed in a social cognitive perspective. Social inequalities between students are then reinforced.
China's Educational Attainments and Educational Equality: Empirical Data from 2002 to 2012;Achieving educational equality is one of the basic requirements for building a holistically well-off society, as well as one of the basic values necessary to deepen overall education reform in the future. Using data from 2002-2012 covering China's educational distribution, this article calculates the average years of schooling and education Gini coefficient based on gender and the entire population as a whole. Using the hierarchical cluster analysis between regions and decomposition of the education Gini coefficient, the study finds that China's educational attainments and educational equality between 2002 and 2012 improved significantly. China's educational attainments in the northern regions are significantly higher than that of those in the south. The degree of educational inequality declines when viewed from the West to the East. Gaps in the level of education between genders exhibit have shown a tendency towards convergence, but the education gap between regions has slightly expanded.
Explaining parents' school involvement: The role of ethnicity and gender in the Netherlands;Ethnic minority parents are often less involved with their children's schooling, and this may hamper their children's academic success, thus contributing to ethnic educational inequality. The authors aim to explain differences in parental involvement, using nationally representative survey data from the Netherlands of parents of primary school-aged children of Dutch, Turkish, and Moroccan origin. Descriptive findings show lower levels of parental involvement across several domains among ethnic minority compared to Dutch majority parents. Moreover, mothers are significantly more involved than fathers. To explain ethnic and gender gaps in parental engagement, the authors draw on parents' skills and household resources, parenting goals, and self-efficacy as important antecedents for their motivation to become involved. The model explains substantial portions of the variance in parental involvement and succeeds in fully explaining ethnic discrepancies by parents' levels of education and language proficiency. However, the gender gap in parental involvement remains unexplained.
What is it worth? An empirical investigation into attitudes towards education amongst youngsters following secondary education in Flanders;This paper argues that whereas the social relevance of attitudes towards education is commonly confined to their direct impact on educational aspirations or attainment, attitudes may also impact on educational success in a way similar to cultural capital. Survey data were used to assess the support for three different attitudes with respect to the perceived value of attending school among youngsters (n = 853) following secondary education in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium). The results revealed substantial differences according to the pupils' cultural capital, time perspective, personal educational experiences and social mobility. These findings are taken as a starting point for a broader discussion about how attention to attitudes may enable us to account for the power struggles in which the educational field and the teaching profession are involved.
Specific Features of Child Involvement in Supplementary Education Depending on the Cultural, Educational, and Financial Status of Families and Place of Living;This paper presents the results of research on child involvement in supplementary education. This research was conducted by HSE in partnership with the Levada Center as part of the 2013 Education Markets and Organizations Monitoring project. The survey covered over 2,000 parents of school students involved in supplementary education provided by various institutions. Correlations between various parameters of student involvement in supplementary education (the rate and continuity or discontinuity of service consumption, the choice of supplementary education programs and institution types, and the place of supplementary education during free time and holidays) and family characteristics (place of residence, financial status, and cultural and educational background) are analyzed. Some solutions are suggested on how to overcome difficulties produced by differences in policies and the real situation in the field of supplementary education. For instance, the authors claim that national policies oriented at children from vulnerable socioeconomic backgrounds and those living in rural areas should be a combination of two in-struments: information, which raises parental awareness of and motivation for their children's supplementary education, and social support to disadvantaged families, including the introduction of vouchers for supplementary education services, setting quotas for publicly funded places in high-quality supplementary education programs, and targeted financing for supplementary education programs in rural schools and schools for difficult students.
Fairness in Admission: Voices from Rural Chinese Female Students in Selective Universities in Chinese Mainland;As the Chinese mainland has transitioned from elite to mass higher education, the race to attend university has escalated to become a race to attend selective universities. This study focuses on rural female university students and explores how they make sense of their higher education admission experiences. We rationalize that the inquiry into fairness is crystallized through examining rural female students' voices, which remain largely marginalized from the literature. Drawing from in-depth interviews with 22 rural female undergraduates from five selective universities in northern China, we focus on their perspectives towards three key issues in higher education admission: entrance exams, region-based quotas that put them at distinct disadvantages, and new reform initiatives.
Multiple paths to inequality. How institutional contexts shape the educational opportunities of second-generation immigrants in Europe;Most cross-country studies on educational systems aim at identifying the net effects of single institutional aspects on students' outcomes. In this paper, I argue that educational systems are best conceived as configurations of interconnected elements. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic assessment of how selected features of the educational system and of the immigration context combine in countries where second-generation immigrants severely underperform their native peers, net of socio-economic differentials. Using PISA data from 2006 and 2009, I compare the relative mathematics achievement of students with and without an immigrant background in 17 Western-European educational systems. The empirical results, based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, point to the existence of functional equivalents and institutional complementarities. Equally severe disadvantages can be found in the rigidly tracking systems of German-speaking and Dutch-speaking countries, but also in the highly comprehensive Scandinavian systems, where a delayed entry in the educational system is coupled with a wide distance from the language of instruction. Moreover, even in the absence of tracking, second-generation immigrants critically lag behind their native peers if they are overrepresented in schools with a poor learning environment.
Assessing students' equality of opportunity in OECD countries: the role of national- and school-level policies;This article analyses the relationship between equality of opportunity and the characteristics of the educational system, jointly considering country- and school-level policies. Because school social environment represents a fundamental channel in shaping educational opportunities, we consider all policies, recorded in PISA 2012 dataset, that affect the sorting of students to schools. We show that including sorting policies enriches the explanation of the socio-economic gradient, that is, the association between students' performances and parental background, with respect to previous studies including only country-level features. The negative impact of early tracking on equality of opportunity is overvalued without including other sorting policies, while grouping students' within-school by ability increases the socio-economic gradient and a greater students' heterogeneity in the school reduces the gradient.
What Have We Learned from Cross-National Research on the Causes of Income Inequality?;Reviews of research on the causes of income inequality often limit themselves to the United States or highly industrialized societies. The present review seeks greater generalizability across societies at all levels of development. It covers cross-national studies published since the 1960s, which draw upon a variety of theories and test them empirically, with the result that that we can now identify a broad range of important causal variables that explain variations in income inequality both across societies and over time. These variables include: economic dualism and the Kuznets inverted-U hypothesis, demographic variables, human capital theory and the influence of a population's level of education, educational inequality, and the race between education (skill) and technology, democracy, communist rule, factors of production, labor institutions, neoliberal globalization, and the effect of the state on inequality. The review suggests which of these variables have more robust effects, and which causal effects are more contested.
The declining influence of family background on educational attainment in Australia: The role of measured and unmeasured influences;"The paper examines changes in the influence of family background, including socioeconomic and social background variables on educational attainment in Australia for cohorts born between 1890 and 1982. We test hypotheses from modernization theory on sibling data using random effects models and find: (i) substantial declines in the influence of family background on educational attainment (indicated by the sibling intraclass correlations); (ii) declines in the effects of both economic and cultural socioeconomic background variables; (iii) changes in the effects of some social background variables (e.g., family size); (iv) and declines in the extent that socioeconomic and social background factors account for variation in educational attainment. Unmeasured family background factors are more important, and proportionally increasingly so, for educational attainment than the measured socioeconomic and social background factors analyzed. Fixed effects models showed steeper declines in the effects of socioeconomic background variables than in standard analyses suggesting that unmeasured family factors associated with socioeconomic background obscure the full extent of the decline.

PISA 2012: how do results for the paper and computer tests compare?;The Programme for International Assessment (PISA) is an important cross-national study of 15-year olds academic achievement. Although it has traditionally been conducted using paper-and-pencil tests, the vast majority of countries will use computer-based assessment from 2015. In this paper, we consider how cross-country comparisons of children's skills differ between paper and computer versions of the PISA mathematics test. Using data from PISA 2012, where more than 200,000 children from 32 economies completed both paper and computer versions of the mathematics assessment, we find important and interesting differences between the two sets of results. This includes a substantial drop of more than 50 PISA test points (half a standard deviation) in the average performance of children from Shanghai-China. Moreover, by considering children's responses to particular test items, we show how differences are unlikely to be solely due to the interactive nature of certain computer test questions. The paper concludes with a discussion of what the findings imply for interpretation of PISA results in 2015 and beyond.
Educational inequality in the occurrence of abdominal obesity according to gender and color/race: the Pro-Health Study, 1999-2001 and 2011-2012;"Cross-sectional data from the Pro-Health Study in 1999-2001 and 2011-2012 revealed important gender and color/race differences in the size and variation across time in educational inequalities related to abdominal obesity. Probability of obesity increased steadily in women (independently of color/race) and men (brown/black) with less schooling. These gradients were quantified according to the relative index of inequality (RII). Over the course of the decade, there was a reduction in inequality in brown/black women (Delta RII: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.2-1.1), underlying a relatively higher increase in the prevalence of abdominal obesity in women with more schooling. RII was stable in white women and brown/black men, indicating a similar increase in the prevalence of abdominal obesity in educational subgroups. The association between schooling and abdominal obesity was affected by the multiple interaction of socio-demographic factors. Our results recommend joint stratification by gender and color/race in the study of socioeconomic inequalities related to abdominal obesity."
Comparing the gender gap in educational attainment: the impact of emancipatory contexts in 33 cohorts across 33 countries;Nowadays, women outperform men in educational attainment in many countries. Still, large variation between countries remains. Emancipatory contexts in which individuals are raised might explain these differences in male-female educational attainment, both over time and across countries. This study examines individual and contextual factors that affect educational attainment of men and women for cohorts born between 1950 and 1982 across 33 countries. Possible explanations for differentiation over time and across countries relate to women's labour market participation and an emancipatory normative climate, indicated by degree of religiosity. We employ multilevel models on data (N = 138,498) from 6 waves of the European Social Survey and the US General Social Survey (2002-2012) to test our hypotheses. Results show that a higher level of female labour market participation in early adolescence improves women's performance in education, whereas high levels of religiosity during that phase negatively affect women's educational attainment.
ASSESSING THE STOCK AND DISTRIBUTION OF EDUCATION IN ROMANIA;Education is one of the most important drivers for growth, development and well-being. Therefore, investments in education are beneficial for individuals, companies and societies in long term. Most studies analyze the stock of education and its role in promoting social and economic development. However, distribution of education is another key issue that has effects, on the long run, both at individual and societal levels. Reducing educational inequalities represents a target for public policies in many countries. The current paper aims to examine both the stock and the distribution of education in Romania and to discuss how the post-communist reforms in the education system have influenced both of them. We build our analysis on census data regarding school attainment by age, gender and area of residence. The results of the analysis show that younger cohorts have higher access of education, while the level of educational inequality registers contradictory evolutions for specific groups of individuals.

Swiss University Students' Attitudes toward Pharmacological Cognitive Enhancement;Pharmacological cognitive enhancement (PCE) refers to the nonmedical use of prescription or recreational drugs to enhance cognitive performance. Several concerns about PCE have been raised in the public. The aim of the present study was to investigate students' attitudes toward PCE. Students at three Swiss universities were invited by e-mail to participate in a web-based survey. Of the 29,282 students who were contacted, 3,056 participated. Of these students, 22% indicated that they had used prescription drugs (12%) or recreational substances including alcohol (14%) at least once for PCE. The use of prescription drugs or recreational substances including alcohol prior to the last exam was reported by 16%. Users of pharmacological cognitive enhancers were more likely to consider PCE fair (24%) compared with nonusers (11%). Only a minority of the participants agreed with the nonmedical use of prescription drugs by fellow students when assuming weak (7%) or hypothetically strong efficacy and availability to everyone (14%). Two-thirds (68%) considered performance that is obtained with PCE less worthy of recognition. Additionally, 80% disagreed that PCE is acceptable in a competitive environment. More than half (64%) agreed that PCE in academia is similar to doping in sports. Nearly half (48%) claimed that unregulated access to pharmacological cognitive enhancers increases the pressure to engage in PCE and educational inequality (55%). In conclusion, Swiss students' main concerns regarding PCE were related to coercion and fairness. As expected, these concerns were more prevalent among nonusers than among users of pharmacological cognitive enhancers. More balanced information on PCE should be shared with students, and future monitoring of PCE is recommended.
Do Students without a General Qualification for University Entrance Show Lower Academic Performance? Findings from a Quantitative Case Study;Since 2009, German universities have been open to vocationally qualified applicants without the school-leaving qualification traditionally required for university entrance (Abitur). This paper investigates the extent to which these non-traditional students differ in regard to academic performance from traditional students who have attained the Abitur. Hypotheses about differences in performance are derived from three assumptions: competence differences due to different educational backgrounds, cultural closure of the academic field to students of lower socio-economic origin, and differences in students' living conditions. We used data from up to 1,142 undergraduate students in one department at a German university to test our hypotheses. The analyses show that non-traditional first-year students pass a lower proportion of their courses (by 8.4 percentage points), have a lower probability of graduating within nine semesters (down 19.9 percentage points), and receive poorer final grades than persons with general university entrance qualifications (0.15 grade points lower).
University access for disadvantaged children: a comparison across countries;In this paper, we consider whether certain countries are particularly adept (or particularly poor) at getting children from disadvantaged homes to study for a bachelor's degree. A series of university access models are estimated for four English-speaking countries (England, Canada, Australia and the USA), which include controls for comparable measures of academic achievement at age 15. Our results suggest that socioeconomic differences in university access are more pronounced in England and Canada than Australia and the USA and that cross-national variation in the socioeconomic gap remains even once we take account of differences in academic achievement. We discuss the implications of our findings for the creation of more socially mobile societies.
Inequalities in Alcohol-Related Mortality in 17 European Countries: A Retrospective Analysis of Mortality Registers;"Background Socioeconomic inequalities in alcohol-related mortality have been documented in several European countries, but it is unknown whether the magnitude of these inequalities differs between countries and whether these inequalities increase or decrease over time. Methods and Findings We collected and harmonized data on mortality from four alcohol-related causes (alcoholic psychosis, dependence, and abuse; alcoholic cardiomyopathy; alcoholic liver cirrhosis; and accidental poisoning by alcohol) by age, sex, education level, and occupational class in 20 European populations from 17 different countries, both for a recent period and for previous points in time, using data from mortality registers. Mortality was age-standardized using the European Standard Population, and measures for both relative and absolute inequality between low and high socioeconomic groups (as measured by educational level and occupational class) were calculated. Rates of alcohol-related mortality are higher in lower educational and occupational groups in all countries. Both relative and absolute inequalities are largest in Eastern Europe, and Finland and Denmark also have very large absolute inequalities in alcohol-related mortality. For example, for educational inequality among Finnish men, the relative index of inequality is 3.6 (95% CI 3.3-4.0) and the slope index of inequality is 112.5 (95% CI 106.2-118.8) deaths per 100,000 person-years. Over time, the relative inequality in alcohol-related mortality has increased in many countries, but the main change is a strong rise of absolute inequality in several countries in Eastern Europe (Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia) and Northern Europe (Finland, Denmark) because of a rapid rise in alcohol-related mortality in lower socioeconomic groups. In some of these countries, alcohol-related causes now account for 10% or more of the socioeconomic inequality in total mortality. Because our study relies on routinely collected underlying causes of death, it is likely that our results underestimate the true extent of the problem. Conclusions Alcohol-related conditions play an important role in generating inequalities in total mortality in many European countries. Countering increases in alcohol-related mortality in lower socioeconomic groups is essential for reducing inequalities in mortality. Studies of why such increases have not occurred in countries like France, Switzerland, Spain, and Italy can help in developing evidence-based policies in other European countries."
Socioeconomic inequality in access to high-status colleges: A cross-country comparison;This paper considers the relationship between family background, academic achievement in high school and access to high-status postsecondary institutions in three developed countries (Australia, England and the United States). We begin by estimating the unconditional association between family background and access to a high status university, before examining how this relationship changes once academic achievement in high school is controlled. Our results suggest that high achieving disadvantaged children are much less likely to enter a high-status college than their more advantaged peers, and that the magnitude of this socio-economic gradient is broadly similar across these three countries. However, we also find that socio-economic inequality in access to high-status private US colleges is much more pronounced than access to their public sector counterparts (both within the US and when compared overseas).

CONSTITUTION OF EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AMONG OLDER ADULTS IN INDIA AND CHINA: ASSESSING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OCCUPATION;
The Impact of Comorbid Depression on Educational Inequality in Survival after Acute Coronary Syndrome in a Cohort of 83 062 Patients and a Matched Reference Population;Background Patients with low socioeconomic position have higher rates of mortality after diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but little is known about the mechanisms behind this social inequality. The aim of the present study was to examine whether any educational inequality in survival after ACS was influenced by comorbid conditions including depression. Methods From 2001 to 2009 all first-time ACS patients were identified in the Danish National Patient Registry. This cohort of 83 062 ACS patients and a matched reference population were followed for incident depression and mortality until December 2012 by linkage to person, patients and prescription registries. Educational status was defined at study entry and the impact of potential confounders and mediators (age, gender, cohabitation status, somatic comorbidity and depression) on the relation between education and mortality were identified by drawing a directed acyclic graph and analysed using multiple Cox regression analyses. Findings During follow-up, 29 583(35.6%) of ACS patients and 19 105(22.9%) of the reference population died. Cox regression analyses showed an increased mortality in the lowest educated compared to those with high education in both ACS patients and the reference population. Adjustment for previous and incident depression or other covariables only attenuated the relations slightly. This pattern of associations was seen for mortality after 30 days, 1 year and during total follow-up. Conclusion In this study the relative excess mortality rate in lower educated ACS patients was comparable with the excess risk associated with low education in the background population. This educational inequality in survival remained after adjustment for somatic comorbidity and depression.
EVALUATING EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY WITHIN EDUCATIONAL EXPANSION: A FORMAL COMPARISON BETWEEN ODDS RATIO AND THE EDUCATIONAL GINI COEFFICIENT;Odds ratio (OR) and the educational Gini coefficient (EGINI) defined on a specific social grouping scheme can both be used to gauge educational inequality. In this study, we systematically review the scholarship that underpins the utilities of OR and EGINI and evaluate their properties across four research scenarios of allocating newly created opportunities under educational expansion. Formal analyses suggest that (1) both OR and EGINI monotonically increase (decrease) if the newly created educational positions are entirely delivered to the upper (lower) class. However, the rate of change differs between OR and EGINI. (2) When educational opportunities within expansion are allocated according to the relative populations of social classes, the probabilities of upper and lower classes to receive better education rise by the same extent, suggesting that all social classes benefit from the proliferation of educational credentials. This would drive down the EGINI, but change in OR is not monotonic. (3) EGINI remains unchanged if the newly created educational opportunities are allocated based on the initial class composition of better educated individuals before educational expansion. However, OR is driven to increase by the Matthew Effect where the increment in educational probability for the upper class is larger than that for the lower class. The discrepancy of empirical patterns between OR and EGINI is explained, and the practical implications are discussed using a case study of the educational policy evaluation in Britain.
The influence of classroom disciplinary climate of schools on reading achievement: a cross-country comparative study;Despite considerable interest in research and practice in the effect of classroom disciplinary climate of schools on academic achievement, little is known about the generalizability of this effect over countries. Using hierarchical linear analyses, the present study reveals that a better classroom disciplinary climate in a school is significantly associated with better school reading performance in 53 of the 65 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 participant countries. The classroom disciplinary climate of schools can explain 11% of the between-school differences in reading achievement over countries. Controlling for economic, social, and cultural variables and student gender-related variables at student and school levels, the between-country differences in the effect of classroom disciplinary climate of schools shrank by three quarters. These findings can inform countries that face educational inequality issues (e.g., Argentina) and gender gap issues (e.g., Trinidad and Tobago), suggesting the possibility of tackling these issues via intervening on classroom disciplinary climate of schools.
Parents' economic capital and studying medicine abroad. How processes of Europeanization and globalization change the reproduction of social inequalities;"The fact that university degrees are accepted throughout Europe has led to the founding of medical faculties, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, that offer medical studies in German or English and thus attracting students from richer Western European countries like Germany. Unlike medical studies in Germany, access to these foreign universities is not dependent on the final school exam grade, but on the ability to pay high tuition fees. The article compares the social class background of medicine students in Germany with German medicine students in Hungary. The analysis shows that the percentage of medicine students who come from higher social classes is even higher in Hungary than it already is in Germany. Studying medicine in Hungary primarily serves as an immediate reproduction of the parents' profession as many of German medicine students in Hungary have a parent who belongs to the medical profession. The case of German students studying medicine abroad illustrates how Europeanization and Globalization have changed the reproduction of social inequalities; upper classes profit most from the new opportunities."
University Rankings as a New Criterion of Social Inequality in Higher Education?;In this article we discuss whether the differentiation of universities as part of the emergence of rankings in Germany throughout the 1990s led to new social selectivity in the choice of institutions of higher education. We focus on the development in the quantitatively important fields of business and economics as well as engineering. We have analyzed data provided by the German Center for Research on Higher Education and Science Studies from the years 1993, 1996, 2000, and 2005 and have found a trend toward new inequalities in the enrollment in highly ranked universities throughout the 1990s. This, however, had set in before the newly introduced rankings became widely accepted.
The Role of Schooling in Perpetuating Educational Inequality: An International Perspective;In this paper, student-level indicators of opportunity to learn (OTL) included in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment are used to explore the joint relationship of OTL and socioeconomic status (SES) to student mathematics literacy. Using multiple methods, we find consistent evidence that (a) OTL has a significant relationship to student outcomes, (b) a positive relationship exists between SES and OTL, and (c) roughly a third of the SES relationship to literacy is due to its association with OTL. These relationships hold across most countries and both within and between schools within countries. Our findings suggest that in most countries, the organization and policies defining content exposure may exacerbate educational inequalities.
Utilizing Multidimensional Measures of Race in Education Research: The Case of Teacher Perceptions;Education scholarship on race using quantitative data analysis consists largely of studies on the black-white dichotomy and, more recently, on the experiences of students within conventional racial-ethnic categories (white, Hispanic/Latina/o, Asian, black). Despite substantial shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of American children, studies continue to overlook the diverse racialized experiences for students of Asian and Latina/o descent, the racialization of immigration status, and the educational experiences of Native American students. This study provides one possible strategy for developing multidimensional measures of race using large-scale datasets and demonstrates the utility of multidimensional measures for examining educational inequality, using teacher perceptions of student behavior as a case in point. With data from the first grade wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort of 1998-1999, I examine differences in teacher ratings of externalizing problem behaviors and approaches to learning across 14 racialized subgroups at the intersections of race, ethnicity, and immigrant status. Results show substantial subgroup variation in teacher perceptions of problem and learning behaviors and highlight key points of divergence and convergence within conventional racial-ethnic categories.
Educational inequality among the indigenous-speaking population in Michoacan, 2010;Gini coefficients for education were calculated for the ten municipalities of the State of Michoacan with more indigenous-speaking population, using census data for the year 2010. The hypothesis of this paper suggests that, for these municipalities, educational inequality is higher between speakers of indigenous languages than among those, who do not hold that status. The results suggest that the educational inequality was considerably higher among the indigenous-speaking population compared to the population that does not speak indigenous languages, even living in the same municipality. This situation occurred in nine of the ten municipalities studied.
SCHOLARLY INEQUALITIES, TOOLS FOR EVALUATING IT AND STUDY OF THE PROCESS OF PRODUCTION;The article presents the results of those elements, not only of what is known about educational inequality and its evolution from the work of the sociology of education in the years 1960-1970, but also as tools of measurement and lines of thought with which we try to understand and better understand its dimensions and production processes. Data on inequalities in access to different levels of training or qualifications, but also to acquire knowledge and skills at national or international level are examined not only. It also focuses on educational inequalities between students belonging to different social classes, as well as gender inequalities, territorial inequalities and context effects, as well as the most visible changes, paradoxes and contradictions through which they are reproduced and social and educational processes are renewed in the production of inequalities in access to knowledge and training.
Population migration and children's school enrollments in China, 1990-2005;This paper examines the impact of migration on children's school enrollment by analyzing the micro-data from Chinese population censuses in 1990 and 2000 and mini-census in 2005. We match school-age children (7-14 years old) with their parents, and examine how migration status and parents' absence affect children's school enrollment in urban China. We also compare rural-urban migrant children with their peers in both origin counties and destination districts. Results show that migrant children are less likely to be enrolled in school than urban local children and that children of rural registration status are particularly disadvantaged in school enrollment over the whole examined period in urban China. Rural-urban migrant children fare significantly worse than non-migrant children in both origins and destinations and noticeably they are even less likely than left-behind children to be enrolled in school. The likelihood of being enrolled in school increases for rural-urban migrant children as they spend more time in destinations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Are boys that bad? Gender gaps in measured skills, grades and aspirations in Czech elementary schools;This article examines gender gaps in academic performance (grades in mathematics and reading) between boys and girls of ninth-grade elementary schools in the Czech Republic. Our analysis is based on 2003 data from the Programme for International Student Assessment, encompassing the academic performance and family background of ninth-grade pupils. Similar to research on other countries, we find that girls strongly outperform boys in grades in Czech language, but that this gender gap is not explained by measured ability in reading nor on family background or student attributes. We also find gender bias in mathematics grades, after controlling for measured ability and other factors. Girls are also substantially more likely than boys to apply to secondary grammar schools, as well as aspire to a college education, even after controlling for measured ability. We put forward a number of theoretical perspectives that shed light on the possible causes of these empirical findings.
Educational inequality in Cotonou (Benin): the increasing role of family supervision in obtaining quality education;Educational inequality in Cotonou (Benin): the increasing role of family supervision in obtaining quality education-In Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, primary school enrolment is available to all. Girls and boys go to school. Very few children between the ages of 6 and 14 years have never attended school. However, not all children have the same educational experience. Drawing on data from a socio-economic survey conducted in 2012, the authors examine pupils' schooling conditions. Their analyses confirm the hypotheses derived from the literature review: inequalities have moved from outside school to inside it. Generalised access to primary school has not done away with inequalities-far from it and today in Cotonou the schooling and learning conditions are very diverse. The most advantaged children are enrolled in private schools, have a tutor and are helped with their homework by their parents. These children are those who come from the more affluent social classes and in particular those whose parents have the highest level of formal education. The inequalities once observed in access to school have now shifted to extracurricular supervision and the choice of school. The survey also highlighted that the few children still entirely outside of the school system are foster children.
Adult learning and social inequalities: Processes of equalisation or cumulative disadvantage?;Adult learning is an increasingly important form of education in globalised and aging societies. While current policy recommendations tend to focus on increasing participation rates, the authors of this article argue that higher participation rates do not necessarily lead to lower social/educational inequalities in participation. The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between social inequalities and adult learning by exploring cross-national patterns of participation in different adult learning activities and the consequences of participation on individual labour market trajectories. The empirical basis of the paper is an analysis of 13 country studies (as well as two cross-national analyses) brought together by the international comparative research project Education as a lifelong process-comparing educational trajectories in modern societies (eduLIFE). Despite wide variations in participation rates across countries, mechanisms of social/educational inequality in engagement in job-related adult learning tend to be relatively similar across countries, in particular with regard to non-formal learning. Effects tend most frequently to be a presence of cumulative advantage, though in some countries a certain degree of equalisation is noticeable with regard to formal adult education. The authors conclude that it is relatively clear that currently almost no country is truly able to reduce social inequalities through adult learning. Their recommendation is that public policy makers should place greater emphasis on making adult learning more accessible (in terms of entry requirements, affordability as well as motivation) to underrepresented groups, in particular those who are educationally disadvantaged.
mortality and survival of women and men in the Americas, 1990-2010;"Objective. Analyze magnitude and trends in educational inequality in mortality and survival of women and men in countries of the Americas. Methods. Gap and gradient metrics were used to calculate inequality between countries in adult mortality, average age of death, life expectancy, and healthy life expectancy, according to educational level in men and women for 1990 and 2010. Results. Between 1990 and 2010, the average number of years of education increased from 8 to 10 with no difference between sexes. Adult mortality (15-59 years) did not change: 1.9 per 1 000 women and 3.7 per 1 000 men. The slope index of inequality (SII) increased from -1.0 to -2.0 per 1 000 women and from -1.2 to -4.4 per 1 000 men. Life expectancy increased from 75.6 to 78.7 years in women and from 68.9 to 72.4 in men; absolute inequality decreased from 7.8 to 7.2 years in women and increased from 7.2 to 9.2 years in men. Healthy life expectancy increased from 63.7 to 65.9 years in women and from 59.5 to 62.5 years in men; the SII declined from 6.9 to 5.8 years in women and increased from 6.9 to 7.8 years in men. Conclusions. In the countries of the Americas, men are at greater risk of dying, die earlier, and live fewer disease-and disability-free years than women; educational level is a determinant of mortality and survival in both sexes, and educational inequalities are more pronounced and increasing among men, and are disproportionately concentrated in the most socially disadvantaged populations."
The Cumulative Disadvantages of First- and Second-Generation Segregation for Middle School Achievement;Middle schools are important because they launch students on trajectories that they are likely to follow throughout their formal educations. This study explored the relationship of first-generation segregation (elementary and middle school racial composition) and second-generation segregation (racially correlated academic tracks) to reading and mathematics test scores of Grade 8 students who attended the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) in 1997. At the time the data were collected, the district had been operating under a mandatory desegregation plan since the early 1970s, which it continued to do for another five years. While the majority of students attended desegregated schools for most of their CMS education, a portion of youth also experienced school- and classroom-level segregation. Survey data collected from 1,812 students in randomly selected language arts classes stratified by track from the district's 24 middle schools were analyzed with multilevel modeling to examine the influence of school and classroom racial composition on standardized scores, controlling for student and family factors associated with school performance. Results indicate that school- and classroom-level racial segregation was negatively related to achievement. Beginning in elementary school, sequential experiences of first- and second-generation segregation likely triggered a cycle of cumulative disadvantage for respondents' middle school educational outcomes. This article contributes to the literatures on the structural antecedents of school success and failure, the ways that many positive desegregation effects are undermined by tracking, and how first- and second-generation segregation contributes to maintaining the race gap in school outcomes.
Impact of primary and secondary social origin factors on the transition to university in the Czech Republic;The main objective of this paper is to show to what extent and why students with the same academic aptitude but different social backgrounds have different odds of entering university. For our analysis, we separated primary and secondary factors of social origin in the formation of educational inequalities. The results show that the primary and secondary factors have approximately the same influence on the transition to university. Czech schools do not affect the process of forming educational aspirations and transition to university, and merely classify' children according to their social origin. This situation emerged during the socialist era and has remained unchanged after the fall of communism (in 1989). However, the mechanism of the social origin effect has changed - while cultural capital with a direct' impact had a major role to play during the socialist era, at present there is a rather indirect' influence through economic capital.
The evolution of educational inequalities through secondary school: Evidence from a South African panel study;Schooling outcomes in South Africa are characterised by significant inequalities on the basis of race and socio-economic status. This paper reports on findings from a unique panel dataset that follows individuals who participated in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study in 2002 as Grade 8 students through to their secondary school-leaving examination (known as 'matric') in Grade 12. The paper investigates the extent to which secondary schools differ in converting Grade 8 achievement into matric outcomes. Achievement in Grade 8 is strongly predictive of survival to matric, passing matric and performance in matric. Many students had extremely weak mathematical proficiency in Grade 8 and yet decided to take matric mathematics, only to fail the subject. Increasing the number of matric mathematics passes is a strong policy imperative. Our analysis suggests that the way to achieve this is to improve mathematics learning at earlier stages of the school programme rather than through indiscriminate mathematics participation in matric.
Teach For/Teach First candidates: what conclusions do they draw from their time in teaching?;Teach For and Teach First programs now constitute a significant pathway into teaching in a number of countries. One criterion for selection into these programs is leadership capacity, and evidence indicates that many candidates do move into leadership roles in education, business, and policy in the years following their time as a Teach For/Teach First candidate. Given their capacity to influence policy directions and school practice, and to speak with the authority of at least some experience in challenging schools, it is important to understand the types of conclusions they draw from their time in teaching, and the solutions they propose to the problems of educational inequality. This study set out to explore the types of attributions made by 76 Teach For candidates for the low achievement of disadvantaged students, and what they consider to be potential means of effectively addressing the achievement gap. Participants gave most importance to the types of people attracted to and retained in teaching, and placed relatively little importance on improving school resourcing or addressing systemic and structural contributions to educational disadvantage. Implications for those training and working with Teach For candidates are discussed.
Educational inequalities in higher education in Hong Kong;Harsh levels of social inequality stunt social mobility and progress towards equality of opportunity in Hong Kong. There are also strong connections between levels of social inequality and educational attainment in this global city. This paper seeks to contribute to the important body of work on equality studies and attainment research by examining two inter-connected aspects of educational inequality in higher education in Hong Kong: first, the relative shortage of degree places available for local students at local universities, and second, the relatively strong correlation between income and educational attainment across the districts in Hong Kong. It adopts a discursive sociocultural approach in examining, and commenting on, both the context and statistical trajectory of post-secondary education in Hong Kong. The paper also assesses government initiatives that claim to encourage higher levels of post-secondary participation, in particular through the rapid development of self-financed sub-degree programmes. A secondary argument discusses how university rankings criteria have a deleterious effect on the commitment to promote mass higher education, especially in terms of participation rates at publicly-funded full-time degree programmes.
Urban segregation in Montevideo. Investment in human capital, access to social capital, and their impact in the first job;This article explores the impact of urban segmentation in Montevideo in the distribution of social capital as well as the years of schooling achieved. Thus, it analyzes the consequences on the quality of the first job. Firstly, we observe the distribution of schooling and social capital based on PISA panel 2006-2011 through hierarchical lineal models of individuals nested in neighborhoods. Secondly, we estimate the impact of the social capital on the prevalence of youngsters who obtain a quality first job through propensity score matching. The results show a segmentation of Montevideo with socioeconomic criteria, the impact in schooling achievement as well as in social capital. This social capital is relevant for obtaining a quality first job, thus promoting inequality in urban segregation scenario.
Religious Denomination, and Educational Success in West Germany with a Focus on Diaspora Effects;Current research on the relevance of religious affiliation for educational success is scarce in Germany. We address this gap and look at differences among Protestants, Catholics, and Muslims regarding educational success. We focus on West Germany, where both Christian denominations are more or less equal in size overall, but with strong regional variations. According to relevant literature, differences in educational success by religion might be due to specific values and beliefs, or minority status (diaspora), yet parts of the population in a diaspora might be highly selective due to spatial mobility. Muslims might be less successful, as the Islamic religion is seen as a bright boundary in the German context, which impedes assimilation. To test these hypotheses, we use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) collected between 1997 and 2011. The dependent variable is enrolment in the most prestigious secondary school type (Gymnasium) at the ages of 13 to 16. We use linear probability models to estimate school attendance with fixed effects for districts. Altogether, Catholics, Protestants, and Muslims do not differ in educational success if we control for parents' socioeconomic status. In the case of the two Christian denominations, belonging to a regional minority leads to higher success. There are strong hints that this is caused by parents' spatial mobility.
Pigmentocracies: Educational inequality, skin color and census ethnoracial identification in eight Latin American countries;For the first time, most Latin American censuses ask respondents to self-identify by race or ethnicity allowing researchers to examine long-ignored ethnoracial inequalities. However, reliance on census ethnoracial categories could poorly capture the manifestation(s) of race that lead to inequality in the region, because of classificatory ambiguity and within-category racial or color heterogeneity. To overcome this, we modeled the relation of both interviewer-rated skin color and census ethnoracial categories with educational inequality using innovative data from the 2010 America's Barometer from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) and 2010 surveys from the Project On Ethnicity and Race in Latin America (PERLA) for eight Latin American countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru). We found that darker skin color was negatively and consistently related to schooling in all countries, with and without extensive controls. Indigenous and black self-identification was also negatively related to schooling, though not always at a statistically significant and robust level like skin color. In contrast, results for self-identified mulattos, mestizos and whites were inconsistent and often counter to the expected racial hierarchy, suggesting that skin color measures often capture racial inequalities that census measures miss.

The Family Socioeconomic Effect on Extra Lessons in Greater China: A Comparison between Shanghai, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao;Spawned by the heightened competition in mainstream education, supplementary tutoring outside regular school time has rapidly expanded as a common practice of students seeking to gain a competitive edge in school. It is widely known that students from low socioeconomic status (SES) families lag behind their high-SES peers in academic performance. This study examines whether extra lessons reinforce or weaken the family effect on educational inequality. We use the Programme for International Student Assessment 2009 data to analyze the effect of family SES on the likelihood and intensity of students' extra lesson attendance in four Chinese regions: Shanghai, Taiwan (Chinese Taipei), Hong Kong, and Macao. The research confirms that (1) high-SES students are more likely than low-SES students to receive extra lessons, and (2) among the students who participated, high-SES students also invested more time each week in such lessons. However, the study has also found substantial regional differences.
The flow of higher qualified new teachers into challenging UK high schools;If every child is to have a fairly even chance of a good education, every child must have a fairly even chance of being taught by high-quality teachers. However, high levels of social segregation in UK schools concentrate disadvantaged young people in some schools creating conditions that may deter many teachers. This study investigates whether higher qualified new teachers are deterred from working in challenging schools by examining the average entrance requirements of teachers' degree subject combined with the university grade teachers achieved of all newly qualified teachers in the UK over three recent years (n = 37,039) and relating these qualifications to the results and socio-economic make-up of schools they sought and found employment. Higher qualified teachers were found to be most attracted to schools with high attainment, next most to those that achieve greater progress, next most to schools with more affluent pupils and least of all to schools that achieve greater progress accounting for pupils' socio-economic background. Higher qualified new teachers were also found to prefer schools that achieve low progress with affluent pupils to schools that achieve high progress with disadvantaged pupils. Further analysis finds that recruitment imbalances were large as the top quartile highest qualified new teachers were over-represented in higher attaining schools by around a fifth of the new teacher workforce. These results suggest that without steps to increase recruitment of higher qualified teachers into challenging schools, recruitment market forces are likely to prevent challenging schools from being be able to narrow the gap.
Socioeconomic inequality and mortality - a regional Danish cohort study;"Background: Socioeconomic inequalities in mortality pose a serious impediment to enhance public health even in highly developed welfare states. This study aimed to improve the understanding of socioeconomic disparities in all-cause mortality by using a comprehensive approach including a range of behavioural, psychological, material and social determinants in the analysis. Methods: Data from The North Denmark Region Health Survey 2007 among residents in Northern Jutland, Denmark, were linked with data from nationwide administrative registries to obtain information on death in a 5.8-year follow-up period (1stFebruary 2007-31stDecember 2012). Socioeconomic position was assessed using educational status as a proxy. The study population was assigned to one of five groups according to highest achieved educational level. The sample size was 8,837 after participants with missing values or aged below 30 years were excluded. Cox regression models were used to assess the risk of death from all causes according to educational level, with a step-wise inclusion of explanatory covariates. Results: Participants' mean age at baseline was 54.1 years (SD 12.6); 3,999 were men (45.3%). In the follow-up period, 395 died (4.5%). With adjustment for age and gender, the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the two least-educated levels (HR = 1.5, 95%, CI = 1.2-1.8 and HR = 3.7, 95% CI = 2.4-5.9, respectively) compared to the middle educational level. After adjustment for the effect of subjective and objective health, similar results were obtained (HR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.7 and HR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.0-6.3, respectively). Further adjustment for the effect of behavioural, psychological, material and social determinants also failed to eliminate inequalities found among groups, the risk remaining significantly higher for the least educated levels (HR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9 and HR = 4.0, 95% CI = 2.3-6.8, respectively). In comparison with the middle level, the two highest educated levels remained statistically insignificant throughout the entire analysis. Conclusion: Socioeconomic inequality influenced mortality substantially even when adjusted for a range of determinants that might explain the association. Further studies are needed to understand this important relationship."
Educational Inequality in Physical Inactivity in Leisure Time in Spanish Adult Population: Differences in Ten Years (2002-2012);Background: Social inequality in health is an increasing phenomenon in the world. The aim was to compare in 2002 and 2012, the magnitude of inequalities in leisure-time physical inactivity by educational level in Spain, but also the trends in health perception, in physically inactive people. Methods: A cross-sectional study from the National Health Survey in Spain in 2002 (n= 21,650) and 2012 (n= 21,007). The population aged from 25 to 64 years. At the first stage, physical inactivity in leisure-time was the dependent variable, and educational level was the independent variable. At the second stage, self-perception of health in last 12 months was the dependent variable. Logistic regression was adjusted using other variables: age, marital status, employment status and social class of the head of the family. Results: Prevalence of leisure time physical inactivity was in 2012, up to 53.9% (men) and 67.5% (women), in the group aged between 25-44 with primary education. It declined in all age and sex groups in 2012, compared to 2002 (down to 18.7 percentage points). More than three times inactive women in between those who have primary or less education: OR 3.27 (2.35-4.55) in 2012. Bad health perceived in women with less educational level comparing with those with higher education. It also has declined over time: OR 1.45 in 2002 to OR 1.91, in 2012 (45-64 aged group). Conclusions: Although the prevalence of physical inactivity has decreased, inequalities in such behavior have increased in 2012 respect 2002.
Inequality, marketisation and the left: Schools policy in England and Sweden;It is argued in this article that the marketisation of schools policy has a tendency to produce twin effects: an increase in educational inequality, and an increase in general satisfaction with the schooling system. However, the effect on educational inequality is very much stronger where prevailing societal inequality is higher. The result is that cross-party political agreement on the desirability of such reforms is much more likely where societal inequality is lower (as the inequality effects are also lower). Counterintuitively, then, countries that are more egalitarian - and so typically thought of as being more left-wing - will have a higher likelihood of adopting marketisation than more unequal countries. Evidence is drawn from a paired comparison of English and Swedish schools policies from the 1980s to the present. Both the policy history and elite interviews lend considerable support for the theory in terms of both outcomes and mechanisms.
Learning in a Burning House: Educational Inequality, Ideology, and (Dis)Integration;
Do grandparents matter? A multigenerational perspective on educational attainment in Taiwan;In response to the growing interest in multigenerational effects, we investigate whether grandparents' education affects grandchildren's transitions to academic high school and university in Taiwan. Drawing on social capital literature, we consider potential heterogeneity of the grandparent effect by parents' characteristics and propose that grandparents' education yields differential effects depending on parents' education. Our results show tenuous effects of grandmother's and grandfather's years of schooling, net of parents' education. However, the positive interaction effects between grandparents' and parents' years of schooling indicate that grandparents' additional years of schooling are more beneficial to students with more educated parents than for students with less educated parents. The diverging gap in the likelihood of attending academic high school or university between students with parents in higher and lower ends of the educational hierarchy, along with increased levels of grandparents' education, supports our hypothesis that grandparents' education augments educational inequality by parents' education.

Prospective register-based study of the impact of immigration on educational inequalities in mortality in Norway;"Background: Differences in mortality with regard to socioeconomic status have widened in recent decades in many European countries, including Norway. A rapid upsurge of immigration to Norway has occurred since the 1990s. The article investigates the impact of immigration on educational mortality differences among adults in Norway. Methods: Two linked register-based data sets are analyzed; the first consists of all registered inhabitants aged 20-69 in Norway January 1, 1993 (2.6 millions), and the second of all registered inhabitants aged 20-69 as of January 1, 2008 (2.8 millions). Deaths 1993-1996 and 2008-2011, respectively, immigrant status, and other background information are available in the data. Mortality is examined by Cox regression analyses and by estimations of age-adjusted deaths per 100,000 personyears. Results: Both relative and absolute educational inequality in mortality increased from the 1993-1996 period to 2008-2011, but overall mortality levels went down during these years. Immigrants in general, and almost all the analyzed immigrant subcategories, had lower mortality than the native majority. This was due to comparatively low mortality among lower educated immigrants, while mortality among higher educated immigrants was similar to the mortality level of highly educated natives. Conclusions: The widening of educational inequality in mortality during the 1990s and 2000s in Norway was not due to immigration. Immigration rather contributed to slightly lower overall mortality in the population and a less steep educational gradient in mortality."
Educational Expansion and Inequalities in Educational Opportunity: Long-Term Changes for East and West Germany;Using data on successive birth cohorts from the German Life History Study and the National Educational Panel Study, we analyse how the process of educational attainment of men and women from different educational origins has changed in the long run. Our results show that educational inequality is strongly declining at the first transition to upper secondary education across cohorts. However, it is constant or even slightly increasing at the transition to the traditional university. In addition, there are no origin-specific differences in the transition to university of applied science graduation. In other words, there is no unidirectional trend of change in inequalities of educational opportunities across all transitions.
Freedom versus Equality? The Effect of Compulsory Primary School Recommendations on Social Inequality in Secondary Education;Compulsory school recommendations by primary schools are frequently discussed as a way of reducing social inequality in secondary education. However, it has not been possible to prove such an effect empirically in an unambiguous way. Using the German Microcensus we address this research gap. Firstly, we compare the educational inequality in federal states with compulsory and with non-compulsory school recommendations for the period 1976 to 2010. Secondly, we analyze the consequences of the change from a compulsory to a non-compulsory recommendation in Lower Saxony in the school year 1979/80 and from a non-compulsory to a compulsory recommendation in North Rhine-Westphalia at the end of the school year 2006/07. Our results indicate that the social inequality in educational achievement as measured in the middle of lower secondary level is not systematically connected to the compulsiveness of primary school recommendations.
Consequences of the Bologna-Reform: Why Do Social Differences Exist at the Transition from Bachelor to Master Degree Programs?;In the course of the Bologna process, traditional one-cycle German higher education degrees were transformed into two-cycle bachelor and subsequent master programs. This has established new transition points in higher eduction and different employment prospects for bachelor and master graduates. Although the intention of the reform was to reduce social inequality, students from less privileged families often forgo graduate studies. While different explanations can be offered for this phenomenon, the underlying decision processes are not well understood. The present contribution draws on rational choice and cultural reproduction theories and on life course analysis in discussing some of the mechanisms that may explain the pattern of social inequality. By using a panel dataset representative of Germany it discusses the empirical evidence. Results indicate that social inequality at the transition from bachelor to master studies mainly results from differences in students' previous educational biographies, differences in their academic ability, and a higher cost sensitivity on the part of less privileged groups.
Lessons from outside the classroom: What can New Zealand learn from the long Chilean Winter?;This article explores the potential impact of increased school choice, specifically of proposed charter (partnership) schools, on educational inequality in New Zealand. An initial review of the educational marketplace literature proves inconclusive as to whether privatised schooling is capable of reducing disparity in academic outcomes and broader social contexts, and even suggests it might further increase segregation. Subsequently, the article presents a case study of educational inequality in Chile (1990-2010) to set up a comparison of an education system that has become increasingly market based and unequal. The 20-year time frame was selected to cover the shift to decentralised education under Pinochet until the large-scale breakout of student protests against systemic inequality, known as the Chilean Winter'. In conclusion, the article suggests that a successful strategy to counter educational disparity needs to create viable alternatives to a free-market approach and, as such, it appears that there are important lessons that New Zealand can learn from the Chilean Winter - lessons that go beyond the implementation of charter schools to fundamental social structures.
Teacher Placement Into Immigrant English Learner Classrooms: Limiting Access in Comprehensive High Schools;This qualitative study examined how secondary teachers were assigned to teach courses intended to expand English learners' (ELs') access to academic subjects. Theoretically, this research extends the contexts of reception framework from immigration studies into the educational realm by investigating how teachersas one important contextual variableentered into settings designed for immigrant-origin ELs. Analysis examined institutional processes, norms, and policies as well as participants' practices. Findings suggest that novice teachers were most likely to be placed into separate EL content-area classrooms, unless more senior teachers requested these assignments or administrators intervened. Ultimately, this article uses teacher assignment processes to illustrate how contexts for immigrant-origin youth are constructed and contested and how ELs' opportunities to learn were jeopardized in local settings.
Kindergarten Black-White Test Score Gaps: Re-examining the Roles of Socioeconomic Status and School Quality with New Data;Black-white test score gaps form in early childhood and widen over elementary school. Sociologists have debated the roles that socioeconomic status (SES) and school quality play in explaining these patterns. In this study, I replicate and extend past research using new nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011. I find black-white test score gaps at kindergarten entry in 2010 in reading (SD = .32), math (SD = .54), and working memory (SD = .52 among children with valid scores). Math and reading gaps widened by approximately .06 standard deviations over kindergarten, but the working memory gap was constant. Multivariate regressions show that student SES explained the reading gap at school entry, but gap decompositions suggest that school quality differences were responsible for the widening of the reading gap over kindergarten. SES explained much of the math gap at school entry, but the widening of the math gap could not be explained by SES, school quality, or other hypotheses.
Schooling, space and social justice;"The representational space of teachers and children in schools has changed beyond all recognition. Drawing on the idea that the school is a socio-spatial landscape, a highly significant institutional space with which children engage, we can understand forms of educational inequality as consequences of spatial production. This article contributes to the emerging literature suggesting that the spatial dimension of education is increasingly important in analysing the re/production of individual identities and social inequalities. Putting space at the centre of the article provides a further tool in which to analyse the possibilities for change in terms of educational social justice for all children. Using spatial theory, this article examines the overlapping relationships of spatial production, including: spatial practices of teaching and learning; representational space in terms of policy discourse; and spatial representations in terms of the daily experiences of school life. The particular emphasis is to examine the stories of people's schooling experiences in order to investigate how schools shape, have shaped, and are shaped by the 'structures' and 'landscapes' of the education process, as well as by the social practices and interactions of participants. With a particular focus on Gypsy/Traveller experiences of school, this article examines the situation of children from these communities and their unique relationship with the schooling system and education more widely."
Parenting for social mobility? Home learning, parental warmth, class and educational outcomes;Parenting has come to play a pivotal role in breaking intergenerational disadvantage and increasing children's life chances and social mobility through practices such as parental support with their learning and education. Using a UK representative sample from the Millennium Cohort Study, the present study examined the unique and cumulative contribution of children's characteristics, parenting practices and family's socio-economic background to children's educational outcomes at the end of Key Stage 1 (age 7). Consistently with previous studies, the findings showed that family's socio-economic background made a substantive contribution to teacher-rated reading, maths and sciences. Despite much emphasis within family policy on parents as being central in tackling educational inequality, certain aspects of parenting such as involvement with home learning, parental warmth and discipline did not explain a significant amount of variance in teacher- rated reading, maths and sciences. These findings are likely to contribute to debates regarding the role of parents in reducing the achievement gap and the enduring influence of social class on young people's school outcomes, drawing important implications for family policy.
Social Inequality in Modern Higher Education;One of the urgent problems of modern society is the accessibility and quality of higher education for various population groups. The importance of the knowledge and skills acquired in the process of education to achieve social success is proved by a large number of studies. However, the value of higher education for the representatives of different social groups is an open to debate issue. Many researchers point out that the function of education as a channel of the social mobility is gradually neutralized. On the contrary, education becomes an institute of strengthening and reproduction of the inequality. This process contributes to another socio-cultural effect dislocation of the value scale for those who are deprived of access to quality higher education. As a result we can observe the erosion of basic mental values in the society, the growth of resentment sentiment and social tension. The given article discusses some aspects of the above mentioned problems. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
STRUCTURAL INEQUALITY IN EDUCATION: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF LITERACY IN RUSSIA AND THE OECD COUNTRIES;In the current period studies of the professions and professionalism are increasingly associated with the measurement of knowledge and competences, alongside assessments of national educational systems. In this paper the authors evaluate the effectiveness of different areas and levels of the Russian educational system in comparison to the educational systems of the most economically developed countries. A study of adult literacy levels across different generations was conducted in order to reveal stability (or instability) in educational outcomes over the long run in different groups, including both those with higher and lower levels of education and modest and significant access to resources. The empirical basis for this research are the results of international comparative studies from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA, all rounds were carried out with the participation of Russia), and the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). The central question of the article is to ask whether the specific features of the Russian educational system exist on the macro-level in comparison to developed countries. Moreover, if found to exist, what advantages and disadvantages do they bring to Russian education? Do educational outcomes change with time? And what are the tendencies of these changes?
Survey on the Practices and Accomplishments of School Management Entrustment in China;School management is of high importance to the success of school education. There is an emerging trend of school management entrustment in China, aiming to assist schools in need by entrusting their management to better established schools. The school management entrustment helps reduce the current educational inequality between well-resourced elite schools in big cities and less-equipped needy schools in rural areas. We conduct a survey on school management entrustment in Shanghai and Chengdu, two representative top cities of China. The scope, characteristics, practicing methods and accomplishments of the school management entrustment are presented. The benefits of school management entrustment are found to include improved student standard test scores, enhanced school management team, reinforced teaching staff, increased student motivation, confidence, and perseverance, and increased satisfaction and involvement of parents. We further discuss the areas for further improvements, such as sustainable education quality improvement, establishment of positive school culture, and enhancement of 3rd-party evaluation organizations.
Middle-class Students Studying in a Community College in Hong Kong: A Mismatch between High-status Habitus and Low-status Field?;This article is about twelve middle-class students, previously studying in elite primary and secondary schools, making another attempt at getting into university in Hong Kong. Despite their failure at a critical educational stage, which contradicts a general pattern of middle-class educational success, they decide to seek a second chance by reading an associate degree in community college, a perceived inferior educational option. Despite feeling determined, they are anxious and uneasy with taking up this option. How the middle class feel about their academic pursuits, especially after a critical failure, is under-researched. This article attempts to fill this gap by referring to Bourdieu's notions of habitus and field to make sense of the complex or contradictory feelings of 12 students with a self-conscious, high-status, middle-class habitus in encountering a perceived low-status community college. I shall conclude this article with the normative implication of our discussion in making sense of educational inequality.
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THE PROBLEM OF SEGREGATION IN US;"Charter Schools emerged in the 1990s as an alternative to the U.S. public schools with the hope that charter schools would not be exposed to the same problems of the traditional public schools that are due to high levels of bureaucracy, less autonomy and no competition for students, hence for financial resources. This came about following the success of magnet schools that emerged as a product of the previous generation in the 1970s. Likewise, charter school movement had bipartisan support from many levels and today, although still only about 1 percent of students is enrolled in charter schools they emerged as a successful model to traditional public schools and even to the private schools in many areas. U.S. has the most diverse group of students in its history and all the basic trends indicate the diversity will become even greater. Among the school age population after only one generation the entire country will become a minority non-white or non-European in origin. Diversity is growing rapidly in the nation's suburban rings, which have become the center of American life and politics. Yet schools remain largely segregated and are becoming more so although Americans still believe that their children benefit from integrated education and there is substantial evidence that those beliefs are correct. Segregated schools are still highly unequal. Segregation by race related to segregation by poverty and to many forms of educational inequality for African American and Latino students; few whites experience impoverished schools. Efforts to overcome the effects of segregation through special programs have had some success, but there is no evidence that they have equalized systems of segregated schools. Segregated schools particularly those in big cities have stunningly high levels of high school dropouts and very poor records of preparing students for higher education. Segregation has not been a successful educational or social policy. Yet U.S. school system is experiencing a continuing expansion of segregation for both blacks and Latinos and serious backward movement in the South. Specifically in this study, effect of charter school movement on the issue of ethnic, racial, religious, socio-economic segregation has been analyzed and it has been concluded that in fact there is a relation between the segregation issue and the charter school movement and that this relationship is mostly a negative one unlike magnet schools, which substantially improved the segregation problem in the 1970s; however it was not clear whether it is the charter school movement that is the cause or it is the other way around."
Educational inequality in the occurrence of abdominal obesity: Pro-Saude Study;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the degree of educational inequality in the occurrence of abdominal obesity in a population of non-faculty civil servants at university campi. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used data from 3,117 subjects of both genders aged 24 to 65-years old, regarding the baseline of Pro-Saude Study, 1999-2001. Abdominal obesity was defined according to abdominal circumference thresholds of 88 cm for women and 102 cm for men. A multi-dimensional, self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate education levels and demographic variables. Slope and relative indices of inequality, and Chi-squared test for linear trend were used in the data analysis. All analyses were stratified by genders, and the indices of inequality were standardized by age. RESULTS: Abdominal obesity was the most prevalent among women (43.5%; 95% CI 41.2;45.9), as compared to men (24.3%;95% CI 22.1;26.7), in all educational strata and age ranges. The association between education levels and abdominal obesity was an inverse one among women (p < 0.001);it was not statistically significant among men (p = 0.436). The educational inequality regarding abdominal obesity in the female population, in absolute terms (slope index of inequality), was 24.0% (95% CI 15.5;32.6). In relative terms (relative index of inequality), it was 2.8 (95% CI 1.9;4.1), after the age adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Gender inequality in the prevalence of abdominal obesity increases with older age and lower education. The slope and relative indices of inequality summarize the strictly monotonous trend between education levels and abdominal obesity, and it described educational inequality regarding abdominal obesity among women. Such indices provide relevant quantitative estimates for monitoring abdominal obesity and dealing with health inequalities."
THE EFFECTS OF SUMMER LITERACY PROGRAMS: LEARNING OPPORTUNITY THEORY AND NON-TRADITIONAL STUDENTS IN ONTARIO FRENCH LANGUAGE SCHOOLS;According to studies from the United States and English Canada, student achievement gaps grow over the summer months when children are not attending school, but summer literacy interventions can reduce those gaps. This paper presents data from a quasi-experiment conducted in eight Ontario French language school boards in 2010, 2011 and 2012 for 682 children in grades 1-3. Growth in literacy test scores between June and September are compared for 361 attendees of summer literacy programs and 321 control students. Summer program recruits initially had lower prior literacy scores and grades, and tended to hail from relatively disadvantaged social backgrounds. Yet, summer programs narrowed those pre-existing gaps. Effect sizes from a variety of regression and propensity score matching models ranged from .32 to .58, which is quite sizeable by the standards of elementary school interventions and summer programs. Effects were stronger among students whose parents reported not speaking French exclusively at home. Our paper considers learning opportunity theory in light of the non-traditional student in Ontario French language schools.
Agents of reproduction or actors of transformation? Teachers in the focus of Pierre Bourdieu's sociology of education;"As the result of social inequalities in our educational system has been widely discussed in the 1960s, it is part of the challenging tasks of social sciences to develop and provide theoretical explications of these still valid findings. The importance attached to the teachers concerning the production and increase of social inequalities is surprisingly very different in the currently discussed theoretical explanations. Depending on the theoretical position, teachers were considered as either agents of reproduction or as actors of transformation of educational inequalities. This paper discusses these two perspectives. Moreover, it will be centred on the reflections and assumptions of Pierre Bourdieu. The paper argues in favour of giving greater consideration to the theoretical perspective of Bourdieu; not, however, without enhancing them by referring to approaches of pedagogical professionalism and research on teacher habitus."
Determinants of Income Inequality in the Early Twenty-First Century: A Cross-National Study;This paper uses Solt's Standardized World Income Inequality Database and attempts to explain variations in Gini coefficients for net household income across 142 developing, transitional and developed societies. The causal model contains three sets of explanatory variables: (1) economic dualism, (2) educational attainment and educational inequality, and (3) political and state influences on income inequality. The most important cause of inequality is still the Kuznets effect: societies at low and high levels of development have less inequality than those at intermediate levels. Population growth increases inequality. Rising labor productivity in the agricultural relative to that in the non-agricultural sector, and being a former Soviet society reduce inequality. Educational attainment has less effect than educational inequality on income inequality. Government income transfers sometimes reduce inequality, but have no effect when all variables are in the model. Finally, liberal democracy has no net effect on inequality
Do parents and siblings serve as educational resources? How and what extent family capital contributes to children's educational aspirations, self-concept and educational attainment;Due to both the growing importance of education for life trajectories and the social structural dependency, the family comes to the fore as the place where social inequalities emerge and are being reproduced. In this contribution, the indicators of family life events on which quantitative empirical family and education research has been based so far will be discussed and extended. The focus will be primarily placed on parental support in school issues and on the educational attainment experience of siblings. Based on NEPS data of starting cohort 3, these events will be investigated within the framework of a path analytical model with regard to their explanatory power for the education-related habitus and the school achievements of 5th graders (N=4,661). It can be demonstrated that both aspirations for educational attainment and the school-related as well as the general self-concept of the students are more pronounced when older siblings already had experiences in higher education as well as in the case of parental school-related support of children's aspirations for educational attainment. Thereby the dependency of expectations of educational attainment and orientations on family resources and family practices related to education can be determined more precisely. This, in turn, serves as a first step aiming at the longitudinally oriented analysis of central intermediation mechanisms of the reproduction of educational inequality within the family.
Perspectives of parents on the all-day school;All-day schools are not only meant to improve the individual development of their students, they are also supposed to support parents in reconciling family and work. However, studies on parental acceptance of all-day schools focus primarily on the issue of work-life balance. The opinions of parents with regard to the potential support of all-day schools for individual development and educational success of their children have hardly been examined. In this paper, we investigate whether parents regard all-day schools as an opportunity for improving the individual development of their children. For our analyses, we use mainly the data of a survey of parents of students at all-day schools (N=16,261), which was conducted in 2009 within the Study on the development of all-day schools (StEG). First of all, our findings show that all-day schools are accepted particularly by East German parents in dual-income households. These parents see all-day schools as an opportunity for both goals, i.e. for a better care as well as a way of enhancing the personal development of their children. This is especially true for parents with a less privileged social background.
IMAGINING CRITICAL COSMIC PEDAGOGY NESTED WITHIN CRITICAL PEDAGOGY;"The infinite problems attendant with mass public schooling requires evermore resilient and innovative theories to buttress an account of education that is socially defensible. While educational inequality could previously be attributed to developing nations due to their economic underdevelopment, developed nations too, with growing rapidity have to confront their internal burgeoning crises in education. It is against this backdrop that I focus on the possibility of expanding a notion of critical pedagogy by nesting the concept of cosmic pedagogy therein. As such, I draw on the Montessorian theory of cosmic education; Bazalukan theory of the formation of a planetary and cosmic personality; and Freireian critical pedagogy to discover the resonance and disharmony between these conceptual positions. Of the three theoretical frames, each can in their own right be considered a methodological approach to address particular problems in education and society at large. So it is with these theories and methods in mind that I suggest and reflect upon the ways that education might nudge us along in our attempt to be fully human and to occupy the space of intelligent matter in an ever expanding universe."
Institutional barriers and education accessibility mechanisms: conception and regional dynamics;The article is devoted to the problem of educational inequality reproduction. The authors refer to domestic and foreign sociological studies of education research developing their own concept of major mechanisms that provide reproduction of inequality through public education, as well as institutional barriers hampering access to quality education. Basing on empirical research from 2000-2013, they reveal regional trends in the reproduction of educational inequality and institutional barriers in the area of general upper secondary education. Also strategies are proposed for state educational policy to eliminate educational inequality through social interactions.
The past as more than prologue: a call for historical research;Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to argue that historical research methods offer an innovative and powerful way to examine, frame, explain, and disrupt the study of contemporary issues in educational leadership. More specifically, the authors examine how historical methodology might recast some of the questions educational leadership researchers presently engage and how the act of doing history might simultaneously lead to new research agendas and social change. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper provides a discussion of the explanatory and disruptive power of historical research methods and how intentional ignorance of uncomfortable historical realities, such as racist institutional structures and practices, undermines present-day efforts to advance equity in schools. Using the mainstream achievement gap narrative as an example, the authors consider the ways in which historical scholarship can effectively disrupt current conceptions of educational inequality and opportunity in the USA. Findings - The paper suggests researchers close the history gap by engaging historical research methods in ways that better ground, contextualize, and disrupt the often ahistorical and uncritical ways the field frames present-day challenges like the achievement gap. Originality/value - This paper explores the explanatory and disruptive power of historical research as a mode of inquiry in education leadership.
Hip hop and nueva cancion as decolonial pedagogies of epistemic justice;"In this essay we describe our work as Chicana and Chicano Studies scholars teaching Latino Cultural Studies to majority students-of-color classrooms. In our courses we examine music as decolonial pedagogical praxis through the use of nueva cancion and hip-hop, both musical forms which have political roots and exemplify counterhegemonic movements against cultural imperialism in the U.S. and in Latin America. We begin with the premise that education is a political act and, as such, we draw from creative forms and styles that problematize what decolonial scholars call the colonial matrix of power in shaping the Latino subaltern experience (Mignolo, 1991, 2001; Quijano, 2000). Using music as a political and aesthetic expression against empire (Anzaldua, 2012; Sandoval, 2000; Perez, 1999), we argue that hip-hop and nueva cancion offer students possibilities to critique and delink from coloniality in their everyday lives. Committed to decoloniality as a political, epistemological, and spiritual project, we are intent on creating spaces that value transcultural understanding and solidarity between and across subaltern peoples of the Global North and the Global South, with particular attention to Chicanas and Chicanos and Latinas and Latinos in the U.S. and other peoples in the hemisphere. Musical forms like hip-hop and nueva cancion also provide ways to critically explore and engage in decolonial horizons that break silences, disrupt dominant narratives, and create a transformative consciousness among our students, particularly around issues of economic globalization, immigrant rights, cultural resistance, ethnic relations, poverty, and educational inequality in the Americas."
Does Schooling Increase or Reduce Social Inequality?;Does experience in school increase or reduce social inequality in skills? Sociologists have long debated this question. Drawing from the counterfactual account of causality, we propose that the impact of going to school on a given skill depends on the quality of the instructional regime a child will experience at school compared with the quality of the instructional regime the child would receive if not at school. Children vary in their benefit from new instruction, and current skill increases this benefit. We hypothesize that the expansion of free, universal schooling promotes social equality in part by equalizing access to school, but also because disadvantaged children benefit more from access. However, we predict that this equalizing effect will be more pronounced for younger children than for older children. To test these hypotheses, we review empirical evidence regarding the impact of (a) increasing access to universal kindergarten and preschool, (b) interrupting schooling with the summer recess, (c) extending the school day, and (d) extending years of compulsory schooling. We consider implications for the potential of school reform to reduce educational inequality.
I was made to feel very discriminated against as an anglo-saxon Grappling with pedagogies of change;Purpose - Critical discussion of the social conditions that shape educational thinking and practice is now embedded in accredited teacher education programmes. Beneath beliefs that critique of educational inequality is desirable, however, lie more problematic questions around critical pedagogies, ethics and power. Emotional investments can work to protect habituated ways of thinking, despite attempts to move students beyond their comfort zone. This strategic process can shift attitudes and promote intellectual and emotional growth, but can also produce defensive reactions. This paper, a self-study in relation to an incident in a tertiary education programme, examines how student feedback on content and pedagogy positions teachers and learners. The purpose of this paper is to frame and reframe ways in which learner feedback to critical approaches might be read. The argument examines, through dialogue, the potential of disruptive teaching approaches for recontextualising both learner and teacher response. Such exploration articulates particular tensions and challenges inherent in critical teacher education pedagogies. Design/methodology/approach - This is a reflective practitioner piece - involving journaling and the use of dialogue - to explore a critical incident. Findings - This is an exploratory piece - the authors explore the workings of tension in critical/poststructural pedagogical work. Originality/value - The deployment of dialogue as a method and as a way of presenting key issues is somewhat novel. The paper works through quite complex terrain in an accessible and reasonably clear fashion.
POVERTY AND CLASS BIAS IN SCHOOLS An Anti-Classist Agenda for Educators;In this chapter, I articulate a multilayered, anti-classist agenda for teachers, teacher educators, and K-12 educational policymakers. While locating the persistence of educational inequality in power differentials, I reject cultural-deficit rationales used to justify why low-income and working-class children so often fare badly in schools. Instead, I advocate for an asset-based approach founded on high expectations for working-class students, one that challenges damaging myths and stereotypes and other pervasive forms of the class bias that permeates schooling. Informed by scholarship on educational risk within the intersecting contexts of classism, racism, and other forms of institutional injustice, and mindful of lessons learned over two decades of community-driven, equity-focused educational activism in Toronto, Canada, I recommend that educators adopt a series of anti-classist principles in their work by pursuing strategies ranging from changing how we recruit, educate, and mentor teachers, to critiquing and correcting biased learning materials, to developing robust school board human rights policies. If these recommendations were to be implemented, working-class students would be far more likely to realize their right to socioeconomically just, meaningful, and high-quality schooling.
Socialization 'upside down'. When the child as actor enters the stage in socialization perspective;What happens, if two competing theoretical paradigms on childhood are brought together? More precisely: what happens if childhood sociological concepts are transferred into a model of socialization that the new sociology of childhood wanted to challenge once? Initially, it is not problematic to include the two concepts generational order and the child as actor into this draft paradigm which attempts to conceive the preparation of children and adolescents for their future participation in society. A socialization model that is revised in such a way, though, implies a shifted view on growing up and on a most central topic of socialization research: the dependency of educational opportunities on social background. Some results of educational research, however, fit into this new image. The here developed theoretical approach is used for the interpretation of a structural equation model, referring to data from the authors' own research - a survey with third graders.
Insight Schoolboys' Worldview - Educational Inequalities and Cultural Studies;The figure of the secondary schoolboys reflects debates about educational inequality and educational poverty. In the process it is revealed that a lack of attention is paid to issues concerning practices and perspectives, orientations and self-images that culturally influence the strategies for action of those socially disadvantaged adolescents. Paul Willis' ethnography Learning to Labour is one of the few studies that takes as it area of investigation the secondary schoolboys' worldview. It not only offers explanations on the issue of the reproduction of educational inequalities past and present but furthermore informs like no other study to date about the educational and scholastic sociological potential of Cultural Studies.
Biographical orientations of working class pupils in their decision to study at university;"This article builds on studies that see educational inequality as a result of socialization. The focus is on processes of educational intergenerational mobility. With the help of biographical interviews and the documentary method, the article reconstructs practical orientation patterns in the decision to study at university. It shows how class-specific barriers can be overcome on the basis of biographical experience. Four types of educational orientation were found which led to the decision to study at university in spite of a low educational background in the family of origin; climbing up the social ladder (1); undisputed educational aspirations (2); opportunity orientation (3); focus on one's personal interest in a topic (4)."
Educational Inequality in Female Cancer Mortality in Korea;We evaluated the influence of socioeconomic factors on female cancer mortality using death data from the Cause of Death Statistics and the Korean Population and Housing Census databases collected in 2001, 2006, and 2011. We estimated Relative Index of Inequality (RII) of female cancer mortality using Poisson regression analysis. RII greater than 1 indicates increased mortality risk for women at the lowest educational level compared with women at the highest educational level. The RII for cervical cancer mortality was persistently greater than 1 for the entire study period, with a gradual increase over time. Subgroup analysis stratified by age (25-44 and 45-64 yr) revealed that younger women had increased RIIs of mortality due to cervical cancer and ovarian cancer during the entire study period. Older women had higher RII only for cervical cancer mortality, but the value was much lower than that for younger women. The RII for breast cancer mortality was greater than 1 for younger women since 2006. In conclusion, socioeconomic inequality in female cancer mortality has persisted for the last decade in Korea, which was most evident for cervical cancer, and for younger women.
The Nexus of Income Gap, Economic Growth and Educational Inequality in China;This paper incorporates distribution-lag model into a system of equations to study the nexus of income inequality, economic growth and education in China. The major findings are: (1) Income inequality has negative effect on economic growth, and economic growth will in turn be helpful to narrow the income gap. Therefore, controlling the income gap is conducive to economic growth and in turn conducive to narrowing the income gap, in this way the goal that equality and growth develop coordinately may be achieved.(2) the income distribution inequality leads to educational inequality, but the lessening of educational inequality has not promoted the narrowing of the gap in income distribution, a virtuous circle between educational equality and income distribution equality, has not formed spontaneously. To make education, economic growth, income distribution into an endogenous nice track, a series of reforms, policies and measures are needed, to solve such kind of problems as unreasonable labor market structure, urban and rural variations in returns to schooling and unreasonable education investment structure.
Welfare state retrenchment and increasing mental health inequality by educational credentials in Finland: a multicohort study;Objectives: Epidemiological studies have shown an association between educational credentials and mental disorders, but have not offered any explanation for the varying strength of this association in different historical contexts. In this study, we investigate the education-specific trends in hospitalisation due to psychiatric disorders in Finnish working-age men and women between 1976 and 2010, and offer a welfare state explanation for the secular trends found. Setting: Population-based setting with a 25% random sample of the population aged 30-65 years in 7 independent consecutive cohorts (1976-1980, 1981-1985, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, 2006-2010). Participants: Participants were randomly selected from the Statistics Finland population database (n=2 865 746). These data were linked to diagnosis-specific records on hospitalisations, drawn from the National Hospital Discharge Registry using personal identification numbers. Employment rates by educational credentials were drawn from the Statistics Finland employment database. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Hospitalisation and employment. Results: We found an increasing trend in psychiatric hospitalisation rates among the population with only an elementary school education, and a decreasing trend in those with higher educational credentials. The employment rate of the population with only an elementary school education decreased more than that of those with higher educational credentials. Conclusions: We propose that restricted employment opportunities are the main mechanism behind the increased educational inequality in hospitalisation for psychiatric disorders, while several secondary mechanisms (lack of outpatient healthcare services, welfare cuts, decreased alcohol duty) further accelerated the diverging long-term trends. All of these inequality-increasing mechanisms were activated by welfare state retrenchment, which included the liberalisation of financial markets and labour markets, severe austerity measures and narrowing down of public sector employment commitment.
Neoliberalization of education in Brazil: the impact of cursinhos and the private sector on pedagogical practices and access to university;The normalization of a profitable industry of preparatory courses (cursinhos) for the Brazilian university entrance exams vestibular and ENEM contributes to one more access barrier to higher education, in addition to factors such as race and class. The case study of the cursinho industry in the city of Goiania, holder of the highest Gini coefficient of Latin America, demonstrates how cursinho institutions are perceived as a determinant factor to access public universities and have contributed to social and educational inequality. The cursinho industry is shown to originate in the advancement of the human capital paradigm as well as the continuous reliance on the private sector to access services that are otherwise neglected or made precarious by the state. This issue is examined through a critique of neoliberalism and a Marxist critical pedagogical perspective to examine the relationship between the private sector of education and pedagogical practices in Brazil.
Inequality in educational attainment and expectation: evidence from the China Family Panel Studies;This article studies educational inequalities in China by measuring both educational attainment and educational expectations using the 2010 nationally representative data from the China Family Panel Study. We find that educational inequalities have increased over the past several decades, and these inequalities are mainly reflected in the widening gaps in higher education between rural and urban residents. This is true for both educational attainment and expectations. Because parental education level is another significant factor affecting both educational attainment and expectations, imminent measures are needed to stop the vicious cycle of translating existing educational inequalities into larger inequalities in later generations.
Contribution of Human Capital towards Economic Growth in China;
What are the causes of educational inequality and of its evolution over time in Europe? Evidence from PISA;This paper provides evidence on the sources of differences in inequality in educational scores and their evolution over time in four European countries. Using Programme for International Student Assessment data from the 2000 and the 2006 waves, the paper shows that inequality decreased in Germany and Spain (two 'decentralised' schooling systems), whilst it increased in France and Italy (two 'centralised' systems). The decomposition exercise shows that educational inequality not only does reflect the background related inequality, but also schools' characteristics especially. These characteristics are responsible for the observed evolution over time of inequality.
Educational choice and risk preferences: How important is relative vs. individual risk preference?;The primary goal of this article is to examine the influence of relative vs. individual risk preference in educational choice. To do so, we discuss relative risk preference in prospect theory and in sociological models of educational choice and debate the notable but widely neglected importance of individual risk preferences for educational plans and decisions. We analyze these different forms of risk preference and demonstrate how they influence the intentions for further education of students attending Gymnasium, the academically oriented secondary school track in Germany. Using data collected from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) youth questionnaire in the years 2003 to 2012, we find not only that students from a higher socio-economic background are less sensitive to their school performance but also that their individual risk preferences are completely irrelevant to their educational plans. The opposite applies to students from a lower socio-economic background: the more risk-averse they are, the less likely they are to opt for a university degree. Most importantly, we find support for the notion of relative risk-seeking in upper social classes and relative risk aversion in lower classes.
What Happened to Educational Equality? Tracing the Demise of Presidential Rhetoric on Racial Inequality in Higher Education;This article asks why discussion of racial inequality in higher education is absent from presidential speeches, which helps us understand why it is absent from the public agenda. I find a decrease in presidential speech about race and education after the 1980 and 1984 elections. By analyzing Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan's rhetoric during those elections, we can see that Carter struggled to promote affirmative action and, instead, supported historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Reagan adopted Carter's arguments about HBCUs and used them to support his strategy to appeal to whites' and white ethnics' racial resentments. This dynamic led to a political stalemate: Democrats could not address educational inequality, distance themselves from Republicans, and appeal to majority whites. Therefore, presidents had no incentive to address inequality in higher education. While educational inequality still exists, it remains absent from presidential speeches.
CORRELATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION VALUES AND ITS APPROACHABILITY IN MODERN RUSSIA;The value of the higher education, its availability and prospects of development is one of serious problems of modern society. A number of research works show that education stops being the channel of social mobility. In particular, the higher education in modern society gradually becomes the instrument of reproduction of a social inequality. Besides, this process is followed by transformation of system of values of people deprived of access to a quality higher education. This results in the growth of ressentiment of moods and social tension.
Hidden Gains: Effects of Early US Compulsory Schooling Laws on Attendance and Attainment by Social Background;Research on early compulsory schooling laws finds minimal effects on attendance but fails to investigate heterogeneous effects. Similarly, research proposes limited contexts in which expansion policies can increase equality but has difficulty separating policy and cohort effects. Capitalizing on within-country variation in timing of early compulsory laws, passed 1852 to 1918, I ask whether they improved equality of school attendance or educational attainment by class, nativity, and race. Based on census data, compulsory laws increased equality of attendance and attainment, particularly among young men in the North, where the laws reduced class and race gaps by over 20%. Early compulsory schooling laws provided hidden gains, missed in previous analyses, suggesting policies that raise minimum schooling can increase educational equality in certain contexts.
Social origin, conscientiousness, and school grades: Does early socialization of the characteristics orderliness and focus contribute to the reproduction of social inequality?;"Among a child's skills and competencies, conscientiousness has been shown to be one of the most important predictors of school performance and later academic achievement. We refer this insight to the social reproduction of social inequality: Is socialization of personality characteristics in the parental home a significant mechanism that contributes to a child's life chances? Using school grades as the outcome measure, we combine different pathways toward their achievement: the impact of a child's conscientiousness on school grades, parental conscientiousness and parental stratification as sources for the differential conscientiousness of children, and the mediation of this interrelationship through different parenting styles. To date, almost no research has been conducted which integrates the unequal formation of personality and its consequences regarding life chances and compares it with the respective influences of social origin. Moreover, we add to existing research in social reproduction the distinction between different facets of conscientiousness. We show that it allows for more precise predictions of academic achievement than looking at the highly aggregated Big Five personality traits; moreover, these facets can be much better linked to the established body of sociological stratification theory. We combine data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and the related Familien in Deutschland (FiD) study involving children 9-10 years of age and their parents and households. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we found theoretical and empirical evidence that only the focus facet and not the orderliness facet is highly positively correlated with school grades even more than indicators of social background. Our main hypothesis that conscientiousness, specifically the facet focus, acts as one transmission belt between social background and school grades was confirmed.

The Legitimation of Inequality: Psychosocial Dispositions, Education, and Attitudes toward Income Inequality in China;Why people of lower socioeconomic status often support conservative economic policies has been one of the most intriguing puzzles for sociologists. This study tackles this paradox and presents a social psychological explanation that considers the effect of two kinds of psychosocial dispositions-authoritarianism and social dominance orientation-on attitudes toward economic inequality. Using two nationally representative Chinese social surveys and using structural equation modeling for empirical analysis, this article demonstrates that stark rural-urban income disparity in China resulted in large regional-educational inequality and that lower educational levels in disadvantaged areas led to residents' conservative psychosocial dispositions. This article sheds light on a previously neglected social psychological mechanism of political attitude formation and shows how such a mechanism is embedded in macro-institutional contexts.
Unequal returns to academic credentials as a hidden dimension of race and class inequality in American college enrollments;This study asks whether growing access to academic credentials for students from disadvantaged groups will lead to a decrease in the value of those credentials for these groups in college enrollments. Drawing on credentialing theory and the concept of adaptive social closure, I argue that as certain academic credentials become democratized (i.e., more accessible to disadvantaged students), their value decreases for students from disadvantaged race and class groups at the same time as it increases for students from privileged race and class groups. To test this idea, I use data from two cohorts of American high school graduates to estimate changes in the educational payoff of participation in the Advanced Placement (AP) program for students across racial and social class groups. The results show that at the same time as students from disadvantaged groups gained wider access to the AP program, its effect on their rates of college enrollment declined. During the same time period, the AP effect on the rates of college enrollment for students from privileged groups increased. I conclude that unequal returns to academic credentials for privileged and disadvantaged students represent a hidden dimension of race and class inequality in American college enrollments. Moreover, the results demonstrate the possibility that as access to an academic credential democratizes, as is the case with the AP program, privileged groups are better able to insulate themselves from the negative effects of credential inflation.

Horizontal inequalities in children's educational outcomes in Ethiopia;We go beyond previous studies of vertical inequality in Ethiopia, by investigating ethnic group-based, or horizontal, educational inequality. Currently, there are no known studies of differential schooling patterns across cultural groups in Ethiopia. The research draws on the Young Lives prospective longitudinal study of 929 children in later childhood. We investigate the extent to which ethnic group differences in schooling participation and progression can be explained by individual differences in socio-economic status. The findings show that poor educational participation and progression remain challenges for certain minority ethnic groups. Household wealth helps to explain the effect of ethnicity on educational outcomes. However, it cannot fully account for the ethnic gap. We conclude that conventional research, which emphasizes addressing individual differences in educational outcomes, or vertical inequalities, may downplay the role of cultural group-based inequalities in children's opportunities to learn.

Family Socioeconomic Status, Peers, and the Path to College;Drawing on the primary/secondary effects perspective of educational inequality, this mixed methods study investigated connections between high school students' trajectories through college preparatory course work and their relationships with parents and peers as a channel in the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic inequality. Growth curve and multilevel analyses of national survey and transcript data revealed that having college-educated parents differentiated students' enrollment in advanced course work at the start of high school and that this initial disparity was stably maintained over subsequent years. During this starting period of high school, exposure to school-based peer groups characterized by higher levels of parent education appeared to amplify these course work disparities between students with and without college-educated parents. Ethnographic data from a single high school pointed to possible mechanisms for these patterns, including the tendency for students with college-educated parents to have more information about the relative weight of grades, core courses, and electives in college going and for academically relevant information from school peers with college-educated parents to matter most to students' course work when it matched what was coming from their own parents.
Choosing schools: explorations in post-primary school choice in an urban Irish working class community;This paper examines post-primary school choice processes in the urban Irish working-class community of Portown. Here, there is an awareness of hegemonic neoliberal ideals and how school choice becomes a significantly classed space characterised by market ideologies and structural inequality. This critical ethnography explored the world through participant observation, semi-structured interviews over a 3-year period. The data examined here are drawn specifically from investigations into school choice processes. It deploys identity theories as thinking tools to examine the classed nature of engagement with school choice markets. The findings delineate three distinct groups of choosers in this school community: passive transitioners, active choosers and second-schoolers. The findings of the study reveal the entwined and co-constructed nature of identity and social class as well as examining the role played by school choices and differential access to economic, cultural and social resources in these processes.
Diversity and complementarity of multi-agent models in the social sciences;Multi-agent systems have been used for fifteen years to simulate the dynamics of social phenomena. They help conceptualize interactions between an organized set of agents and to explore the structures that emerge through the formalization of complex situations where heterogeneous agents operate at various levels. This paper presents and discusses a framework of thought which articulates the relevant fields (empirical, conceptual, model) in a general way, and in the case of multi-agent systems. It then develops an analytical framework to capture the various uses of these systems, exploring in particular the methodological opposition between parsimonious models (KISS) and descriptive models (KIDS), which in fact reflect different stages in scientific investigation. Finally, it uses this framework and grid to analyse several examples from sociology, economics and geography (residential segregation, educational inequality, the emergence of norms, market operation, urban hierarchy) and concludes with methodological proposals based on an abductive approach to the use of multi-agent systems in social science.
Learning in a Burning House: Educational Inequality, Ideology, and (Dis)integration;
On the Relationship between Innovation and Wage Inequality: New Evidence from Canadian Cities;In this article, we examine the link between innovation and earnings inequality across Canadian cities over the 1996-2006 period. We do so using a novel data set that combines information from the Canadian long-form census and the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The analysis reveals that there is a positive relationship between innovation and inequality: cities with higher levels of innovation have more unequal distributions of earnings. Other factors influencing differences in inequality include city size, manufacturing and government employment, the percentage of visible minority in an urban population, and educational inequality. These results are robust to the use of different measures of inequality, innovation, alternative specifications, and instrumental variables estimations. Questions are thus raised about how the benefits of innovation are distributed in society and the long-term sustainability of such trends.
Educational Aspirations and Attitudes over the Business Cycle;UK policy debate has recently focused on the role of young people's aspirations and attitudes in raising educational attainment. We use the youth component of the British Household Panel Survey to examine how educational attitudes and aspirations among 11- to 15-year-olds vary with the local unemployment rate. We find that children who have highly educated parents with positive educational attitudes react more positively to low labour demand than those from less educated families with negative educational attitudes. This reduces social mobility and increases persistence in educational inequality for a cohort growing up in a recession.
Aspirations, education and inequality in England: insights from the Effective Provision of Pre-school, Primary and Secondary Education Project;Educational and occupational aspirations have become an important reference point in policy debates about educational inequality. Low aspirations are presented as a major barrier to closing educational attainment gaps and increasing levels of social mobility. Our paper contributes to this on-going debate by presenting data on the educational aspirations of students from the Effective Provision of Pre-School, Primary and Secondary Education Project in England. We analyse factors that help predict students holding high aspirations. Our findings reveal generally high aspirations across all students but also differences by income group and other background factors. We evaluate the significance of these findings for the existing literature and public policy discussions about the importance of raising educational aspirations. In particular, we question the way in which low aspirations are framed by policy-makers as a major problem in debates around educational inequality.
Universal patterns or the tale of two systems? Mathematics achievement and educational expectations in post-socialist Europe;Although communist ideology claimed to destroy former class stratification based on labour market capitalist relationships, de facto during socialism one social class hierarchy was substituted for another that was equally unequal. The economic transition during the 1990s increased stratification by wealth, which affected educational inequality. This study examines the relationships among parental education, gender, educational expectations and mathematics achievement of youths in five post-socialist Eastern European countries, comparing them with three Western countries. We employed the 8th-grade data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 1995 and 2007. The findings point to the universal associations between parental education and student outcomes, whereas gender comparisons present interesting East-West differences. The theoretical and policy implications of these findings are discussed.
No association found between cardiovascular mortality, and job demands and decision latitude: Experience from the Vasterbotten Intervention Programme in Sweden;The current prospective study with the longest follow-up period in Northern Sweden aims to investigate the association between job demands and decision latitude and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Further, we aim to assess the effect of conventional risk factors (i.e., body mass index, alcohol consumption, physical activity, marital status, education and smoking) on the association between job demands and decision latitude and CVD mortality. The data originated from the Linnaeus database, available at the Center for Population Studies, Umea University, Sweden. A cohort of men and women aged 40, 50 and 60 years were recruited from the Vasterbotten Intervention Programme. Deaths due to stroke and myocardial infarction at the end of the follow up are considered the outcome. Baseline job characteristics were defined by the Swedish version of the Karasek demand/control model. Statistical methods include proportional Cox hazard modeling and Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI) to assess interactions. The findings from this study did not support the association between job demands and decision latitude and CVD mortality. Instead, conventional risk factors were found stronger predictors, most evidently education differentials were associated with CVD mortality. We know from previous research that the greater the attenuation of the gradient after adjustment for a given risk factor, the greater the potential to reduce educational inequality via interventions that target this factor. Based on the present findings of the experience in Vasterbotten, further research is needed to identify other risk factors besides job strain and its components that would reduce the socioeconomic gradient in CVD mortality.

Educational and income inequality in Europe, ca. 1870-2000;In this paper, we revisit the relationship between educational and income inequalities in a historical perspective, using a newly developed annual dataset of average years of education in Europe. Theoretically one would expect a reduction in educational inequality should, given the positive correlation between education level and income, initially increase and then, at a later stage, reduce income inequality. Testing for such a Kuznets-type relationship between educational and income inequalities yields an unexpected result: we find the expected inverse U-curve before the 1950s, but the relationship changes into a normal U-curve afterward. We explain this observation by a change in the trend of skill premium during the second half of the twentieth century due to an increased relative demand for skills, which contradicts the usual assumption of decreasing returns to education. Due to lack of appropriate wage data, we cannot directly capture this effect. Yet, once we use an instrumental variable estimation method to filter out the effect of the omitted skill premium, the expected inverse U-curve also appears for the latter decades of the twentieth century.
A new dataset on educational inequality;This paper describes a new dataset, in which measures of educational level and inequality were collected for 48 countries over 13 5-year birth cohorts. Drawing on four representative international surveys (ess, eu-silc, ials and issp), we collected measures of individual educational attainment and aggregated them to generate synthetic indices of educational level and dispersion by countries and birth cohorts. The paper provides a detailed description of the procedures and methodologies adopted to build the new dataset, analyses the validity and consistency of the measures across surveys and discusses the relevance of these data for future research.
The Granger-causality between income and educational inequality: a spatial cross-regressive VAR framework;This paper tests the causal processes between income and educational inequality within regions of the European Union, using a spatial cross-regressive VAR framework. The results show that there is a heterogeneous causality from income inequality to educational inequality and vice versa, and interregional income and educational externalities are relevant to this causality. This finding raises potentially interesting economic policy implications.
Social Background and PhDs: How Does the Educational Background of Parents Affect the Likelihood of Entering Doctoral Studies?;Based on a representative longitudinal survey among graduates, this article explores the relationship between parents' educational background and the likelihood of entering into doctoral studies. Subsequently, possible processes and mechanisms that may account for the effects of social background are explored. Findings indicate that the likelihood of beginning doctoral studies significantly varies with the parents' educational background. For the most part, this finding can be explained by differences in the choice of field of study, by performance differences, and by differences in the extent of academic integration during undergraduate studies.
Two Aspects of the Rural-Urban Divide and Educational Stratification in China: A Trajectory Analysis;Contextualized in China's social change of the past half-century, this article conceptualizes the two aspects of China's rural-urban divide in educational inequality the household registration system (hukou) assigns people to a hierarchy, and the rural-urban schooling system institutionalizes unequal resource distribution and diverse school mission. To test a Chinese version of the maximally maintained inequality (MMI) hypothesis, we capitalize on the individual educational history data from the 2008 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) and use growth mixture modeling to estimate the differential effects of the two aspects of rural-urban divide on educational inequality in China. Findings indicate that (1) the hukou system places rural-hukou people at the very bottom of educational stratification, (2) the penalty of attending rural pretertiary school increases with educational stages, and (3) there is a cumulative disadvantage of rural hukou and rural school. Overall, our findings attest to the Chinese-version of MMI and inequality reproduction.
Expansion of schooling and educational inequality in Europe: the educational Kuznets curve revisited;This article analyses the relationship between schooling expansion and educational inequality in a panel of developed countries over different birth cohorts. We extend previous literature by exploiting the longitudinal dimension of our data and by focussing on different measures of inequality. Using either a Gini or a Theil measure of inequality, we find evidence that at higher average levels of education further increases are associated with rising inequality. The inverted-U Kuznets curve appears to depend on using the standard deviation as the measure of inequality. We also discuss how educational policies may influence educational inequality and find that the length of compulsory education affects inequality only through its effect on average education, whilst school tracking shapes inequality independently of the level of education.
Gender Inequalities in the Education of the Second Generation in Western Countries;Drawing on comparative analyses from nine Western countries, we ask whether local-born children from a wide range of immigrant groups show patterns of female advantage in education that are similar to those prevalent in their host Western societies. We consider five outcomes throughout the educational career: test scores or grades at age 15, continuation after compulsory schooling, choice of academic track in upper-secondary education, completion of upper secondary, and completion of tertiary education. Despite great variation in gender gaps in education in immigrants' origin countries (with advantages for males in many cases), we find that the female advantage in education observed among the majority population is usually present among second-generation immigrants. We interpret these findings in light of ideas about gender role socialization and immigrant selectivity.
An analysis of education inequality in China;"This article analyzes both the current situation regarding education inequality in China, and its formation mechanisms. Policies promoting education have lead to remarkable progress in educational attainment, and also effectively decreased educational inequality. However, substantial inequalities in educational attainment remain, even though sustainable progress has been realized. Decomposition results using the Gini coefficient and Shapley value approach based on regression analysis indicate that the greatest contributing factors to educational inequality involve the urban-rural and social stratification divisions. Moreover, the household register system which divides city and country, as well as increasing income inequality is deepening institutional barriers and stratum differentiation. Though gender and regional gaps have been reduced significantly, the population residing in economically disadvantaged areas, especially females, still warrants social concern. In addition, age related decomposition results indicate that increasing educational attainment for the young plays a key role in reducing education inequality. At last, we argue that more educational investment should be allocated to disadvantaged groups and lower income groups; especially eliminating some institutional barriers such as the hukou system, unequal distribution of good quality educational resources, and so on.

Independent Freshman Admission and Educational Inequality in the Access to Elite Higher Education Evidence from Peking University;Over the past decade, China has undertaken a significant institutional reform of its admission system in elite higher education (namely, Independent Freshman Admission, IFA), adopting a multistage selection strategy characterized by recommendation and interviews as an alternative channel of admission to the national college entrance examination (gaokao). Using IFA administrative data from Peking University, we reveal the mechanism of educational inequality through criterion transformations from standard test scores to comprehensive evaluations on competence. Significant associations were found between students' socioeconomic status origins, prior academic credentials, and whether they passed the selection process. This study contributes a unique and representative case of Chinese elite universities explaining why privileged groups maintained their advantages in this reform as well as in a rapidly expanded system of higher education. It also provides a better understanding of social stratification and elite reproduction in contemporary China.
Discursive practices in family dinner talk and classroom discourse: A contextual comparison;The present study investigates the interplay of communication, socialization practices and educational opportunities by reconstructing the discursive practices of the same children in different contexts: family dinner talk and classroom interaction. From a rich corpus of naturally occurring interactions of eleven children before and after school enrollment, two cases are selected for presentation. The microanalytic reconstruction demonstrates how discursive practices are socio-culturally situated and differ in terms of communicative genres, topics and communicative demands, both between families and contexts. When the teacher does not make communicative investments to bridge divergences in teacher-student interactions, children lack the external resources necessary for utilizing discourse as a means of learning, both from a microgenetic and ontogenetic perspective.

Are children with a Turkish migration background disadvantaged at school entry? - The importance of general and host country specific skills for the probability of delayed school entry;This article analyses the effect of a Turkish migration background on the risk of delayed school entry. Besides the social background, we control general and host country specific individual skill levels of the child. We assume that children's individual skills can affect the school entry decision both directly and indirectly. We use data of the longitudinal project Preschool education and educational careers among migrant children (German acronym ESKOM VG). About 500 German parents and 500 Turkish-origin parents were interviewed in this study. Standardized developmental tests were conducted with the children in various domains. We find that the Turkish migration background does not have an independent effect on the probability of delayed school entry when the social background and individual skills are controlled. We furthermore disentangle the indirect effect of the Turkish migration background using the khb method. The results indicate that mathematic skills and cultural knowledge have the largest contribution on this indirect effect.
Combating educational disadvantage through early years and primary school investment;In 1965, following a review of second-level education in Ireland, the report Investment in Education was published. While a concern with educational inequality and disadvantage pre-dates this report, it clearly identified the significant socio-economic disparities in educational participation at the time and emphasised an urgent need for remedial action. However, while the discussions emanating from this seminal report are concerned with issues around educational disadvantage, less attention has been given to the processes at play in underlying such inequality. Moreover, it can be argued that overarching debates on educational investment over the last 50 years (as reflected in the papers in this special issue) have focused predominantly on post-primary and higher education, to the detriment of early education. Given the recent proliferation of research stemming from the USA around the significant human capital and societal gains of early years investment - which is especially pronounced for disadvantaged children - this paper argues that it is vitally important that early education is viewed as an important window of opportunity for increased public spending and treated on par with later educational investments.
Constructing social and communicative worlds - The role of peer-interactions in preadolescents' discursive development;This article offers a comparative analysis of explanatory discourse in informal, spontaneous peer-interactions of twelve German cliques of preadolescents, and discusses their possible role in children's discursive development. Findings demonstrate a sharp contrast in the occurrence of explanations among peers depending on their social backgrounds. Preadolescents from privileged milieus skillfully deal with contextual framings and global constraints linked to explanations, and may therefore be assumed to use, adopt, and expand their explanatory discourse skills - and especially their contextualization skills - through social interactions with peers. Their counterparts from rather deprived homes, on the other hand, follow communicative practices (e.g. teasing) which prevent the occurrence of explanatory talk, thereby depriving themselves of valuable learning opportunities.

Communication experiences: A constitutive principle in pupils' socialization of agency;This paper provides a discussion of the Special Issue's content from a socialization perspective. The argument is based on a social constructivist understanding of socialization, which highlights the meaning of communication skills with regard to human agency. In order to illustrate the dynamic interrelations between conversational practices, individual skills and habits in diverse social settings, we present a model of agency as a gearwheel. Following the traditions of social-ecological research, we argue that a multilevel and methodologically complex investigation of communication practices helps to understand not only the development of individual competencies, but also their context-sensitive impact on educational inequality.

School expansion and uneven modernization. Comparing educational inequality in Northern and Southern Italy;The paper asks whether the patterns of educational expansion and inequality were the same in the two parts of Italy: the North, more industrialized and developed, and the more backwards South. This is a theoretically relevant issue as, despite this major socioeconomic heterogeneity, Italy has a centralized school system, whose main institutional features are the same all over the country. By means of an educational transition analysis of the five waves of the Italian Longitudinal Household Survey we analyze school expansion and long-term trends of educational inequality, both in general and at each specific school transition. The main results indicate that there has been increasing divergence between the two areas in educational expansion and in the effect of social background on years of education attained, favouring the North. The main difference between the two areas is found at two transitions, the one from elementary to lower secondary and the one from lower to upper secondary. While the first difference diminishes over time, the second grows over time and is currently crucial. Its reasons are found in the different propensity of the offspring of the working class to enrol in vocational schools, which is stronger in the North.

Are Contemporary Patterns of Black Male Joblessness Unique? Cohort Replacement, Intracohort Change, and the Diverging Structures of Black and White Men's Employment;"Employment rates for black men have declined sharply over the last half century. We use data from the 1962-2009 March Current Population Surveys and linear decomposition techniques to examine the mechanisms generating change in employment rates for white and black men with different levels of education. We find that not only did the overall magnitude of change in employment differ by race and education; but so too did the mechanisms generating change. Black men with less than a college degree experienced sharper declines in employment than did white men and more educated black men. Cohort replacement processes played a more prominent role in employment declines for less educated black men than for other men, who were affected more strongly by intracohort change mechanisms. Stronger cohort replacement effects for less educated black men concentrated joblessness to an unparalleled extent among younger black men with the least formal schooling. Declining employment since the 1960s for this group of men was not primarily the result of economic downturns or layoffs later in life, but rather resulted from the inability of more recent cohorts to secure stable employment. Comparisons of the employment experiences of less educated black men in the metropolises experiencing the most deindustrialization to those of men in other areas reveal that these men experienced greater employment declines not only because more recent cohorts had greater difficulty securing stable employment in early adulthood but also because, within cohorts, they experienced additional job losses associated with aging and changes in the economy."
To what degree is the association between educational inequality and laryngeal cancer explained by smoking, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposure?;Objectives The aim of this study was to measure the extent to which the association between socioeconomic status and laryngeal cancer among males is mediated by smoking, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposure. Methods We used Karlson et al's decomposition method for logit models, which returns the percentage of change in odds ratios (OR) due to confounding. This population-based, case control study on laryngeal cancer was conducted in Germany in 1998-2000 and included 208 male cases and 702 controls. Information on occupational history, smoking, alcohol consumption, and education was collected through face-to-face interviews. Jobs coded according to ISCO-68 were linked to a recently developed job-classification index covering physical and psychosocial dimensions. A sub-index focused on jobs involving potentially carcinogenic agents (CM) for the upper-aero digestive tract. Results When adjusted for smoking and alcohol consumption, higher OR were found for lower education. This OR decreased after further adjustment using the overall job index [2.9,95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.4-6.2], similar to the OR using the sub-index CM (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.8). Applying the Karlson et al method, 25.4% (95% CI 22.6-28.2%) of the reduction in these OR was due to occupational exposure (CAI), while smoking and alcohol consumption contributed to around 26.1% (95% CI 23.2-28.9%) and 2.7% (95% CI 1.7-3.8%), respectively. Conclusions Occupational aspects, in particular the exposure to carcinogenic agents, explain a large portion of the association between low educational level and laryngeal cancer risk among males. Occupational effects are now easier to quantify using this recently developed and easily applicable index.
Curriculum Knowledge, Justice, Relations: The Schools White Paper (2010) in England;In this article I begin by discussing the persistent problem of relations between educational inequality and the attainment gap in schools. Because benefits accruing from an education are substantial, the 'gap' leads to large disparities in the quality of life many young people can expect to experience in the future. Curriculum knowledge has been a focus for debate in England in relation to educational equality for over 40 years. Given the contestation surrounding views about curriculum knowledge and equality I consider the thinking of two philosophers, Jacques Derrida and Emmanuel Levinas, and their work on justice, to trouble the curriculum framework and discourse of knowledge promoted through the policy text of The Importance of Teaching: The Schools White Paper (2010) and later associated policy reforms to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) curriculum in England. The Schools White Paper aims to make the curriculum more challenging to students by introducing tight controls in terms of the assessment framework and curriculum knowledge. I argue that, when considered through Derrida's perspective on language and meaning and Levinas' view on the ethical responsibility for the other, the reforms present obstacles to the search for a just curriculum. I look to the work of Sharon Todd and Paul Standish for a re-imagination of curriculum as or through relations in the light of Derrida's and Levinas' philosophies.
Gender differences in school success: what are the roles of students' intelligence, personality and motivation?;Background: Education is a key variable for reaching individually and socially desired outcomes. Specifically, school grades are important admission criteria for higher education and job positions. Nowadays, in countries committed to equal opportunities, girls obtain better school grades than boys, but the reasons why girls outperform boys are not well understood. In the following, individual student characteristics (i.e. intelligence, personality, motivation) were investigated as promising candidates that may account for gender differences in school performance. Purpose: This is a review of research findings on gender differences in performance-related individual students' characteristics. These findings may help to explain differences in boys' and girls' school achievement. It was hypothesised that girls are better adapted to today's school environment because of their intelligence (general, specific), personality (Big Five) and motivation (ability self-concept, interest or intrinsic values, goal orientations). To investigate this hypothesis, we reviewed literature with respect to five questions: (1) How strongly are intelligence, personality and motivation associated with school achievement? (2) Are there mean level differences between boys and girls in these characteristics? (3) Do these characteristics show gender differences in predicting school achievement? (4) Can gender differences in these characteristics explain the association between gender and school achievement? (5) Are gender differences in these characteristics causally related to differences in boys' and girls' school achievement? Sources of evidence: We mainly based our review on meta-analyses and literature reviews. If no meta-analyses or reviews were available, we reported results of representative single studies, including results from our own studies. To illustrate the magnitude of gender differences, we also reported statistical parameters (correlation coefficients, effect sizes and regression coefficients). Main argument: Concerning the five research questions, we found that, first, among the characteristics investigated here, general intelligence, ability self-concepts and self-discipline were the most important predictors of school performance. Second, gender differences in students' individual characteristics varied from non-existent (e.g. general intelligence) to strong (e.g. self-discipline). Third, there was no indication that these characteristics were differently important for boys' and girls' school performance. Fourth, gender differences in intelligence, personality and motivation partially mediated the association between gender and school achievement but cannot fully explain it. Fifth, whether differences in intelligence, personality and motivation cause performance differences between boys and girls remains unknown because there were no studies that have investigated this question with designs that could test for causal inferences. Conclusion: Gender differences in students' individual characteristics contribute to a significant extent to gender differences in school performance. Taken together, the effects of gender differences in students' individual characteristics can partially but not fully account for gender differences in school performance. Girls are somewhat better adapted to today's school environments, especially because of their better verbal intelligence, higher Agreeableness, stronger self-discipline, as well as certain aspects of their motivation. In light of these specific differences, it is argued that changing certain aspects of school environments might help boys to better succeed in school and, thus, reduce educational inequality.
Identities, cultural capital, educational choices and post-communist transition: an ethnographic study of Georgian youth;This paper summarizes a qualitative study of the educational decision-making of adolescents with diverse backgrounds in the post-Soviet republic of Georgia. The results suggest that a set of institutional factors force young people with certain backgrounds to drop out of school at an early stage, even when alternative education or labour market options are not available for them. The absence of fear of downward mobility among some parents may be helping to increase educational inequality. Parental motivation can be seen as a form of capital that is particularly valued by teachers, who attenuate aspirations of those students whose parents lack it and encourage them to leave the system.
Previous School Results and Social Background: Compensation and Imperfect Information in Educational Transitions;In this article, we analyse whether previous school results have a social background-specific impact on a student's decision to continue in schooling. We refer to the model proposed by Breen and Goldthorpe (1997) and scrutinize the theoretical underpinnings of the interaction between previous school performance and educational choices. We provide two sets of predictions. First, a compensatory effect might occur if inequality is greater among the worst-performing students than among others. In this case, students from socio-economically advantaged backgrounds with poor school results would still move to higher educational levels, whereas students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds with poor school results would drop out. Second, inequality might be higher among average performers. Both good and poor school results send stronger messages and clearer information than scores in the middle of the distribution. If individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds handle imperfect information differently, then the impact of social background could be larger on average grades than on good or poor ones. To test these hypotheses, we used the French Panel d'Eleves du Second Degre and focused on social background differences in the decision to opt for the academic or the vocational track after the completion of compulsory education. Our findings support the hypothesis of a compensatory effect. In the conclusion, we discuss further general implications of our results for research on educational inequality.
Social inequality and smoking in young Swiss men: intergenerational transmission of cultural capital and health orientation;Smoking is related to income and education and contributes to social inequality in morbidity and mortality. Socialisation theories focus on one's family of origin as regards acquisition of norms, attitudes and behaviours. Aim of this study is to assess associations of daily smoking with health orientation and academic track in young Swiss men. Further, to assess associations of health orientation and academic track with family healthy lifestyle, parents' cultural capital, and parents' economic capital. Cross-sectional data were collected during recruitment for compulsory military service in Switzerland during 2010 and 2011. A structural equation model was fitted to a sample of 18- to 25-year-old Swiss men (N = 10,546). Smoking in young adults was negatively associated with academic track and health orientation. Smoking was negatively associated with parents' cultural capital through academic track. Smoking was negatively associated with health orientation which in turn was positively associated with a healthy lifestyle in the family of origin. Results suggest two different mechanisms of intergenerational transmissions: first, the family transmission path of health-related dispositions, and secondly, the structural transmission path of educational inequality.
Social Class and School Performance as Predictors of Educational Paths in Spain;This paper explores the impact of school performance (primary effects) and the structure of costs and benefits that individuals of different social class face (secondary effects) on the transition from compulsory to non-compulsory education in Spain. We find that both predictors of educational paths seem to operate through an interactive effect, which contributes to reproducing educational inequalities. This interaction suggests that school performance is not interpreted in the same way by individuals from different social classes. In concrete, the resources and social capital of upper class families provide compensation effects leading to a greater probability of students from upper classes with poor grades reaching post-compulsory secondary education and higher education in comparison to lower class students with the equivalent grades. Therefore, inequality by social class of origin is greatest among students with the lowest grades.
Compensatory Advantage as a Mechanism of Educational Inequality: A Regression Discontinuity Based on Month of Birth;Compensatory advantage is a mechanism of social stratification that complements cumulative advantage and path dependence. In this article, I first discuss the theoretical foundations of the compensatory advantage and path dependence mechanisms and the methodological challenges that complicate identification of their effects. Next, I present a practical demonstration of the use of the compensatory advantage theoretical framework, with a regression discontinuity design estimating the probability of being continuously promoted throughout primary education in France. Results indicate that students born just before the cutoff date for primary school entry, who are consequently the youngest in the class when starting school, face a larger risk of grade repetition. In line with theoretical predictions of the compensatory advantage model, the risk is much smaller for students born to highly educated parents compared to students whose parents have lower educational attainment.
Measure for Measure: How Proficiency-based Accountability Systems Affect Inequality in Academic Achievement;"How do proficiency-based accountability systems affect inequality in academic achievement? This article reconciles mixed findings in the literature by demonstrating that three factors jointly determine accountability's impact. First, by analyzing student-level data from a large urban school district, we find that when educators face accountability pressure, they focus attention on students closest to proficiency. We refer to this practice as educational triage and show that the difficulty of the proficiency standard affects whether lower or higher performing students gain most on high-stakes tests used to evaluate schools. Less difficult proficiency standards decrease inequality in high-stakes achievement, while more difficult standards increase it. Second, we show that educators emphasize test-specific skills with students near proficiency, a practice we refer to as instructional triage. As a result, the effects of accountability pressure differ across high- and low-stakes tests; we find no effects on inequality in low-stakes reading and math tests of similar skills. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that instructional triage is most pronounced in the lowest performing schools. We conclude by discussing how these findings shape our understanding of accountability's effects on educational inequality."
Unfinished business: re-positioning gender on the education equity agenda;The long-standing relationship between social disadvantage and poor educational outcomes continues to preoccupy educational policy-makers, with teachers at the front line of the ongoing struggle. Across the range of equity concerns, gender may be noted as either qualifying disadvantage or compounding it, but the meaning of gender as a simple binary category is rarely challenged. Using data drawn from a study in three disadvantaged urban fringe Australian high schools we argue that the policy-driven gender-as-difference approach can serve to mask educational inequality rather than to challenge it. By demonstrating the ways in which the girls and their teachers respond to, interpret and understand their schooling experience, we suggest the enriched capacity of a relational theory of gender that, while inclusive of earlier theoretical moments and cognisant of progress made, does offer a more coherent and potentially redemptive basis for educational intervention
Educational inequality and social justice: Challenges for career guidance;The article provides a multiperspective approach to educational careers. It first discusses social justice issues in the distribution of the crucial individual and social good of education. It then summarizes core findings of recent international research on processes and factors generating social disparities in the acquisition of education. Based on both it finally provides suggestions how especially professional guidance can contribute to reducing inequalities and increasing social justice.
The reduction of educational disadvantages through day care for children under 3-between dream and reality;Based on the assumption that children can benefit from early childhood education, the present paper investigates if the admission to day care and the selection of the type of day care (child care centers and home day care) is socially selective. In doing so, the paper analyzes how the socioeconomic and immigrant background of families influences which type of day care is used. For children under the age of three, the social background of families does influence if a child receives day care, but this influences diminishes the older the children get. The type of day care (child care centers and home day care) did not differ according to social background. The paper closes with a discussion of the challenges and potentials for development of educating children under the age of three.
School entry, social and ethnic family background and educational inequality;In Germany, age and readiness for school are still the main criteria for school entry decisions. As a result some children start school earlier or later than scheduled. Since the 1970s it is well known that school entries not according to the cut-off date are coupled with the social and ethnic family background of these children and result in differential school careers. Thus an early or delayed school entry may be seen as the starting point of cumulative educational inequalities. New results from three series of interviews with parents, Kindergarten teachers, and school headmasters being part of the longitudinal study BiKS (Bildungsprozesse, Kompetenzentwicklung und Selektionsentscheidungen im Vor- und Grundschulalter, educational processes, competence development and selection decisions in pre- and primary school age) now reveal how these decisions develop. One of these qualitative studies is dedicated to school entry decisions in families with Turkish migration background. It is concluded that especially two measures can reduce these early inequalities: (1) better information for the parents and (2) early preventive support for all children making delayed school entries no more necessary.
Extra-curricular support challenging disadvantages in education: opportunities and limits of social work with young people;Even though social inequalities in education are often dealt with in out-of-school social work programs, this has been largely neglected by educational research in recent years. The present paper therefore presents the different fields of action in youth social work as means of compensatory education and discusses research findings regarding its use and effectiveness. The difficulty of measuring their effectiveness is not only due to a fragmented research field, but also reflects the fundamental contradiction between structural problems and their pedagogical treatment. The paper ends with a reflection on the importance of out-of-school programs to help adolescents with difficult course of lives.
School accountability and the black-white test score gap;Since at least the 1960s, researchers have closely examined the respective roles of families, neighborhoods, and schools in producing the black-white achievement gap. Although many researchers minimize the ability of schools to eliminate achievement gaps, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) increased pressure on schools to do so by 2014. In this study, we examine the effects of NCLB's subgroup-specific accountability pressure on changes in black-white math and reading test score gaps using a school-level panel dataset on all North Carolina public elementary and middle schools between 2001 and 2009. Using difference-in-difference models with school fixed effects, we find that accountability pressure reduces black-white achievement gaps by raising mean black achievement without harming mean white achievement. We find no differential effects of accountability pressure based on the racial composition of schools, but schools with more affluent populations are the most successful at reducing the black-white math achievement gap. Thus, our findings suggest that school-based interventions have the potential to close test score gaps, but differences in school composition and resources play a significant role in the ability of schools to reduce racial inequality.

Creche attendance and children's intelligence and behavior development;Early childhood education is intended to further cognitive and general development. Studies on the impact of regular creche (preschool for children under age 3) attendance outside the U.S. are rare. Two complementary studies conducted in Austria are presented: In Study 1,62 kindergarten children (aged 4-6 years) who previously attended creche were matched to kindergarten children who had not attended creche. Creche attendance was strongly and positively associated with cognitive ability (10 IQ points), social-emotional and motor development, but negatively associated with behavior rated by kindergarten teachers. In Study 2 with 118 fourth graders (aged 8-10 years), the association between creche attendance and cognitive ability was weaker than in Study I at kindergarten age and was masked by a negative correlation with learning behaviors. A path model indicated direct positive (3 IQ points) and indirect negative effects (-1 IQ point) via learning behaviors on intelligence at primary school age. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Social Selectivity and Effectiveness of Private Tutoring among Elementary School Children in Germany;We discuss the sociological model of educational choice and Coleman's social capital approach in order to develop hypotheses on social selectivity in the use of private tutoring. Our empirical work is based on panel data on almost 1,800 students and their parents collected from elementary schools in two German states. Our logistic regression results provide little support for our hypotheses on educational aspirations and status maintenance, on parental help with homework, and on financial and time resources. The results show that the use of tutoring is driven mainly by low school performance. An additional investigation of the effectiveness of tutoring in a control group shows that private tutoring does not lead to improved achievement in German or mathematics between the third and fourth grades.
Effectively Maintaining Inequality in Toronto: Predicting Student Destinations in Ontario Universities;Access to highly ranked, prestigious, and well-resourced universities represents an additional yet understudied dimension of educational inequality in Canada. The theory of effectively maintained inequality contends that advantaged groups will dominate access to the best-positioned institutions within any credential tier. This paper tests this hypothesis using unique data on thousands of Toronto District School Board students that were tracked from Grade 9 to their entry in Ontario postsecondary institutions, and then linked to data on university rankings, incomes, expenditures, and endowments. A series of multilevel models shows that entry into Ontario's university hierarchy tends to mirror inequalities in general access to universities. Female, Asian-origin, and students from higher socioeconomic neighborhoods are more likely to enter higher ranked and better resourced institutions, while students who self-identify as black and male are less likely to enter such institutions. High socioeconomic status and Asian-origin advantages are mediated only partly by academic variables, suggesting that status cultures play a role in shaping their university choices, while gender and other racial inequalities emerge largely through academic processes.
The relationship between socioeconomic status at age one, opportunities to learn and achievement in mathematics in fourth grade in Peru;Using Young Lives longitudinal data from Peru, this paper explores the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) measured at the age of one, opportunities to learn (OTL) and achievement in mathematics ten years later. Four variables of OTL were measured: hours of class per year, curriculum coverage, quality of teachers' feedback, and level of cognitive demand. The last three were measured through an analysis of the exercises attempted by fourth grade students in their notebooks and workbooks. Multivariate analysis showed a robust association of one of the OTL variables (curriculum coverage, more specifically number of exercises attempted by students) with achievement in mathematics. Moreover SES at the age of one was significantly associated with this variable and with achievement by the time students were ten years old. Overall, the findings of the paper illustrate a highly unequal education system in which relatively poor children have fewer OTL in school.
Physical and Psychological Mechanism of Educational Inequality and Its Intervention Paths Selection;Educational inequality is an unjust difference of the education system. Educational inequality is one kind of education system that discriminates or oppresses or rejects or disparages some people judging by their family background, talents, abilities, race, cultural background, academic performance, ambition etc. which will lead to biases in China's education, making China's modernization and rejuvenation difficult to achieve. This paper analyzes the physical and psychological mechanisms and intervention paths of educational inequality. It argues that educational inequality is due to a lack of social and economic background measurement of parents' social status which leads to an overestimation of the impact of schools and self-fulfilling prophecy of the parents. Physical mechanism reflects bad health condition and their demeaning behavioral habits of students. Regarding to physical and psychological mechanism for educational inequality, this paper puts forward two effective intervening methods: passing on incremental theory and building multiple evaluation system, which will provide a new perspective to perfect educational theory.
Reflections on Educational Inequality and Its Countermeasures;The General Secretary Xi Jinping specially mentioned the problem of deepening educational comprehensive reform in the Third Plenum of 18th CPC Central Committee. Problems emerging in current educational field are diversified. The common people mainly pay attention to educational equality problem, and the phenomena of educational inequality have been highlighted and have presented a series of consequences. The General Secretary Xi Jinping's speech has offered important enlightenment for our solving inequality problems in educational field.
The emergence of social capital in low-income Latino elementary schools;"Scholars suggest that racial/ethnic and class disparities in school-based social capital contribute to educational inequalities. Previous studies demonstrate that social capital (relations of trust, mutual expectations, and shared values) between parents and schools supports children's development. Yet we know little about the emergence of social capital, that is, the processes through which it develops. In this study, we explore mechanisms of social capital emergence in predominantly low-income Latino school communities. We draw data from an experimental study that manipulated social capital through an after-school family engagement program. Based on interviews and focus groups with participating parents, teachers, and program staff in two elementary schools, we identified four types of interactions that act as mechanisms of social capital emergence: (1) responsive communication; (2) reciprocal communication; (3) shared experiences; and (4) institutional linkage. The article connects these mechanisms to theoretically linked sources of social capital and discusses implications for theory and practice, (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
THE IMPACT OF CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS ON EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY;Most conditional cash transfer evaluations have focused on estimating program effects on schooling, consumption, and labor supply. Fewer studies have addressed these outcomes using a distributive lens. This article uses data from three programs in Latin America to obtain evidence of their impact on educational inequality of opportunity, measured using primary enrollment. The main results indicate that groups considered vulnerable gain more in terms of access to education and that these interventions help level the playing field. They do not eliminate inequality of opportunity but are certainly a useful complement to equity-enhancing policies.
Home education, school, Travellers and educational inclusion;"The difficulties Traveller pupils experience in school are well documented. Yet those in home educating go unreported. Monk suggests this is because some groups are overlooked; that gypsies and Travellers are often not perceived as home educators. This article highlights how the move to home education is seldom a free choice for Traveller families. Although existing literature suggests this is a consequence of Traveller culture and mobility patterns, this article argues that problems in school drive uptake. Issues of race and ethnicity continue to drive educational inequality and there is an urgent need to redress this is in educational policy and practice."
Reading, Writing, and the Regrettable Status of Education Research in Comparative Politics;Apart from some notable exceptions, education is regrettably understudied in comparative politics. This paucity stems from both a dearth of reliable data on schooling and the fact that education raises analytical issues that fall outside the typical domain of political scientists. In light of education's crucial role in everything from citizen attitudes to earnings to economic growth, we recommend that political scientists pay more attention to education. In particular, comparative researchers should shift from an almost exclusive focus on average levels of schooling to explaining the causes and consequences of educational inequality. To that end, we provide a broad comparative framework for analyzing the politics of education. In our formulation, skill-biased technological change and factor endowments condition the extent to which firms demand human capital. The supply of skills is a function of the interests and institutions that link voters and politicians. We conclude by positing theoretical and empirical puzzles for future research.
Educational Inequality and Social Justice: Challenges for Career Guidance;
The Measurement of Educational Inequality: Achievement and Opportunity(1);Two related measures of educational inequality are proposed: one for educational achievement and another for educational opportunity. The former is the simple variance (or standard deviation) of test scores. Its selection is informed by consideration of two measurement issues that have typically been overlooked in the literature: the implications of the standardization of test scores for inequality indices, and the possible sample selection biases arising from the Program of International Student Assessment (PISA) sampling frame. The measure of inequality of educational opportunity is given by the share of the variance in test scores that is explained by pre-determined circumstances. Both measures are computed for the 57 countries in which PISA surveys were conducted in 2006. Inequality of opportunity accounts for up to 35 percent of all disparities in educational achievement. It is greater in (most of) continental Europe and Latin America than in Asia, Scandinavia, and North America. It is uncorrelated with average educational achievement and only weakly negatively correlated with per capita gross domestic product. It correlates negatively with the share of spending in primary schooling, and positively with tracking in secondary schools.
Educational inequality in rural and urban India;"This paper presents estimates of educational inequality for the major Indian states. We compute the education Gini index separately for the rural and urban sectors and examine the changes in inequality during past two decades. The estimates show the high extent of educational inequality; though the inequality declined between 1993 and 2009 the Gini index is above 50% in 2009. Using the analysis of Gini (ANOGI), a technique to decompose overall inequality into the inequality within- and between-sectors, we find that a large part of overall educational inequality is accounted for by intra-sector inequality. Further, intra-sector inequality has increased and inter-sector inequality has narrowed during the above period. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Class Structure, Education and the Reduction in Income Inequality (2002-2011);"This paper aims to reconcile the role ascribed to education as a major cause of the recent reduction in inequality in Brazil with a class analysis framework. A series of univariate and multivariate inequality decompositions were carried out, including the between-group/within-group decomposition of the GE(0) index and the regression-based decomposition suggested by Fields (2003). Our results show that a) whereas the class structure composition was relatively stable between 2002 and 2011, the educational composition changed dramatically; b) inequality between classes accounts for a larger fraction of total inequality than inequality between educational groups; and c) when class and education are analyzed simultaneously, the fraction of total inequality explained by education falls abruptly, while the relative share of class inequality remains constant. Thus, educational improvement was apparently much more important for the reduction in inequality than changes in the other dimensions captured by class structure."

Social Class and Educational Inequality: The Impact of Parents and Schools;
From Ethnic Capital to Ethnic Educational Inequality: How Family and Co-Ethnic Neighbourhood Resources Affect Second-Generation Attainment in Belgium;Applying multilevel analyses to a sample of the Belgian Census (110,208 individuals in 130 municipalities and districts), we study neighbourhood effects on ethnic educational inequality, comparing the Italian, Moroccan, and Turkish second generation with the Belgian majority. Severe ethnic penalties on the completion of upper secondary and tertiary education are largely explained by ethnic differences in family resources. In addition to individual-and household-level predictors in 1991, our analyses of educational attainment, as assessed retrospectively in 2001, focus on ethnic density and co-ethnic resources as neighbourhood-level predictors in 1991. Neighbourhood resources are measured by general and co-ethnic levels of education and housing wealth in one's municipality or district. Combining migration research on the role of ethnic communities with research on neighbourhood effects, we argue that co-ethnic (relative to general) neighbourhood resources will most effectively support second-generation attainment. Indeed, positive effects of neighbourhood ethnic density and the share of university-educated co-ethnics on attainment account for residual ethnic penalties after taking into account family resources, particularly among the Turkish second generation. Our findings point to the up-and downsides of ethnic residential concentration for second-generation attainment, depending on the presence or absence of co-ethnic neighbourhood resources.

Unequal Distribution of Educational Outcomes between Social Categories: 'Children at Risk' from a Sociological Perspective;This paper discusses the concept of 'children at risk' for poor educational outcomes from a sociological perspective. The broader concept of social inequality with its determinants and dimensions is introduced as a conceptual basis. The concept of 'children at risk' for adverse educational outcomes can be located within this framework: They are defined as children with an above-average risk of unfavourable educational outcomes because of their affiliation to a social category. The unequal distribution of educational outcomes between different social categories is a well-established research topic in sociology which is usually simply referred to as 'educational inequality'. Its description and especially its explanation are the major tasks for sociologists in this field. The paper provides some selected examples for educational inequalities and introduces one exemplary theoretical explanation from a sociological perspective for this phenomenon. Furthermore, the concept of 'children at risk' is critically discussed in light of the usefulness as well as the complex of problems that may be associated with its application in sociology.
Initial Teacher Education programmes: providing a space to address the disproportionate exclusion of Black pupils from schools in England?;Exclusion from school is a disciplinary sanction used in English schools to manage behaviour by limiting a young person's attendance at school and the over-representation of Black pupils in national exclusions statistics has been a long-standing cause of concern. This paper reports on the findings of a small-scale, qualitative study that explored the opportunities that the student teachers in the Initial Teacher Education (ITE) departments of four English universities had to gain an understanding of this particular form of educational inequality and how it might be addressed. Despite a strong focus on diversity and social justice within each institution, interviews with the student teachers highlighted gaps and inconsistencies in their opportunities to learn about exclusion from school and its disproportionate impact on Black young people. Nevertheless, Initial Teacher Education programmes emerged as an important space from which to explore student teachers' understandings of this issue, with a view to moving them beyond the sort of more individualised understandings that militate against recognition of this as an equalities issue.
Excess Infant Mortality Among Native Hawaiians: Identifying Determinants for Preventive Action;"Objectives. We identified potential determinants and cause-specific sources of excess infant mortality among Native Hawaiians. Methods. We compared infant mortality rates among Native Hawaiians and Whites by using data from the 2002 to 2009 Hawai'i State Linked Birth/Infant Death Cohort File. We evaluated the components of excess infant mortality by age and underlying cause of death as well as maternal sociodemographic, behavioral, and chronic condition disparities. Results. The Native Hawaiian infant mortality rate was more than twice that for Whites (7.9 vs 3.5/1000 live births). Excess Native Hawaiian infant mortality was equally apportioned to neonatal and postneonatal deaths. Preterm-related causes of death accounted for 43.9% of the infant mortality disparity, followed by sudden unexpected infant death (21.6%) and injury (5.6%). In multivariable models, maternal educational inequality accounted for the largest portion of the neonatal mortality disparity (20.9%); younger maternal age (12.2%) and smoking (9.5%) were the only significant contributors to the postneonatal mortality disparity. Conclusions. Addressing educational inequalities, promoting safe sleep practices, and reducing smoking among Native Hawaiian mothers would help to eliminate excess infant mortality."
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY AND THE EXPANSION OF UK HIGHER EDUCATION;In this paper we explore changes over time in higher education (HE) participation and attainment between people from richer and poorer family backgrounds during a time period when the UK higher education system expanded at a rapid rate. We use longitudinal data from three time periods to study temporal shifts in HE participation and attainment across parental income groups for children going to university in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The key finding is a highly policy relevant one, namely that HE expansion has not been equally distributed across people from richer and poorer backgrounds. Rather, it has disproportionately benefited children from relatively rich families. Despite the fact that many more children from higher income backgrounds participated in HE before the recent expansion of the system, the expansion acted to widen participation gaps between rich and poor children. This finding is robust to different measures of education participation and inequality. It also emerges from non-parametric estimations and from a more detailed econometric model allowing for the sequential nature of education choices with potentially different income associations at different stages of the education sequence.
Rural students' experiences in a Chinese elite university: capital, habitus and practices;Drawing on a qualitative case study and deploying Bourdieu's thinking tools, this article attempts to understand rural students' subjectivities and practices in a Chinese elite university, relating the types and volumes of capital they possessed to the process of position-takings. It contextualises their experiences against the backdrop of the rural-urban divide in China and the great educational inequality thus entailed. Rurality in the metropolitan space resulted in a strong feeling of being out of place. Lack of the legitimate cultural forms, together with pervasive financial constraints, constituted a major cause of frustration and alienation for these former academic stars. Exclusion and self-exclusion from the consecrated' culture, high-status societies and social activities further handicapped their acquisition of valued capitals. Under such conditions, rural participants produced diversified strategies and practices, through which we catch a glimpse of their evolving habitus.
Educational expansion and field of study: trends in the intergenerational transmission of educational inequality in the Netherlands;In this paper we study to what extent parental field of study affects a person's educational level and field of study. We employ information on 8800 respondents from the Family Survey Dutch Population (1992-2009). Our results first of all show that, over the last five decades, economic fields of study have become more fashionable among men. In sharp contrast, mainly tracks in agriculture have lost most of their appeal. Among women, medical, economic and socio-cultural fields have gained attractiveness. Second, we established that parental field of study is of significant importance for reaching a high level of education for children, and that the relevance of parental field of study is increasing over the years. Moreover, symmetry in fields could be established when it comes to the intergenerational transmission of field of study. Our results support the idea that educational expansion does not necessarily lead to increasing meritocracy in western societies.
Disparities in Academic Achievement: Assessing the Role of Habitus and Practice;Bourdieu's theory of cultural and social reproduction-with its core concepts cultural capital, habitus, practice and field-is a leading account of the intergenerational persistence of educational inequality. Although numerous studies examine the relationship between class, cultural capital and academic outcomes, and some focus on gender differences in cultural capital, few attempt to operationalize Bourdieu's accompanying concepts of habitus and practice, and to consider gender differences along these dimensions. The present study addresses these gaps by examining a structure-disposition-practice model of the relationships between family socioeconomic status (SES), sex, habitus, academic practices, and academic achievement using multilevel Canadian data. Findings of SES and gender differences in the model offer qualified support for the potential of Bourdieu's framework to help increase our understanding of class and gender disparities in educational outcomes. Results suggest that habitus, practice and the structure-disposition-practice model are not only theoretically sophisticated, but also empirically sustainable and that future efforts to more precisely measure the model's concepts and relationships are warranted.
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY AND THE EXPANSION OF UNITED KINGDOM HIGHER EDUCATION;
Incomplete equalization: The effect of tracking in secondary education on educational inequality;"This paper tests whether the existence of vocationally oriented tracks within a traditionally academically oriented upper education system reduces socioeconomic inequalities in educational attainment. Based on a statistical model of educational transitions and data on two entire cohorts of Danish youth, we find that (1) the vocationally oriented tracks are less socially selective than the traditional academic track; (2) attending the vocationally oriented tracks has a negative effect on the likelihood of enrolling in higher education; and (3) in the aggregate the vocationally oriented tracks improve access to lower-tier higher education for low-SES students. These findings point to an interesting paradox in that tracking has adverse effects at the micro-level but equalizes educational opportunities at the macro-level. We also discuss whether similar mechanisms might exist in other educational systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Educational Disadvantages Caused by Overweight: Why Obese Children Do Worse in School;This article investigates whether overweight and obesity among German students are associated with their educational success. Based on the KiGGS study (Study on the Health of Children and Young People in Germany) and the Microcensus 2009, we analyze the relationship between Body Mass Index and grades in mathematics and German as well as the transition to upper secondary school. The results show that both obese boys and girls have lower grades in mathematics and a lower probability of attending upper secondary school. Furthermore, overweight boys' chances of making the transition to this school type are reduced. For obese girls, we find that their weaker school results in mathematics can partially be explained by the fact that they are teased more frequently, resulting in a lower self-esteem (internalization) and behavior problems (externalization). Health problems or personal characteristics do not account for poorer grades of children with obesity.
The role of social capital in the explanation of educational success and educational inequalities;This article examines the role that social capital plays in school success and in the explanation of social and ethnic inequalities in the German educational system. Based on Coleman's well-known concept of social capital, different aspects of social capital are distinguished, including social network composition, parent-school interaction and intrafamilial social capital. In sum, the overall results indicate that the different aspects of social capital influence the school performance of pupils. In addition, social capital endowment is found to be of relevance for the explanation of inequalities in school grades between social classes and ethnic groups. In this respect, the analyses indicate that social capital endowment is part of the underlying mechanism responsible for educational inequalities.
Summarizing primary and secondary effects;Current methods for decomposing class differentials in educational decisions into primary and secondary effects produce many parameters, rendering them ill-equipped for parsimonious comparisons across countries or birth cohorts. This paper develops a parametric method that provides an optimal summary of primary and secondary effects across discrete class origins. Under the testable assumption that the pattern of effects of class origins on academic ability is proportional to the pattern of effects of class origins on educational choice net of academic ability, the method returns a single summary measure. Applying the method to two cohorts born in the UK in 1958 and 1970 suggests that even with increasing overall inequality of educational opportunity the relative contribution of secondary effects to class differentials in A-level completion has changed little between the two cohorts.

Qualitative findings on the inter-dependent educational significance of non-school educational settings;This article presents the results of a qualitative triangulation study which explored the development of educational inequality from the perspective of 13-year-olds, their parents and their friends. The article offers new empirical insights into the interaction of the family and peer settings and their importance for the educational biography of pupils aged about 13 and the development of educational inequality. First of all, the requirements for educational research into non-school settings are discussed. Then, the hitherto largely unconnected fields of research into educational biographies, families and peer settings are examined to ascertain how they could contribute to the goal of a qualitative triangulation study. This is followed by a presentation of the questions and the conceptual and empirical methods of our own study, before the results are presented in the form of a typology of the interrelationships. The article concludes with a discussion of the results against the background of the goals formulated at the beginning of the article and considerations about research into the social origins of habitus.
Interrogating institutionalized establishments: urban-rural inequalities in China's higher education;China's urban-rural disparities are a fundamental source of China's overall educational inequalities. This article addresses the issue with data collected through interviews with members at various Chinese higher education institutions. It interrogates China's current policies together with the socio-political institutional arrangements that underlie them and assesses the effectiveness of existing schemes to support higher education students. Based on China's experience, it challenges market transition theory's claim and debates the classical economic theory which postulates that expansion of education will reduce inequality. Believing that the educational gap is only part of China's urban-rural disparities, of which many resulted from social institutional arrangements, it calls for changes to established institutions and a reconsideration of the role of private financing mainly through tuition fees.
Cantonal variations of integration policy and their impact on immigrant educational inequality;Migration policy regimes are mainly analysed from an international comparative perspective, whereas subnational policy variations, although they are particularly pronounced in federal states, remain largely neglected. By transferring an international concept of integration policy to Switzerland's cantonal level, we show that cantonal variations of integration policy are not only considerable but even occasionally exceed international variance. Subsequent outcome analyses further undermine the relevance of cantonal integration polices, suggesting that liberal and culturally pluralist policies moderate immigrant educational inequality in schools. As the results of our Bayesian multilevel analyses show, a combination of different policy aspects representing inclusive cantonal integration policies has the greatest potential to ameliorate immigrants' equal opportunities in school. Accounting for immigrants' heterogeneity in terms of linguistic and social background moreover reveals that integration policy differently affects various groups of immigrants.
Poverty & privilege: Primary school inequality in South Africa;The strong legacy of apartheid and the consequent correlation between education and wealth have meant that, generally speaking, poorer South African students perform worse academically. Although racial segregation has been abolished for 18 years now, schools which served predominantly White students under apartheid remain functional, while those which served Black students remain dysfunctional and unable to impart the necessary numeracy and literacy skills students should be acquiring by this level. The present study provides an overview of this dualistic nature of the primary education system in South Africa, with special attention paid to the bimodality of student performance. It argues that there are in fact two different education systems in South Africa and thus two different data-generating processes. These two sub-systems can be seen when splitting student performance by former-department, language, or socioeconomic status. The implications of such a dualistic schooling system are also elucidated, with special emphasis on government reporting and econometric modeling. The recently released SACMEQ III dataset is used for the econometric modeling. The study finds that when modeling student performance separately for the wealthiest 25% of schools on the one hand, and the poorest 75% of schools on the other, there are stark differences in the factors influencing student performance. Only five of the 27 factors are shared between the two models for mathematics, and 11 of the 30 factors for reading. This suggests a bifurcated system where the process which converts inputs into outputs is fundamentally different for each sub-system. Ultimately the paper has two logical conclusions: 1) Observing averages in South African education is uniquely misleading and overestimates the educational achievement of the majority of students, and 2) Modeling a single schooling system when there are in fact two school systems can lead to spurious results and misleading policy conclusions.

Educational family background and the realisation of educational career intentions: participation of German upper secondary graduates in higher education over time;In this article, we evaluate the impact of social origin on the realisation of educational intentions at the time of becoming eligible for higher education in Germany. In general, we find high persistence of intentions and actual attendance of higher education. However, effects of parental education on the changes of educational intentions increase the existing social inequality with regard to higher education at the time of leaving secondary school. The group which is affected most are those young adults planning to study after vocational training-while the gap between different origin groups does not widen much during other stop-outs from education. This can be explained only partly by previous educational performance. The findings suggest that estimates of educational inequality are attenuated when entry into higher education is approximated by educational intentions of young adults.
The Price of Opportunity: Race, Student Loan Debt, and College Achievement;This paper examines racial differences in student loan debt and concurrently assesses the potential payoffs and countervailing risks inherent in reliance on loans in a cohort of black and white first-year college students. Using the 1996-2001 Beginning Postsecondary Student study we find that the use of loans results in greater enrollment persistence and higher odds of college completion, especially for black students. However, black students acquire larger amounts of student loan debt and face a higher risk of default than white students. This is in part due to associated racial differences in family socioeconomic status and type of institution attended. We suggest these findings illuminate the dual-sided nature of college loans that makes them an imperfect, but overall positive, tool for reducing educational inequality. On the one hand, student loans reduce educational inequality that otherwise results from disadvantaged students' struggles to pay for college and complete college in a timely fashion. At the same time, the degree to which loans reduce racial inequality is diminished by black students' higher loan amounts, the large number of black students who borrow but do not finish college, and the large racial difference in the odds of defaulting on a loan.
Re-examining the relationship between economic growth and inequality in the New Member States;The link between income inequality and economic growth has raised many debates in the literature and has generated a large spectrum of results over time. This paper aims at analyzing the relationship between economic growth and income inequality, as well as their macroeconomic and institutional determinants in the New Member States, between 2000 and 2009. In the presence of a set of explicative variables, the economic growth influences the social inequality through a U-shaped relationship. Health, education and gross capital formation generate different direct and indirect effects on income inequality as the per capita GDP growths, while the transition indicators are found to be either common or specific determinants of inequality and growth.
Distance, education and inequality;In this paper we examine the role which distance, in a variety of forms, can play in the reproduction, intensification or reduction of educational inequality in different types of school systems in different countries. This is a very broad issue, and in the paper we examine the ways in which distance to school has emerged as an important factor in understanding the relationship between social and educational inequality in London. We begin by outlining a broad framework for examination of the importance of space and distance which looks at characteristics of schools, pupils and school allocational systems and how they combine in different situations. We then attempt to populate this schema by drawing on different specific examples linking to relevant national literatures.
'Arguments' for School Choice: A Case Study with Portuguese Parents;"Taking as an empirical basis some of the data from a questionnaire applied to a sample of approximately eight hundred parents from three public secondary schools, this paper discusses how various categories of parents organise hierarchies of excellence through the arguments for choice that they prioritise when choosing their children's school for entrance into secondary education (year 10 of schooling, equivalent to the year 4 of compulsory secondary education in Spain - ESO). The analysis of the data highlights that, in all segments of parents, a group can be found that attaches great importance to academic indicators; in addition, an unequal concentration of these groups was verified in the three establishments studied, which reflects a predominance of different types of public in each school. Thus, even though the importance attributed to the arguments for choice varies according to the educational level of the parents, in the cases studied the hierarchies of excellence are distinguished, above all, by the school variable."
The College Type: Personality and Educational Inequality;I examine the effects of cognitive ability and personality traits on college graduation in a recent cohort of young Americans, and how the returns to these traits vary by family background, and find very substantial differences across family background groups in the personality traits that predict successful completion of college, particularly for men. The implications are twofold. First, the returns to noncognitive traits may be highly context dependent. Second, policy discussion concerning educational inequality should include not just the possibilities for remediating the skill levels of poor children, but also approaches to changing the environments that limit their opportunities.
Immigrant background peer effects in Italian schools;This article provides an empirical assessment of the effect of the concentration of students of immigrant origin on student learning, in Italian primary and lower secondary schools. I draw on the data of a national standardized learning assessment administered in 2010 to the entire student population at selected grades. The main threat to identification is given by the endogeneity of school characteristics, due to the fact that families choose their children's schools. To circumvent this problem I exploit the within-school random variability observed in the share of immigrant students across classes. I estimate peer effects allowing for heterogeneous effects between native and immigrant background children, and among natives, between children of different socio-economic background. The main finding is that the proportion of children of immigrant origin has a weak negative effect on child learning outcomes. This negative effect is somewhat larger for children of immigrant and low socioeconomic background, while it is negligible or even positive for high social origin native children.

The Reading Literacy of Immigrant Youth in Western Societies A Multilevel Analysis Based on PISA 2000 to 2009;The present article investigates the reading literacy of students from immigrant families by means of a multilevel analysis of 24 Western countries based on PISA data from 2000 to 2009. Results indicate that on the level of macro-variables, the quality and the stratification within the educational system have a very important effect on immigrant students' reading skills. Schools and their resources as well as the social and ethnic composition of the student body are crucial as well. On the individual level, the cultural capital of the parents and the language spoken at home proved to be relevant. In addition, second-generation immigrant students had better scholastic achievements than first generation immigrant students. Furthermore, differences between natives and immigrant students have, over time, diminished in several countries.
The school choice market in China: a case study;Background: In contrast to the top-down government-designated school choice programmes in many countries, e.g. in the UK and USA in particular, school choice in the Chinese context is a bottom-up movement initiated by parents and is characterised by the payment of a substantial choice fee' to the preferred school, and by competition by parents through the use of cultural, social and economic capital in order to obtain a place for their child in a preferred school. Purpose: This exploratory study aims to investigate the role of economic capital in the school choice process, i.e. how do parents realise their school choices for their children by financial means and what are the respective financial motivations and rewards of schools and the government in the school choice process? Method: This paper is a report on a case study conducted in Nanning, the capital city of a province in South China where school choice is actively taking place. Questionnaires were distributed to 450 parents from three state junior middle schools of different quality (a first-tier school, a second-tier school and a fourth-tier or below average school) with a response rate of about 80%. Follow-up, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 representative parents (10 from each school) and three administrators (the head teacher of the first-tier school, a middle manager from the second-tier school and another middle manager from the fourth-tier school). Results and conclusion: The research findings indicate that economic capital has played a vital role in helping children to accumulate sufficient cultural capital for admission to oversubscribed schools, which can in turn reduce the required extra payment for preferred schools. As a unique made in China' product, choice fees paid by parents to the school of their choice have effectively motivated schools and the local government to cooperate with parents in creating a school choice market. In such a money-oriented school choice process, school places constitute the best value for money, as they generate substantial additional income for both the schools taking choice students and the local government. To many parents, such school places are worth buying. as they believe they will increase their children's chances of entering a first-tier school at the next level of education, and eventually find a high-paid job. However, such highly income-biased school choice tends to exclude children from the working class families and exacerbates the educational inequality that already exists in society.
Voice, Schooling, Inequality, and Scale;The rich studies in this collection show that the investigation of voice requires analysis of recognition across layered spatial-temporal and sociolinguistic scales. I argue that the concepts of voice, recognition, and scale provide insight into contemporary educational inequality and that their study benefits, in turn, from paying attention to social inequality.
Educational attainment across the UK nations: performance, inequality and evidence;"Background Political devolution occurred in the UK in 1998-99, following many years in which some degree of policy administration had been devolved to the four nations. Since devolution, all four countries of the UK have pursued increasingly divergent education policies. This is true in England in particular, where diversity, choice and competition have become a key focus of education policy. This political divergence between the four nations gives us the opportunity to appraise differences and similarities in educational policies and outcomes in the four UK nations. Purpose This article is a comparative review of the education reforms of the constituent countries of the UK, with particular focus on value for money. The main aims of the article are to (1) outline the key differences in the educational systems in terms of school type, choice and competition, educational resources and pedagogy; (2) describe how the countries compare in terms of educational attainment during compulsory schooling years; (3) examine inequalities in educational attainment, such as by gender and socio-economic status, and how the different countries compare on these measures; and (4) examine existing evidence on the effectiveness and value for money of different education policies and programmes in the different countries. Sources of evidence We use a variety of sources of evidence to achieve these aims. We undertake a literature review of the existing evidence on the effectiveness and value for money of different programmes and policies that have taken place across the UK. We also collate and undertake an analysis of data on educational outcomes from published statistics sourced from the national statistics offices of each country. It is easier to be confident about comparisons based on international data sets because in this case all students will have taken exactly the same test, so we also compile and analyse survey data from international surveys of educational attainment such as PISA, PIRLS and TIMSS. Main argument We argue that while the systems of the four countries of the UK are becoming increasingly divergent, there are still many similarities. This is borne out in the evidence on educational outcomes, which show many similarities between the four countries. Because of these similarities, the positive impacts of many of the policies and programmes adopted in England may have relevance for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Conclusions We find evidence that increasing school resources improves results, and also that more targeted spending benefits able pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. We also find positive results of several programmes. Evaluating the education policies of the four nations in terms of value for money - and therefore whether they have scope to be adopted - represents a bigger challenge. Whilst the value for money of certain policies - such as the literacy hour - can be reasonably well measured, for many other policies, value for money is hard to pin down accurately. However, this forms an important direction for future research."
The Advanced Placement Arms Race and the Reproduction of Educational Inequality;Background: Access to Advanced Placement (AP) courses is stratified by class and race. Researchers have identified how schools serving disadvantaged students suffer from various kinds of resource deprivations, concluding that interventions are needed to equalize access to AP courses. On the other hand, the theory of Effectively Maintained Inequality (EMI) argues that schools serving advantaged students may perpetuate inequalities by expanding their AP curriculum so their graduates can be competitive in the college admissions process. Research Questions: Between 2000 and 2002, California attempted to expand AP offerings and enrollments. This study answers whether or not this intervention narrowed inequalities in AP along class and racial lines. It also examines if community affluence affects district officials' views of pressures to offer AP courses, which could explain any effectively maintained inequalities in AP access. Research Design: This study uses a panel dataset of all California public high schools from 1997 to 2006. It examines the changing effects of school poverty, upper-middle class presence, and school racial composition on offerings of and enrollments in AP subjects. It supplements the quantitative analysis with interviews from 11 school district officials in California conducted in 2006. Results: Hierarchical generalized linear models show that upper-middle class presence structures California high schools' AP subject offerings and enrollments, much more than school poverty. California's intervention resulted in increased AP subject offerings and enrollments in high schools serving disadvantaged and less advantaged students, but these reductions in deprivation had trivial effects on inequalities, since schools serving advantaged students increased their own AP offerings and enrollments. In addition, high schools serving White and Asian students had larger increases in AP offerings and enrollments than high schools serving Black and Hispanic students. Interview data indicate that officials in affluent districts perceived a greater demand for AP subjects, and were more likely to report their school staff was proactive to initiate new AP courses than officials in districts serving working-class communities. Conclusions: The findings document that while policies can increase AP access at schools serving low-income students, the actions of affluent schools and families will pose substantial barriers to achieving parity in AP offerings and enrollments. Moreover, studies gauging resource inequalities among schools may underestimate these inequalities if they use school poverty to measure schools' socioeconomic composition.
School tracking and educational inequality: a comparison of 12 education systems in Switzerland;Using data from the super-sample of the PISA Suisse' 2003 assessment, this article examines the relationship between the characteristics of education systems (made up of homogeneous or heterogeneous tracks) and their consequences in terms of effectiveness and equity. Our results indicate that it is not so much the official structure of tracks as the ways in which tracking is really organised and, in particular, the degree of segregation that tracking methods involve which make it possible to explain inequalities among students. They also show that some education systems are more inegalitarian than others and that the factors leading to inequalities can vary significantly from one Swiss canton to another. Finally, through multilevel analyses, we demonstrate that when the individual and aggregate characteristics of students are taken into account, the type of track a student attends is of only limited significance for explaining inequalities, which suggests that the effects of tracking are in fact linked to the nature of the population educated in the tracks.
Educational inequalities in smoking: The role of initiation versus quitting;The existing literature on educational inequalities in adult smoking has focused extensively on differences in current smoking and quitting, rather than on differences in never smoking regularly (initiation) by education in the adult population. Knowing the relative contribution of initiation versus quitting is critical for understanding the mechanisms that produce educational gradients in smoking because initiation and quitting occur at different points in the life course. Using data from 31 waves of the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (N = 587,174), the analyses show the relative likelihood of being a never versus former smoker by education, sex, and age from 1966 to 2010 and for birth cohorts from 1920 to 1979. The analyses also describe differences in the cumulative probability of quitting over the life course, and the role of initiation versus quitting in producing educational gaps in smoking. The results show that educational gaps in never smoking explain the bulk of the educational inequality in adult smoking. Differences in former smoking play a small and decreasing role in producing these gaps. This is true across the life course, whether measured at age 25 or age 50, and for both men and women. While the prevalence and age patterns of former smoking by education converge across birth cohorts, differences in never smoking by education increase dramatically. At the population level, educational gaps in adult smoking are produced by the combination of inequalities in initiation and quitting, with differences in initiation playing a larger role in producing the observed gaps. The portion of the gap explained by differences in quitting is itself a function of educational differences in initiation. Thus, educational gradients in adult smoking are tethered to experiences in adolescence. These findings have important implications for both understanding and addressing disparities in this important health behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Institutional Features of Schooling Systems and Educational Inequality: Cross-Country Evidence From PIRLS and PISA;Educational opportunities determine the intergenerational mobility of human capital and affect the distribution of earnings on the labour market. This paper aims at explaining cross-country differences in educational opportunities by features of schooling systems. The theoretical model predicts that a greater differentiation of the schooling system as indicated by streaming and a large share of private schools decreases educational opportunities while more instruction time increases educational opportunities. The empirical results that are based on a difference-in-differences estimation approach to control for country-specific effects support these hypotheses.
The power of social capital in school choice in a Chinese city;School choice in China is characterized by the payment of substantial amounts of additional (choice) fees by parents to the preferred school, and by the use of cultural, social and economic capital to obtain places in oversubscribed schools. This study examines the role of social capital in current parent-initiated school choice in China. It finds that it is common for parents to mobilize their social capital in the form of guanxi to acquire insider information, to facilitate or gain exceptional entry into the preferred school and to reduce or waive the choice fee. The paper also addresses the issue of educational inequality caused by such practice in the school choice process.
Differentiation in Higher Education and Social Inequality: Have the Mechanisms of Social Inequality Changed with the Expansion of Vocational Education?;"Despite growing educational participation less privileged groups are still underrepresented at universities. Several studies indicate that patterns of social inequality have changed in the course of educational expansion. While these changes have been widely discussed from a theoretical point of view, empirical evidence for the described pattern of changing mechanisms is lacking. With respect to the transition to higher education this article focuses on the question whether increasing educational participation is associated with a diversion of less privileged groups into less prestigious colleges of applied sciences (Fachhochschulen). Results indicate that with the expansion of vocational pathways to higher education children of less privileged groups more often attain upper secondary education. These changes have consequences on subsequent educational opportunities in the transition to higher education. For this reason social differences in the decision to enter on academic studies at a university have increased in the past thirty years. However, the reason for these growing differences cannot be attributed to processes of diversion, distinction, or heterogenization of ability; rather, they can rather be found in biographical differences and an increasing cost-sensitivity on the part of women from less privileged groups."
Intergenerational transmission of educational attainment: The role of household assets;High intergenerational persistence of educational attainment is an indicator of educational inequality and a barrier to equal opportunities in the labor market and beyond. This study uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to generate a sample of two cohorts of children ('84 and '94 cohorts), and it examines whether intergenerational transmission of educational attainment varies by household economic resources, especially household assets. Results show that, among male children in the '94 cohort, household assets increase the strength of the association between parents' and children's years of schooling. Also, household assets are found to interact with parental education to affect educational attainment, as measured by college completion, among female children in the '94 cohort. Research and policy implications are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Educational Inequality in Stillbirth: Temporal Trends in Quebec From 1981 to 2009;"OBJECTIVE: Educational inequality in stillbirth has been documented in high-income countries and the province of Quebec, Canada, but temporal trends are poorly understood. Our objective was to determine time trends in inequality related to maternal education for all-cause and cause-specific stillbirth over the past three decades in Quebec. METHODS: We included 2,397,971 live births and 9,983 stillbirths from 1981 through 2009 using Quebec vital statistics. For each decade, we computed measures of inequality capturing relative (relative index of inequality, RII) and absolute (slope index of inequality, SII) differences between the least-and most-educated mothers for all-cause and cause-specific stillbirth, adjusting for maternal characteristics. RESULTS: Stillbirth rates decreased over time for all education levels. Absolute educational inequality (SII 2.5 per 1000 births, 95% CI 2.1-2.8; all periods combined) was stable over time, whereas relative inequality increased (RII1981-1989 1.8 vs. RII2000-2009 2.3). Absolute inequality decreased for stillbirths caused by placental abruption (SII1981-1989 0.6 vs. SII2000-2009 0.3), but increased for unspecified causes (SII1981-1989 0.2 vs. SII2000-2009 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Absolute educational inequality in stillbirth persisted and relative inequality increased over the past three decades, despite an overall decrease in stillbirth rates. The decrease in absolute inequality for placental abruption was countered by an increase for unspecified causes. A better understanding of the underlying components of unspecified causes is needed to further address educational inequality in stillbirth."
OECD, 'Key competencies' and the new challenges of educational inequality;In this paper, I develop a critique of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)-based lifelong learning policy discourse with a particular focus on key competencies' (KCs) and its equity implications for school curricular policies. First, I review the discussion of KCs in the writings by the OECD-affiliated researchers and other OECD documents. In so doing, I identify a marked decoupling of KCs from the initial lifelong learning policy framework. Then, I situate the discussion of KCs within the sociological critique of the new mode of learning deemed essential for a knowledge society'. I identify KCs' potential to naturalize the (re)production of inequalities through schooling and argue that this can be further compounded by the extraction of KCs from the lifelong learning policy discourse. Finally, I ground these expositions in the specific policy context of Japanese education, highlighting how KCs and its decoupled articulation pose a difficult policy dilemma for Japan's Ministry of Education attempting to address the widening class-based inequalities through schooling. Hence, this study critiques the contemporary school curriculum reform driven by KCs by tracing the flow of this concept from the international policy discourse down to the level of a national policy development. In conclusion, I call for curriculum studies to recognize the increasingly globalized curricular policy context and develop strategies for the new challenges of educational inequalities that confront us today.
School Climate and Students' Early Mathematics Learning: Another Search for Contextual Effects;Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K)-a large, nationally representative sample of US elementary school students, we employed multilevel analysis to answer the following research questions: (a) Does students' mathematics achievement growth in grades K-3 vary among schools? (b) To what extent does school academic and disciplinary climate explain variation in mathematics achievement growth among schools? (c) To what extent do students' and schools' demographic characteristics explain this variation? While previous studies have examined the effects of school climate on student achievement in middle school and high school, the present study is focused on the effect of school academic and disciplinary climate on students' mathematics learning in the first 4 years of schooling-from fall of kindergarten to spring of third grade. We found that students' mathematics achievement growth varies significantly among schools and that students' improvement in mathematics achievement over time was higher in schools characterized by a stronger climate, above and beyond students' and schools' demographic characteristics.
Educational Inequality and Social Stratification in Brazil;
Educational Inequality and Educational Expansion in China;
Does Regional Education Inequality Affect China's Economic Growth;The research results of this paper show that: educational inequality would have negative impact to the economic growth. If the education inequality rises by 1%, the China's economic growth rate would decline by 0.066%. And education inequality also really has important influence to economic divergence and convergence. Education inequality enlarged the regional economic disparities on during 1997-2002, however education inequality decreased the regional economic disparities at the period of 2003-2008 because China's educational investment system has been the reconstructed, education equality has been improved greatly and the convergence rate of economic disparities has also been prompted. Therefore, improving education equality is the important measure which would be conducive to develop economy in cooperativeness and promote economic convergence.
PUBLIC TALES WAG THE DOG Telling Stories about Structural Racism in the Post-Civil Rights Era;This essay examines the case of Kelley Williams-Bolar-an African American single mother from Akron, Ohio-who in 2011 was arrested, charged with a felony, and jailed for sending her two daughters to a predominantly White suburban public school in Copley Township without meeting the township's residency requirements. This essay closely examines the case with particular attention paid to the important but often unacknowledged intersections of race, gender, economic privilege, spatial containment, and racialized criminalization that shaped the case. The Williams-Bolar case became a public site of contesting narratives, some obscuring these intersections, others acknowledging them. Those who supported Copley Township's prosecution of Williams-Bolar relied on a law and order mandate and fiscal responsibility that supported the dominant racial narrative while appearing to be race, gender, and class neutral. But many were critical of Williams-Bolar's arrest and the story used to justify it. Their response was a massive and heated online challenge that inspired existing and newly outraged parents and educational activists from a wide range of backgrounds, triggering petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of people requesting that the Governor of Ohio pardon Williams-Bolar. This essay places the case in the context of what I call the invisible intersections of colorblind racism, the racial privileges of housing and educational resource hoarding via private property taxes for suburban upper-middle-class Whites and the expanded application of the criminalization of the Black poor to Black mothers who receive state assistance by the judicial system, in political discourse and mass media narrative. Williams-Bolar's supporters used the power of social media to build community activism and to generate alternative narratives that countered the discursive and structural forces that were at work. Finally, this article considers the value and impact of alternative narratives about Williams-Bolar and her actions as generated by supporters.
Reflections on Equity of Access to Quality Higher Education under the Trend of Massification in China;Higher education in China has undergone the transition from an elite to a mass model and is witnessing the accelerated massification of higher education with enormously larger share of people in the relevant age group going on to higher education. This change, however, has not removed the prevailing egalitarian concerns for equal educational opportunities. As the fact stands, elite higher education institutions are distributed unevenly in China, provincially-based enrollment program that makes the educational disadvantage more Pronounced in the disadvantaged locations. To a considerable measure, regional disparities and flawed enrollment system impede the quest for equity in attaining high quality tertiary education. The paper, therefore, examines this key and neglected dimension to the study of educational inequality, inequality in accessibility of elite universities, contends that research on egalitarian issues of higher education needs to shift its emphasis from enrollment expansion in a quantitative sense to whether equal access to higher education of an excellent standing can be granted, and explores feasible measures to tackle the obstacles observed in present unequal access to quality higher education.
Educational Inequality in China The Intergenerational Dimension;
Educational policies in a long-run perspective;In this paper we study the effects of educational reforms on school attainment. We construct a dataset of relevant reforms that occurred at the national level over the last century, and match individual information from 24 European countries to the most likely set-up faced when individual educational choices were undertaken. Our identification strategy relies on temporal and geographical variations in the institutional arrangements, controlling for time/country fixed effects, as well as for country specific time trend. By characterizing each group of reforms for their impact on mean years of education, educational inequality and intergenerational persistence, we show an ideal policy menu which has been available to policymakers. We distinguish between groups of policies that are either inclusive' or selective', depending on their diminishing or augmenting impact on inequality and persistence. Finally, we correlate these reform measures to political coalitions prevailing in parliament, finding support for the idea that left-wing parties support reforms that are inclusive, while right-wing parties prefer selective ones.

THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN THE COMPREHENSION OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES IN BRAZIL;There was a significant drop in income inequality in Brazil in recent years, especially in governments Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2003-2010). Although the country has gone through a substantial economic growth since 2003, and that public policies have been designed to reduce this inequality, we observe that the high level of income inequality impacts on the country's ability to reduce poverty and social inequality. Moreover, the Gini index is still very high (over 0.50), especially when we seek comparisons with developed countries (Gini lower than 0.40). Thus, the reduction of social inequality is understood today as one of the greatest challenges for Brazil. In an attempt to explain the causes of Brazilian inequality, education is always presented as a determinant factor for the wage level that can be achieved. Also, another factor that has historically contributed to the production and reproduction of inequality in the country is related to the territory, mainly by the uneven distribution of educational opportunities, so that the place where you live can influence employment opportunities and income level of the individual or families. However, a careful look at the challenges and possibilities Brazilians face can result in better ways to design and implement policies, guidelines, programs and actions in order to minimize the educational inequalities in all its dimensions. Therefore, this study aims to identify whether education is a variable that can explain inequality in Brazil. Thus, studies that tried to interpret the phenomenon of inequality in the country by identifying historical characteristics and causes were sought. After the presentation of the literature review on the relation between education and inequality and also the presentation of researches that aimed to explain the perceived inequality in Brazil, it is clear that educational inequality, measured by access to and maintenance of low-income population in school, the number of years of study and results in national assessments, is an independent variable of great explanatory power for the phenomenon of income inequality in Brazil. Also shown are the positive effects of investing in the training of the poorest by providing educational opportunities, believing that the reduction of educational inequality will lead to reduced income inequality, creating a virtuous circle.
THE EQUITY OF ITALIAN SCHOOL SYSTEM: A TERRITORIAL ANALYSIS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC GRADIENT;This paper provides an analysis of Italian students' achievement on the basis of OECD Programme International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 data. In line with results by the previous editions, PISA 2009 underlines the lower performance of Italian 15-year olds in relation to their counterparts from most of the developed countries involved in the survey. The low achievement of Italian students, which conflicts with the high level of education expenditure per pupil, leads to analyze the determinants of their poor performance focusing on the significant relationship between literacy skills and socioeconomic status. This relationship, called socio-economic gradient, is a useful policy device because it provides a framework that emphasizes both levels of schooling outcomes and the equality of outcomes among advantaged and disadvantaged groups. Given the hierarchical nature of data (students nested into schools), we also employ multilevel statistical techniques in order to decompose and investigate the role of socio-economic context on students' achievement. The main results highlight the stratification of students into different types of schools and the segregation of students from different family backgrounds. Therefore, a reorganization of educational investments could be required in order to readdress the available financial funds to schools which operate in poorer territorial contexts.
EDUCATIONAL CHOICES AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS: A FORMAL MODEL AND A COMPUTATIONAL TEST;In their authoritative literature review, Breen and Jonsson (2005) claim that 'one of the most significant trends in the study of inequalities in educational attainment in the past decade has been the resurgence of rational-choice models focusing on educational decision making'. The starting point of the present contribution is that these models have largely ignored the explanatory relevance of social interactions. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper introduces a micro-founded formal model of the macro-level structure of educational inequality, which frames educational choices as the result of both subjective ability/benefit evaluations and peer-group pressures. As acknowledged by Durlauf (2002, 2006) and Akerlof (1997), however, while the social psychology and ethnographic literature provides abundant empirical evidence of the explanatory relevance of social interactions, statistical evidence on their causal effect is still flawed by identification and selection bias problems. To assess the relative explanatory contribution of the micro-level and network-based mechanisms hypothesised, the paper opts for agent-based computational simulations. In particular, the technique is used to deduce the macro-level consequences of each mechanism (sequentially introduced) and to test these consequences against French aggregate individual-level survey data. The paper's main result is that ability and subjective perceptions of education benefits, no matter how intensely differentiated across agent groups, are not sufficient on their own to generate the actual stratification of educational choices across educational backgrounds existing in France at the beginning of the twenty-first century. By computational counterfactual manipulations, the paper proves that network-based interdependencies among educational choices are instead necessary, and that they contribute, over and above the differentiation of ability and of benefit perceptions, to the genesis of educational stratification by amplifying the segregation of the educational choices that agents make on the basis of purely private ability/benefit calculations.
IDENTIFYING AND EXPLAINING HIDDEN DISADVANTAGE WITHIN THE NON-MANUAL GROUP IN HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS;In an examination of class inequality in education in the Republic of Ireland over the period from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, this chapter reveals class inequality in educational outcomes within social groups as well as across social groups, and places particular attention on the non-manual group. Within this group, a clear distinction can be made between those classified as having an 'intermediate non-manual' position and those classified as holding an 'other (lower) non-manual' position in terms of their educational performance at secondary education and subsequent access to higher education, which persists over the period. This finding has been revealed by disaggregating the non-manual group into the 'intermediate non-manual' and 'other (lower) non-manual' groups, a practice that has not been used by analysts in the past in the Irish context. In this chapter, we engage with theories of class which offer a framework for understanding educational inequality and in particular, why members of the same social class groups experience different educational outcomes.
BUT DID IT HELP YOU GET TO UNIVERSITY? A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF SUPPLEMENTARY EDUCATION IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA;"Purpose - This chapter reflects the findings of a qualitative study of supplementary education in Western Australia, showing a commitment to understanding the broader social context of the individuals receiving educational assistance beyond their normal classroom activities. Design/methodology/approach - The chapter is based on 10 semi-structured interviews conducted with university students who had utilised supplementary education services of a tutor made available through their schools and a variety of secondary sources. Findings - The study also reveals that student access to university is not necessarily enhanced by private tutoring. It uncovers an under-researched component of the overall educational process in pointing to some of the emotional dimensions of the supplementary education industry. While tutoring did not appear to harm the chances of students making it to university, the beneficial effects of tutoring are not as clear-cut as some suggest they are. Overall the research suggests that, emotional support effects notwithstanding, perhaps we should not worry overly much about the inequalities brought by private tutoring as, yet again, the market shows itself to less efficient than some hope it to be and that others might fear it is. Originality/value - Market-based supplementary education remains massively under-researched in Australia. While qualitative research is unable to address the effects of educational interventions definitively, the study adds important layers of complexity to questions about educational effectiveness and inequality. It helps validate concerns about social and economic inequalities; it also mollifies these concerns, partially because some of the programmes described here aim at addressing some basic inequalities, particularly those related to rural and remote education."
The influence of habitus in the relationship between cultural capital and academic achievement;Scholars routinely use cultural capital theory in an effort to explain class differences in academic success but often overlook the key concept of habitus. Rich. longstanding debates within the literature suggest the need for a closer examination of the individual effects of cultural capital and habitus. Drawing upon the writings of Pierre Bourdieu, I use a longitudinal dataset to examine the effects of multiple operationalizations of cultural capital on academic achievement and the mediating effects of habitus. Using first difference models to control for time-invariant unobserved characteristics. I find that typical operationalizations of cultural capital (i.e. high-arts participation and reading habits) have positive effects on GPA that are completely mediated through habitus. These results stress the importance of habitus in the relationship between cultural capital and academic achievement for disadvantaged youth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Access Without Equity: Longitudinal Analyses of Institutional Stratification by Race and Ethnicity, 1972-2004;The competitive dynamics that sustain stratification among postsecondary institutions have reinforced racial inequality in selective college enrollment between 1972 and 2004. Using a data set constructed from four nationally representative surveys (National Longitudinal Survey 1972, High School & Beyond 1980, National Educational Longitudinal Survey 1988, and Educational Longitudinal Survey 2002), the authors model how escalating admissions standards-including academic preparation and the growing importance of SAT scores and extracurricular leadership-effectively maintain racial inequality in selective college enrollment over time. Black and Latino students have made strides in their pre-collegiate academic preparation. Nevertheless, although access to postsecondary education has expanded since 1972 for all ethnic groups, Black and Latino students' odds of selective college enrollment have declined relative to White and Asian American students.
Widening social inequality in life expectancy in Denmark. A register-based study on social composition and mortality trends for the Danish population;Background: Dynamics of the social composition of the population might influence the interpretation of statements of the increasing gap of social inequality in life expectancy. The aim of the study was to estimate trends during a quarter of a century in social inequality in life expectancy and to compare results based on different social stratifications. Methods: Life tables by sex and various levels of education and income were constructed for each year in the period 1987-2011 by linking individual data from nationwide registers comprising information on all Danish citizens on date of birth, date of death, education and income. Trends in life expectancies were compared for different categories of social grouping of the population. Results: When categories of educational level were kept fixed, implying a decreasing proportion of persons with a short education, the educational inequality in life expectancy increased. Thus, the difference in life expectancy at age 30 between men with primary or lower secondary education and men with tertiary education increased from 4.8 years in 1987 to 6.4 years in 2011. For women the difference increased from 3.7 years in 1987 to 4.7 in 2011. A similar growing social disparity was observed when educational level was based on quartiles established from prescribed length of education. A considerable increasing inequality was reached for men when the population was divided in quartiles of equivalent disposable income, whereas the change was only modest for women. Conclusions: During the past 25 years, the social gap in life expectancy has widened in Denmark. This conclusion could not be explained by changes of the social compositions of the population.
Live and Learn? Contradictions in Residential Patterns and School Demographics;Educational and sociological scholars frequently debate how racial dynamics between neighborhoods and their public schools can maintain or exacerbate educational inequality. Drawing on secondary data from the Georgia Department of Education, 2000 Census Bureau, and attendance boundaries for metro Atlanta public high schools, this study investigates the following: To what degree do Atlanta-area racial and ethnic segregation patterns in public secondary schools reflect those in residential catchment areas? I find that in areas with the greatest racial heterogeneity and the greatest potential for diversity in educational settings, the public schools least reflect the racial composition of the neighborhoods. These results can inform policy makers and administrators on neighborhood and school-level factors which have implications for minimizing ethnoracial differences in education.
The racial gap in education and the legacy of slavery;Bertocchi, Graziella, and Dimico, Arcangelo - The racial gap in education and the legacy of slavery We study the evolution of racial educational inequality across US states from 1940 to 2000. We show that throughout this period, despite evidence of convergence, the racial gap in attainment between blacks and whites has been persistently determined by the initial gap. We obtain these results with 2SLS estimates where slavery is used as an instrument for the initial gap. We address the question of the excludability of slavery by instrumenting it with the share of disembarked slaves from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Using the same approach we also find that income growth is negatively affected by the initial racial gap in education and that slavery affects growth indirectly through this channel.

The Changing Impact of Family Size on Adolescents' Schooling: Assessing the Exogenous Variation in Fertility Using Twins in Brazil;Researchers have long been interested in the influence of family size on children's educational outcomes. Simply put, theories have suggested that resources are diluted within families that have more children. Although the empirical literature on developed countries has generally confirmed the theoretical prediction that family size is negatively related to children's education, studies focusing on developing societies have reported heterogeneity in this association. Recent studies addressing the endogeneity between family size and children's education have also cast doubt on the homogeneity of the negative role of family size on children's education. The goal of this study is to examine the causal effect of family size on children's education in Brazil over a 30-year period marked by important social and demographic change, and across extremely different regions within the country. We implement a twin birth instrumental variable approach to the nationally representative 1977-2009 PNAD data. Our results suggest an effect of family size on education that is not uniform throughout a period of significant social, economic, and demographic change. Rather, the causal effect of family size on adolescents' schooling resembles a gradient that ranges from positive to no effect, trending to negative.

Growing Gaps: Educational Inequality around the World;
21st-Century Capitalism, Austerity, and Black Economic Dispossession;The article is an analysis of late capitalism and the nature of Black inequality today given the political economy of late capitalism. As always, the fundamental fact of 21st-century capitalism is profit. Yet the system is in crisis, centered in a crisis of accumulation. Given this, what are the consequences for the Black population in the United States and globally? A number of key questions inform the discussion, centered on the nature of capitalism today. Issues of austerity, neoliberalism, race, gender, and class are interrogated. Then there is the issue of how might the situation be changed. Using the September 2012 Chicago Teachers Union strike as an entry point, an initial set of reflections on how might we resist and struggle are articulated, centering some key lessons from the fight for educational justice in Chicago.
Are educational policies elitist?;This paper analyses the link between public education expenditure and human capital inequality. I build a model of human capital formation where government intervention in education is justified by the existence of credit constraints. The framework provides conditions on the level of economic development and income inequality under which the educational policies are elitist, that is, they increase the spread between the educational achievement of bright and less bright individuals. With the use of the measures of educational inequality constructed for both developed and developing countries by Castello and Domenech, I also present descriptive evidence that provides some support to the model's predictions.
The impact of economic coordination and educational institutions on individual-level preferences for academic and vocational education;Integrating the literature on the varieties of capitalism with sociological studies of educational stratification, this paper argues that macro-level institutions significantly shape the relationship between educational background and preferences for different kinds of education on the micro level. In particular, we find that the institutional set-up of the education system and the degree of coordination prevailing in a given economy both have a distinct impact on micro-level associations. Segregated education systems dominated by vocational training at the secondary level increase the strength of the association between educational background and preferences, whereas higher levels of coordination weaken this relationship. Our claims are supported by an empirical analysis of Eurobarometer survey data, using multilevel regression statistics. Our findings have important consequences for our understanding of the relationship between skill formation processes, labour market institutions and social equality.
The relationship between educational homogamy and educational mobility in 29 European countries;This article deals with the relationship between educational homogamy and educational mobility in 29 European countries. It answers three interrelated questions: (1) Is there any relationship between educational mobility and educational homogamy? (2) Does educational homogamy diverge from educational mobility (negative relationship) or does educational heterogamy strengthen educational mobility (positive relationship)? (3) If there is any positive relationship, do educational mobility and educational heterogamy indicate the level of educational inequality to the same degree? To answer these questions the authors use data from three waves of the European Social Survey (2002, 2004 and 2006). The answers are given in absolute (percentages) as well as in relative measures (log-multiplicative effects). The results show that there is a positive relationship between educational mobility and educational heterogamy. For all countries analysed, relative educational heterogamy is a stronger indicator of educational inequalities than relative educational mobility. The systematic deviation of educational heterogamy from educational mobility is explained by a number of factors that the authors discuss in the last part of the article.
The Effect of Tuition Fees on Enrollment in Higher Education in Germany. Evidence from a Natural Experiment;In this paper we estimate the effect of tuition fees on the intentions of high school graduates in Germany to enroll in higher education. Based on representative survey data collected by the HIS institute between 2002 and 2008, we are able to analyze the effect of tuition fees using a quasi-experimental design. We take advantage of the variation between the German federal states in the introduction of tuition fees to examine the impact of tuition fees and employ a difference-in-differences estimation strategy. We do not find empirical evidence that tuition fees lower the intentions to enroll in higher education among high school graduates. This holds true for both the whole sample and for different subgroups, such as women or high school graduates with no family background of higher education.
From Culturally Deprived to At Risk: The Politics of Popular Expression and Educational Inequality in the United States, 1960-1985;This article examines the terms culturally deprived and disadvantaged in light of their popular use in the sixties and following decades, particularly in the ethnic and mainstream press. These expressions represented an effort to explain differences in educational attainment and academic achievement along lines of social class, race, and ethnicity from an environmental, liberal viewpoint. We consider the use of such terms from the standpoint of both the African American and Mexican American communities at the time, representing perspectives from the North, South, and West Coast. In doing this, we document a national effort by educators and the concerned public to comprehend and address long-standing patterns of social and educational inequity. State and federal programs that used compensatory and remedial education to address the problems of culturally deprived and disadvantaged communities are also considered, along with political tensions within and between the African American and Mexican American communities over benefits to be gained. The use of these expressions was eventually marked by controversy as ethnic communities and academic critics labeled them a new form of prejudice, based on conceptions of cultural and academic inadequacy. While the terms fell out of favor, a new generation was left with the problem of explaining persistent differences in educational outcomes and academic achievement that marked children's lives. The expression at risk was brought into the mainstream, and the academic terms social capital and cultural capital were introduced and gained currency. While these new terms have not sparked the controversies of the past, they fail to fully characterize the systematic educational disadvantages experienced by children from poor or minority backgrounds. The article closes with a brief discussion of the recurring dilemma of how best to describe persistently unequal educational outcomes, particularly when they continue to correspond to broad patterns of social and economic inequality in contemporary society.
Education Policy and Educational Inequality-Evidence from the Swiss Laboratory;This article examines how the different education policies in the subnational units of Switzerland-the cantons-affect educational inequality. The article builds on previous research arguing that in order to properly evaluate education policy and its outcomes in decentralized countries, regional disparities must been taken into account. Switzerland has one of the most decentralized education systems in the world and is thus an exemplary case for a subnational analysis. Applying multilevel models the article illustrates that small class size, public investments in education as well as the mobility between ability groups are related to a lower degree of educational inequality. In contrast, longer schooldays strengthen inequality in education, implying that school instruction in the Swiss cantons does not provide equal opportunities to pupils irrespective of social class.
The influence of tuition fees on study aspiration;Even more than other European countries, Germany must fear a serious future skills shortage and lack of experts. Therefore, increasing the proportion of high school graduates who wish to study at a university is a clear political objective. The aim of this paper is to identify variables that hinder or support the decision to pursue university studies. We used longitudinal data of 23,000 graduates of upper secondary school of the years 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008 to analyze how tuition fees (which are charged only in some of the German federal states), family status, and students' own cost-benefit analyses impacted their decision in favor or against taking up university studies. Results showed that the subjective costs of higher education were highest for persons of low social economic background, and for women. Also, the introduction of tuition fees in some federal states in the year 2006 lowered the percentage of students who wanted to enter higher education. Contrary to our expectations, however, this effect was observed in all federal states, irrespective of whether they had introduced tuition fees or not. Our results suggest that participation in higher education can be increased by both lowering (social and psychological) costs and raising (social and psychological) benefits of higher education.
Bringing the State Back In: restoring the role of the State in Chinese higher education;In the last few decades, in the wake of three major crises in political faith and the overall instability that followed the end of the Cultural Revolution, the post-Mao Chinese government has sought to improve the lives of its citizens and to restore political legitimacy through rapid economic growth that has focused almost exclusively on GDP. This strong focus has brought about rapid, widespread economic growth to China, and has, by classical market standards, been a success. At the same time, issues of social development and human well-being have received less attention. Before the Hu-Wen leadership's formal accession to power, the Jiang-Zhu administration sought to adopt neo-liberal ideas and practices to reform the delivery of social services and the implementation and funding of social policy. In this context, major fields of social policy such as health, education, and housing have been going through the processes of marketisation and privatisation, which have placed much of the financial burden of meeting these social welfare needs on China's citizens. After several decades of privatisation and marketisation in the educational system, the Chinese government has been the subject of repeated criticism for failing to tackle what is popularly known as the new three mountains phenomenon, namely, the rising cost of health, education, and housing in recent years. Against the wider policy context described above, this article examines the social and political consequences of the privatisation and marketisation of education. It also discusses the major policies and strategies recently adopted by the Chinese government to restore the role of the State in the education system in order to address the negative consequences of the privatisation of education. Finally, it critically examines the main implications of major reforms undertaken in higher education in Mainland China.
The Socio-Economic Gradient in Teenagers' Reading Skills: How Does England Compare with Other Countries?;A number of studies have explored the link between family background and children's achievement in a cross-national context. A common finding is that there is a stronger association in England than in other parts of the developed world. Rather less attention has been paid, however, to England's comparative position at different points of the achievement distribution. Is the test score gap particularly big between the most able children from advantaged and disadvantaged homes, or are differences particularly pronounced between low achievers? This issue is investigated using the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 data set. The association between family background and high achievement is found to be stronger in England than in most other developed countries, and there is little evidence that this has changed over time. However, socio-economic differences at the bottom of the achievement distribution are no more pronounced in England than elsewhere. I discuss the implications of these findings for social mobility and educational policy in the UK.
The 9th grade shock and the high school dropout crisis;Retrospective questions on educational attainment in national surveys and censuses tend to over-estimate high school graduation rates by 15-20% points relative to administrative records. Administrative data on educational enrollment are, however, only available at the aggregate level (state, school district, and school levels) and the recording of inter-school transfers are generally incomplete. With access to linked individual-level administrative records from a very large West Coast metropolitan school district we track patterns of high school attrition and on-time high school graduation of individual students. Even with adjustments for the omission of out-of-district transfers (estimates of omission are presented), the results of this study show that failure in high school, as indexed by retention and attrition, are almost as common as on-time high school graduation. In addition to the usual risk factors of disadvantaged background, we find that the 9th grade shock-an unpredicted decline in academic performance upon entering high school-is a key mechanism behind the continuing crisis of high school attrition.

Ethnic Inequality in Choice-driven Education Systems: A Longitudinal Study of Performance and Choice in England and Sweden;The authors ask whether choice-driven education systems, with comprehensive schools and mass education at the secondary and tertiary level, represented in this article by England and Sweden, provide educational opportunities for ethnic minorities. In studying educational attainment, the authors make a theoretical distinction between mechanisms connected with school performance on the one hand (primary effects) and educational choice, given performance, on the other (secondary effects). Using large national data sets and recently developed methods, they show that performance effects tend to depress the educational attainment of most, although not all, ethnic minorities, whereas choice effects increase the transition rates of these students. This pattern is repeated at the transition to university education. These results are true for many immigrant categories in both England and Sweden, although immigrant students are a heterogeneous group. Black Caribbean students in England and children of Turkish and South American descent in Sweden fare worst, while several Asian groups do extremely well. The authors conclude that it may be a generic feature of choice-driven school systems in Western societies to benefit non-European immigrants, and they discuss some possible explanations for this.
Differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic families in social capital and child development: First-year findings from an experimental study;Disadvantages faced by Hispanic children in the U.S.. compared to non-Hispanic Whites, have been widely reported. Economic differences account for some of the gaps, but the social isolation of Hispanic families also serves as a barrier to children's success. Whereas Hispanic families tend to have strong kinship networks, their social ties often do not encompass the school and other authority systems. As a result. Hispanic families may have less access to social capital, that is, relations of trust and shared expectations that foster the flow of relevant information and support social norms that contribute to children's academic and social development. To study the role of social capital in child development, we embarked on a school-randomized trial in two cities with large Hispanic populations: San Antonio. Texas. and Phoenix. Arizona. In this paper, we report on first-year data from what will be a three-year longitudinal study, including 24 of an eventual 52 schools and about 1300 of what will be a sample of over 3000 children. We aimed to manipulate social capital through an intervention called Families and Schools Together (FAST), a multi-family after-school program that enhances relations among families, between parents and schools, and between parents and children through a sequence of structured activities over 8 weekly sessions. In the first year. 12 schools were randomly assigned to participate in FAST, and 12 served as controls. Data come from district administrative records, surveys of parents prior to FAST, and surveys of parents and teachers immediately after FAST. Surveys prior to FAST confirm that Hispanic parents have less extensive parent-school networks compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Comparisons of school means on post-FAST surveys indicate that parents in FAST schools experience more extensive social networks than those in control schools, but the differences are much more apparent in Phoenix than in San Antonio. Similarly, a pattern of better behavioral outcomes for children in FAST schools is evident in Phoenix but not San Antonio. Individual-level comparisons suggest that for some outcomes, effects may be larger for non-Hispanic Whites than for Hispanics, which would undermine potential contributions to reducing inequality.

A comparative analysis of the efficiency of national education systems;"The present study assesses the performance of 54 participating countries in PISA 2006. It employs efficiency indicators that relate result variables with resource variables used in the production of educational services. Desirable outputs of educational achievement and undesirable outputs of educational inequality are considered jointly as result variables. A construct that captures the quality and quantity of educational resources consumed is used as resource variables. Similarly, environmental variables of each educational system are included in the efficiency evaluation model; while these resources are not controllable by the managers of the education systems, they do affect outcomes. We find that European countries are characterized by weak management, the Americans (mainly Latin Americans) by a weak endowment of resources, and the Asians by a high level of heterogeneity. In particular, Asia combines countries with optimal systems (South Korea and Macao-China); countries with managerial problems (Hong Kong, China-Taipei, Japan and Israel); others where the main challenge is the weak endowment of resources (Jordan and Kyrgyzstan), and, finally, others where the main problem is in the long run since it concerns structural conditions of a socioeconomic and cultural nature (Turkey, Thailand, and Indonesia)."
A comparative study of educational inequality in the risk of stillbirth in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden 1981-2000;Background The stillbirth rates in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are among the lowest in the world, but socioeconomic disparities in stillbirth still exist. This study examined the educational patterns in the risk of stillbirth in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden from 1981 to 2000. Methods From the national birth registries, all singleton live births and stillbirths with a gestational age of at least 28 weeks were selected in Denmark (n=1 182 888), Finland (n=419 729), Norway (n=1 006 767) and Sweden (n=1 974 101). The births were linked with individual data on parental socioeconomic factors from various national registers. Linear and logistic regression were used to calculate RR and risk differences for stillbirth according to maternal educational attainment. Results The risk of stillbirth was lowest in Finland and highest in Denmark. The risk decreased over time in Denmark, Norway and Finland, but remained stable in Sweden. Educational gradients were found in all countries in all time periods under study. In Denmark, the gradient remained stable over time. In Norway the gradient decreased slightly during the 1990s, whereas the gradient increased in Sweden. The gradient in Finland was relatively stable. Conclusions There were persisting educational inequalities in stillbirth in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in the 1980s and 1990s. Inequalities were stable or decreasing except in Sweden, where an increase in inequality was observed. This increase was not solely attributable to a decreasing absolute risk of stillbirth as both the relative and absolute measures of inequality increased.
Early transitions and tertiary enrolment: The cumulative impact of primary and secondary effects on entering university in Germany;Our aim is to assess how the number of working-class students entering German universities can effectively be increased. Therefore, we estimate the proportion of students from the working class that would successfully enter university if certain policy interventions were in place to eliminate primary effects (performance differentials between social classes) and/or secondary effects (choice differentials net of performance) at different transition points. We extend previous research by analysing the sequence of transitions between elementary school enrolment and university enrolment and by accounting for the impact that manipulations at earlier transitions have on the performance distribution and size of the student 'risk-set' at subsequent transitions. To this end, we develop a novel simulation procedure which seeks to find viable solutions to the shortcomings in the German data landscape. Our findings show that interventions are most effective if they take place early in the educational career. Neutralizing secondary effects at the transition to upper secondary school proves to be the single most effective means of increasing participation rates in tertiary education among working-class students. However, this comes at the expense of lower average performance levels.
Educational Inequality by Race in Brazil, 1982-2007: Structural Changes and Shifts in Racial Classification;Despite overwhelming improvements in educational levels and opportunity during the past three decades, educational disadvantages associated with race still persist in Brazil. Using the nationally representative Pesquisa Nacional de Amostra por Domicilio (PNAD) data from 1982 and 1987 to 2007, this study investigates educational inequalities between white, pardo (mixed-race), and black Brazilians over the 25-year period. Although the educational advantage of whites persisted during this period, I find that the significance of race as it relates to education changed. By 2007, those identified as blacks and pardos became more similar in their schooling levels, whereas in the past, blacks had greater disadvantages. I test two possible explanations for this shift: structural changes and shifts in racial classification. I find evidence for both. I discuss the findings in light of the recent race-based affirmative action policies being implemented in Brazilian universities.
Intervening in Alienation: The Outcomes for Urban Youth of Participating in School Activism;This article investigates whether school activism diminishes the alienation that accompanies urban youths' observations of unequal educational conditions, and often leads to underachievement and school rejection. The study is based on interviews with 13 urban youth about their participation in a community-based program that supports education organizing. Findings reveal that school activism is a promising intervention that encourages more constructive responses to schooling. However, the opportunity to participate in school activism was more influential for students who were already integrated into school life and initially felt less acutely alienated. Implications for enhancing the prevalence of success among urban students are considered.
Analysis on Inter-provincial Disparities of China's Urban Education and Convergence;Regional coordinated development of education is the reflection on educational justice and equality. Uncoordinated educational development among provinces in China has become one of significant issues of regional development. Therefore, after estimating the urban average years of schooling and education Gini coefficients of 31 provinces beside Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan from 2001 to 2008, this article in addition applies the method of Economic Convergence to analyze inter-provincial disparities of urban education and the convergence. Research results show that: after the investment system reform of compulsory education, from 2001 to 2008, the provinces' education development and education equity have been improved. Inter-provincial disparity of the education development shows beta convergence. Regional economic differences also have a greater influence on education development disparities, while educational inequality differences are mainly due to the existing educational fairness.
Comparing Concepts of Ethnicity in Ethnic Composition Measures: Local Community Contexts and the Educational Attainment of the Second Generation in Belgium;This study examines the relation between the ethnic composition of municipalities and the secondary-school completion of the second generation of Italian, Moroccan and Turkish origin and of the Belgian majority. Drawing on random samples from the Belgian census and on contextual data at the level of municipalities, we use multilevel models to compare two competing concepts and measures of ethnic composition. The percentage of ethnic minorities in a municipality is found to be negatively related to secondary-school completion among Belgians, but not among ethnic minorities. In contrast, a positive association is found for the percentage of co-ethnics for all groups. Compared to measures of socio-economic composition, however, ethnic composition measures are more weakly associated with school completion. The findings are discussed in light of research on neighbourhood effects, in particular ethnic density effects. We argue that combining different ethnic groups into one measure of ethnic minority concentration, though relevant for the majority population, glosses over crucial ethnic differences from the perspective of ethnic minorities.
Teachers' Perceptions of Gender Discrimination on Elementary School Coursebooks;"Problem Statement: Coursebooks have great impacts on students' sexist attitudes in the years to come. Texts and pictures are carved into students' minds and in this way students' behaviour is shaped. The coursebooks can help to create a more egalitarian social structure and can serve to combat sexism; on the other hand, they can serve to uphold existing sexist patterns and reproduce new ones. In that sense, it can be said that contents in the coursebooks serve to maintain and reproduce sexist attitudes and patriarchy. Purpose of Study: The purpose of this study is to determine whether the pictures in the primary school coursebooks are suitable for gender equality; moreover this study aims to show whether there is gender discrimination in the coursebooks and in the educational environment from the perception of the teachers. Methods: This study is descriptive and data has been collected through content analysis and survey study. In the first section, all first five years of primary education coursebooks were examined in terms of the pictures, with their main and secondary characters, in terms of the company of all individuals, and in terms of the activities in which they are involved concerning gender. In the second section of the study, the survey was applied to the teachers of primary school in order to learn their perceptions on the gender equality of the educational environment. Findings and Results: Pictures were found in the textbooks, which could cause extensive sexism. Boys are depicted alone and dealing with managerial jobs while girls are mostly portrayed with their mothers and dealing with the housework. It was found that both male and female teachers perceive sexism in the social structure. However, there are significant differences between the perceptions of male and female teachers. Conclusions and Recommendations: In the primary schools the coursebooks were found to have gender inequality. Boys are mostly indicated alone in public places, with the outdoors and being away from home representing personality traits such as independence, autonomy, self-reliance, and courage. It was also determined that the young teachers are more sensitive to sexism. The Ministry of National Education should revise the coursebooks and correct the text and images."
The importance of teaching: pedagogical constraints and possibilities in working-class schools;"This paper starts from the propositions that (a) pedagogy is central to the achievement of socially just education and (b) there are existing pedagogical approaches that can contribute to more socially just outcomes. Given the ostensible commitments of the current English Government to reducing educational inequality and to the importance of teaching, we set out to explore the conditions that would need to be put in place to enable these approaches to be developed and sustained consistently in disadvantaged schools in England. We start by analysing classroom observation and interview data from four primary schools with contrasting socio-economic composition, highlighting the different pedagogical practices that emerge in working-and middle-class schools and also in working-class schools in different circumstances. Interviews with pupils show the impact of these practices on learner identities. We then draw on a variety of literatures on school composition, markets, leadership and teacher identities to present an account of the ways in which these different pedagogies are consciously or unconsciously produced. We point to systemic constraints: a mismatch between student demands and organisational capacity; teachers' attitudes and professional identities and performative pressures on school leaders. All of these suggest the need for fundamental reforms to educational purposes and system architecture, rather than the naive reliance on teacher agency to transform educational outcomes. Nevertheless, the current policy environment in England does offer some possibilities for action and we close the paper with some suggestions about ways in which capacity for more socially just pedagogy could be built within English schools."
Learning in a Burning House: Educational Inequality, Ideology, and (Dis) integration;
Ethnic inequalities in education: second-generation Russians in Estonia;This paper investigates ethnic educational inequality in Estonia focusing on second-generation Russians. In Estonia, contrary to many other European countries, the overall educational attainment of second-generation immigrants has, compared to their parents, diverged from the educational attainment of the native population. Our results from logistic regression analysis indicate that the odds of Russians continuing in general secondary and higher education are lower compared to native Estonians. Parental economic, cultural, and host country specific resources do not account for ethnic differences in educational transition. Adolescents' own language proficiency and citizenship have a strong impact on educational decisions. We conclude that the Estonian education system contributes to the emergence of ethnic differences. While basic and secondary schools function in either the Estonian or Russian languages, the curricula in public higher education institutions are taught mainly in Estonian, which might lower expectations of success amongst Russian adolescents.
Attitudes and expectations: do attitudes towards education mediate the relationship between social networks and parental expectations?;Previous international research has shown that educational goals are fundamental for explaining differences in the educational attainment between individuals. For a better understanding of educational inequality, it is therefore crucial to know more about the mechanisms leading to different expectations. Our paper contributes to this field of research by empirically testing how social networks affect educational expectations of mothers for their children. Furthermore, we try to disentangle the underlying mechanisms by investigating which role resources and attitudes within social networks play in influencing educational expectations. We use quantitative data gathered in three federal states in Germany. The key results indicate that network composition not only has an effect on educational expectations but also on general attitudes towards education. Both attitudes towards education and embedded resources seem to mediate the effect of social ties on educational expectations.
Macro-Political Determinants of Educational Inequality between Migrants and Natives in Western Europe;This paper analyses how macro-societal conditions determine educational inequality between migrants and natives in the Western EU member states. The education system, with its ability to integrate young immigrants, is often seen as the foundation for successful integration in later curricular stages. By means of linear hierarchical models, this paper demonstrates that EU standards of good practice in integration policy are ineffective in producing equal educational opportunities for immigrant pupils. Educational inequality between migrants and natives is mainly a result of the political-institutional settings. The paper thus rejects the widely held belief that consensus democracies are in fact kinder and gentler. By contrast, the analyses reveal that majoritarian democracies are more effective in equalising educational opportunities between immigrants and natives.
School choice with Chinese characteristics;This paper explores the major characteristics of school choice in the Chinese context. It highlights the involvement of cultural and economic capital, such as choice fees, donations, prize-winning certificates and awards in gaining school admission, as well as the use of social capital in the form of guanxi. The requirement for these resources in order to be successful in the positional competition for admission to key schools has greatly advantaged children from middle class families. Schools and local governments cash in on school choice fever in order to obtain significant economic returns. The current school choice process creates winners among some of the parties involved: school places for selected students, and additional funds for schools and local governments. However, the practice exacerbates the educational inequality that already exists in society.
Growing gaps: educational inequality around the world;
The production of urban educational space;It is widely recognised that large urban centres exhibit significant and enduring patterns of educational inequality. This paper explores the social production of urban educational space. In particular, it argues that since these patterns are geographical, it will be useful to revisit the emergence of an 'urban crisis' in education and attempts, by geographers, in the 1970s and 1980s, to explain spatial differences in educational attainment. For much of the past two decades, educational policy has tended to adopt an 'a-spatial' approach, and the final part of the paper looks forward to the prospect of an updated and culturally informed analysis of education in cities.
English immersion and educational inequality in South Korea;This article explores what immersion English education means in South Korea (henceforth Korea) and examines various related educational practices. The proposal for English immersion from the Presidential Transition Committee of the Lee administration in early 2008 has highlighted immersion education in Korea. Ironically, since the committee's withdrawal of the plan, Korea has seen a rise in 'English immersion' education in different programme formats. This article proposes a modified typology for immersion education in English as a foreign language context. It surveys various English immersion programmes offered both in private and public venues in Korea and analyses the widely differing practices in English immersion education based on the contextual and structural characteristics of these English immersion programmes. It also examines key research findings regarding immersion education in Korea. Finally, this article demonstrates how immersion education contributes to sustaining and strengthening an 'English divide' between children of wealthy parents and those from lower income families.
Growing Gaps: Educational Inequality Around the World;
The discovery of youth's learning potential: The influence of teacher recommendation and parental decision;Social disparities in education have been investigated for a long time. Children of lower social background do not have the same chances of educational success compared to their counterparts from upper social strata, even after cognitive ability is controlled for. My focus of analysis is on disparities regarding the transformation of cognitive ability (i.e. learning potential) into certified academic achievement, based on SOEP data. Adolescents are categorized along two dimensions: social background (academic vs. non-academic) and underachievement status. The impact of teacher recommendation and parental decision on the risk of underachievement is investigated. Both dimensions of the transition process from elementary to secondary schooling significantly influence the risk of underachievement. The issue of equal opportunities is addressed with a special focus on the theory of primary and secondary effects as well as teachers' and parents' decision behaviour.
Welfare regimes and the incentives to work and get educated;This paper examines whether differences in welfare regimes shape the incentives to work and get educated. Using microeconomic data for more than 100 ON European individuals, we show that welfare regimes make a difference for wages and education. First, people-based and household-based effects (internal returns to education, and household wage and education externalities) generate socioeconomic incentives for people to get an education and work which are stronger in countries with the weakest welfare systems, that is, those with what is known as 'residual' welfare regimes (Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal). Second, place-based effects and, more specifically, differences in regional wage per capita and educational endowment and in regional interpersonal income and educational inequality, also influence wages and education in different ways across welfare regimes. Place-based effects have the greatest impact in the Nordic social-democratic welfare systems. The results are robust to the inclusion of a large number of people-based and place-based controls.
European Capitalist Welfare Societies: The Challenge of Sustainability;
Bringing the schools back in: the stratification of educational achievement in the Chilean voucher system;This paper analyzes the socioeconomic stratification of achievement in the Chilean voucher system using a census of 4th and 8th graders, a multilevel methodology, and accounting for unobserved selectivity into school sector. Findings indicate that the association between the school's aggregate family socioeconomic status (SES) and test scores is much greater in the private-voucher sector than in the public one, resulting in marked socioeconomic stratification of test scores in the Chilean voucher system. We also find that the amount of tuition fees paid by parents in private-voucher schools has no bearing on test scores, after controlling for the socioeconomic makeup of the school. Implications of these findings for educational inequality in the context of a universal voucher system are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
The Household Registration System and Rural-Urban Educational Inequality in Contemporary China;This article examines the effect on educational inequality in contemporary China of the household registration (hukou) system, based on which Chinese citizens were designated as having either rural or urban status and entitled to different life chances. Analyses of data from a national representative survey in 2005 consistently reveal a significant educational gap between people of different hukou status, even after controlling for other covariates. Furthermore, to rule out the selectivity effect of hukou assignment based on education, endogenous switching regression models are employed to demonstrate a causal impact of hukou status on educational attainment. The article thus calls for attention to be paid to the hukou institution in studying educational stratification and the reassessment of the role of the socialist state in generating social inequality in contemporary China.
Educational Expansion and Social Inequality: Increase, Decline or Persistence of Unequal Opportunities. A Matter of Perspective?;Despite educational expansion and institutional differentiation, Germany shows rather high levels of social selectivity. Although new institutional pathways into higher education have emerged in the course of educational expansion, it is unclear whether this has contributed to an inclusion of more students from less privileged families. In the light of these changing opportunities this paper deals with the question of how social inequality in access to higher levels of education has developed over the last few decades. These developments are discussed from both a theoretical and a methodological perspective. Using a combination of two large-scale datasets, we present a novel approach to this issue. Our findings suggest different developments of inequality depending on the different transitions from primary to secondary education. While social selectivity in access to upper secondary education has declined, differences in the transition from upper secondary to tertiary education have increased. In sum, both developments counterbalance each other. The results also indicate that it is a methodological question whether one finds increasing or decreasing inequality: Our absolute measure of social inequality indicates persistent inequality, whereas our relative measure indicates decreasing inequality.
Gender-specific educational inequality;
Increasing educational inequality in preterm birth in Quebec, Canada, 1981-2006;Background Few studies have evaluated the relationship between preterm birth (PTB) and maternal education over time. We sought to determine whether educational inequalities in PTB have increased in Quebec, Canada. Methods The authors analysed 2 124 909 singleton live births from 1981 to 2006, and computed the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and Slope Index of Inequality (SII) with 95% CIs for the relationship between maternal education and extreme, very or moderate PTB (<= 27, 28-31, and 32-36 completed weeks of gestation, respectively) for five periods (1981-1985, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2006), adjusting for maternal age, marital status, birthplace, language spoken at home, parity and infant sex. Results Average rates of extreme and moderate PTB increased over time but decreased for very PTB. A statistically significant increase in the RII over time was present for extreme and moderate PTB. The adjusted RII for extreme PTB increased from 1.58 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.01) in 1981-1985 to 3.11 (95% CI 2.54 to 3.81) in 2001-2006. For moderate PTB, the corresponding RIIs were 1.53 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.61) and 1.91 (95% CI 1.81 to 2.01). Absolute differences in the PTB proportion between the least and most educated mothers increased from 1981 to 2006 for extreme (adjusted SII 0.11% vs 0.28%) and moderate PTB (adjusted SII 1.67% vs 3.11%). Absolute differences in the proportion very PTB did not increase. Conclusions Relative and absolute educational inequalities in extreme and moderate PTB have increased over time in Quebec. Relative increases were largest for extreme PTB, and absolute increases were largest for moderate PTB.
How institutional context alters social reproduction dynamics: Ethnic track placement patterns in the U.S. and Germany;"How does institutional context shape the way family dynamics, especially ethnic background and parental resources. affect track placement? We contrast the track placement patterns of immigrants and ethnic majority students in two countries marked by drastic differences in the social organization of schooling. Drawing on German (GSOEP) and U.S. (NELS) data, we find that, in general, more family resources pull students from lower to higher tracks, but ethnic inequalities in these resources favor the ethnic majority groups in both countries. In addition, institutional context conditions which parental resources shape educational outcomes, and how they do so. We find that the effects of parental ties exacerbate ethnic inequalities between whites and Latinos in the U.S.; whereas in Germany, parents' community ties play a compensatory role for immigrants, who benefit from interactions with secular and ethno-religious groups. Our findings confirm previous cross-national research, but they also highlight the need to elaborate the relationship between institutional context and ethnically specific reproduction mechanisms within countries.

Racial differences in high school dropout rates: An analysis of U.S. Metropolitan areas;In this paper, we explore the differences in high school dropout rates among white, black and Hispanic students in 275 U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in 2000. Our analysis focuses on the impact of community and labor market conditions, in hopes of providing insight into the relationship between place and educational outcomes. The explanatory power of our regression models is mixed across racial groups, performing best for whites and Hispanics. Our results also indicate that community factors - most importantly, same-race adult educational attainment in the community, teenage birth rates and residential stability - have a greater impact on dropout rates than labor market factors. Our results suggest that as education reform moves toward broad-based solutions to improve student outcomes including dropout rates, it will be increasingly important to address the structural origins of inequality outside of schools.

Schools and the Diversity Transition in the Wealthy Societies of the West;The rich countries of the West are facing a diversity transition that will unfold in the next several decades. The transition means that these societies will depend increasingly on individuals who have grown up in immigrant homes to maintain economic, social, and cultural vitality. This situation turns a spotlight on educational systems, which are crucial to preparing the children from low-status immigrant families to participate in the institutions of the mainstream. The educational gaps between native- and immigrant-origin children in France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States raise concerns about the performance of systems with very different characteristics. Yet all is not hopeless: Some modest policies seem to bring amelioration, and each system can learn from others.
The cognitive exclusion of young immigrants in comparative perspective - The role of institutions and social structure;The degree of ethnic educational inequality varies across countries, as international educational surveys have shown. Previous studies suggest that institutional and societal characteristics of destination countries partly account for this variance. The article builds upon these recent findings and upon hypotheses with regard to the relationship between welfare states and immigration and integration processes. It is assumed that two different societal dimensions, namely egality and diversity of the destination countries structure educational decisions of immigrants. Thus, at least partly, the individual control has its educational success revoked. This is why this article speaks of a process of cognitive exclusion. With data from PISA 2003 and 2006 we examine the effects of welfare state institutions and diversity of host countries on individual educational success by applying multilevel regressions. The results show that strong welfare states reduce the individual risk of cognitive exclusion, contradicting common moral hazard assumptions.
Mapping the European regional educational distribution;The geography of education, especially at subnational level, is a huge black box. Little is known about the distribution of educational attainment and inequality across regions in Europe. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by mapping educational attainment and inequality in 102 regions in Western Europe, using data extracted from the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) covering more than 100,000 individuals over the period 1995-2000. The results of this Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) reveal a strong correlation between levels of educational attainment and inequality across regions in Europe. Regions with similar educational conditions tend to cluster, often within national borders. In addition, a North-South and an urban-rural dimension are evident. Northern regions and large European metropoli have not only the most-educated labour force but also the lowest levels of inequality. Educational inequality seems to be, in any case, a fundamentally within-region phenomenon: 90 percent of the educational inequality in Europe occurs among individuals living in the same region.
'Geography matters': the role distance plays in reproducing educational inequality in East London;There is a longstanding literature on the unequal geographical distribution of welfare. In this paper we argue that increasingly geography is becoming the basis for rationing access to some forms of welfare. Focusing on access to secondary schools in East London, England, where the demand for places at the more popular schools generally far exceeds the number of places available, we show how distance from school has now become the primary means of allocating places. Rather than educational resources attempting to compensate for geographical disadvantage, geography (in the form of distance from school) has become the rationale by which those living in advantaged areas continue to have privileged access to educational resources. Whereas previously the role of the state was to compensate for the unfairness of such geographical inequalities, geography (via distance to school) is now used to justify the unequal allocation of scarce school places. The paper demonstrates that not only does the near universal adoption of distance-based allocation policies in East London lead to the reproduction of social advantage and disadvantage, but also it is creating new hierarchies of school popularity and more important unpopularity which are not always clearly related to issues of school attainment.
Paradoxes and Pitfalls in Using Fuzzy Set QCA: Illustrations from a Critical Review of a Study of Educational Inequality;Charles Ragin's crisp set and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA and fsQCA) are being used by increasing numbers of social scientists interested in combining analytic rigour with case-based approaches. As with all techniques that become available in easy-to-use software packages, there is a danger that QCA will come to be used in a routinised manner, with not enough attention being paid to its particular strengths and weaknesses. Users of fsQCA in particular need to be very aware of particular problems that can arise when fuzzy logic lies behind their analyses. This paper aims to increase its readers' understanding of some of these problems and of some means by which they might be alleviated. We use a critical discussion of a recent paper by Freitag and Schlicht addressing social inequality in education in Germany as our vehicle. After summarising the substantive claims of the paper, we explain some key features of QCA. We subsequently discuss two main issues, (i) limited diversity and the various ways of using counterfactual reasoning to address it, and (ii) the logical paradoxes that can arise when using fsQCA. Making different choices than Freitag and Schlicht do in respect of dealing with these two issues, we undertake some reanalysis of their data, showing that their conclusions must be treated with some caution. We end by drawing some general lessons for users of QCA.
Geography, uneven development and distributive justice: the political economy of IT growth in India;The aim of the paper is to apply a political economy framework both to explain the rise of the information technology (IT) industry and to analyse the spatial and developmental consequences of this growth, especially the distributive dimension on the wider society. The purpose is also to reveal the contradictions associated with the industry, question the crude optimism surrounding the IT sector's transformative capabilities, and by extension, assess the 'model' of development implicit with its growth trajectory. As there is class bias in the workings of the sector, which excludes large swathes of the population and reproduces educational inequality, policy implications are briefly discussed.
Examining racial differences in the effect of popular sports participation on academic achievement;Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, this study employs propensity score modeling to measure the effects of participation in varsity football (among men) and varsity basketball (among men and women) in the 10th grade on students' CPAs and math test scores in the twelfth grade. This study also investigates whether the effect of sports participation on student achievement differs between black and white students. The results show that participation in varsity football negatively affects the 12th grade GPAs of black, but not white, men but does not affect the math test scores of either of these subgroups. Moreover, varsity basketball participation leads to higher GPAs in the 12th grade among white, but not black, women. Implications of the different operationalizations of sports participation, the investigation of different student subpopulations, and the different methods of analysis are discussed.

Citizenship or Immigrant Background? A Comparison of Differing Operationalizations with Respect to Educational Attainment;To date, it has been difficult to gauge and compare the effects of different operationalizations of immigrant origins in the German context. The 2005 microcensus provides an unprecedented opportunity to address this issue. In this paper, we first take a look at the typical operationalization of immigrant origins and generation status. Subsequently, we show that differing proportions of the total population can be identified as immigrants and their descendants depending on the operationalization used, whereby the greatest discrepancies are found in the younger age groups. Divergent findings also emerge when information on group membership is combined with information on generation status. Similar effects of different types of operationalization can be identified in multivariate analyses of educational attainment. Once ethnic German repatriates from Central and Eastern Europe (the so-called Spataussiedler) are identified separately in the records, we observe changes in the findings for the remaining respondents from Russia and Poland. Generation status turns out to be important as well, since it reveals the contrasting educational patterns of the first and second generation. At the same time, one of the key messages of previous research is not affected by different types of operationalization: when considering characteristics of social background immigrants' educational disadvantages disappear and sometimes initial disadvantages even turn into benefits.
Contextualizing Ethnic Educational Inequality: The Role of Stability and Quality of Neighborhoods and Ethnic Density in Second-Generation Attainment;This study examines the joint impact of neighborhood structure and ethnic density on the educational attainment of the second generation. Using second-generation samples and a majority reference sample from the Belgian Census, multi-level analysis yields the expected positive effects of neighborhood stability and quality and ethnic density on second-generation school completion. Reflecting the ethnic stratification of the Belgian housing market, majority residential concentration tends to coincide with high neighborhood stability and quality and high completion rates, whereas Moroccan concentrations overlap with low neighborhood quality, and low completion rates. For the Turkish and Italian second generation, neighborhood structure moderates ethnic density effects on school completion, in line with segmented assimilation. Our findings suggest distinct Moroccan, Turkish and Italian incorporation modes which reflect differential access to, and investments in ethnic versus mainstream social networks.
Decomposing primary and secondary effects: A new decomposition method;One strand of educational inequality research aims at decomposing the effect of social class origin on educational choices into primary and secondary effects. We formalize this distinction and present a new and simple method that allows empirical assessment of the relative magnitudes of primary and secondary effects. Contrary to other decomposition methods, this new method is unbiased, is more intuitive, and decomposes effects of both discrete and continuous measures of social origin. The method also provides analytically derived statistical tests and is easily calculated with standard statistical software. We give examples using the Danish Longitudinal Survey of Youth.

Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Collegiate Cognitive Gains: A Multilevel Analysis of Institutional Influences on Learning and its Equitable Distribution;Although numerous studies have examined racial/ethnic inequalities in collegiate student outcomes, serious attention to disparities in post-secondary student learning has emerged only recently. Using a national sample of 35,000 college seniors and 250 diverse institutions from the Collegiate Learning Assessment, this study investigates the role of institutional characteristics in promoting the development of higher-order cognitive skills and the equitable distribution of these skills by student racial/ethnic background. Using three-level hierarchical linear models within an analysis of covariance framework, we find that the initial academic gaps that separate African American students from their white peers widen even further during college. Although substantial academic disparities exist between Hispanic and white students at both college entry and exit, Hispanic and white students gain academic skills at statistically comparable rates. Importantly, racial/ethnic differences in cognitive development vary across institutions partly as a function of institutional characteristics. In particular, even after accounting for a host of student- and institution-level characteristics, African American/white and Hispanic/white inequalities are somewhat smaller at colleges that enroll larger proportions of non-white students. However, these benefits of increased minority enrollments are contingent upon the academic backgrounds of students' peers, with academically weaker student enrollments in some cases negating the benefits of increased racial/ethnic diversity.
Eco-Apartheid: Linking Environmental Health to Educational Outcomes;Background/Context: The issue of how to achieve a racially diverse student population has become increasingly challenging since a 2007 U. S. Supreme Court split decision endorsed the importance of creating diverse schools, while simultaneously limiting the assignment to public schools based on an individual student's race or ethnicity. The article examines innovative efforts at achieving racial integration in Berkeley, California, as well as other district efforts in New York City, to curtail the dangers associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in school building materials and develop plans to remediate contaminated school buildings. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: In this article, the author draws on the disciplines of environmental sociology, critical race theory, and social epidemiology to examine the relationship between school desegregation, environmental inequality, structural racialization, and health and educational outcomes. The author proposes a conceptual framework for linking environmental health to educational outcomes that considers the dynamic social processes through which social and environmental inequalities-and associated health and educational disparities-are produced, reproduced, and transformed. Setting: Berkeley Unified School District has achieved substantial integration in a city where neighborhoods are polarized by racial-ethnic, socioeconomic status, and environmental inequality. Moreover, the Berkeley integration plan was upheld in 2009 by the state appellate court, a decision that the California Supreme Court allowed to stand. As a result, the Berkeley Unified School District's plan to maintain diversity could serve as a national model for other public schools that are seeking constitutionally sound desegregation programs. Research Design: Using empirical evidence from the published literature, as well as the author's own practical experience conducting community-based participatory research in Berkeley, the author applies the eco-apartheid conceptual framework to the city of Berkeley. Conclusions/Recommendations: The eco-apartheid framework provides a useful model for theory building in the study of environmental health and educational equity. Moreover, the author recommends that theories of racial and educational inequality in general would benefit from a more serious consideration of the role that environmental inequalities play in structuring the relationship between health and educational inequality. Additionally, the author highlights the ways in which existing research on desegregation remains in need of theoretical strength and methodological rigor with respect to environmental inequality.
Educational Inequality in Turkey: An Evaluation by Gini Index;This study aims to determine the relationship between educational inequality and the average year of schooling in Turkey. The data was the content of the 2000 General Census of Population: Social and Economic Characteristics of Population. To determine inequalities in education, average year of schooling of 25 year olds and above and the education Gini index were calculated. Average year of schooling in Turkey in all regions increased during the period of 1975-2000 while inequality in education decreased. A negative relationship was found between average year of schooling and educational Gini index. A positive relationship was found between the rates of increase in average year of schooling and decrease in the education Gini index.
Why Parents Pay for College: The Good Parent, Perceptions of Advantage, and the Intergenerational Transfer of Opportunity;This article asks how parents think about the cost of a college education for their children. Based on data from more than ninety in-depth interviews with upper-middle-class parents and children, it is clear that grooming children for college and then paying for their education is intimately linked with ideas about being a good parent. We present data on three related aspects of parents' consciousness about paying for college. First, data are presented on how parents view the benefits of college for their children. Second, data illustrate how parents think about the obligations associated with paying. Third, we report on what parents expect in return for their efforts and expenditures. Data also indicate that parents' views are contingent on their perceived ability to pay for the increasing costs of higher education. We conclude by considering how the implicit contract between upper-middle-class parents and children may change as new economic and structural uncertainties increase parents' anxieties and challenge their abilities to see themselves as good parents.
Conceptual and methodological innovations in research into educational inequalities;This paper provides a survey of the key thematic and methodological milestones in research into educational inequalities. The article focuses on authors and concepts that introduced major innovations and contributed to significant advancements in the analysis and knowledge of educational inequalities. We have distinguished three periods, focusing on two key concepts in each. The first period is represented by the basic model of the process of stratification and the social-psychological model. The second period includes the educational allocation concept and the theory of maximally maintained inequality (MMI). Finally, the third period is described on the grounds of the multinomial transition model and the theory of effectively maintained inequality (EMI). Across these development stages, three of the above-mentioned concepts are presented as breakthrough methodological innovations while another three concepts are viewed as thematic (interpretational) innovations, closely linked to the development of quantitative methods used to analyse educational inequalities.
How Policies of Priority Education Shape Educational Needs: New Fabrications and Contradictions;This article aims to interpret how different policies of priority education deal with the notions of educational needs and educational inequalities. Indeed, it is the processes and mechanisms embedded in the deployment of such policies that ultimately model a category of educational need that goes beyond the conceptualization of educational inequality used to justify the policies themselves. The authors reach this conclusion by examining four European programs of priority education (PPE). Two basic tendencies are identified. On the one hand, recent deployment of the English and French initiatives seems to be altering the formulation of problems they are designed to address by enhancing in practice a decontextualized notion of individual educational need in which it is considered legitimate to intervene. On the other hand, the Catalan and Dutch programs, which theoretically address both territorial and nonformal educational inequalities, in fact apply prioritization schemes and interventions mainly based on school-based social measures.
Social disparities in children's vocabulary in early childhood. Does pre-school education help to close the gap?;Children start school with differing levels of skills. Thus, children of different social origin have different probabilities of educational success right from the start of their school career. This paper analyses how the gap in language abilities of children with different social backgrounds develops from age three to five. A focus lies on the question whether pre-school education can help to close this gap. The data of the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) show that children's score on a standardized vocabulary test strongly depends on their parents' education. These social differences remain stable or even increase slightly over the two-year period. Using fixed effect models, it is demonstrated that children of higher educated parents can improve their vocabulary more strongly than children whose parents have a lower educational level. Participation in an early education institution positively affects the vocabulary development of children with lower educated parents while there is no significant pre-school effect for children of higher educated parents. The results indicate that pre-school attendance does not lead to a catching-up process of children with lower educated parents. But without pre-school attendance, the gap between children of higher and lower educated parents widens even further.
The power of positional competition and market mechanism: an empirical study of parental choice of junior middle school in Nanning, PR China;"School choice has been actively exercised by mostly middle class parents and 'key' schools in many places in China, each obtaining what they want: school places and funds, respectively. The aims of this study were to explore the impact of positional competition in school choice and explore the effect of market mechanisms in the resulting school choice process. There has been little empirical research into school choice in China and this represents a first step. A descriptive survey was distributed to 224 parents from one 'key' school and 206 of whom returned the form. Follow-up interviews with eight parents and the headteacher of the sample school were conducted. The 68% of the school choice participants were professionals and public servants; the income of 69% of the participants is above or well above the average income of the locals; 61% of the participants indicated they had or were expected to spend over (sic)30,000 for their child's three-year study; 79% of the participants had spent (sic)3000-15,000 for their child's after-school activities. The results of the study suggest that the most active participants of school choice are the middle class parents and the key schools. The substantial amount of choice fee has either created a financial burden on those working class families or effectively closed the door of school choice to them."
Vestiges of Desegregation: Superintendent Perspectives on Educational Inequality and (Dis)Integration in the Post-Civil Rights Era;The purpose of this article is to extend the growing counternarrative in education research concerning the negative consequences of school desegregation and its implications for urban education, educational leadership, and policy reform in the post-Civil Rights Era. Guided by qualitative and historical research methods, this article presents the perspectives of eight retired Black school superintendents concerning the goal of integration during the civil rights movement and its disintegration in contemporary urban contexts. Findings reveal that despite desegregation efforts, schools and school systems have never truly integrated and now face a 21st-century brand of educational inequality, what I describe in this article as vestiges of desegregation, which further undermine the educational opportunities and experiences of those students school desegregation efforts were arguably intended to serve.
Studying together, living apart: Emerging geographies of school attendance in post-apartheid Cape Town;Desegregation of South African schools is creating new geographies of education. Parental choice of school in the context of continuing spatial inequalities of educational provision encourages considerable movement of pupils from outside traditional catchment areas, as parents send children to distant schools formerly intended for members of other racial groups. To explore the socio-economic context of such choices, and the costs of making them, this article uses survey data from ten secondary schools with differing apartheid histories, in different socio-economic neighbourhoods, and with differing racial compositions. The findings reveal both the progress made since the end of apartheid and the limitations of change. Pupils travelling to distant schools in white areas appear to be coping well with the potential pressures, but remain a small, largely middle-class minority of black and coloured children, while friendships still appear to be made mainly within rather than across racial groups. Genuine educational choice and class mobility will depend on more fundamental reduction of educational inequality.
Accumulating human capital while increasing educational inequality: a study on higher education policy in China;Since 1999, the expansion of higher education has been viewed as an important step in accumulating human capital for China that was to gradually open its domestic sectors to the global market at a turbulent time at the turn of the century. Recent studies suggest that the improvement of human capital has succeeded in preparing China with a solid platform to weather the economic crisis in recent years. However, these changes have not necessarily favoured the disadvantaged groups or promoted social mobility. This article demonstrates that access to elite universities of prestigious status is not equal for students from different socio-economic backgrounds. An analysis of graduates' starting salaries shows that educational inequality has contributed to income inequality, which is one of the key obstacles to building a harmonious society. Inequality of opportunity in higher education occurred in the context of marketization and localization of higher education, which have been worsening the regional disparity of human capital investment. This article examines the pros and cons of the policy changes, and attempts to draw lessons from the structural problems lingered from the past policies which China has to address in the aftermath of the current economic crisis.
Researching race/ethnicity and educational inequality in the Netherlands: a critical review of the research literature between 1980 and 2008;"This article describes and critically analyzes how educational sociologists in the Netherlands have studied the relationship between race/ethnicity and educational inequality between 1980 and 2008. Five major research traditions are identified: (1) political arithmetic; (2) racism and ethnic discrimination; (3) school characteristics; (4) school choice; and (5) family background. The development of particular research traditions is explained by pointing to more general developments in terms of social policy and intellectual climate in the Netherlands. This study builds on a similar, recently published literature review that focuses on the UK context by critically comparing the development and findings from these different bodies of research literature. The conclusions suggest that the Netherlands, like England, developed strong research traditions in this area of research since the 1980s and that both countries can learn from each other and advance future research in this area by developing more comprehensive research agendas. More generally, this review illustrates the usefulness of conducting nationally comparative literature reviews in assessing the development of particular bodies of research and in bringing together knowledge produced in different national settings."
Disrupting patterns of educational inequality and disadvantage in Malawi;This paper is concerned with the gap in educational provision for vulnerable learners in Malawi who are at risk of falling behind and dropping out of school due to irregular attendance. It draws on a study in high HIV-prevalence areas that explores the patterns of inequality and disadvantage that disrupt learning and uses this knowledge to design a school-based intervention to complement conventional schooling with more open and flexible delivery of the curriculum and increased school and community support. The intervention was implemented over one school year and evaluated using a randomized controlled design. The findings show that the intervention reduced dropout overall by 42% in the intervention compared to the non-intervention group. These findings suggest that there is a role for more open and flexible models of schooling and support in reducing educational inequalities. However, transforming established practice would require an integrated strategy supported by national policies that recognize the need for schools to change.
Examining the Impact of Tracking on Long-Term Student Outcomes;The focus of this chapter is to review the literature dealing with the impact of tracking on long-term student outcomes, such as postsecondary education attainment and earnings potential. As a result, this chapter will examine whether the goals of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1990 have been met: that is, preparing CTE students for the workforce as well as for postsecondary education. This particular legislative initiative is critical since it was the first endeavor to expand the historical goal of preparing students solely for the workforce. The discussion ends with an articulation of future trends for practice and research.
Gender-Class Equality in Political Economies;
Recent Developments in Intergenerational Mobility;Economists and social scientists have long been interested in intergenerational mobility, and documenting the persistence between parents and children's outcomes has been an active area of research. However, since Gary Solon's 1999 Chapter in the Handbook of Labor Economics, the literature has taken an interesting turn. In addition to focusing on obtaining precise estimates of correlations and elasticities, the literature has placed increased emphasis on the causal mechanisms that underlie this relationship. This chapter describes the developments in the intergenerational transmission literature since the 1999 Handbook Chapter. While there have been some important contributions in terms of measurement of elasticities and correlations, we focus primarily on advances in our understanding of the forces driving the relationship and less on the precision of the correlations themselves.
The Determinants of Regional Educational Inequality in Western Europe;This chapter provides an empirical study of the determinants of educational inequality across regions of the EU. Using the European Community Household Panel dataset for 102 regions over the period 1995-2000, it analyses how microeconomic changes in income distribution as well as in educational attainment affect educational inequality. The different static and dynamic panel data analyses conducted reveal the complexity of the interaction between income and education. Educational attainment seems to curb the increase in educational inequality. While the impact of income per capita is unclear, the relationship between income inequality and educational inequality is positive and robust to the model specification. Other results indicate that women's access to work has a negative impact on inequality and that there is an EU North South and urban rural divide. Educational inequality is lower in social-democratic welfare states, in mainly Orthodox areas, and in regions with North/Central family structures. All the results are robust to changes in the definition of income distribution.
Labour market outcomes and their impact on tertiary decisions in Germany: class and gender differences;In order to explain why students choose to enter or abstain from university education, economic theories of educational choice assume that the income returns to a degree are critical in motivating students' educational decisions. However, important group differences between men and women as well as students from different class backgrounds that might influence the relationship between expected returns and educational choice have largely been ignored in this line of research. This article explores how and to what extent changes in income and unemployment returns for graduates influence the educational decisions of students that are eligible to enrol in tertiary education in Germany. A unique dataset from the German Higher Education Information System Institute consisting of large-scale surveys of university qualified students is analysed. Contrary to many previous findings, the results of the article suggest that variations in relative income returns do not seem to affect the educational decisions of school leavers while variation in unemployment seems to have significant effects on postsecondary decisions for women only. Furthermore, female students from lower-class backgrounds appear to be more responsive to changes in unemployment rates than their higher-class peers.
Scottish higher education, 1987-2001: expansion through diversion;A pressing question about the expansion of higher education is whether it tends to be inclusive, in the sense of bringing in larger proportions of persons from disadvantaged backgrounds, or diversifying, in that higher education tends to differentiate as it expands, or both, by bringing more persons into an increasingly stratified system of higher education. This paper addresses the question with evidence on higher education expansion in Scotland. Data are drawn from six waves of the Scottish School Leavers Survey from the late 1980s to the start of the new millennium. Binary and multinomial logit models are estimated to examine changes in inequality during this period, which was characterised by substantial expansion in both secondary qualifications and postsecondary enrolment. The results show that, in contrast to the general pattern of stable inequality observed in most nations, overall social inequalities in Scottish higher education enrolment declined over time. However, this decline did not occur in all sectors but was limited to the lowest-status institutions. These findings illustrate how expansion can serve both inclusive and diversifying ends.
Horizontal Inequalities in Higher Education;This paper aims to answer two questions concerning inequalities in tertiary education. First question concerns the effect of social origin on choice of field of study and the second question concerns the effect of gender. Existing research has demonstrated a significant relation between social background and the field of study. Individuals with more educated parents are more likely to study at prestigious faculties, such as law or medicine. Women are more willing than men to choose humanities and social studies whereas men more often choose technical studies. Will these patterns continue in the face of the rapid increase in number of students which began in Poland in the 1990s? A survey conducted in three state higher-education establishments in Bialystok in 2008 shows that students' choices continue to be affected both by social background and gender. We also found a significant relationship between the field of study and general risk-proneness. These results are explained in terms of three different theories: cultural capital, critical theory, and rational choice.
Intergenerational Reproduction of Educational Inequality: Limits and Opportunities of Democracy;The basic aim of this paper is to address a central question in the sociology of education: school performance and its relationship with family origin. Particular emphasis is laid on analyzing the possible determinants of school success in terms of parents' occupational status and family context. The central hypothesis of this study is that, despite the reduction of social inequality that has occurred in the Spanish educational system as a result of democratization and increased social mobility in recent decades, there are still social inequalities that are reproduced in the educational system, linked with family social origin and social capital. This article reviews sociological theories on the association between family background and educational achievement in order to analyze the extent to which educational attainment differs depending on family context and, more specifically, on parents' education and occupational status. The focus is on Spain in the European comparative context. The discussion is structured around the concept of educational achievement based on parental family background as a form of intergenerational reproduction of educational inequality. The indicators used are obtained from different sources, such as the Pisa Report, In the case of Spain, the data are drawn from the 2008 Youth Institute survey and the 2005 Survey of Living Conditions (module on the intergenerational transmission of poverty). The data presented in this article seem to confirm a clear tendency toward the reproduction of educational inequalities based on intergenerational educational level and parental occupational status. The permanence of this trend throws the supposed democratization of equal educational opportunities in Spain partly into question.
Changes in the Multi-Level Effects of Socio-Economic Status on Reading Achievement in Sweden in 1991 and 2001;This study examines the changes in educational inequality at the school- and individual-levels in 1991 and 2001. Comparisons are made between the IEA Reading Literacy Study 1991 and the so called 10-Year Trend Study in PIRLS 2001. The between-school differences in reading achievement variance and the size of the relationship between SES and reading achievement at school-level are the two main focuses. Applying a two-level structural equation modeling technique, it was found that the between-school differences in reading achievement were greater in RLS 2001 than in RLS 1991, and the school SES effect has been strengthened over time. These changes indicate that educational inequality in Sweden has increased over time. Some possible explanations to these changes are discussed with reference to school reforms and demographic changes.
Intergenerational Educational Fluidity and Its Trends in the Czech Republic between 1990 and 2009;The aim of the article is to identify the trend in educational fluidity in the Czech Republic between 1990 and 2009 and offer an explanation for it. The authors use a series of 28 annual surveys conducted between 1990 and 2009 in the Czech Republic and ascertaining information about the level of education of the respondent and the respondent's father. The authors analyse trends in educational fluidity from a period and birth cohort perspective. The findings show that educational fluidity did not increase in Czech society between 1990 and 2003. From 2004 to 2009 this trend changed and a slight increase in educational fluidity became evident. These changes in educational fluidity are driven by period (by institutional changes) rather than cohort effects (by cohort replacement). Period effect signifies both changes in the effect of class origin on educational attainment (class inequalities in education) and changes in the expansion of the Czech educational system. Both these period effects are presented as a part of the theory of maximally maintained inequality (MMI), which helps explain the changes in educational fluidity in the Czech Republic during the observed period.
Kindergarten and elementary school;The German National Educational Panel Study covers educational processes during Kindergarten and elementary school age in two stages: Kindergarten and transition to elementary school and elementary school and transition to lower secondary school. One cohort covers both of these two stages, starting in winter 2010/2011 with a cluster sample of 3,000 target children at about age 4 in Kindergarten. When most of these children enter school, the cohort will be more than doubled by integrating their classmates into the survey. In addition to direct assessment of children's competencies, their parents are interviewed and teachers and principals fill out self-administered questionnaires. In these stages, assessments focus on early scientific and mathematical literacy as well as language competencies (e.g., vocabulary, grammar, phonological awareness). We survey the structure and aspects of the quality of Kindergarten and elementary school, families, and nonformal learning environments. Information on parents' socioeconomic status and their evaluation of decision-relevant aspects allows us to model school choice and disentangle primary and secondary effects of stratification. Theoretically relevant aspects of migrants' situation are surveyed. Further aspects are children's health, social competencies, and the different care settings.
Legal In- and Exclusion of Immigrant Children: Institutional Influences on their Educational Opportunities;Legal stratification among immigrants is a rarely discussed dimension of inequality. This essay presents a theoretical model outlining direct and indirect effects of legal statuses and status-specific migration policies on immigrant children's educational opportunities. An institutional analysis of the German case illustrates for the immigrant cohorts of 1987 - 2003 how legal hierarchies, e.g. between ethnic German immigrants, non-German family migrants, and refugees, were relevant for educational and other types of rights. After presenting the immigrant children's actual educational attainment, the article discusses the interplay of legal stratification with other social determinants of educational opportunities. The legal status of ethnic German immigrants and the migration policies related to this status represent an example of an inclusive mode of governmental incorporation. Its positive impact did not eliminate but mitigated the educational risks related to migrations.
Making a difference? The use (and abuse) of diversity management at the UK's elite law firms;The UK's elite law firms have recently seen a shift from talking about equality of opportunity alone to the adoption of a diversity discourse as well. This article examines this transition for what it can tell us about the value of diversity strategies as a means for widening access to the corporate legal profession on the basis of social class, focusing on five elite law firms based in the City of London. A number of studies have demonstrated how cultural practices within the legal sector maintain exclusionary mechanisms based on class. There has been less attention to how this is sustained within an amended institutional framework which outwardly 'celebrates' difference. This research suggests that though diversity strategies do little to change organisational cultures, those that recognise both the depth of professional prejudice within the sector and the reality of educational inequality across the UK may prove relatively progressive nonetheless.
Primary and secondary effects of social origin at the transition to tertiary education;Following Boudon social disparities at educational transitions can be linked to primary and secondary effects of social origin. Whereas primary effects describe social differentials in scholastic performance, secondary effects represent social differences in educational choices that are independent of performance. We use four panel surveys of graduate cohorts that have obtained eligibility for higher education between 1983 and 1999, provided by the German Higher Education Information System (HIS). By applying counterfactual decomposition methods we estimate the relative importance of primary and secondary effects at the transition to tertiary education. Our results indicate that secondary effects are the main driving force in the creation of social disparities at the transition to tertiary education, accounting for more than 80% of the differential between service class and working class offspring. Particularly financial aspects connected to the choice of post-secondary alternatives, interest in academic work and the type of Abitur degree can explain these effects. Furthermore, even though we observe a small increase in social selectivities at the transition to higher education, the relative importance of primary and secondary effects does not change within our observation period.
Employment transitions in the Netherlands, 1980-2004: Are low educated men subject to structural or cyclical crowding out?;This article addresses whether low educated men are displaced from their jobs by higher educated workers in the Netherlands in the period 1980-2004. In particular, we test whether structural or cyclical crowding out is predominant in the Dutch labor market. In order to do so, we try to explain the observed trends in education-specific transition rates to entry into first employment from education, exit from employment into unemployment or inactivity, and re-entry into employment from unemployment or inactivity for men by both business cycle effects (that is, changes in aggregate unemployment rates) and structural effects (that is, changes in labor supply-demand ratios for high educated). Discrete-time event history models are estimated using the OSA Labor Supply Panel 1985-2004. Retrospective information enables to study trends from 1980 onwards, so that structural effects can be distinguished from cyclical effects. The results show that structural crowding out exists at both the worker in- and outflow. First of all, it was observed that a growth in the oversupply of high educated increases the employment exit risk of low educated workers more so than that of higher educated ones. In addition, it was shown that an increase in the oversupply of high educated especially reduces the re-employment chances of low educated unemployed men. There is no evidence found for cyclical crowding out among low educated workers in the Dutch labor market.

Educational Expansion and Social Mobility in the 20(th) Century;Sociologists consider inequality in educational attainment to be a major cause of inequality between people in their chances of occupying a more advantageous class position. However, there is dispute as to whether educational inequality according to social class background declined during the 20(th) century. What is not in doubt is the expansion of education in the advanced economies during this time, and several authors have pointed to educational expansion as a mechanism by which inequalities in social mobility chances may be reduced. I measure this effect and compare it with the impact of educational equalization on social mobility in Britain, Sweden and Germany during the 20(th) century. I find that in all three countries educational expansion promoted greater social mobility.
Urban Sprawl and the Constitution: Educational Inequality as an Impetus to Low Density Living;
Does No Child Left Behind Really Capture School Quality? Evidence From an Urban School District;Before revising the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation under the new administration, policy makers need to be informed as to whether or not the NCLB labeling formula adequately distinguishes good-quality schools from poor-quality schools. This study tests this question, using rich descriptive data for Milwaukee's urban school district (MPS). Alternative indicators of school quality, the NCLB subgroup test failure measure and a standardized testing proficiency measure, are used as comparison measures to illustrate the discrimination embedded in the current formula used by the Department of Education.
Changes and Challenges in the Flow of International Human Capital China's Experience;"This article tracks the changes in the directions of the international flow of Chinese human capital between the 1870s and 2000s. Although many studies on international academic flow adopt the pull-and-push approach, this article argues that the direction of human capital flow is not determined solely by an individual's choice when faced with a pulling or pushing force; it can also be affected by people's psychocultural perception of overseas study, the international relations between host and source countries, the nation state's higher education policy, and social changes in both the domestic and the global contexts. China's experience exemplifies the potential of a developing country's success in influencing the distribution of internationally mobile students and in altering its status in the world system from that of a country on the periphery to that of one approaching the core."
GLOBALIZATION AND EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY DURING THE 18(TH) TO 20(TH) CENTURIES: LATIN AMERICA IN GLOBAL COMPARISON;This paper explores the inequality of numeracy and education by studying school years and numeracy of the rich and poor, as well as of tall and short individuals. To estimate numeracy, the age-heaping method is used for the 18(th) to early 20(th) centuries. Testing the hypothesis that globalization might have increased the inequality of education, we find evidence that 19(th) century globalization actually increased inequality in Latin America, but 20(th) century globalization had positive effects by reducing educational inequality in a broader sample of developing countries. Moreover, we find strong evidence for Kuznets's inverted U hypothesis, that is, rising educational inequality with GDP per capita in the period until 1913 and the opposite after 1945.
The City against the school? Urban Segregation and Educational Inequality in Latin America's major cities;
Educational Expansion and Its Consequences for Vertical and Horizontal Inequalities in Access to Higher Education in West Germany;For scholars of social stratification one of the key questions regarding educational expansion is whether it diminishes or magnifies existing inequalities in educational attainment. The effect of expansion on educational inequality in tertiary education is of particular importance, as tertiary education has become increasingly relevant for labour market prospects and life course opportunities. Our article studies the access to tertiary education of students with different social origins in light of educational expansion in Germany. First, we examine inequalities in access to four vertical alternatives of postsecondary education by means of multinomial regression with national data from four school-leaver surveys from 1983, 1990, 1994, and 1999. Second, for those students who enrol at a tertiary institution, effects of social origin on horizontal choices of fields of study are analysed. Results show that unequal opportunities to access postsecondary and tertiary institutions remain constant at a high level. Likewise, social background effects have not changed over time for the choice of field of study. Thus, students from different social backgrounds did not change their educational strategies irrespective of the ongoing expansion of secondary and tertiary education.
Curricular Choice: A Test of a Rational Choice Model of Education;Rational choice theories of education view student's educational decision as a sequence of binary choices between options that entail long-term utility and options that reduce short-term risk of failure. One of the best articulated models of educational choice asserts that choice between alternative options is affected by students' utility considerations, their expectations regarding the odds of success or failure in alternative educational options, and their motivation to avoid downward social mobility. We evaluated these propositions using data on students' curricular choices in Tel Aviv-Jaffa high schools. We found that educational choice was affected by subjective utility and failure expectations, but not by class maintenance motivations. Just as important, and contrary to the model's main assertion, educational inequality between social strata was not mediated by any of these choice mechanisms. Finally, and importantly, about a fifth of the students in Tel Aviv-Jaffa did not choose between long-term utility and short-term risks, but combined the two. These students, the hedgers, combined the riskier scientific subjects that are expected to yield long-term utility with social sciences and the humanities that reduce the risk of failure in the short term, but are not expected to yield large long-term utilities. The hedgers, moreover, were shown to be disproportionately female and drawn from disadvantaged social strata. These results suggest that educational systems that allow multiple rather than alternative choices may enhance the attainment of working-class youth because they enable them to opt for long term utility while providing a safety-net in the form of additional safer subjects.
Does Educational Status Impact Adult Mortality in Denmark? A Twin Approach;To disentangle an independent effect of educational status on mortality risk from direct and indirect selection mechanisms, the authors used a discordant twin pair design, which allowed them to isolate the effect of education by means of adjustment for genetic and environmental confounding per design. The study is based on data from the Danish Twin Registry and Statistics Denmark. Using Cox regression, they estimated hazard ratios for mortality according to the highest attained education among 5,260 monozygotic and 11,088 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs born during 1921-1950 and followed during 1980-2008. Both standard cohort and intrapair analyses were conducted separately for zygosity, gender, and birth cohort. Educational differences in mortality were demonstrated in the standard cohort analyses but attenuated in the intrapair analyses in all subgroups but men born during 1921-1935, and no effect modification by zygosity was observed. Hence, the results are most compatible with an effect of early family environment in explaining the educational inequality in mortality. However, large educational differences were still reflected in mortality risk differences within twin pairs, thus supporting some degree of independent effect of education. In addition, the effect of education may be more pronounced in older cohorts of Danish men.
Education, Educational Heterogamy, and Self-Assessed Health in Europe: A Multilevel Study of Spousal Effects in 29 European Countries;This study extends earlier research on educational inequality and health in two ways. First, we examine whether own educational level and spouse's educational level are independently associated with self-assessed health throughout European societies by analysing 29 countries simultaneously. Second, we ask to what extent educational heterogamy at the country level is related to health differences between and within countries. Theories on social capital lead to the hypotheses that average health is better in countries with more educational heterogamy, and educational differentiation in health is smaller in countries with more educational heterogamy. To test our expectations, we use individual data from the European Social Survey of 2002, 2004, and 2006 (N = 59,314) as well as country-level data. Using multilevel analyses, we find that not only one's own educational level, but additionally the spouse's level of education positively affects self-assessed health in Europe. The degree of educational heterogamy does not influence the average level of self-assessed health in a country. However, the positive relationships between own and partner's education and self-assessed health are weaker as the degree of educational heterogamy at the national level is higher.
Changes in Intergenerational Mobility and Educational Inequality in Estonia: Comparative Analysis of Cohorts Born between 1930 and 1974;We analyse intergenerational social mobility in Estonia comparing four cohorts born between 1930 and 1974. The article addresses three main research questions. First, how have absolute mobility rates changed in Estonia? Second, what have been the trends in social fluidity across birth cohorts? Third, what is the role of education in explaining changes across cohorts? Separate analyses are carried out for men and women. Analysis is based on data from the Estonian Social Survey, 2004-2005, which gathered retrospective information about the work histories of respondents as well as their social origins. We find that social fluidity certainly varies across cohorts but not in any way that could be characterized as a trend towards greater or lesser inequality. Comparisons of cohorts born in the 1930s and in the 1940s showed that social fluidity increased for both sexes. The increase continued for the cohort born in the 1950s but only for women belonging to that cohort. For men the association between origin and destination started to increase in the cohort born in the 1950s. For women that trend was noticeable for the youngest (1974) cohort. Our conclusion is that changes in social fluidity, across cohorts in Estonia, have been driven by changes in educational inequality.
Educational Inequality and Teacher Recommendations at the Transition to Upper Secondary School: A Decomposition of Primary and Secondary Effects of Social Origin;"According to Boudon's (1974) well-known micro-theoretical model of educational transitions, inequality in educational opportunity stems from two sources: primary effects which are all those that are expressed by the association between social origin and academic performance; and secondary effects which are propensities toward transition differing between families of different social origin even at the same level of school performance. The evaluation of the relative importance of primary and secondary effects is the aim of a growing body of literature. This article contributes to this line of research first by evaluating the relative importance of these two effects at the transition to upper secondary schools in Germany and second by assessing whether the differences in translation regulations between the various German federal states (Bundeslander) affect the relative importance of these effects. Employing nationwide panel data (years 2002-2005) collected by the German Youth Institute (DJI), primary and secondary effects are decomposed through counterfactual analysis. Results indicate that secondary effects are the main source of educational inequality, accounting for 59 % of total inequality. These effects are especially strong for children with medium (as opposed to very high or very low) grades. Furthermore, the relative importance of secondary effects tends to be higher when parents are allowed to choose a secondary school track, and lower when the parents' freedom of choice is restricted by teachers' recommendations. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed."
Inequalities in income and education and regional economic growth in western Europe;Does inequality matter for regional growth? This paper addresses this question, using regionally aggregated microeconomic data for more than 100,000 individuals over a period of 6 years. The aim is to examine the relationship between income and educational distribution and regional economic growth in western Europe. Our results indicate that, given existing levels of inequality, an increase in a region's income and educational inequality has a significant positive association with subsequent economic growth. Educational achievement is positively correlated with economic growth, but the impact of initial income levels is unclear. Finally, the results suggest that inequalities in educational attainment levels matter more for economic performance than average educational attainment. The above findings are not only robust to the definition of income distribution, but also across inequality measurements.
Economic Crisis and Inequality of Educational Opportunity in Latin America;Research in the industrialized world shows that the influence of family background on educational attainment has remained stable or declined over time. In contrast, very little is known about the developing world. Using high-quality data sets and a standard protocol, this article offers a comparative analysis of trends in educational stratification in four Latin American countries-Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. Latin America provides an interesting case study because the economic crisis and structural adjustment in the 1980s led to declines in family income, which may have resulted in growing inequality of educational opportunity. Findings are consistent with this hypothesis. They show a marked increase in socioeconomic inequality at the secondary and postsecondary levels for the cohorts that experienced the economic crisis. In addition, there is a decline in inequality in the lower educational transitions, which is explained by their universalization, a reduced advantage of males, and in some cases a growing advantage of females.
Educational inequality under China's rural-urban divide: the hukou system and return to education;We use microsample data from the 2005 (1%) National Population Sample Survey in southeast China and examine the relationship between the effect of hukou status on income and return to education under China's rural urban divide. For labor-market return we find that: (1) the influence of hukou status is deeply rooted in an indivdual's other key features (occupation, years of schooling, and working location) in the labor market, and (2) hukou status affects labor-market return primarily through its influence on people's return to education. Assisted by spline regression models, we find that the gap of return to education among people with different hukou status increases as years of schooling decrease, and reaches its peak in primary education. The data overwhelmingly suggest that individuals' human capital was largely determined by the place (rural versus urban) where they were born and received their compulsory education, which highlights the role of China's rural urban divide in shaping people's labor-market return.
Educational Inequality in the EU The Effectiveness of the National Education Policy;Since the publication of the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), scholarly interest in analysing the effectiveness and performance of education policy has risen again. The present article follows this path and presents the first empirical evaluation of the influence of national education policies on educational inequality in the European Union member states. We examine whether the availability of preschool education, an all-day school tradition, tracking during secondary education, a large private school sector, average class size and education expenditures moderate the relationship between individual social background and educational success. As a main finding, our multi-level analyses show that education policy affects educational inequality very differently, an outcome that is most visible when comparing West European and post-communist countries.
Addressing educational inequality;
Gender and school performance: the inversion of a social stratification pattern;In this paper, we seek to identify factors that account for the declining school performance of boys and young men. After reviewing and analysing the international literature on gender and education, we integrate various explanatory approaches into a model that is rooted in the theory of socialisation. The model focuses on the developmental tasks which young men face during adolescence. Our central thesis is that the declining school performance of young men cannot be fully explained by their failure to cope with educational challenges, i.e., their problems with respect to the developmental task qualification. Rather, a comprehensive explanation requires the incorporation of three other central developmental tasks, social attachments, regeneration, and participation. In the last decades, it has become easier for young women to cope with these tasks than it is for young men. Thus a rare sociological incident has occurred: the reversal of centuries-old pattern of social stratification. Nowadays, young women and not young men acquire the privileged certificates offered by the educational system, and it is them who gain the more promising career prospects. Our thesis can be supported with data from a broad range of international studies. The crucial implication is that supporting young men at school will show only limited results. Rather, to improve the school performance of young men, it is also necessary to address their deficits in coping with the other aforementioned developmental tasks, all of which point to challenges that young people are expected to master in today's individualised, achievement-oriented society.
Who profits more from preschool attendance? The impact of time in preschool and quality of preschool environment on the development of German and Turkish children's German vocabulary;Good German language skills are necessary to succeed in the German educational system. E specially for children of immigrants, learning contexts outside the family like preschools can provide access to the German language during preschool age. However, international studies have shown that the impact of preschool attendance depends on the preschools' quality. This article analyses whether the time spent in preschool and the quality of its environment have a beneficial influence on 3-5-year-old children's German vocabulary development and whether these factors have a larger impact on children with a Turkish migration background compared to German children. The analyses are conducted with data from the project 'Preschool Education and Educational Careers among Migrant Children' which includes a two-wave panel over a one-year period. It is shown descriptively that Turkish children score worse on the German vocabulary test than German children at both points in time, but that they make greater progress. Using fixed effects regressions, it is demonstrated that longer preschool attendance leads to a significant improvement in the German vocabulary of Turkish children and that all children can profit from a better quality of the preschool environment. Thus, preschools turn out to be an important context for language learning-especially for Turkish children.
Selections and social selectivity on the academic track: A life-course analysis of educational attainment in Germany;"Graduating from university is just the final step of an extended educational career. Sociological transition research has revealed that final educational attainment must be understood as the result of a sequence of successive decisions. With regard to graduation from university, one has to take into account that upper secondary school qualifications are required for enrolling in the first place, and in Germany, the decision for this kind of schooling is at a much earlier age. So where on the long way to the university degree does Germany 'lose' its potential academics and in particular its lower class children? This paper presents a detailed picture of the life-course development of educational careers by analyzing the various steps of the collective educational history of a particular birth cohort. The paper takes account of both the country-specific institutional structures of the educational system and inter-individual variation in educational trajectories and combines both aspects in an analysis of the most relevant types of educational transitions associated with the 'academic track'. Altogether, the transitions aggregate to the final number of graduates as well as to the observed level of inequality in educational attainment. In our empirical analyses, we are interested in both the overall selection at particular transitions and social differences in these transition patterns. We use survey data on participation and social selectivity in education. The paper confirms the usefulness of transition research for understanding the process of educational attainment; an analysis based on transitions is clearly superior to an analysis which focuses purely on stock figures of educational attainment. However, the paper also shows that conventional forms of transition research are often too simple as they assume an ideal-typical sequence of transitions during education. Educational careers in reality often deviate from this model. The number of young people (and in particular lower class children) who try to join the 'academic track' at least once during their educational career is much higher than the number of those who graduate successfully in the end. Accounting for the most relevant events helps to understand the quantitative and qualitative selectivity of the German educational system and may serve as a model for research on other aspects of educational inequality as well as on other educational systems.

Changing effects of family background on transitions to secondary education in the Netherlands: Consequences of educational expansion and reform;Recent developments in educational transitions research suggest a decomposition of qualitative dimensions within educational levels that are (nearly) universal. However, research on long-term trends of social stratification in the structurally tracked educational system of the Netherlands has not been published previously. In the Netherlands, the secondary educational level is divided into four hierarchical tracks which each lead to different options for subsequent educational decisions. A rapid increase of participation in the higher tracks over time however. may have changed the background-specific distribution of early track placement. This paper improves upon previous research on educational inequality by incorporating a long-term perspective into tracking research. The secondary level of the Dutch educational system is decomposed into its four tracks, using a time frame that covers cohorts that entered secondary education between 1946 and 1998. The application of multinomial logit regressions reveals that the choice of a secondary track is strongly depending on social background features, measured as education of the parents and occupational status of the father. We found linear downward trends of effects for fathers' occupation in the intermediate tracks for the cohorts that entered secondary education between WWII and the 90s. The effects of parental education also decrease after WWII, but the trend is curvilinear and not enduring. Unexpectedly, the effects almost reach their previous level in the youngest cohort. Our results furthermore suggest that a controversial reform of the educational system in 1968 neither triggered nor accelerated equalization of secondary education, although it resulted in a growth of participation in senior general education (HAVO).

Economic transition, school expansion and educational inequality in China, 1990-2000;This paper examines the trends in educational stratification during China's economic reforms in the 1990s. Based on the sample data of population censuses in 1990 and 2000. school-age children were matched to their parents' background information, and the effects of family background on their school enrollment and continuation were investigated. Results show that despite the substantial expansion of educational opportunities in the decade, family background continues to play an important role in determining school enrollment status and school transitions. During the decade, children of rural-hukou status became more disadvantaged compared to their urban counterparts, and the effect of their father's socioeconomic status on school enrollment was enhanced. Despite the fact that children of rural-hukou status gained relatively more opportunities at junior high school level, as a result of nationwide saturation at the 9-year compulsory education, the rural-urban gap in the likelihood of transition to senior high school level enlarged, and the effect of their father's socioeconomic status increased-even after controlling for regional variations in economic development.

Still Separate and Unequal? A City-Level Analysis of the Black-White Gap in Homicide Arrests since 1960;More than four decades ago, the Kerner Report chronicled the violent disturbances of the 1960s and predicted that the United States was rapidly moving toward two racially separate and unequal societies. Resulting concerns about black and white inequality form a critical chapter in the history of sociological research. Few studies, however, explore trends in racial inequality in rates of violence. Has the gap between black and white violence rates significantly narrowed since 1960 and, if so, why? Drawing on recent work on assimilation and the literature on race inequality, we develop a set of hypotheses about black-white differences in violence rates and how these rates may have changed during the past four decades. We emphasize race differences in family structure, economic and educational inequality, residential integration, illicit drug involvement, and population composition. Using race-specific homicide arrest and census data on social, economic, and demographic conditions for 80 large U. S. cities from 1960 to 2000, we find substantial convergence in black-white homicide arrest rates over time, although this convergence stalled from the 1980s to the 1990s. Consistent with theoretical expectations, we find that, since the 1960s, the racial gap in homicide arrests declined more substantially in cities that had greater reductions in the ratio of black to white single-parent families, as well as in cities that experienced greater population growth and increases in the proportion of the population that is black. Also, as expected, the race gap in homicide arrests widened in cities that had an increasing ratio of black to white rates of drug arrests. Measures of racial integration, however, have no discernible impact on the black to white homicide arrest ratio.
Long-term Trends in Educational Inequality in Europe: Class Inequalities and Gender Differences(1);"Using data for seven European countries we analyse trends among women in class differences in educational attainment over the first two-thirds of the 20th century. We also compare educational attainment between men and women; we ask whether class differences among the two sexes are similar or not; and whether trends in class differences over birth cohorts have differed between men and women. We find that, as expected, over the 20th century, inequalities between men and women in their educational attainment declined markedly. More importantly, changes in class inequalities in educational attainment have been similar for both men and women, although, in some countries, women displayed greater inequality at the start of the 20th century and have shown a somewhat greater rate of increase in equality. Patterns of class inequality were also largely similar for both sexes, though in some countries daughters of farmers and the petty-bourgeoisie did relatively better than their brothers. While some of these results reinforce what has long been believed, our central finding of a decline in class inequality in educational attainment for both men and women contradicts the persistent inequality in education that earlier scholars claimed existed."
Income-related and educational inequality in small-for-gestational age and preterm birth in Denmark and Finland 1987-2003;Aims: In this paper, we examine income-and education-related inequality in small-for-gestational age (SGA) and preterm birth in Denmark and Finland from 1987 to 2003 using concentration indexes (CIXs). Methods: From the national medical birth registries we gathered information on all births from 1987 to 2003. Information on highest completed maternal education and household income in the year preceding birth of the offspring was obtained for 1,012,400 births in Denmark and 499,390 in Finland. We then calculated CIXs for income-and education-related inequality in SGA and preterm birth. Results: The mean household income-related inequality in SGA was -0.04 (95% confidence interval: -0.05, -0.04) in Denmark and -0.03 (-0.04, -0.02) in Finland. The maternal education-related inequality in SGA was -0.08 (-0.10, -0.06) in Denmark and -0.07 (-0.08, -0.06) in Finland. The income-related inequality in preterm birth was -0.03 (-0.03, -0.02) in Denmark and -0.03 (-0.04, -0.02) in Finland. The education-related inequality in preterm birth was -0.05 (-0.07, -0.04) in Denmark and -0.04 (-0.05, -0.03) in Finland. In Denmark, the income-related and education-related inequity in SGA increased over time. In Finland, the income-related inequality in SGA birth increased slightly, while education-related inequalities remained stable. Inequalities in preterm birth decreased over time in both countries. Conclusions: Denmark and Finland are examples of nations with free prenatal care and publicly financed obstetric care of high quality. During the period of study there were macroeconomic shocks affecting both countries. However, only small income-and education-related inequalities in SGA and preterm births during the period were observed.
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY, HOMOGAMY, AND STATUS EXCHANGE IN BLACK-WHITE INTERMARRIAGE: A COMMENT ON ROSENFELD;
Early Ethnic Inequality: The Influence of Social Background and Parental Involvement on Preschool Children's Cognitive Ability in Germany;International research on educational inequality consistently reports the existence of ethnic differences in school achievement. The paper explores as a prior stage early cognitive differences between 3- to 4-year-old natives and immigrants in Germany and tests whether ethnic differences in cognitive outcomes can be essentially explained by the parents' social background and the home environment of the children. It is assumed that children's later educational success depends on their abilities at preschool age. The acquisition of these abilities is determined particularly by the family, the children's home environment and through institutional care. The data of a German project Preschool education and educational careers among migrant children reveal the existence of inequality in cognitive scores between natives and Turkish children. These differences cannot be explained by controlling for the social background of the families, nor by the home environment. A main result of the analyses shows that both factors are important.
'Anyone can make it, but there can only be one winner': modelling neoliberal learning and work on reality television;This article investigates how reality television talent-quest formats model the normative neoliberal worker and learner - roles which are increasingly drawn together. In the age of 'life-long learning' and shifting employment demands, new models of the supple, adaptable and willing learner are increasingly important both to meeting neoliberal economic demands and to legitimating them. As they appear in reality television, these models stand as ideological exemplars for the management of disappointment, the cultivation of hope and the maintenance of belief in meritocracy. Compliance, effort, just desserts and luck are emphasised in programs that offer viewers self-narratives that allow them to account for both their own circumstances and wider inequalities. As a vehicle of public pedagogy, reality television plays a central role in defining the place of learning in neoliberal self-actualisation. This is tied to well-established narratives of nationalism, which offer a depoliticised and demobilised sense of community.
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY AND THREE WAYS TO ADDRESS IT;
CHANGES IN EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN CHINA, 1990-2005: EVIDENCE FROM THE POPULATION CENSUS DATA;"This chapter examines the trend in school enrollment and transitions to senior high school and to college in China for selected young cohorts since the 1990s, based on the analyses of the sample data from population censuses in 1990 and 2000 and the mini-census in 2005. We pay particular attention to educational inequality based on gender and the household registration system (hukou) in the context of educational expansion. Results show a substantial increase in educational opportunities over time at all levels. In particular, women have gained relatively more; gender inequality has decreased over time, and the gap in college enrollments was even reversed to favor women in 2005. However, rural urban inequality was enlarged in the 1990s. The educational expansion has mainly benefited females and urban residents."
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN SOUTH KOREA: THE WIDENING SOCIOECONOMIC GAP IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT;Increasing income inequality particularly since the economic crisis of 1997 has called attention to the issue of growing educational inequality, in South Korea. Although much recent research has been directed at understanding the socioeconomic gap in academic achievement, few studies have empirically examined how this gap has changed over time during the past decade in South Korea. Using nationally representative data for the most recent three cohorts (1999, 2003, and 2007) of eighth-grade South Korean students from Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), this study examines trends in the relationship between socioeconomic background and student achievement. The eighth-grade TIMSS data demonstrate that the influence of socioeconomic background on student achievement has increased over time during the past decade, offering evidence of growing educational inequality in South Korea. Various factors may contribute to higher educational inequality, including the widening income gap and recent educational transformations geared toward school choice and tracking.
The colour of numbers: surveys, statistics and deficit-thinking about race and class;"Drawing on the traditions of critical race theory, the paper is presented as a chronicle - a narrative - featuring two invented characters with different histories and expertise. Together they explore the strengths and weaknesses of quantitative approaches to race equality in education. In societies that are structured in racial domination, such as the USA and the UK, quantitative approaches often encode particular assumptions about the nature of social processes and the generation of educational inequality that reflect a generally superficial understanding of racism. Statistical methods can obscure the material reality of racism and the more that statisticians manipulate their data, the more it is likely that majoritarian assumptions will be introduced as part of the fabric of the calculations themselves and the conclusions that are drawn. Focusing on the case of recent national data on the secondary education of minoritized children in England, the paper highlights statisticians' ability to define what counts as a 'real' inequality without public challenge or scrutiny; reflects on the dangers of statistical 'explanations' in the realm of public debate and policy outcomes; and questions quantitative assumptions about the intersectional relationships between different forms of oppression, including gender, class and race."
E-LEARNING ON ISLANDS: IDEAL AND PRACTICE;Islands are poor in educational foundation and insufficient in high-quality education resources due to their unique geographical features. However, E-learning has brought about changes in people's concept of time and space, and shortened the gap caused by time and space distances, hence effectively reducing educational inequality resulting from information asymmetry. E-learning is now transferring its focus from academic education to life-long education and job training, which means that its mission is to let more people enjoy high-quality educational resources and to train a wider variety of professionals for the readjustment of industrial structure. Therefore, it is necessary and important to develop E-learning on islands.
New Dimensions of Educational Inequality in Poland;This is the first insight into effect of development of nonpublic and paid schools on social stratification in Poland. Logistic and multinomial regression of the Polish General Social Survey data 1998 is conducted to test hypotheses concerning effect of the fathers's EGP category on access to various types of schools in secondary and tertiary education. Results confirm the hypotheses that respondents from intelligentsia families are overrepresented in both secondary and tertiary paid schools and have greater odds of entry in to public tertiary education in comparison to lower non-manual categories, owners, working class and peasants. Children of intelligentsia also have more opportunities to attend better stationary (than non-stationary) schools in comparison to other categories. This analysis provides support for the thesis about growing role of qualitative differentiation in education.
Educational Inequality revisited. Education and Social Inequality, from Kindergarten to University;
Health prospects of children and adolescents. On the importance of social background and school education;Using data from the Robert Koch Institute's National Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), the article looks into the influence of social background and the type of school attended on the health prospects of 11- to 17-year-old adolescents in Western Germany and Berlin (n=4739). Behavioural problems, the exercise of violence in the past 12 months, and the adolescents' current smoking status are incorporated into the analysis as health outcomes. The results show that boys and girls from families with a low social status have behavioural problems, exercise violence against others, and smoke more frequently than their peers from the middle and high status groups. An analysis from the perspective of the type of school attended reveals marked health differences to the detriment of young people at secondary schools (Hauptschulen) compared to young people attending intermediate secondary schools (Realschulen) and comprehensive schools (Gesamtschulen) and grammar schools (Gymnasien). At the same time, however, it becomes clear that adolescents from the low status group who qualify, to attend a grammar school have better health prospects and show no significant health differences from their fellow students from socially better-off families. The results suggest that reducing educational inequality could contribute towards greater equality as regards the health prospects of the younger generation.
Education for all? The school Logic of resource privilege and non-priviledged Children as the Cause of the existing Educational Inequality;
Study Involvement of Academic and Vocational Students: Does Between-School Tracking Sharpen the Difference?;Although a rich tradition of mainly U.S. and UK research focuses on the nature and effects of tracking students with in schools, little research has investigated the importance of tracking students in the same or in separate schools. The authors used data from a unique, representative survey in Flanders (Belgium) to examine bow students' study involvement varied between multilateral schools (in which all different tracks are offered) and categorial schools (in which only particular tracks are offered) and whether the relation between track and study involvement varied between these school types. Multilevel analyses of data gathered in 2004 and 2005 from academic and vocational third and fifth grade students in a sample of Flemish secondary schools showed that vocational students had slightly lower study involvement in multilateral schools. Although academic students were more study involved than vocational students, this difference was larger in multilateral schools than in categorial schools. The data suggest that in multilateral schools, vocational students compared themselves with academic track students, consistent with, the hypothesis of increased statu's deprivation, resulting in even stronger antischool attitudes. The implications of these finding for further research and social policy are discussed,
Achieving equity through charter schools: more than tinkering at school structure;Today, the US public educational landscape features both well-funded and richly resourced segregated white schools and underfunded, poorly resourced majority black, Latino, Native American, and poor schools. Efforts to remedy these problems are ongoing and varied. Some parents and educators have turned away from traditional public schools and have advocated community-controlled schools as a means of remedying a wide range of issues, including educational inequality. Charter schools are now a particularly popular alternative form of public education. In this article, we draw on findings from a larger case study of a conversion charter school in California in order to examine issues of equity from two perspectives: access and quality. Here, we focus attention on internal dynamics, raising critical questions about the policies and practices enacted within the school and about the long-term effects of everyday interactions between teachers and students. Our analysis helps reveal the extent to which educational outcomes are socially constructed, and it shows how structural arrangements within the school sustain rather than lessen educational inequity.
WHY DO MORE POLARIZED COUNTRIES RUN MORE PROCYCLICAL FISCAL POLICY?;We study the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy to explain why some countries exhibit procyclical fiscal policy stances-being expansionary in good times and contractionary in bad times. We develop a model that links the polarization of preferences over fiscal spending to the procyclicality bias. We then present evidence that social polarization as measured by income inequality and educational inequality is consistently and positively associated with fiscal procyclicality, even after controlling for other determinants from existing theories. We also find a strong negative impact of fiscal procyclicality on economic growth.
Social Class, School and Non-School Environments, and Black/White Inequalities in Children's Learning;As social and economic stratification between black and white Americans persists at the dawn of the twenty-first century, disparities in educational outcomes remain an especially formidable barrier Recent research on the black/white achievement gap points to a perplexing pattern in this regard. Schools appear to exacerbate black/white disparities in learning while simultaneously slowing the growth of social class gaps. How might this occur? Using 1st grade data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), I test-and find support for-the proposition that school factors play an elevated role in generating the black/white achievement gap while non-school factors primarily drive social class inequalities. These findings help explain why black/white achievement disparities grow mostly during the school year (when schools are in session and have their greatest impact on students' learning) while class gaps widen mostly during the summer (when school is out of session and non-school influences dominate). I conclude by discussing the implications for future research, especially as they pertain to what appears to be the most important contributor to the black/white achievement gap: school racial segregation.
Effects of the 1994 Tax Reform on Intraprovincial Inequalities in Financing Basic Education;This study explores the influence of the 1994 tax reform on intraprovincial inequality in financing basic education. The empirical analysis finds that the reform has decreased inequality in general, suggesting that the center may attain its policy goal through centralizing its relative fiscal capability and increasing the intergovernmental transfers. The data defy that there is a linear relationship between the fiscal dependency of the province on the center and educational inequality, even though the reform has changed the fiscal dependency of each province significantly. But the study strongly supports that there is a U-shaped relationship between fiscal dependency and inequality. This indicates that when fiscal dependency increases, education in a richer province will be more equal, whereas that in a poorer province will be more unequal.
When marketisation and privatisation clash with socialist ideals: Educational inequality in Urban China;In the last two decades, China's education has experienced significant transformations and restructuring on account of privatization and marketization. Unlike the Mao era when the state assumed the major responsibilities in financing and providing education, individuals and families have now to bear increasing financial burdens in paying for education. The marketization and privatization of education has undoubtedly intensified educational inequalities and widened regional disparities between the economically developed areas in the eastern coast and the less economically developed areas in the middle and north-western parts of the country. The growing inequalities in education and the increasing financial burdens presented by education have been a source of social discontentment, which have in turn prompted the central government to revisit its approaches to educational development. This article sets out to examine, how in this wider policy context, China's education has been transformed following the adoption of more pro-competition and market-oriented reform measures. This article is based on intensive secondary data analysis, fieldwork observations, and findings from a household survey conducted in eight different Chinese cities about people's perceived education hardship. The article concludes by considering how the Chinese government has attempted to address the problems of educational inequalities that have intensified on account of two decades of education marketization.

Rethinking academic literacy for educators: towards a relevant pedagogy;Even though South African institutions of higher learning have an open door policy and all students across racial lines can study anywhere they like, very few currently stand a chance of achieving their goals of further education and professional careers. Drawing on research findings, it seems to me that as teacher educators we are faced with a challenge to undo school classroom practices that evolved in western education systems to reward the elite and marginalise the majority. I intend to demonstrate ways in which the Faculty of Education at the University of the Witwatersrand designed a course and implemented strategies to redress this educational inequality. I used Grounded Theory as the research methodology and documentary evidence (in the form of module content) as the research instrument. By means of the research findings, I illustrate the value in focusing squarely on teaching all students in a class to read and write the texts expected of their level and area of study, as part of everyday teaching practice. Research findings indicate that genre pedagogy has the potential to facilitate epistemological access relevant to student teachers.
Multiracial Groups and Educational Inequality: A Rainbow or a Divide?;"How do multiracial groups fit into the system of racial oppression and privilege in the United States? Are the outcomes of multiracial individuals explained by the Latin Americanization hypothesis (Bonilla-Silva 2002), or a hardening racial divide between blacks and all other racial groups (Gans 1999; Yancey 2006)? Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I address these questions and show that the educational outcomes of multiracial groups and individuals are not consistently explained by measures of appearance, as suggested by these theories. Although the educational outcomes of Latinos and single-race groups are significantly associated with skin color and the racial perceptions of observers, multiracial young adults' high school and college educational outcomes are not consistently related to either measure of appearance. Parental education and family income are the most important predictors of educational outcomes for multiracial respondents across different types of outcomes. The implications of these findings for racial inequality and research on multiracial groups are discussed."
Politics and School Desegregation Before and After Parents Involved;The authors attempt to tell the story of Brown and Parents Involved on educational inequality and connect these topics to economic competition globally. Brown came about in the 1950s in a much different environment: America was less diverse racially and ethnically, and economic competition on a global scale was less than in today's economy. Today, America's future is closely tied to the large pool of minority children enrolled in its public schools. The authors explore the return of more public schools to the neighborhood concept and how these schools may produce high-quality graduates. Finally, they examine how legal challenges may shift to school inequality within school districts away from challenges to inequality between school districts in the past.
The influence of parental investments on the development of German and Turkish children in Germany;The basis of ethnic inequality is set during preschool age. This article aims to explain developmental ethnical differences by using a resource-investment-model. The question is, wether the influence of the ethnic origin could be mediated by the social background and parental investments. The project Preschool education and educational careers among migrant families supplied data on 1046 families. The analyses clearly show ethnic differences in early development. These differences persist even after controlling for the socioeconomic background, but disappear after controlling for the investments of the parents. Therefore, the family background and the investment of parents in their children's home environment improve the developmental score of the child and explain the observed ethnic differences. Additional analyses show that among German children the social background is even more important than among Turkish children. The differential development of Turkish children is mainly stimulated by their parent's investments.
Parental education, children's performance and the transition to higher secondary education: trends in primary and secondary effects over five Dutch school cohorts (1965-99);According to Boudon, social background affects educational transitions as a result of differences in children's academic performance (primary effects) and differences in transition probabilities given children's level of academic performance (secondary effects). This study addresses historical changes in both primary and secondary effects on the educational transition from primary school to higher secondary education in the Netherlands. In addition, it considers changes over time in the relative importance of these effects. The study compares five cohorts of Dutch pupils, specifically those enrolling in secondary education in 1965, 1977, 1989, 1993 and 1999, and it employs counterfactual analyses. The main findings are that secondary effects have been stable and primary effects have fluctuated to some extent. As a result, the proportion of the total effect of social background accounted for by primary effects has increased somewhat, from 53 per cent to 58 per cent.
Social inequality at school entry in Germany - the impact of social origins and child care attendance on timing of school entrance;Although there is a regular age of school entry in Germany, some children start school later than usual and some children start ahead of schedule. While there has been some decrease in delayed school entries in the last years, the rate of premature school entry has increased substantially. Paradoxically, while the delayed entry is primarily because professionals rate a child as not ready for school, the premature entry is mainly based on parents' choice. The first aim of the paper is to discover whether kindergarten attendance can reduce the risk of a delayed entry. The arguments and hypotheses are mainly based on the theory on the ecology of human development of Bronfenbrenner. The empirical analyses demonstrate that low educated families profit most by kindergarten attendance, but only if the child begins attending the care institution before reaching age four. The second aim concerns considerations in regard to the decision of prematurely entering school. Socio-economic conditions are not as important at this point as compared with a delay in school entry. However, there are some effects indicating that higher educated parents foster a premature entry to elementary schools. The analyses are based on over 1.400 children in the relevant age group and their parents taking part in the large nationwide German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP).
The Brown Legacy and the O'Connor Challenge: Transforming Schools in the Images of Children's Potential;The gap between Blacks and Whites in educational outcomes has narrowed dramatically over the past 60 years, but progress stopped around 1990. The author reviews research suggesting that increasing the quantity and quality of schooling can play a powerful role in overcoming racial inequality. To achieve that goal, he reasons, our knowledge of best instructional practice should drive our conceptions of teachers' work, teachers' expertise, school leadership, and parent involvement. The research agenda supporting this paradigm connects developmental science to instructional practice and school organization and requires close collaboration between practitioners and researchers in a relentless commitment to provide superb educational opportunities to children whose future success depends most strongly on schooling.
Nonpersistent Inequality in Educational Attainment: Evidence from Eight European Countries;In their widely cited study, Shavit and Blossfeld report stability of socioeconomic inequalities in educational attainment over much of the 20th century in 11 out of 13 countries. This article outlines reasons why one might expect to find declining class inequalities in educational attainment, and, using a large data set, the authors analyze educational inequality among cohorts born in the first two-thirds of the 20th century in eight European countries. They find, as expected, a widespread decline in educational inequality between students coming from different social origins. Their results are robust to other possible choices of method and variables, and the authors offer some explanations of why their findings contradict Shavit and Blossfeld's conclusions.
The Socioeconomic Gap in University Dropouts;In many countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., there is ongoing concern about the extent to which young people from lower-income backgrounds can acquire a university degree. Recent evidence from the U.K. suggests that for a given level of prior achievement in secondary school a disadvantaged student has as much chance of enrolling in a university as a more advantaged student. However, simply participating in higher education is not sufficient--graduation is important. Therefore, this paper investigates whether students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have a higher rate of university dropout when compared to their wealthier counterparts, allowing for their differential prior achievement. Using a combination of school and university administrative data sets, we show that there is indeed a sizeable and statistically significant gap in the rate of withdrawal after the first year of university between advantaged and disadvantaged English students. This socioeconomic gap in university dropouts remains even after allowing for their personal characteristics, prior achievement in secondary school and university characteristics. In the English context, at least, this implies that retention in university of disadvantaged students is arguably a more important policy issue than barriers to entry for these students.
Social identity theories and educational engagement;There is a large body of research in studies of schooling, particularly ethnographic case studies, which posits that collective action among students undermines engagement in school and contributes to educational inequality. In this paper I review studies of engagement from a social identity theory perspective. To what extent can collective action explain why some student groups are less engaged than others? I discuss four approaches to identifying social identity-related problems of engagement frequently used in prior research. While researchers often find problems of engagement among low-academic-status students, research on educational engagement has had difficulty locating the underlying causes of inequality in student engagement. Social identity theories of educational engagement are inherently theories of collective action. I conclude that a fifth approach, large-scale observational studies of monitoring and sanctioning, provides the best framework for identifying both the prevalence of, and solutions to, this particular source of disengagement.
SEX VERSUS SES: A DECLINING SIGNIFICANCE OF GENDER FOR SCHOOLING IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA?;Recent worldwide gains in girls' schooling are raising new questions about the continued relevance of gender for educational inequality. At issue is whether the time has come to shift the policy focus away from gender to socioeconomic status. Answers to this question, we suggest, depend on how gender gaps close, i.e., do they close irreversibly, evenly, and faster than socio-economic (SES)-related inequality? Against this background and building on contrasted sociological perspectives on inequality, our chapter examines the recent convergence trajectories of several sub-Saharan countries, asking if these trajectories warrant a policy shift away from gender. Our findings are mixed. Although, the magnitude of sex-related inequality in schooling is consistently smaller than SES-related inequality, the process of gender convergence remains reversible and it unfolds in top-down fashion. Such findings warrant continued attention to gender in sub-Saharan Africa, but with particular focus on poor girls and on synergies that address both female and poor children. This conclusion supports theoretical advances that transcend the Manichean divide between focus on cultural recognition and socioeconomic redistribution.
Educational Federalism in Germany: Foundations of Social Inequality in Education;This article applies Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to examine how sub-national education systems affect the extent of social inequality in education within the German federal states. Variations in educational outcomes between the federal states can be primarily attributed to the strict educational decentralization in Germany. We examine four conditions of regional education systems presumed to be relevant for the extent of social inequality in education: the availability of early childhood education, the development of all-day schools, the onset of tracking to different school types, and the degree of tripartition in secondary education. Altogether, we find systematic relationships between the variation of sub-national education systems and the extent of social inequality in education. The results indicate that well-developed early childhood education is necessary for a low degree of educational inequality. However, educational inequality is not directly related to partisan and socioeconomic determinants.
Measuring Educational Inequality in South Africa and Peru;
Education, meritocracy and the global war for talent;"Talk of the rise of a global war for talent and emergence of a new global meritocracy has spread from the literature on human resource management to shape nation-state discourse on managed migration and immigration reform. This article examines the implications that the global war for talent have for education policy. Given that this talent war is a product of neoliberalism, it raises many of the same concerns for educators as neoliberalism in general: the embrace and promotion of social, economic and educational inequality; and a narrow, market-based conception of education, skill and talent. This article argues, however, that the global war for talent represents a new phase in neoliberalism, as it seeks to liberalise the global movement not just of capital and commodities, but of high skill labour as well. In this, it threatens to undercut some of the founding assumptions and goals that have shaped national education policy in OECD countries throughout the post-World War II period, and raises serious concerns for how we are to think about and pursue equality, inclusion and fairness in and through education in the future."
Socio-economic inequality in preterm birth: a comparative study of the Nordic countries from 1981 to 2000;During the 1980s and 1990s, there were large social and structural changes within the Nordic countries. Here we examine time changes in risks of preterm birth by maternal educational attainment in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Information on gestational age and maternal socio-economic position was obtained from the NorCHASE database, which includes comparable population-based register data of births from Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway from 1981 to 2000. The risks of very preterm birth (< 32 gestational weeks) and moderately preterm birth (32-36 gestational weeks) were calculated by maternal educational attainment and analysed in 5-year intervals from 1981 to 2000. Compared with mothers with > 12 years of education, mothers with < 10 years of education had similarly increased risks of very, and to a lesser extent moderately, preterm birth in all four countries. The educational gradient increased slightly over time in very preterm births in Denmark, while there was a slight narrowing of the gap in Sweden. In moderately preterm births, the educational inequality gap was constant over the study period in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but narrowed in Finland. The educational gradient in preterm birth remained broadly stable from 1981 to 2000 in all four countries. Consequently, the socio-economic inequalities in preterm birth were not strongly influenced by structural changes during the period.
Critical race reflections: valuing the experiences of teachers of color in teacher education;"While research has demonstrated that White teachers often must be taught about the pain of racism in order to not perpetuate it, this may not apply to racial minority teachers. Through personal experience, Teachers of Color are likely aware of the trauma that racism can cause students. Within teacher education, we must create research and teaching strategies that acknowledge racial minority teachers as insiders to the experiences of racism in school, and as valuable assets in the fight for educational justice. Using a critical race theory (CRT) framework, this article explores the reflections of Women of Color educators regarding their encounters and observations with race and racism in K-12 schools. Qualitative interviews were conducted with twelve Asian-American, Black and Latina women enrolled in a social justice teacher preparation program in Los Angeles. Their stories expose (1) the personal experiences with racism the women endured within their K-12 education; (2) the parallel experiences with racism they observe Students of Color enduring in schools today; and (3) racial hierarchies within teacher education. This data highlights a cycle of racism that continues to manifest in the educational experiences of Asian-American, Black and Latina/o youth. Additionally, the important stories and ideas revealed through the process of this research draws attention to the personal knowledge teacher preparation programs can tap into when training Teachers of Color about educational inequality."
Who's at Risk in School and What's Race Got to Do With It?;
Class, school, municipal, and state effects on mathematics achievement in Argentina: a multilevel analysis;This article analyzes the distribution of mathematics achievement among class, school, municipality, and state in Argentina. Data from the Year 2000, 6th-grade Primary School Census from the Minister of Education are analyzed using multilevel methodology. The results indicate that all levels of the education system are relevant and must be considered. If all levels are included, the school orawo effect is much less (18%) than if they are not (31%). Prior academic performance and socioeconomic level of the individual pupil, plus socioeconomic composition variables, accounted for most of the performance distribution among school, municipality, and state levels. These kinds of variables do not explain significant inter-class differences inside the school. As a consequence, the class became the superior level with the larger proportion of the total unexplained variance (15%), while the school variation represents just 8,6% of that variation. Finally, unexplained inter-school and inter-class variation is still significant making it necessary to further investigate relevant schooling and classroom factors.
An Analysis of Educational Inequality in Taiwan After the Higher Education Expansion;Two major educational expansions in Taiwan have resulted in a remarkable improvement of human capital accumulation for the last three decades, which is consistent with the long-run goal of education in improving individual well-being and international competitiveness. This study focuses on the expansion of higher education starting from the late 1980s. As the number of higher-educated workers entering the labor market each year has increased rapidly, this higher education expansion policy has encountered some critiques from the public. Evidence shows that the incidence of over-educated workers in the labor market has been continuously increasing after the expansion, which is considered to be a short-run problem from the policy. We also find that the overall educational inequality drops sharply, which is mainly contributed by the within age group component after decomposing educational inequality using the decomposable Theil index. Along with a larger increase in average schooling for women, a larger reduction in educational inequality for women than for men implies women have benefited more than men from the policy and the educational inequality between men and women is narrowing.
Shifts in the Intergenerational Transmission of Education in a Historical Perspective in the Czech Republic;The aim of this article is to explain educational reproduction in the Czech Lands between 1906 and 2003 from the perspective of educational mobility. Mobility trends in the intergenerational transmission of educational status identified in an analysis are presented in the context of findings on odds ratios in education and in a historical context. The analysis is based on observations of the intergenerational transmission of educational status, i.e. educational mobility, in two educational transitions between three educational levels (lower secondary, upper secondary, and higher education). Mobility tables and their log-linear analysis are used to help explain what mobility processes shape the educational inequalities that have proved stable over the long term and also odds ratios between the main levels of education. The article helps fill in the gap in knowledge about the long-term development of the educational structure in the historical Czech Lands and Czechoslovakia and provides information about typical mobility trajectories and varying mobility patterns in periods before 1948, between 1948 and 1989, and after 1989. Ail understanding of these structural contexts helps clarify what occurred in the past and what is occurring now in the area of unequal access to education and to explain one of the main findings from the analysis - that in Czech society the transmission of a family's educational status from one generation to the next continuously follows the same patterns.
Empirical Orientations in Educational Inequality Research;The paper aims to review main approaches in research on educational inequalities, focusing mainly on quantitative studies of social structure. The review starts with a discussion of the status attainment school developed in nineteen sixties, followed by educational transition approach and empirical generalizations proposed in nineteen nineties, namely maximally maintained inequality, effectively maintained inequality and rational choice theory. The article shows how the concept of educational process has been redefined in these perspectives, what research questions have been asked and what types of statistical techniques have been used. Such comparison leads to the conclusion that changes in research strategies in the past five decades evolved towards more valid and detailed models which were better fitted to actual educational paths. Nevertheless they can be still seen as rather crude research patterns. Their application in the context of differentiation of educational institutions can seriously limit possibilities of asking new questions concerning educational stratification.
Measuring regional inequality of education in Turkey: an evaluation by Gini index;This study aims to determine the relationship between inequality in education in Turkey and the average years of schooling. The source of the data was the 2000 General Census of Population: Social and Economic Characteristics of Population. To determine the inequalities in education, the average years of schooling of the population at the age of 25 and over and the education Gini index were calculated. The average years of schooling in Turkey and in all the regions during the period of 1975-2000 increased, and inequality in education decreased. A negative relationship was found between average years of schooling and educational Gini index. A positive relationship was found between the rates of increase in average years of schooling and decrease in the education Gini index. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved
The Emergence of Parents' Educational Decisions at the Transition from Elementary to Secondary Schooling;As little is yet known about the decision-making process at the transition from elementary to secondary schooling, this article aims to identify types of parental aspirational patterns and their development. Given the increasing relevance of higher educational qualifications, the analyses focus on aspirations to obtain the Abitur. The data show that most parents' decisions are based on a rational, measured assessment that is reflected in changes in their educational aspirations over time, Less educated parents and parents with an immigrant background are more likely to be found in this group. Further, parents in Bavaria are more likely to adjust their aspirations than are parents in Hesse. Parents in Bavaria have to take the state's binding regulations into account in their decision-making process, whereas parents in Hesse have a free choice of secondary track for their children. The group of parents that makes a measured assessment considers factors that are subject to change over time. By contrast, nearly one third of the parents have high and stable aspirations. These parents arc more likely to show behavior specific to their social class and less likely to adjust their aspirations over time.
The Transition from Elementary to Secondary Education in Germany: Definition, Specification, and Quantification of the Primary and Secondary Effects of Social Background;This study analyzes the primary and secondary effects of social background at the transition to lower secondary education in Germany. To this end, Boudon's theoretical model was extended to include factors of specific relevance to the German education system (grades and tracking recommendation). Educational inequality results from the interaction of social background, objective student achievement and grades awarded, the tracking recommendation of the elementary school, and the actual transition behavior. Analyses showed that social background affects transition behavior, the tracking recommendations made, grading, and objective achievement. Primary and secondary effects were then decomposed to identify the points at which social background influences the transition to secondary education. Whereas primary effects were indirect in all cases, secondary effects were both indirect and direct. Primary and secondary effects were found for each of the three outcomes considered (grades awarded, tracking recommendations, and transition behavior). For grades awarded, the relative proportion of primary effects was larger than that of secondary effects. For tracking recommendations, both effects were of the same size. For transition behavior, the relative proportion of secondary effects was larger than that of primary effects. The article thus provides first insights into the composition of social background effects and the specific impact of primary and secondary effects.
Reconstruction of Recommendations and Choices at the Transition to Secondary Education: Ethnic Criteria, Social Background, Achievement, and Class Composition;Based on data from 5 1 grade 4 classes in Rhineland-Palatinate that were administered academic achievement tests and questionnaires, multinomial logistic multilevel analyses were used to reconstruct transition recommendations and choices. As expected, at the individual level, the social background - in contrast to ethnic criteria played an important role over and above achievement. The recommendation proved to be a strong predictor for the choice of the school track, though both individual achievement and - to some extent - social background remained significant. Even when the recommendation was controlled, the achievement-related reference group effect for the choice of school track persisted. In line with the hypothesized reference group effects, the class-mean level of achievement was negatively associated with transition recommendations and choices.
Race, Racial Concentration, and the Dynamics of Educational Inequality Across Urban and Suburban Schools;This study uses national data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study to model educational inequality as a feedback process among course placement, student engagement, and academic achievement, separately for students in schools with high and low percentages of African American students. Results find strong effects of placement, engagement, and performance on one another over time and across both school types. However, the results also show that racial segregation is detrimental to the overall learning process for students between 8th and 10th grade. The author concludes that White and African American students in predominantly Black, particularly urban, schools are significantly disadvantaged at each point of the learning process compared to students in other school types.
The relative effects of family socio-economic characteristics on participation in education in Turkey;Problem Statement: In the last half of the century, the discrepancy in primary school graduation between the developed and developing countries has continually narrowed, while the discrepancy in the rates of secondary completion have widened. Debates on policies and analyses are on the worldwide increase in order to determine and prevent the impediments to increasing school participation rates at the post-compulsory, education stages. According to the results of related research, there is a strong relationship between children's participation in education and their family's socio-economic variables. Parents' level of education and family income are stated to be significant variables in participation in education and to correlate strongly with other socio-economic variables. Purpose of Study: This study aims to determine the effect of family variables, which play a role in school attendance among the population between the ages of 15-18 by gender and place of residence. Methods: This study is of an analytical nature. The dependent variable for the analytical data analysis is binary and cross-sectional. For the nature of the data, the Binary Logistic regression was employed to analyze the nature of the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable. The dependent variable in this research is the student. The independent variables are the father's level of education, mother's level of education, size of the household, and level of income. Findings and Results: Parents' level of education, household size, and level of income are variables, which affect children's participation in education. However, there are differences in the effects of the family variables in the child attending school. For example, the father's level of education shows the highest effect and the level of income shows the lowest effect. The family variables have a particularly high effect on girls' participation in education. It can be said that the positive developments in the family variables play an important role in girls going to school. The parents being elementary school graduates show the maximum effect in the child's attendance to school. The size of the household being 4 or fewer members has a marginal effect on the child going to school. Similarly, middle income has a marginal effect on the child's participation in education. Conclusions and Recommendations: It can be said that negative conditions have a negative effect on girls' education particularly. Improvements in these conditions play an important role in girls going to school.
Persistent Inequality in Educational Attainment and its Institutional Context;Research has repeatedly shown that educational opportunities are distributed unevenly in all countries. Therefore, the question is not whether family background and educational outcomes are related but to what degree they are related. This latter question then invites a comparative perspective. That is, does social inequality in education differ across time and countries If yes, which institutional characteristics can explain differences in educational inequality Educational inequality is conceptualized as the association between individuals and their parents highest educational level attained. Intergenerational educational mobility processes are analysed for 20 industrialized nations by means of log-linear and log-multiplicative models. The results show that the degree of educational mobility has remained stable across the second half of the 20th century in virtually all countries. However, nations differ widely in the extent to which parents education influences their childrens educational attainment. The degree of educational inequality is associated with the institutional structure of national education systems. Rigid systems with dead-end educational pathways appear to be a hindrance to the equalization of educational opportunities, especially if the sorting of students occurs early in the educational career. This association is not mediated by other institutional characteristics included in this analysis that do not exert notable influences on educational mobility.
Educational Disparities between Immigrant Groups in Germany: School Leaving Certificates of Ethnic German Resettlers and Other First-Generation Immigrants Compared;This contribution explores the educational achievements of immigrants who migrated to Germany as minors during the large influx that began in 1987. Differences in education levels between the following two immigrant groups are the analytical focus of this analysis: ethnic German resettlers (Aussiedler) and other first-generation immigrants who used different legal channels to enter German territory. What accounts for the fact that Aussiedler youth have higher chances of reaching a medium-level school certificate, whereas the majority of their immigrant
Comparing the distribution of education across the developing world, 1960-2005: What does the grade enrollment distribution tell about Latin America?;The present paper introduces a new indicator of educational inequality, the grade distribution ratio (GDR), focusing on levels of grade repetition and drop out rates in primary and secondary education. The indicator is specifically suitable to evaluate the distributive implications of expanding educational systems in developing countries. A comparative analysis of grade enrollment distributions across 92 developing countries from 1960 to 2005 reveals that the decline in educational inequality has been substantial and wide spread since 1960, but that progress has slowed down in the last two decades. Latin American countries were characterized by very large initial levels of educational inequality, but contrary to other developing regions continued to equalize their grade enrollment distribution in the last two decades.
Gender aspects of Czech education;Numerous Czech Studies have been conducted on how the education system reproduces inequalities. While most of them have dealt with the reproduction of class inequalities, relatively few have focused on the reproduction of gender inequalities. In this article, the authors apply a conceptual understanding of the category of gender to research on education, an approach that avoids both universalising g the category of woman, as well as the opposite extreme of individualisation. We claim that female students, even though they differ among themselves in various social and personal ways, are serialised as women by institutions in the education system. They are expected to perform differently, with different motivations, their performance is valued differently and they are expected to follow different professions than male students. The paper focuses in detail on the gendered nature of educational institutions, both in terms of the gender segregation of fields and levels of study, as well as in terms of the importance of the interaction that occurs during the processes of teaching and ascribing value and significance to the performance of male and female Students. The authors argue that education, generally expected to function as a social ladder and a route to better-paid jobs in the labour market, serves men and women in segregated ways.
Empirical approaches in social stratification research on educational inequalities;This article provides a took at the main turning points in research on educational inequalities, both at the level of the field's Subject matter and its methodology. The text focuses on authors and concepts that in their time constituted a major innovation, significantly advancing analysis and knowledge in the field of research on educational inequalities. In the article the authors propose viewing researchers in the field of educational inequalities through the lens of their era and in relation to the major turning points between them, which can be identified in terms of subject matter and methodology, and even chronologically. The authors define three basic periods, and for each one present two key concepts. The first period is represented by the basic model of the stratification process and by the socio-psychological model. The second period is characterised by the concept of educational allocation and the theory of 'maximally maintained inequality' (MMI). Presented for the third period are the multinomial transition model and the theory of 'effectively maintained inequality' (EMI). Across these stages of development the authors highlight three of the cited concepts as ground-breaking methodological innovations (the basic model of the stratification process, the concept of educational allocation, and the multinomial transition model) and the other three as innovations in subject matter (interpretive), though closely tied to the advancement of quantitative methods used in the analysis of educational inequalities (the socio-psychological model and the MMI and EMI theories).
Reexamining social class differences in the availability and the educational utility of parental social capital;Emergent ethnographic research disentangles social capital from other components of social class (e.g., material and human capital) to show how class-stratified parental social networks exacerbate educational inequality among schoolchildren. The authors build upon this research by using survey data to reexamine whether certain forms of parental social capital create educational advantages for socioeconomically privileged students vis-a-vis their less economically fortunate peers. By drawing a distinction between the availability of social capital and its convertibility, the authors find that whereas larger stocks of parental social capital accompany higher rungs on the social class ladder, its educational utility is less clearly associated with class status. A possible exception to this pattern pertains to the educational utility of middle-class parents' ideas about the collective efficacy of influencing school policies and practices. At issue is whether a more inclusive understanding of the material and sociological reasons for educational inequality can spur educationally useful social exchange among parents across social class boundaries.
Race, social class, and student engagement in middle school English classrooms;Student level data on participation in classroom discourse and student effort on assignments in 117 middle school English classrooms are used to investigate the social determinants of student engagement in classroom instruction. Social identity theories of race, social class, and attachment to school, and research in the social psychology of achievement motivation both suggest differential levels of student engagement among diverse student groups. Using multilevel models, the author investigates the relationship between classroom context and students' levels of engagement. Levels of engagement among black and low SES students are mostly insensitive to classroom context, suggesting there is little collective action directed at fostering anti-school norms among these student groups. However, consistent with research in the social psychology of achievement motivation, students who begin class with weaker reading and writing skills are less likely to be engaged, setting the stage for a cycle of reduced achievement growth.

Credit constraints in education: Evidence from international data;This paper tests empirically the credit-constraints thesis by using cross-country data on secondary and higher-education enrolment rates. Contrary to some previous works in this direction, we find several pieces of evidence that support the importance of such a thesis. First, controlling for the effects of both economic development and educational inequality, we find that school enrolments are negatively correlated with income inequality and positively correlated with financial-market development. Second, these correlations are robust to the specific country-effects, the composition of the sample of countries, and the inclusion of public education expenditures. Finally, public education expenditures are significantly correlated with school enrolment ratios. Distinguishing developed countries from developing ones reveals that the effects of both social and material factors are larger in rich countries than in poor ones. Our estimation results also show that the way public expenditures are allocated across educational levels affects enrolment ratios in higher educational stages. Specifically, countries where expenditure allocations are biased in favour of the advanced stages of education at the expense of the basic levels also experience low enrolment ratios in the higher levels of education.
Peer effects, social multipliers and migrants at school: An international comparison;This article analyses the school performance of migrants and peer group effects in different national schooling environments. Using data from the international OECD PISA test, we consider social interaction within and between groups of natives and migrants. Results based on social multipliers suggest that both native-to-native and migrant-to-migrant peer effects are higher in ability-differencing school systems than in comprehensive schools. Thus, non-comprehensive school systems seem to magnify the prevailing educational inequality between students with a low parental socio-economic migration background and children from more privileged families.
Early ethnic educational inequality: The influence of duration of preschool attendance and social composition;Ethnic inequality in education is a well-established topic among the scientific community. We assume that ethnic inequality is constituted early in life-before a child has even started school. Differences between natives and immigrants with regard to preschool attendance (if, when, and which preschool is attended) may account for some of the ethnic educational inequality upon entering school. We use the school entrance examination data of the City of Osnabruck (Germany) for the years 2000-2005 to analyse the school readiness of 6- to 7-year-old children as an indicator of early school success. It is apparent that the amount of preschool experience improves school readiness, even when controlling for family background. While this is true for all children, immigrant children nonetheless exhibit lower scores on school readiness when all these individual explaining factors are controlled for. Multilevel analysis shows that the ethnic effect differs among preschools. A preschools influence depends on its social composition: preschools with a beneficial social composition are better able to promote childrens development than those with a poorer learning context. Immigrant children benefit particularly from longer attendance at preschools with a positive context.
Higher Education Entry of Turkish Immigrant Youth in Germany;Drawing on three large datasets from the German Higher Education Information System Institute (HIS) from 1990, 1994 and 1999, the study reveals that Turkish youth are considerably more likely than Germans to enter tertiary education. This result sharply contrasts with findings on the Turks' poor performance in primary and secondary school. The higher propensity for tertiary education among Turks can, to some degree, be explained by their lack of familiarity with the German system of dual vocational training and their educational motivation. Another important finding is that among those who enter higher education students of Turkish origin choose, more often than Germans, academically oriented universities rather than the lower-tier applied science universities. This is mainly due to the selection of more traditional fields offered at universities by Turkish young adults. Our results indicate that the educational decisions of these students after the Abitur by no means contribute to the established pattern of ethnic disadvantages in educational attainment in Germany.
Engaging the sociological imagination: My journey into design research and public sociology;I chronicle the changes in my research, especially those that have moved me closer to C. Wright Mills's call for a sociological imagination and Dell Hymes's reinvented anthropology. As I spend more time attempting to create and describe equitable educational environments and less time documenting educational inequality, I have adopted a version of design research. I describe the possibilities and limitations of trying to conduct research while participating in the phenomenon under investigation.
Rethinking alternative education to break the cycle of educational inequality and inequity;The growing number of alternative schools seems to correlate with the mounting population of disenfranchised students. The higher the number of disenfranchised students, the more alternative schools are being built. This correlation may be caused by social, economic, and political issues that bring about pervasive social injustice, which reinforces the cycle of educational inequality. In this qualitative study, the authors examined 1 alternative high school from a critical perspective to determine whether the school benefited students to the extent that it broke the cycle of educational inequality. Using critical theory as a theoretical framework, the authors found that the school provided a caring environment for students and gained their trust. However, the school did not offer a meaningful and equitable alternative education that benefited the students. This failure led the authors to question for whom this school is truly an alternative.
Why working-class children become diverted from course of studies at the University? A empirical review of the diversion thesis by Muller and Pollak (2007) and its extention by Hillmert and Jacob (2003);Why are the working-class children diverted from universities? In spite of the educational expansion, the decline of inequalities of educational opportunities in schools, and the institutional reforms in vocational training and university education, the access to tertiary education at university remains still remarkably unequal across social classes. In accordance with the 'diversion thesis' suggested by Mulller and Pollak and extended by Hillmert and Jacob working class children are lead away from the direct path to university to non-academic education institutions because of both the impact of institutional structures of the educational systems on individuals' educational choices and the attractiveness of alternative education and training in non-academic areas. In order to investigate how does the diversion work the mechanisms of socially selective educational choices have to be analyzed from the perspective of rational action theory. For the empirical test of the theoretical approach data about school-leave with the 'Abitur' (high school degree) in the East Germany federal state Saxony are employed. Subjective evaluation of the former educational performance, the expectation to be successful at university and the subjectively expected costs are the mechanisms mainly responsible that working class children more likely choose the vocational training than education at university. In particular, the subjectively expected success at university has the greatest impact on working class children's educational choices leading them away from the university.
Accumulating disadvantage over the life course - Evidence from a longitudinal study investigating the relationship between educational advantage in youth and health in middle age;Recent studies suggest the importance of examining cumulative risk or advantage as potential predictors of health over the life course. Researchers investigating the cumulative health effects of education, however, have mainly conceptualized education in years or degrees, often disregarding educational quality and access to educational opportunities that may place individuals on divergent academic trajectories. We investigate whether educational advantages in youth are associated with an individual's health trajectory. We develop a novel index of educational advantage and employ random-intercept modeling using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. A widening health disparity was found in adulthood between respondents with greater and those with fewer educational advantages in youth. Furthermore, among respondents with few educational advantages, Blacks experience a greater health burden as they age compared to Whites and Hispanics. These results suggest that differential access to educational advantages during youth may contribute to persisting health disparities in adulthood.
Cultural capital, the state, and educational inequality in China, 1949-1996;Previous studies on educational stratification in socialist China focused on how changing macropolitical processes and state policies affected the patterns of educational attainment, while paying less attention at the mechanisms of the intergenerational transmission of educational inequality. Employing the cultural capital perspective, this article explores the relationship between cultural capital and children's educational attainment in urban China during the entire history of communist rule from 1949 to 1996. Using data from a nationally representative sample of Chinese urban adults conducted in 1996, this article addresses important issues about the social reproduction of educational inequalities in a socialist context. It finds that cultural capital has significant positive effects on children's educational attainment even after controlling for measures of family background. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that both the cultural reproduction model and the cultural mobility model have applicability to the Chinese case. Another finding is that the effects of cultural capital on educational attainment vary with the changing macropolitical processes in different historical periods in China. The results imply that the process of social stratification in socialist China has been shaped by massive state intervention.
An early start: Skill grouping and unequal reading gains in the elementary years;Separating elementary school students into skill-based reading groups within classrooms affects a vast majority of young children in the United States. The impact of this institutional process on students' learning has important implications for sociological perspectives on education and stratification, yet a lack of studies comparing similar grouped and nongrouped students has prevented scholars from drawing conclusions as to the salience of this type of curriculum differentiation. Drawing on data from the first- and third-grade waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort, I use propensity score matching techniques to estimate the impact of low, middle, and high group placement on reading gains relative to nongrouped instruction. Findings suggest that high-grouped students learn more, and low-grouped students learn less, than comparable nongrouped students. These analyses, which significantly lessen the extent to which selection into groups may bias results, add strong evidence to the view that within-classroom skill grouping in the early elementary years promotes unequal reading gains compared to nongrouped instruction. I conclude by discussing the theoretical and policy implications of these findings.
Education for Equitable Outcomes or Educational Inequality: A Critical Analysis of UNESCO'S Education for All and the United States' No Child Left Behind Programs;
Quality and equality: the mask of discursive conflation in education policy texts;Two key themes of recent UK education policy texts have been a focus on 'quality' in public sector performance, and on 'equality' in the form of New Labour's stated commitment to equality of opportunity as a key policy objective. This twin approach can be seen at its most obvious in the concept of 'excellence for all'. This paper contends that in recent policy texts the vocabularies of quality management discourse and egalitarian discourse have become conflated, serving to mask key issues relating to educational inequality, seen at its most stark in the attainment gap. The paper argues that this has led to a failure to distinguish between the goals of quality management and the ends of egalitarianism. Discursive conflation of this sort risks obscuring the significance of socio-economic context and the limited impact of within-school action. The paper also suggests that the focus on equality in terms of school provision paradoxically risks entrenching social inequalities despite the appearance of egalitarian commitment.
THE ZIP CODE EFFECT Educational Inequality in the United States;
Social inequality in education: A constraint on an American high-skills future;Countries everywhere are turning to education in the quest for competitive edge in the global economy. How to attain the high skills needed in new reformed workplaces is a preoccupation that can be observed across developed countries. In this widening discourse of high skills and competitiveness, the U.S. skills production model is being seen as undesirable because it is perceived to be premised upon educational inequality and skills polarization. This article agrees with such characterization of the U.S educational condition. It examines skill tendencies in new reformed workplaces and conceptions of how schools must respond, then interrogates assumptions underpinning college-bound/non-college-bound formulations that would have low socioeconomic status (SES) children pursuing watered-down academic fare, or vocational education, while high SES children are set on college pathways. I contend that curricula approaches that are premised on alternative post-school destinations leave the children of underclasses in the same unfavorable position as their parents, such curricula serving only to reproduce inequality. The article rejects curriculum tracking, and the notion of the non-college bound, and instead argues for the democratization of high status knowledge as the best response to the challenge of a high-skills future.
Sorting and inequality in Canadian schools;A student's peers are often thought to influence his or her educational outcomes. If so, an unequal distribution of advantaged and disadvantaged students across schools (sorting) in a community will amplify existing inequalities. This paper explores the relationship between the degree of sorting across schools within a community and educational inequality as measured by the variance of standardized high school exam scores within the community. Cross-sectional OLS estimates suggest that the variance of test scores is related to sorting by ethnicity, but not to sorting by income or parental education. We then implement two strategies for addressing endogeneity in the degree of sorting: a standard unobserved effects (first-difference) approach, and a first-difference/instrumental variables approach in which the structure of school choice (number and relative size of schools) is used to construct instruments for the degree of sorting. The results from both approaches indicate that the variance of test scores is related to sorting by home language and parental education, but not to sorting by income. Our results also suggest that reducing sorting would have little effect on inequality of outcomes in the typical Alberta community, but would have substantial effects in the larger cities.

'Margin insensitivity' and the analysis of educational inequality;A problem in educational attainment research is that measures of association, and not measures of inequality, have been used to observe inequality in the distribution of higher education between classes. While the statistical association between class and education in many countries has been relatively stable, measures of inequality applied to the same data show a marked reduction of inequality in the distribution of higher education over time. This is a result of reduced bias in the allocation mechanisms, most likely facilitated by the increasing provision of higher education. Decreasing inequality means that the conclusion in the literature that egalitarian educational reforms have been ineffective lacks empirical support. One reason why measures of inequality have been overlooked in most educational attainment research may be the firm but unfounded belief in the 'margin insensitivity' of loglinear measures. They are assumed to capture the association net of changes in the marginals of the class-by-education table, thus reflecting the 'true nature' of the allocation mechanism in recruitment to higher education. This notion can be shown to be a logically untenable deduction from the property of loglinear measures of being insensitive in relation to one specific kind of change in the marginals, to the claim that these measures are insensitive to marginal changes in general.
Adult social capital and track placement of ethnic groups in Germany;The dictum that context matters notwithstanding, few researchers have focused on how social capital affects educational outcomes for ethnic groups outside of the United States. Using German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) data, analyses highlight the group-specific effects of parental social capital on track placement among 11-16-year-old German and non-German students. For both groups, parents' family ties fail to affect track placement. Parents' community ties have mixed effects. Among Germans, parental involvement in sports affects children's tracking positively. Among non-Germans, parental socializing with peers affects track placement negatively, while parental involvement in religion-based community groups and interethnic ties with Germans improve track placement chances. We relate these findings to different strands of social capital theory.
International comparisons of rural-urban educational attainment: Data and determinants;We study cross-country differences in rural and urban educational attainment by using a data set comprising 56 countries. We focus on the determinants of rural-urban educational inequality, which is measured by the ratio of rural to urban average years of schooling within each country. We find that riskier human capital investment, less credit availability, a colonial heritage, a legal system of French origin and landlockedness of nations are all associated with relatively lower rural educational levels and greater rural-urban educational inequality. Conversely, larger formal labor markets, better infrastructure and a legal system of British origin are associated with relatively higher rural educational levels and lower rural-urban educational inequality. We also identify an interaction effect between economic development level and some of these factors. In particular, we find that as development level increases, the negative (positive) relationship between French (British) legal systems and rural-urban educational inequality is reversed and becomes positive (negative).

Poverty race, and the contexts of achievement: Examining educational experiences of children in the US South;This article considers issues of educational inequality in the US. South from a social work/ social Justice perspective. After a review of existing literature and discussion of cultural versus structural explanations for race and socioeconomic status gaps in academic achievement, findings are presented from a study examining child-, classroom-, and school-level factors that influence academic achievement among public school children in the South. Although a sizeable minority of southern children attend schools that are segregated along racial and socioeconomic lines, and although these schools are different in various aspects of educational environment, once family structure, parental characteristics, the use of ability grouping, and rural school location were taken into account, no influence of race on achievement remained. Implications for social work policy and practice are discussed.
Primary and secondary effects in class differentials in educational attainment - The transition to A-level courses in England and Wales;In this article we start from Boudon's important, but still surprisingly neglected, distinction between 'primary' and 'secondary' effects in the creation of class differentials in educational attainment. Primary effects are all those, whether of a genetic or socio-cultural kind, that are expressed via the association between children's class backgrounds and their actual levels of academic performance. Secondary effects are those that are expressed via the educational choices that children from differing c lass backgrounds make within the range of choice that their previous performance allows them. We apply a method introduced by Erikson and jonsson to represent the relationship between primary and secondary effects in analysing class differentials in one crucial transition within the English and Welsh educational system: that which children make at around age 16 and which determines whether or not they will pursue the higher-level academic qualifications A-levels - that are usually required for university entry. We then use a development of this method that we have earlier proposed in order to produce quantitative estimates of the relative importance of primary and secondary effects as they operate within this transition. We show that secondary effects reinforce primary effects to a substantial extent, accounting for at least one quarter, and possibly up to one-half, of class differentials as measured by odds ratios. In conclusion, we consider some theoretical and policy implications of our findings.
Cultural capital or relative risk aversion? Two mechanisms for educational inequality compared;In this paper we empirically examined two explanatory mechanisms for educational inequality: cultural reproduction and relative risk aversion, using survey data taken from secondary school pupils in Amsterdam. Cultural reproduction theory seeks to explain class variations in schooling by cultural differences between social classes. Relative risk aversion theory argues that educational inequalities can be understood by between-class variation in the necessity of pursuing education at branching points in order to avoid downward mobility. We showed that class variations in early demonstrated ability are for a substantial part cultural: cultural capital - measured by parental involvement in highbrow culture - affected school performance at the primary and secondary level. However, relative risk aversion - operationalized by being concerned with downward mobility - strongly affects schooling ambitions, whereas cultural capital had no effect. Thus, we conclude that 'primary effects' of social origin on schooling outcomes are manifested through cultural capital and not through relative risk aversion (in addition to other potential sources of class variations such as genetics). Relative risk aversion, and not cultural capital, affects schooling ambitions, which is relevant for our understanding of secondary effects.
Old and new inequalities in educational attainment - Ethnic minorities in the Belgian Census 1991-2001;This study examines ethnic and class inequalities in educational attainment using the 2001 Belgian Census. It analyses the highest qualifications that the 1973 to 1979 birth cohort obtained in 2001. Variation in attainment levels is explained as a function of gender, ethnic and class origins, and other characteristics of the parental household in 1991. Earlier findings of gross ethnic disadvantage, in particular among Turkish and Moroccan youngsters, were largely replicated when ethnicity is identified by ancestry rather than nationality. Looking across ethnic groups, parental resources in 1991 were very powerful predictors of educational attainment in 2001. In order of importance, parental education, accumulated wealth (as measured by ownership and quality of housing), employment and occupational class explain most educational inequality. Ethnic disadvantage is perpetuated from one generation to the next mainly through mechanisms of class disadvantage. In addition, there is evidence of cumulative ethnic and class disadvantage for Turkish and Moroccan minorities. Finally, the largest unexplained ethnic disadvantage is found for the Turkish minority in Flanders. Not only are they most under-represented in tertiary education, they are also most at risk of school dropout in secondary education.
Educational mobility over three generations. Effects of educational climbing on the climbers' children. Response to a discussion by Rolf Becker;In a previous article in this journal (Fuchs/Sixt 2007) based on an analysis with the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) we have argued that children of educational climbers do not have educational opportunities similar to the typical educational opportunities of children on the newly achieved educational level. Even though we could demonstrate that the climbers' children are subject to an increase of their educational opportunities compared to the level from which their parents originate, they do not reach the average of the destination level. Based on the theoretical reasoning provided by Bourdieu we argue that this educational disadvantage is caused by the lower furnishing of their families with social, cultural, and economic capital, by climbers' employment position which is less advantageous, and also by the lower educational level of the climbers' partners. In his detailed discussion of our analysis Rolf Becker has identified conflicting findings compared to his previous analysis based on the data of the German Lebensverlaufsstudie. In response to his critical discussion we will solve this ostensible caveat. Using again data from the SOEP we demonstrate that his seemingly contradictious findings are due to the specifics of his analytical approach. While Becker shows that the climbers' children reach educational opportunities that are higher compared to the opportunities of children from the climbers' level or origin (positive effect of climbing), our results indicate that their educational opportunities do not reach the level that is typically seen on the higher level of education that the educational climbers have reached for the first time (negative effect of climbing).
Race, school achievement, and educational inequality: Toward a student-based inquiry perspective;Over the past four decades, there have been numerous discussions on student achievement and school failure. Within this time, the debate over the causes and consequences of racial differences in achievement has been at the heart of the nation's social and political life. The author discusses the major developments in achievement research over the past century and examines the foremost explanations given for racial differences in school performance, namely, genetic deficiency, social class and cultural poverty, low teacher expectancy, and student oppositional identity. The article addresses the strengths and limitations of the existing body of work and concludes with directions toward a student-based inquiry approach to achievement research aimed at filling in some of the missing information in the literature.
Marital assimilation among Hispanics: Evidence of declining cultural and economic incorporation?;Objective. We document intermarriage patterns between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites over the 1990 to 2000 period in 155 U. S. metropolitan areas and evaluate the effects of spatial, cultural, and economic assimilation on interdecade changes in intermarriage. We hypothesize that changes in Hispanic-white intermarriage during the 1990s reflect changing spatial, cultural, and economic assimilation among U. S. Hispanics. Methods. We use data from the 1990 and 2000 Census Public Use Microdata Samples. Results. Analyses show that intermarriage between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites declined during the 1990s, a result fueled in part by burgeoning immigration of Hispanics, especially Mexicans. The 1990s also ushered in a period of increasing Hispanic segregation from non-Hispanic whites, growing language barriers, and accelerated educational inequality, which also dampened Hispanic-white intermarriage rates. Conclusions. Our results imply that the Hispanic population is at a transition point, if intermarriage rates are an indication, and possibly a new period of retrenchment in the assimilation process.
Trends in ethnic educational inequalities in the Netherlands: A cohort design;This study examines ethnic educational inequality in the Netherlands, focusing on changes over cohorts in highest educational level and school transitions for the four largest ethnic groups compared with Dutch natives. The maximum maintained inequality (MMI) and the effectively maintained inequality (EMI) propositions are used to predict ethnic educational differentials, using data from the Dutch immigrant surveys. We show that ethnic educational inequality is maximally maintained at the highest educational levels. After elementary school, ethnic minorities are more likely to choose the lower tracks but they do not differ in their choices between vocational and general tracks at the secondary level. If they succeed in passing higher general secondary education, they are less likely than Dutch natives to continue their school career, and university becomes more exclusively the domain of the native Dutch. These ethnic educational differences are not accounted for by disadvantaged socioeconomic background. In a country where class-based and gender-based educational inequality has decreased over time, ethnic-based educational inequality remains very apparent.
Researching race/ethnicity and educational inequality in English secondary schools: A critical review of the research literature between 1980 and 2005;This article describes and critically analyzes how sociologists in England have studied racial/ethnic inequalities in secondary education between 1980 and 2005. This study is different from earlier literature reviews conducted in this particular area in that it adopts a more systematic approach and includes the most recent studies in this field. Five major research traditions are identified: those of political arithmetic, racism and racial discrimination in school, school effectiveness and school inclusion, culture and educational outcomes, and educational markets and educational outcomes. These research traditions are critically examined in terms of their research questions, methods, outcomes, and related debates. The development of particular research traditions is explained by pointing to more general developments in terms of social policy and intellectual climate in England. A final section offers a discussion of how sociologists of education could improve future research on race/ethnicity and educational inequality in England.
Inner-urban edcuational disparities at the threshold of the transition from elementary school to the secondary school system;"Besides the urban-rural divide, studies on educational inequality increasingly include inner-urban disparities. A comparative analysis of official data on the transition from elementary to secondary school, as it was carried out for the cities of Mannheim and Heidelberg, shows the following: (a) the quota of transitions sometimes differ considerably between elementary schools and districts; (b) there is a strong correlation between the socio-structural profile of the district and the educational aspirations of the families living there; (c) a trend towards an amalgamation of specific elementary and secondary schools is to be observed; (d) these disparities show a considerable persistence during the period from 1980 to 2002, in particular."
Chinese education policy in the context of decentralization and marketization: Evolution and implications;Education policy has been undergoing great transformation in China since the initiation of economic reforms and the open-door policy in the late 1970s. These market-oriented reforms and the pursuit of rapid economic growth in a globalized economy have significantly impacted China's education policy and development. In line with the development of the market-oriented economy and its increasing integration with the global market, a more pragmatic perception of education has gradually taken shape in the post-Mao era, resulting in the decentralization and marketization of education in China. This article aims to examine the development of Chinese education policy in the context of decentralization and marketization since the start of the economic reforms, It will firstly make a brief contrast between the education policies before and after the economic reforms. Then, the decentralization and marketization in the field of education since the initiation of the economic reforms will be examined. What follows is an assessment of the impacts that marketization and decentralization had on education policy. This paper argues that the weakening role of the state in education provision and the disparity between rural and urban areas are key issues facing China's education policy following the economic reforms and the open-door policy. It concludes by suggesting that equal and balanced development in education in China entails bringing the state back into the education sector.
On the sustainability of educational improvement. Social heredity transmission of educational success over multiple generations;The educational expansion has led as a whole to an upgrade of the educational level of the population and, for the individuals, to educational improvement. This paper examines how sustainable these educational improvements are, in other words weather the children of the educationally improved have the same educational opportunities as the children of those whose level of education is traditionally high. The results show that the social heredity transmission of educational success is based on a mechanism that covers several generations, with the result that the educational level of the grandparents still has a considerable effect on the educational opportunities of the grandchildren, a low educational level of grandparents has a negative effect on that of their grandchildren. This phenomenon is demonstrated using the Socio-Economic Panel. An empirically-based outline explanation that takes the theoretical perspectives of Bourdieu as its starting point is then developed. The results show that the upward mobility due to educational expansion is to some degree only transient, which challenges the notion of the sustainability of educational improvement.
Trends in socioeconomic inequalities in adult health behaviors among US states, 1990-2004;"Objective. The purpose of this study was to measure state trends in educational inequalities in smoking, binge alcohol use, physical inactivity, obesity, and seatbelt use. Methods. The authors calculated the Relative Concentration Index of educational inequality for five health behaviors on adults from all 50 states and the District of Columbia using data from 1990 to 2004 in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n=2,118,562). Linear regression was used to measure changes and trends in the Relative Concentration Index of heath inequality across education groups in each state. Results. Except for binge alcohol use, poorer health behaviors were concentrated among the less educated. The largest educational inequalities were for physical inactivity. From 1990 to 2004, significant increases in relative educational inequalities occurred in 40 states for smoking and 31 states for physical inactivity. For binge alcohol use, 27 states showed significant declining inequality trends, but educational inequalities reversed direction and binge alcohol use is now more prevalent among the less educated in 19 states. Significant decreases in educational inequalities occurred in 36 states for obesity and 24 states for seat belt use. Changes in educational inequalities across the different health behaviors were not associated, except for a modest correlation between changes in inequality in smoking and binge alcohol use (r=0.40; p=0.004). Similarly, there was little association between changes in the population prevalence of health behaviors and changes in educational inequality in health behaviors, with substantial heterogeneity among states. Conclusions. State trends in relative educational inequality among health behaviors were mixed, increasing for smoking and physical inactivity and decreasing for obesity and seat belt use. The factors influencing relative inequality trends may differ from those affecting overall prevalence trends."
Mapping educational inequality: Concentrations of poverty among poor and minority students in public schools;We examine high concentrations of poverty in public schools by comparing economic segregation in schools and in their corresponding attendance boundaries. To do this, we assign poverty rates from the 2000 census to maps of school attendance boundaries for 21 of the largest school districts and link this with data enumerating the number of poor children enrolled in each school. Results show that percentages of poor children in neighborhood schools is greater than in their corresponding catchment areas and this difference is greater when the majority of children living in a neighborhood are racial minorities. These patterns reflect the withdrawal of wealthier children from public schools and into private, charter and magnet schools. The result is that poor and minority children are much more concentrated in high-poverty public schools than they would be if all children attended their local schools.
Education expansion, educational inequality, and income inequality: Evidence from Taiwan, 1976-2003;The expansion of higher education in Taiwan starting from the late 1980s has successfully raised the average level of education. Using the concept of the education Gini, we find that the educational inequality declined as average schooling rose during the period of 1976-2003. The impacts of a rising average schooling and a declining educational inequality are also tested empirically in this paper. The evidence supports that a higher level of average schooling will generate a lower income inequality. On the other hand, a lower educational inequality, as measured by education Gini coefficient, will also cause a lower income inequality. Skill-biased technological change that shifts the labor demand from unskilled workers toward skilled workers is the most likely cause for the rising income inequality in Taiwan. However, the trend of rising income inequality could be reversed due to possible future over-education and unemployment in the labor market.

The inheritance of educational inequality: International comparisons and fifty-year trends;This paper estimates 50-year trends in the intergenerational persistence of educational attainment for a sample of 42 nations around the globe. Large regional differences in educational persistence are documented, with Latin America displaying the highest intergenerational correlations, and the Nordic countries the lowest. We also demonstrate that the global average correlation between parent and child's schooling has held steady at about 0.4 for the past fifty years.

Middle class education strategies and residential segregation in Athens;This paper uses census data to investigate educational inequality in different types of residential areas in Athens, focusing on drop-out rates from secondary education, access to higher education and to particular degrees within it. The unequal socio-spatial distribution of educational attainment is linked to antagonistic middle class education strategies centred on school choice. Different forms of such strategies are identified broadly corresponding to different groups within the middle class hierarchy. Each form of school choice strategy has a particular relation to residential segregation. The latter is growing as a result, but under various forms and spatial scales that sometimes challenge the usual assumptions for the evaluation of neighbourhood effects.
Full service extended schools and educational inequality in urban contexts - new opportunities for progress?;This paper examines the extent to which the UK government's full service extended schools programme has the capacity to ameliorate educational inequality in urban contexts. It starts by examining a variety of explanatory narratives for educational inequality in urban contexts in the UK and suggests that the dynamics of social exclusion created by urban decline has generated particular types of polarised urban communities whose analysis has often been decoupled from research on educational reform programmes in urban schools. The paper argues for the need to re-couple educational process with the dynamics of urban context and suggests that the most recent educational policy development of full service extended schools (FSES) may present distinctive opportunities to complete such a synthesis. The paper then locates FSES within a broader set of government approaches that attempt to deal with social exclusion and educational disadvantage. It then draws on research conducted by the authors and others that has examined notions of FSES in the UK and beyond. It will argue that at present the evidence for the capacity of such an initiative to synthesise effectively educational process with the dynamics of urban context and hence resolve successfully the problems of educational inequality in such contexts is at best inconclusive.
Aspirations without consequences;Regarding the analysis of the mechanisms of the reproduction of inequality in education parental aspirations in education and child's performance seem to play a crucial role. Normally, a direct connex is postulated: less educated milieus are supposed to have less educational aspirations. On the basis of our empirical findings, which are produced by school research, we try to show that this assumption is not appropriate any more. According to our analysis it is not the lack of parental aspirations that makes the difference but rather relevant knowledge about the functioning of educational institutions. Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate that there is still a lot of symbolic violence in current educational institutions since less educated milieus are those who believe significantly stronger in the neutrality and objectivity of educational institutions. Having in mind the high educational aspirations of the less educated parents we suggest to analyse the current educational inequalities against the background of a change in the form of structural symbolic violence.
Ethnic educational inequality upon starting school;The present paper aims to explain ethnic educational inequality upon starting school, it considers as an example the children's school readiness, and focuses on preschool attendance as a main determinant. The start of the children's school career is mainly presumed to be influenced by the skills acquired in their preschool years. On the basis of the data of the school entrance examination of the City of Osnabrack for the years 2000 to 2005, ethnic differences at the end of their preschool time can be detected. These differences still persist when controlling for family background. However, when the duration of preschool attendance is taken into account, the ethnic effect on school readiness decreases, disappearing completely when additionally controlling for the children's cognitive and linguistic skills. Further analyses show that preschool attendance affects school readiness both directly and indirectly (via cognitive and linguistic skills). The results emphasize the relevance of preschool attendance within the framework of preschool education.
Interstate inequality in educational opportunity;"For the past half-century, legal and policy efforts to address unequal educational opportunity have largely focused on disparities between schools in the same district or between districts within a state. But the most substantial component of educational inequality across the nation is not disparities within states but disparities among states, a problem long neglected in constitutional law and public policy. In a companion article, Professor Liu argues that the Fourteenth Amendment obligates Congress to ensure that every child has adequate educational opportunity to achieve equal national citizenship. This Article examines the empirical and policy dimensions of the problem of interstate inequality. It analyzes disparities across states in terms of educational standards, resources, and outcomes, showing that the disparities disproportionately burden children who are poor, minority, or limited in English proficiency. Further, it demonstrates that interstate disparities in school spending have more to do with the ability of states to finance education than with their willingness to do so, highlighting the need for a robust federal role in promoting greater equality. Yet federal education policy has done little to ameliorate interstate disparities in education standards and resources; in fact, significant,elements of current policy tend to reinforce rather than reduce such disparities. The Article thus urges Congress to pursue, within an existing framework of cooperative federalism, reforms that create national education standards and an expanded federal role in school finance to serve as building blocks of a national policy to guarantee all children educational adequacy for equal citizenship."
Gender, sibship structure, and educational inequality in Taiwan: Son preference revisited;This study examines how sibship characteristics affect educational attainment in Taiwan. Using a multilevel analysis of a sibling sample of 12,715 observations from 3,001 families drawn from a national survey, we investigate the effects of family size, sibship density, birth-order rank, and sibship gender composition. The results support the argument that the effect of son preference on intrafamily educational inequality is conditional on family resources. We also find, however, that male firstborns, who are the ultimate inheritors of paternal authority in Chinese families, have additional leverage in the sibling competition for family resources. The privilege for firstborns does not extend to daughters. Therefore, we argue that culturally defined norms regarding seniority and gender help shape intrafamily resource allocation in Chinese society.
Education, equality, and national citizenship;For disadvantaged children in substandard schools, the recent success of educational adequacy lawsuits in state courts is a welcome development. But the potential of this legal strategy to advance a national goal of equal educational opportunity is limited by a sobering and largely neglected fact: the most significant component of educational inequality across the nation is not within states but between states. Despite the persistence of this inequality and its disparate impact on poor and minority students, the problem draws little policy attention and has evaded our constitutional radar. This Article argues that the Fourteenth Amendment authorizes and obligates Congress to ensure a meaningful floor of educational opportunity throughout the nation. The argument focuses on the Amendment's opening words, the guarantee of national citizenship. This guarantee does more than designate a legal status. Together with Section 5, it obligates the national government to secure the filll membership, effective participation, and equal dignity of all citizens in the national community. Through a novel historical account of major proposals for federal education aid between 1870 and 1890, I show that constitutional interpreters outside of the courts understood the Citizenship Clause to be a font of substantive guarantees that Congress has the power and duty to enforce. This history of legislative constitutionalism provides a robust instantiation of the social citizenship tradition in our constitutional heritage. It also leaves a rich legacy that informs the contemporary unmet duty of Congress to ensure educational adequacy for equal citizenship.
Structural influences on activism and crime: Identifying the social structure of discontent;By applying and extending the logic of Peter Blau's theory of social structure, this article identifies structural features of U. S. counties that are associated with high levels of crime, the presence of activist organizations as ideologically diverse as civil rights organizations and antiabortion groups, and low levels of voter turnout. Key empirical findings include positive effects of ethnic heterogeneity, religious heterogeneity, and income inequality on both the crime rate and the number of activist organizations in counties. Educational inequality diminishes the positive effect of income inequality on activism and has a strong negative effect on the crime rate. Many structural conditions associated with high numbers of activist organizations and a high crime rate decrease voter turnout rates.
The zombie stalking english schools: Social class and educational inequality;The aim of this article is to reclaim social class as a central concern within education, not in the traditional sense as a dimension of educational stratification, but as a powerful and vital aspect of both learner and wider social identities. Drawing on historical and present evidence, a case is made that social inequalities arising from social class have never been adequately addressed within schooling. Recent qualitative research is used to indicate some of the ways in which class is lived in classrooms. The article also raises concerns about the ability of the education system to positively address social class in the classroom when contemporary initial teacher training rarely engages with it as a relevant concern within schooling.
Race differences in termination at work: The role of educational inequality;"Prior research has demonstrated that race, at least to some extent, is related to employment decisions such as selection and performance appraisals. However, little prior research has addressed the impact of race on employment termination. The current study investigates whether race is related to employment termination and highlights the importance of education, an important component of human capital, in understanding racial differences in termination. Results based on 548 employees from a large hotel chain indicate that race is related to termination; however, race is not predictive of termination when education is included in the regression analysis as a predictor. These findings support the notion that a societal level variable (i.e., education) is an important factor in reducing racial inequality in employment practices."
Did falling wages and employment increase US imprisomnent?;"This paper studies the effects of wages and employment on men's prison admission rates in the United States from 1983 to 2001. Research on the effects of the labor market on incarceration usually examines national- or state-level data, but our analysis studies prison admission among black and white men in specific age-education groups. We find a significant increase in educational inequality in incarceration; nearly all the growth in the risk of imprisonment was confined to non-college men. Regression analysis of prison admission rates shows the negative effects of wages and employment on black men's incarceration, and the negative effects of wages on white men's imprisonment. If 1980s' wage and employment levels had persisted through the late 1990s, the estimates suggest that prison admission rates would be 15 to 25 percent lower for all non-college men."
Czech and Polish higher education - from bureaucracy to market competition;This article aims to compare two aspects of the education systems in two East European countries. As the political history of the Czech Republic and Poland in the past fifty years is similar, the authors compare the countries' development in tackling educational inequalities and attempt to evaluate their policies and reforms from the beginning of socialism to date. Despite many similarities and identical outcomes in the past (no effect in lowering levels of educational inequalities), these countries undertook two different approaches to the transformation of higher education after 1989. The specific current developments in higher education in the Czech Republic and Poland have been caused by conservative and reserved legislation in the former and the creation of new, very liberal rules for establishing non-state higher education institutions in the latter. As there emerged a considerable difference in the number of higher education institutions in each country, the authors show the negative impact on educational inequalities and the social consequences of the enormous increase in the number of students and private universities. Despite different approaches, the countries face many similar problems, such as quality assurance, a shortage of staff, and information asymmetry. These problems seem to be sharper in Poland, but it is only a matter of time for the Czech Republic.
Early childhood cultural capital, parental habitus, and teachers' perceptions;Bourdiell's theory of cultural reproduction posits that social class differences in cultural capital and habitus begin in early childhood and cumulate over time. While the theory maintains popularity in sociological research, no consistent empirical relationship between cultural capital and the reproduction of educational inequality has been established in American research. This study focuses on a population that has not been studied in quantitative research on cultural capital and habitus-children in the early years of elementary school. Data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study are used to show that children's cultural activities have a positive effect on teachers' evaluation of students' language arts and mathematics skills, but only for low-socioeconomic status (SES) students. Only one aspect of parental habitus, expectations that the child will attain a bachelor's degree, has a consistent positive effect on teachers' evaluations. These findings suggest that the traditional definition of cultural capital may not be appropriate for young American children, and that habitus should be included in future studies of educational stratification.

Does educational tracking affect performance and inequality? Differences-in-differences evidence across countries;Even though some countries track students into differing-ability schools by age 10, others keep their entire secondary-school system comprehensive. To estimate the effects of such institutional differences in the face of country heterogeneity, we employ an international differences-in-differences approach. We identify tracking effects by comparing differences in outcome between primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems. Six international student assessments provide eight pairs of achievement contrasts for between 18 and 26 cross-country comparisons. The results suggest that early tracking increases educational inequality. While less clear, there is also a tendency for early tracking to reduce mean performance.
Ethnic discrimination in primary schools? Grading and transition recommendations;Immigrant children's poor academic achievement is often associated with ethnic discrimination in schools. Although evidence on the current German situation shows that discrimination does not play a key role in the explanation of ethnic differences in education, the question still remains unsolved what its precise relevance is. The paper addresses this problem for the First educational transition from primary to secondary schooling. After discussing several causes of discrimination, it is studied whether ethnic discrimination in teacher assessments prevails (i.e. grading and transition recommendations). The data stem from a quantitative study on six primary schools in the German city of Mannheim. Standardized achievement measures serve as performance indicators. Independently from teacher assessments, they reflect ability in different areas. The results do not provide evidence for ethnic discrimination in grading in Maths and also none for the transition recommendation. Only with respect to grading in German language disadvantages remain for Turkish and Italian children. Presumably, this result is due to the incompleteness of the German ability measure. So Far empirical evidence suggests that teachers do not systematically discriminate in their performance assessments.
Educational inequality and family relationships: Influences on contact and proximity;In modern society, education has become a major element of stratification and differentiation. This paper examines how educational differences across and within family relationships affect the content of the relationship, thereby focusing on proximity and contact between parents and adult children and between siblings. Hypotheses are developed about why education should matter, using theoretical arguments about preferences and constraints. The hypotheses are tested using a large new survey on family relationships in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study. Family relationships are pooled into one dataset which is analyzed using multilevel regression. The results show sharp but nonlinear educational effects on proximity and distance, although most of the educational effect on contact is indirect, via distance. Educational differences within family relationships lead to greater distances and less contact, confirming the classic mobility thesis, but the effects are generally weak and the effects on contact are indirect. Implications of the findings for the different theoretical perspectives on family relationships are discussed.
Geography and educational inequality in China;Since the 1980s, educational reforms in China have decentralized administration and finance and privatized costs. These changes have emerged in the context of rapid economic growth and rising regional economic disparities. The reforms have mobilized new resources in support of education, but they have also exacerbated regional disparities in funding for schools. Analyses of trends in school finance and expenditures have emerged, but detailed studies of the shifting ties between geography and educational outcomes in the population have not. Using 2000 census data on year and location of birth and educational attainment, we begin to address this gap. We compare the links between birth province and educational outcomes across 5-year birth cohorts to illuminate trends in region-based inequalities. Results show that the percent of variation in years of schooling explained by birth province declined for cohorts born through the early 1960s, and then increased thereafter. Additional analyses use a dissimilarity index to characterize the strength of the link between geography and access to each level of schooling. This index indicates that the link between geography and access to primary school has greatly increased across cohorts, as the few without access to primary school are ever more concentrated in poor areas. The link between birth province and access to subsequent levels of schooling shows mixed trends through cohorts born in the early 1960s: stability for junior high school and a weakening trend for senior high school and college. Thereafter, the dissimilarity index increased, substantially for junior high school and slightly for senior high school and college. Results attest to the enduring significance of geography as an educational stratifier in China. More broadly, results suggest the importance of regional inequalities in conditioning the relationship between development and educational stratification. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
DECENTRALISATION AND PRIVATISATION OF EDUCATION IN AFRICA: WHICH ONE FOR NIGERIA?;Arguing that the politicisation of decentralisation appreciably reduces educational quality and efficient resource allocation and negatively affects matters of equity in and delivery of education, the present study provides a critique of decentralisation and privatisation in education in Africa with special reference to Nigeria. On the basis of the experiences of other nations, the author suggests that both decentralisation and privatisation in education-especially the introduction of user fees have created a new dimension of educational inequality in Nigeria as well. In this case, it can be seen that indicators of efficiency declined significantly in line with negative trends in national-government appropriations to sub-national governments and the education sector. The author concludes that no linkage can be asserted to exist between decentralisation and educational improvement.
Educational Inequality and Social Cohesion: An Over-Time Analysis;
Comprehensive Schooling and Educational Inequality;
Barriers of the selection to secondary and university-level education;This paper analyses educational inequalities in Poland over the last two decades. Using data from national surveys carried out during the period 1982-2002 these results provide insight into the relationship between social origin and transition to secondary schools and university levels. Transition to both secondary school and universities are unquestionably selective by social class. The only question is whether these patterns have changed over the last two decades, when the communist regime collapsed and new inequalities emerged. Previous cross-time analyses for most countries showed a lack of substantial changes in educational inequalities over long periods of time. The main findings of the investigation can be summarised as follows. First, it showed that the effect of the class position of the father significantly increased in the 1990s, and then-until 2002-it declined to the degree of the 1980s, before the communist system collapsed. Second, in accordance with the findings of all previous studies, secondary school transition proved to be more selective as compared to that to the university level.

Unequal childhood. The alliance between social background and education from an educational perspective;This paper addresses the issue of educational inequality within the current educational debate and how it is discussed in educational science. Unequal opportunities and educational processes are recognized only marginally in this debate. Evidence for this is shown on the one hand on a conceptual and on the other hand on a methodological and practical research level. The social background and its implications for the educational process is noticed, but beyond this, the factors and mechanisms how education and the social as well as ethnic background are strongly linked together and how they constitute unequal childhood are rarely picked out as a central theme in educational science. The paper closes with the outline of an ongoing empirical research project which focuses on milieu- and migration-specific educational processes of children.
Social background, credential inflation and educational strategies;The primary goal of this article is to examine the impact of credential inflation on educational attainment in twentieth-century United States. To do so, we create a measure of 'intergenerational credential inflation' (intergeneration inflation factor) and include it in regression models predicting educational transitions. Using the General Social Surveys of 1972-2000, we find that people are generally less likely to invest in schooling if its value is relatively low. An exception is the final transition to a postgraduate degree, where we find that when its value is low children of parents with postgraduate education are more likely to take it. This finding supports relative risk aversion theory, which assumes that the main goal of children is to avoid downward social class mobility. Perhaps most important, we find that credential inflation is particularly influential on transition probabilities if parents had made the same transition. This pattern is consistent with the information differential thesis that children are more informed about the value of education if their parents acquired it.
The growth of high-stakes testing in the USA: accountability, markets and the decline in educational equality;Over the last decade education in the United States has undergone perhaps its most significant transformation. Where in the past public schools have been primarily under the control of the local community, control has shifted to the state and federal levels. Furthermore, state and federal governments have introduced standardized testing and accountability as a means to hold teachers and students responsible. These reforms have been successfully introduced because reform proponents have provided three principal rationales for the reforms: they are necessary within an increasingly globalized economy, they will reduce educational inequality and they will increase assessment objectivity. After describing the reforms implemented in New York and Texas and by the federal government through the ` No Child Left Behind' Act, the author discusses a range of evidence that the reforms have not achieved their ostensible goals and that resistance to the reforms is beginning to emerge from US educators and citizens.
Privatization reform and inequality of educational opportunity: The case of Chile;Chile has experienced considerable educational expansion over the past few decades, as well as a privatization reform in 1981 that introduced full parental choice through a voucher system, in the context of a market-oriented transformation of the country. Using a cohort analysis of the 2001 Chilean Mobility Survey, this article examines trends in educational stratification in Chile over the past 50 years, with a focus on the changes that followed the privatization reform. The analysis shows that, in line with international findings, there is persistent inequality of educational opportunity across cohorts in Chile. Persistent inequality is not total, however. There is a small but significant increase in inequality in the transition to secondary education, which is cotemporaneous with the market-oriented transformation. Furthermore, when school sector-a form of qualitative inequality expressed in the distinction among public, private-voucher, and private-paid schools-is considered, the analysis suggests an increase in the advantages that are associated with private-voucher schools after the privatization reform, as well as in the benefits of attending private-paid schools during and after the reform. The article concludes by discussing the relationship among economic context, privatization reform, and educational inequality.
Teacher quality and educational equality: Do teachers with higher standards-based evaluation ratings close student achievement gaps?;Using standards-based evaluation ratings for nearly 400 teachers, and achievement results for over 7,000 students from grades 4-6, this study investigated the distribution and achievement effects of teacher quality in Washoe County, a mid-sized school district serving Reno and Sparks, Nevada. Classrooms with higher concentrations of minority, poor, and low-achieving students were more likely to be taught by teachers with lower evaluation scores. Two-level multilevel models, nesting students within classrooms, tended to show higher mean achievement in classrooms taught by teachers of higher than lower quality, with differences of approximately one-tenth of 1 standard deviation. Findings relating teacher quality to closing within classroom achievement gaps, though, were mixed. Implications are discussed related to teacher evaluation, teacher quality, and educational inequality.
Institutional structuring and inter-individual variation: The development of social inequality along the educational career;"How does social inequality in educational attainment develop along the life course? In this paper, we give a theoretical and empirical discussion of this typical aspect of educational careers. We distinguish two main chronological dimensions in educational trajectories: first, the institutionalized sequence of transitions in the educational system; second, the age axis which allows inter-individual variation in passing these different steps during the educational career. Furthermore, differences between analyses of transitions in contrast to analyses of participation are demonstrated. Following these distinctions, we discuss the conceptual perspective of conventional approaches to identify educational inequality. As an empirical case, we describe the development of social inequality along the way to university within the German educational system. To give. an up-to-date account of educational inequality, we draw upon detailed longitudinal data of the most recent part of the West German Life History Study. It turns out that the amount of social differentiation varies both between and within institutionalized stages of the educational career."
Education as a privilege? Explanations and findings on the causes of educational inequality.;
Private tutoring as a strategy for the realization of educational aims. An empirical study based upon data presented by the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP);"According to the theories of educational choice, private tutoring contributes to an increase in educational inequality. On the basis of data presented by the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), it can be shown that every fourth adolescent has had recourse to private tutoring at least once during his or her educational career. In West Germany, private tutoring is used to realize higher educational aims; this is not true for East Germany, where no corresponding tradition of private tutoring exists. Furthermore, the parents' financial situation decides to a great extent whether private tutoring is being sought or not."
Forbidden conversations: On race, privacy, and community (a continuing conversation with John Ely on racism and democracy);More than ever, urban school systems are segregated by race and class. While a chief cause of this segregation is the flight of white and upper-middle-class black families from predominantly black public schools, there is little discussion of white flight in contemporary education policy debates. Instead, our conversations frame the causes of and remedies for educational inequality in terms of racially neutral private choices. Describing this phenomenon as the  privatization of concern for our children this article critiques a narrow view of parental responsibility and care that justifies segregation by invoking the liberty of familial privacy. Employing narratives from his experience as a D.C. school board member and parent, Charles Lawrence calls for an expanded understanding of John Hart Ely's process-defect theory that recognizes the continuing influence of racism on school choice. He argues that our silence on the subject of race undermines the democratic process, and he suggests that breaking the taboo against candid conversation about race and racism is a prerequisite to the creation of the community of care envisioned by Brown v. Board of Education.
Prolonging inequality? Education in Germany after unification;"This research examines educational stratification cross-nationally through the context of German division and unity. Drawing upon representative German Social Survey (ALLBUS) data from 1991 to 1998 on cohorts schooled in the 1980s and 1990s, the analysis explores educational inequality at the secondary school level with respect to social origins and gender in four settings: the late state socialist German Democratic Republic, the immediate pre-unification Federal Republic of Germany, and the two halves of a now-united Germany. The pre-unification settings differ structurally-in the extent and timing of educational differentiation-and ideologically. Post-unification eastern Germany is a case of sudden, top-down structural reform, with a high degree both of cultural continuity and continuity of teaching personnel. The study finds that women's disadvantage in educational attainment has disappeared at the secondary level; indeed, men now face a disadvantage at this level. However, no major changes have occurred with respect to social origins. The children of workers and less educated parents were extremely disadvantaged in both East and West Germany prior to unification, surprisingly, perhaps, even more so in East Germany. Despite dramatic reform and expansion of the university-preparatory curriculum in eastern states since unification, inequality in educational attainment remains stable. Interestingly, the children of small-scale proprietors were particularly advantaged under German state socialism, and in eastern states in the 1990s they maintain a substantial but more moderate advantage over working-class peers. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible underlying reasons for the lack of variation in the parameters of educational inequality in the face of such varied and changing institutions and ideologies."
The role of the family and the school in the reproduction of educational inequalities in the post-Communist Czech Republic;Among the more relevant questions in educational research is how the governments and policy-makers in transition countries address the high educational inequality inherited from the past and what policies they develop in order to reduce the strong effects of the background family and the type of school on students' achievements, their aspirations and their chances of succeeding in the most important educational transitions. This paper addresses one of the most topical issues in this area, namely the social selectivity of Czech basic and secondary education. Special attention is paid to the role of 'multi-year' gymnasia. The results of analyses carried out on data from the Programme for International Student Assessment 2000 study corroborate the initial hypothesis according to which multi-year gymnasia, introduced into the Czech educational system after 1989, represent one of the main sources of the variation in students' achievements at the end of compulsory education. However, this variation can be almost entirely accounted for by the specific socio-economic background of the students. The same holds true for their future aspirations. The results of the analysis support the conclusions of the OECD Review of National Policies for Education from 1996.
Inequality of opportunity in comparative perspective: Recent research on educational attainment and social mobility;Studies of how characteristics of the family of origin are associated with educational and labor market outcomes indicate the degree of openness of societies and have a long tradition in sociology. We review research published since 1990 into educational stratification and social (occupational or class) mobility, focusing on the importance of parental socioeconomic circumstances, and with particular emphasis on comparative studies. Large-scale data now available from many countries and several time points have led to more and better descriptions of inequality of opportunity across countries and over time. However, partly owing to problems of comparability of measurement, unambiguous conclusions about trends and ranking of countries have proven elusive. In addition, no strong evidence exists that explains intercountry differences. We conclude that the 1990s witnessed a resurgence of microlevel models, mostly of a rational choice type, that signals an increased interest in moving beyond description in stratification research.
Family resources, gender, and immigration: Changing sources of Hong Kong educational inequality, 1971-2001;Objective. This study gauged the impact of government-led educational expansion on Hong Kong's social stratification over a 30-year period. The historically close state control over school supply in Hong Kong allows us to test the effectiveness of public policy in changing the transmission of advantages across generations. Methods. I analyzed household-level census data from 1971, 1981, 1991, and 2001. Interviews and documents were also used to illuminate reasons for trends during this period. Results. There was a diminishing role of family resources and gender on access to all levels of schooling until 1991. From 1991 through 2001, however, there was a reversal of this trend at the postsecondary level, as access to university education became more dependent on family resources. In addition, new immigrants from mainland China were at an increased disadvantage. Conclusions. Hong Kong's current plan to create a second tier of self-supporting postsecondary institutions will exacerbate the tendency toward unequal university access, and is also likely to segregate new arrivals from mainland China.
Educational epidemiology - Applying population-based design and analytic approaches to stuffy medical education;Conducting educational research in medical schools is challenging partly because interventional controlled research designs are difficult to apply. In addition, strict accreditation requirements and student/faculty concerns about educational inequality reduce the flexibility needed to plan and execute educational experiments. Consequently, there is a paucity of rigorous and generalizable educational research to provide an evidence-guided foundation to support educational effectiveness. Educational epidemiology, ie, the application across the physician education continuum of observational designs (eg, cross-sectional, longitudinal, cohort, and case-control studies) and randomized experimental designs (eg, randomized controlled trials, randomized crossover designs), could revolutionize the conduct of research in medical education. Furthermore, the creation of a comprehensive national network of educational epidemiologists could enhance collaboration and the development of a strong educational research foundation.
Crosses to bear and promises to keep - The jubilee anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education;This article examines a decade or more of scholarly and popular writings that blame the persistence of racial inequality in educational performance primarily, if not exclusively, on the cultural inheritance of African Americans. This article focuses in part on the ways in which contemporary rationales for educational inequality are linked to a legacy of blaming racial subordination on African American personality traits and cultural norms. Furthermore, this legacy of victim blaming  and its distortions of the African American past are considered in the context of the historical scholarship on education and cultural values in the African American experience. Finally, this article shows how unfounded assumptions about African American culture lead to day-to-day contempt and pity for the intellect and character of African American schoolchildren, giving them a heavy cross to bear on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education.
Educational inequality at the neighborhood level and population health.;
Educational inequality: The widening socio-economic gap;In this paper, we consider research on links between higher education and family background, focusing particularly on the experiences of two cohorts of individuals born in 1958 and 1970. The findings point to a rise in educational inequality during the period relevant to these two cohorts. Specifically, links between educational achievement and parental income/social class strengthened during this period. Furthermore, a person's actual (measured) ability became a poorer predictor of whether they would get a degree than was previously the case. The expansion of higher education in the UK during this period appears to have disproportionately benefited children from richer families rather than the most able. Furthermore, the labour market success or failure of individuals became more closely connected to their parents' income, revealing a fall in the extent of intergenerational mobility over time.
Educational inequality and the expansion of UK higher education;In this paper we explore changes over time in higher education (HE) participation and attainment between people from richer and poorer family backgrounds during a time period when the UK higher education system expanded at a rapid rate. We use longitudinal data front three time periods to study temporal shifts in HE participation and attainment across parental income groups for children going to university in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The key finding is a highly policy relevant one, namely that HE expansion has not been equally distributed across people from richer and poorer backgrounds. Rather, it has disproportionately benefited children from relatively rich families. Despite the fact that many more children from higher income backgrounds participated in HE before the recent expansion of the system, the expansion acted to widen participation gaps between rich and poor children. This finding is robust to different measures of education participation and inequality. It also emerges from non-parametric estimations and from a more detailed econometric model allowing for the sequential nature of education choices with potentially different income associations at different stages of the education sequence.
Health inequalities in Korea: age- and sex-specific educational differences in the 10 leading causes of death;Background An ideological climate has persisted in Korea that has discouraged public discussion of social inequalities. Thus studies on inequalities in mortality remain undeveloped. This study is to examine age- and cause-specific socioeconomic mortality differentials for both men and women representative of the Korean population. Methods Using Korea's 1995 Census and 1995-2000 Death Certificate data, age-, sex-, and education-specific mortality rates were measured, after which education-specific rate ratios, and relative indices of inequality were calculated. Results Graded educational differentials in mortality were observed among both sexes with higher mortality rates related to lower educational attainment in most causes of death. However, positive associations were identified between education levels and mortality rates with respect to ischaemic heart disease among older males and breast cancer among older females. The magnitude of educational inequality in mortality was not constant across causes and in some cases differed by sex. Conclusions The changing relation between educational attainment and mortality rates from ischaemic heart disease and breast cancer likely reflects changes in the social distribution of risk factors that emerged in the process of Korea's rapid economic development. Studies on specific exposures over the life course influencing the occurrence of and survival after specific diseases would help provide a more complete understanding of patterns and trends in socioeconomic mortality differentials in Korea.
Seduced by images: Identity and schooling in the lives of Puerto Rican girls;Based on a two-year ethnographic study at an urban middle school, this article describes the power that images created by and about Puerto Rican girls hold in shaping their schooling experiences. Using a black, critical,feminist framework, I show how dichotomizing the sexuality of Puerto Rican females against their intellectual development obscures the complex ways that identities are co-constructed and then affirmed, appropriated, or resisted within their school site. I conclude that to resist the reproduction of educational inequality in the lives of Puerto Rican females, we must explore and seek to transform the influential ways that identities are mediated and educational outcomes are produced within the school contexts where Puerto Rican females are educated.
Educational inequality in Korea: Recent trends and persistent structure;This paper analyzes how and to what extent inequalities in educational opportunity in Korea have changed during the second half of the twentieth century. Educational inequality is defined by social class differentials in both the quantity (success) and quality (path) of school transitions made at the secondary (middle to high school) and tertiary (college) levels of schooling. The extent of educational stratification as examined by the probability of transition to a higher grade has not been visibly alleviated over multiple generations. We also find that the extent of educational stratification is stronger in the secondary levels than in the tertiary schooling transition. The results also show that the long-term trend of stratification in the Korean educational system has decreased inequality in terms of scale, but increased the qualitative inequality of educational achievement between social classes. Even during the period of educational expansion and rapid economic development, social inequality in educational opportunity has resisted change. Such inequalities tend to reproduce themselves between successive cohorts, especially when quantitative socioeconomic opportunity remains limited.
Structured ignorance and organized racism in the United States;A theory of structured ignorance is developed and applied in an analysis of variation in the number of racist organizations in U.S. counties in 1997 and 2000. The theory identifies forms of structural differentiation that would make the worldview constructed within racist organizations seem plausible to a critical mass of individuals. I argue that racial and ethnic heterogeneity, industrial heterogeneity, income inequality, and changes in the economic structure within local communities provide evidence that may appear to be consistent with white supremacists' claims if individuals lack an alternative interpretation. Educational inequality, however, inhibits racist organizing by facilitating the exchange of information that could be used to reject the white supremacists' claims and by promoting passive acceptance of the existing order.
Risk and the distribution of human capital;We developed a model in which aggregate production risk determines the average level of education and its distribution. Greater risk is associated with greater educational inequality and a lower average attainment. An empirical test using panel data supports this conclusion. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Educational stratification and social change: Evidence from German unification;This research examines educational stratification over the course of German unification. During this transition, eastern German states experienced rapid educational restructuring and expansion of the upper secondary curriculum in the context of dramatic macro-level changes. The analysis, based on German Social Survey (ALLBUS) data, explores educational inequality at the secondary-school level with respect to social origins over the course of unification, comparing four settings: the pre-unification German Democratic Republic and Federal Republic of Germany, and eastern and western states of a now-united Germany. Empirical findings suggest widespread similarities in educational inequality between East and West Germany among cohorts schooled in the 1980s. Among those schooled in the 1990s, the two regions diverge somewhat more as the result of a moderate decline in the effects of social origins in eastern states.
Moments of inclusion and exclusion: Pupils negotiating classroom contexts;This paper uses evidence from a small-scale study of two English primary school classrooms to examine school inclusion in its political contexts. We argue that 'inclusion' and 'exclusion' are complex processes, enacted moment-by-moment by pupils and teachers. Our focus is on the pupils' negotiation of these moments, and we examine how their negotiations are contingent on (although not determined by) a web of intersecting indices of 'difference' including differences of social class, ethnicity gender/sexuality, perceived academic ability and physical appearance. We take a post-structuralist approach, well-known in feminist educational research but less often used in research and thinking about 'inclusive' schooling to foreground children's active role in making sense of social conditions that are not of their own making or choice. We conclude that a politically literate understanding of the processes of inclusion and exclusion is necessary both to highlight the continuing reproduction of educational inequality, and to produce the necessary conditions for egalitarian change.
On educational inequality;
"Trends in social inequality in self-reported health in the Netherlands; does infant mortality in year of birth as a cohort indicator matter?";In this article, we study trends in self-reported health (general health and chronic conditions) and health inequality in the Netherlands between 1974 and 1998 using an age-period-cohort framework. We answer two questions: (1) to what extent can trends in self-reported health be explained by the current macro-context (period effect) and by infant mortality in year of birth (cohort effect)? And (2) do the effects of period and cohort differ for educational groups? Health indicators are self-reported poor health and chronic conditions. The use of 26 Dutch cross-sectional surveys makes it possible to estimate largely unbiased effects of period and cohort simultaneously (controlled for age effects) and thus to adequately describe trends in social inequality in health. Our results give rise to four conclusions. First, for men poor health has been more or less stable, for women there has been an increase. The prevalence of chronic conditions has increased for both sexes. Second, adding cohort specific experiences to a model including age and period effects is only relevant for women's poor health. Decreasing infant mortality in year of birth leads to better health and consequently the period effect initially found for women appears to be slightly underestimated. Third, we found no trends in social inequalities in self-reported health due to period effects. Fourth, our analyses do show socially unequal trends in health as a result of cohort specific experiences. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that decreased infant mortality in year of birth makes for a stronger impact of educational differences on self-reported poor health. Concerning chronic conditions no trends for educational groups were found. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
Gender-role attitudes among Egyptian adolescents;"Using nationally representative survey data, this study explores gender-role attitudes among unmarried adolescents aged 16-19 in Egypt, a society characterized by distinct and often segregated roles for men and women. Adolescents' views about desirable qualities in a spouse as well as more direct indicators of gender-role attitudes are examined, including opinions about whether wives. should defer to their husbands, share in household decision making, and have the responsibility for performing domestic tasks. The findings regarding spousal characteristics reflect strong gender differentiation. Girls, and boys provide divergent profiles of an ideal spouse, profiles that reflect traditional gender roles. Girls are significantly less likely than-boys to favor educational inequality between spouses, however. Neither boys nor girls have egalitarian gender-role attitudes, although girls are significantly more likely to express less traditional attitudes. Multivariate analyses indicate that girls' and boys' attitudes do not vary consistently and significantly by socioeconomic background; in particular, increased schooling does not always promote egalitarian attitudes. The implications of these findings are discussed."
Educational expansion and persistent inequalities of education - Utilizing subjective expected utility theory to explain increasing participation rates in upper secondary school in the Federal Republic of Germany;This investigation attempts to answer the question why more and more parents have chosen the Gymnasium for their children's secondary school education in post-war West Germany. Based on the theory of subjective expected utility, the crucial mechanisms of parental educational decisions have been emphasized. From this perspective it is assumed that increasing educational motivation coupled with changes in the subjective evaluation of the cost-benefit of education were important conditions for an increasing participation in upper secondary schools. These were, however, in turn, the result of educational expansion. The empirical analyses for three time-periods in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s confirm these assumptions to a large degree. Additionally, empirical evidence was found to suggest that in addition to the intentions of parents and the educational career of their children, structural moments of educational expansion and their own inertia played an important role in the pupils' transition from one educational level to the next. Finally, evidence was found that persistent class-specific educational inequality stems from a constant balance in the relative cost-benefit advantages between social classes as well as from an increasing difference of primary origin effect between social classes in the realization of their educational choice.
EGALITARIANISM VERSUS SOCIAL REPRODUCTION: STRATIFICATION IN EASTERN EUROPE;This study examines educational inequalities under socialism in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Russia to assess the extent to which egalitarianism was achieved and whether there was restratification after the common retreat from egalitarian ideology and practices since the 1970s. Exploring the extent of parental influences in three key educational outcomes and their changes in four birth cohorts, the study finds remarkable stability across cohorts and across transitions. Contrary to expectation, the net effect of parental social capital (communist party membership status) is prominent only in the former Soviet Russia and Bulgaria, moderate in Czechoslovakia, and negligible in Hungary and Poland. On the other hand, the effect of parental cultural capital is consistently strong but its influence is somewhat weaker at higher transitions. Its inclusion also dramatically reduces the effect of parental education and father's occupation, suggesting that a significant extent of intergenerational transmission of educational inequality is mediated through parental cultural capital rather than human capital per se.
Black-white income inequality and metropolitan socioeconomic structure;We draw on leading theories about the structural causes of racial inequality in the US to investigate inter-metropolitan differences in white and black per capita income. The analysis, which is based on a sample of 112 metropolitan areas and uses 1990 census data, examines the influence of spatial, economic, and demographic factors on black-white income inequality. Our results show severe income inequality between blacks and whites in most metropolitan areas, with black per capita income being 55% of white per capita income, on average. We find that racial educational inequality and unemployment differences were the strongest predictors of racially based income inequality. We also find that metropolitan areas that are highly ranked on a business and financial dominance hierarchy have the most interracial income inequality. However, when a metropolitan area has a high level of manufacturing employment vis-a-vis low service employment it has less income inequality. We discuss the implications of these and other findings for theories about, and public policy regarding, urban inequality.
Disparities within: Unequal spending and urban school achievement in an district;The debate over whether educational spending shapes achievement has persisted for decades, largely because of methodological and analytical limitations associated with the use of district-level data. In this study, the authors analyzed unique within-district variations in spending and achievement among 89 public elementary schools in a large, North Central, urban district. The analyses reveal considerable disparities in spending within the district, which are linked to local patterns of racial and class stratification and concentration. They show how these locally driven inequalities and their links to specific school resources have consequences for achievement in five distinct subject areas. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of their findings for understanding the local production of class and racial educational inequality and recent moves toward resegregation that are evident in many U.S. cities.
The reproduction of cultural capital;Conflict theoretical approaches in the sociology of education have emphasized the importance of cultural capital for the reproduction of class structures. In recent years several scholars - especially Gerhard Schulze - have stressed the point that the traditional theoretical perspective in regard to cultural capital is too narrow. In modern society multiple lifestyles and corresponding types of cultural capital have developed. We have used data from surveys of school students, firstly to analyze the intergenerational reproduction of different types of cultural capital and, secondly, to study the impact of these forms of cultural capital on school success. We come to the conclusion that high-brow culture continues to be strongly reproduced intergenerationally and that only this kind of cultural capital is relevant for school success. With regard to the reproduction of social structure other types of cultural capital seem to have less of an impact.
Democratization or increase in educational inequality? Changes in the length of studies in France, 1988-1998;
'Stigmatization by negative selection' - Explaining less-educated people's decreasing employment opportunities;The displacement argument is the dominant explanation for the phenomenon of trained individuals out-qualifying the less educated in job competition. Decreasing employment opportunities are seen as a labour-market matching problem. The explanation given in this paper is 'stigmatization by negative selection'. It takes into account that educational expansion has not only changed the number of less-educated people, but also the 'quality' of the less-educated group - due to changes in its group composition caused by increasing selection in the educational system, employers' perceptions, and ultimately employers' human resource management of this group. Thus, shrinking employment opportunitities for less-educated people are not only derived from distributional but behavioural changes. Whereas the displacement argument is mainly based on labour-market disequilibrium in terms of quantity, the 'stigma by selection' argument considers qualitative changes in this relationship between individuals and their environment. The ranking process is expanded into a 'sorting-out' process for the less-educated group which begins in school. The main argument is that following educational expansion, employers increasingly trust the sorting function of schools and teachers' evaluation, resulting in an exclusion of the less well educated. The empirical findings based on West German data correspond to the theoretical reasoning of the 'stigma by selection' argument.
Her mother's daughter? The over-time and life course dynamics of mothers' occupational status transfer for daughters in West-Germany and the Netherlands;In analyses that deal with occupational mobility the question as to how the mother's occupational status influences the process of occupational status attainment usually is passed over. Here we formulate hypotheses on over-time and life course dynamics of tier influence: mothers' (and fathers') status transfer for cohorts of daughters born between 1927 and 1965 and additionally for labour market careers. Sons are excluded in the analytical model because the mother's job appears not to be important for their job status locations. The hypotheses are tested in a cluster adjusted regression analysis. The German database contains 4043 job Spells of 17 60 women and the two pooled Dutch sets of data include 4513 job spells of 1623 female respondents. Our results show that in recent decennia the influence of the occupational status of both parents on their daughter's job status has decreased in a similar fashion. We conclude that a continuing trend towards a decrease of social inequality in the process of occupational status attainment is applicable to the influence of the father and the mother. Over the course of the daughter's career, however, her occupational status becomes increasingly related to that of her mother, This result indicates that the occupational role model of the mother seems to be important for understanding patterns of female occupational immobility.
The dark engine of Illinois education: A sociological critique of a well-crafted (testing) machine;"The authors examine a high-stakes assessment system that will assign designation ranks to Illinois schools on the basis of students' raw scores on the state's achievement tests. The state's own data are analyzed to show that ranks have little to do with actual school performance; 80% of the variance in schools' test scores is due to factors that teachers can neither control nor change. Designations will generate widespread, large-scale goal displacement bl schools; substantially increase educational inequality; and most likely face a court challenge as a ''suspect racial classification under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."
Class, 'ability' and attainment: a problem for the sociology of education;The sociology of education has an ambivalent relationship with IQ and 'ability' tests. Same accounts of educational inequality incorporate measures of intelligence, others restrict their explanations to the 'sociological' rather than the 'psychological' variance, and still others reject psychometric theory in its entirety subjecting it to a vigorous critique. There are evident contradictions in this area. Studies that show, environmental (rather than genetic) effects on 'ability' test scores and school attainment are welcomed while 'ability' is nevertheless regarded as a 'social construct'. Standardised tests produced within the psychometric paradigm are employed in certain research applications even as their theoretical rationale is dismissed. It is argued that this situation is unsatisfactory and that a realist account of cognitive socialisation based on the work of Bernstein and Vygotsky would represent an advance in our capacity to explain social differences in educational attainment.
Education and stratification in developing countries: A review of theories and research;"This review examines research on education and inequality in developing regions. In tracing the progress of this field of inquiry, it focuses on empirical studies of educational inequality in four broad areas: macro-structural forces shaping education and stratification; the relationship between family background and educational outcomes; school effects; and education's impact on economic and social mobility. It assesses the contributions of research in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to the general study of education and social stratification and the theoretical leverage gained from examining stratification processes in developing regions of the world. Finally, the review discusses recent developments that hold promise for addressing the knowledge gaps that remain; these include utilizing relatively new data sources and methods in comparative, cross-national studies and greater collaboration between researchers who study strikingly similar questions but remain segregated due to their focus on either industrialized or developing societies."
Bridges to the future: The contributions of qualitative research to the sociology of education;"This article considers how qualitative research, conducted from an interpretive perspective, has enhanced knowledge of four substantive topics in the sociology of education: educational inequality, socialization and identity formation, school organization, and educational policy. In each area, qualitative studies have generated contextualized, process-sensitive knowledge and have introduced new voices, perspectives, and themes into traditional understanding. This research may enable the sociology of education to meet four additional challenges: generating theoretically rich examinations of schools as organizations; addressing issues of culture and education; developing broader social analyses of schooling and society; and incorporating perspectives on learning as situated, sociocultural activity into the study of schools as contexts for teaching and learning. Two aspects of the qualitative research tradition pose particular dilemmas and opportunities for sociology of education. First, qualitative research brings the sociology of education closer to the worlds of policy and practice, which may mute its critical voice. Second, since the sociology of education has been informed by qualitative research conducted from interdisciplinary vantage points and by researchers who do not identify themselves as sociologists, the boundaries of the field are permeable and fluid."
American schooling and educational inequality: A forecast for the 21st century;Inequality among different socioeconomic and racial groups was a salient subject for sociology of education in the 20th century. What will happen to educational inequality in the 21st century? On the basis of past trends and the assumption that the American educational system will remain largely stable, this article offers predictions about educational inequality over the next hundred years. First, it foresees a decline in black-white racial inequality. This prediction would continue a trend that occurred during the past hundred years and is consistent with current knowledge about the sources of racial inequality in educational outcomes. Although racial inequality in education is expected to decline, corresponding changes in labor market inequality may be much weaker. Second, educational inequality by socioeconomic background is expected to persist at current levels throughout the next century. This prediction is also based on past trends, which indicate that socioeconomic inequality is maximally maintained: Privileged groups protect their advantages until virtually all members reach a given status, at which point the axis of inequality shifts upward to another level of educational outcome. Relaxing the overall assumption of stability raises questions about the predictions.
Social origin and educational participation. Empirical analyses of educational inequality by social origin from 1950 to 1989;Researchers on educational inequality dispute whether the development of the educational system and the different educational reforms that have taken place in Germany since the 1960s have led to a reduction of the effects of social background on educational participation. The empirical analyses of this question requires the use of large samples of official microdata on participation of education for 14 to 18-year-old students. Further, this paper deals with the so far hardly considered question whether the sequential logit model that was suggested for the analysis of educational inequality in the US can also be used for the analysis of the educational inequality in the German tripartite educational system. The empirical results show that educational participation is still closely connected to social background. In addition, statistically significant changes took place between 1950 and 1989 that led to a reduction of inequality. This particularly applies to the odds of attending a middle or upper secondary school in place of a lower secondary school. This dismantling of inequality is closely connected with the declining effects of the occupational position of the head of the family. However, regarding the odds of attending upper versus middle secondary school, inequality by and large remains unchanged.
They cannot master abstractions, but they can often be made efficient workers: Race and class in the intelligence testing of Mexican Americans and African Americans in Texas during the 1920s;The performance of minorities such as Mexican Americans and African Americans became a central preoccupation of the American scientific community in the early twentieth century. During the 1920s the state educational establishment of Texas and its IQ researchers tested what they believed to be the intelligence of white, Mexican American, and African American children. They concluded that there existed a hierarchy of racial intelligence-whites at the top, African Americans at the bottom, and Mexican Americans in a tenuous middle position influenced by class and skin color. Much like that of their colleagues in the national IQ research community, the work of the Texas researchers exhibited racist preconceptions and numerous methodological errors. Ironically, the current reliance on standardized test scores in the selection process for Texas schools and scholarships is now under legal challenge by minority groups arguing that present-day achievement tests are racist and serve to replicate educational inequality and cultural bias, much like the IQ tests of the 1920s.
Social class and the choice of education. An empirical application of the subjective expected utility theory;This empirical study seeks to contribute to the explanation of class differences in educational opportunities in the transition from primary to secondary education. According to recent theoretical explanations the social inequality in education results - apart from the historical conditions and institutions of the educational system - from rational choices of parents about the continuation of their children's education. There is a nexus between class specific evaluation of costs and benefits of higher education and educational choice, which depends on the parents' resources and the selection and allocation function of the educational system. This interrelationship results in unequal educational attainment among the children of different social classes. These hypotheses are tested by employing a two-step model of the dynamics of choices and actual transition. Using panel data and logistic regression as well as considering the children's social origin the rise of educational aspirations and the following transition to higher education cracks are analyzed. The results lend support to the mechanisms and processes assumed by the subjective expected utility approach. However, there is an open question about the historical persistence of class differences in education in spite of educational expansion and school reforms.
Family structure, parental perceptions, and child labor in Kenya: What factors determine who is enrolled in school?;This article combines status attainment research with research on values and beliefs to understand educational stratification in Kenya. With household survey data, I examine the impact of family background and structure, division of household labor, and parental perceptions on children's educational participation. Parents' expectations for future Financial help from children and perceptions of labor-market discrimination against women are significant determinants of children's enrollment. Patriarchal norms and child labor have no effect. Educational inequalities are better understood as due to the evaluation of returns to education and household resource constraints than as due to gender stereotypes or reliance on child labor. The results challenge traditional explanations of educational inequality in less industrialized societies and suggest that policies to spark school demand in developing countries may be misguided.
Stratification in academic secondary programs and educational inequality in Israel and the United States;
Trends in educational inequality in Brazil;Even today, Brazil's educational indicators are only slightly better than those of the poorest countries in Latin America. Nevertheless, the slow but continuous expansion in schooling in the last two decades has increased the Brazilian population's educational level and decreased inequality according to region, color, gender, and income bracket. By breaking down the explanatory factors for educational improvement, this study suggests, as a conservative estimate, that approximately 60% of this improvement is due to changes in living conditions and the geographic distribution of families resulting from urbanization and the demographic transition, with the remaining 40% due to actual improvements in the educational system's performance.
Educational inequality and ethnocentrism;The inverse relation between the level of education and ethnocentrism, right-wing authoritarianism or anti-semitism is one of the most robust empirical results to be found in contemporary survey research in Germany. The article refutes the critique that the emperical result is merely an artefact of method. The author enquires by which mechanisms schools might contribute to the observed result. Four possible mechanisms are identified: (1) that different schools differ in the degree of cognitive sophistication, (2) that they convey different levels of social competence to students, (3) that they impart different values, and (4) that they instill different levels of conformity. These mechanisms do not preclude one another, but may all be insolved in reducing or strengthening ethnocentrism.
The pipeline and student perceptions of schooling: Good news and bad news;The math/science pipeline in public schooling is best described as a phenomenon in which, beginning in late middle/junior high school, the number of female students, students with lower socioeconomic status and students of color in proportion to White male students in advanced math and science progressively shrinks during high school. This article shares the findings from a survey of high school students undertaken to determine the degree to which the nationally recognized pipeline phenomenon exists in five southwestern high schools. Through this study, the authors document a local instance of a national phenomenon. This is especially important in order to address some public school educators' perceptions that the national pipeline phenomenon somehow does not apply to their own schools. Thus, in this article, the authors aim to identify patterns of inequality that might exist in order to create a foundation from which to explore educational inequality more deeply.
Education policy and equality: Some evidence from Europe;Objective. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the European educational reforms of the past three decades have had the intended effect of reducing the impact of social class on educational achievement. Methods. Data from a variety of sources on the social origins of students in higher education in France, Sweden, Britain, and Germany, from the 1960s to the 1990s, are examined and compared, using, when data allow, a simple odds ratio. Results. We find that the expansion of secondary and higher education enrollments contributed to a modest decrease in the effect of social class of origin upon access to higher education when measured by the odds ratio. We find no clear evidence that comprehensivization has contributed to this trend. The trend disappears entirely when it is measured by the percentage difference between the participation rates of children of upper and lower classes. Conclusions. The modest decline in class inequality suggested by the odds ratio is largely offset by continuing social selection within the increasingly diverse structure of post-secondary education. In Europe, as in the United States, children of the working class are drawn disproportionately to the less noble tracks, thereby nullifying much of the effect of expansion on educational inequality.
Social origins and educational success in France;The central question of this study is to determine what role different characteristics of social origin play in educational achievement in France and to what extent educational inequality has changed in the course of the twentieth century. Within the context of the discussion of (in)equality in educational opportunity, the French educational system is a very interesting case: it is committed to the republican tenet of equality, from which both the principles of equal opportunity and the selection of a meritocracy are derived as guidelines for education policy. The empirical investigation is based on a secondary analysis of the survey Formation-Qualification-Professionnelle conducted by the French Office of Statistics. The results show that educational achievement in France depends to a significant degree on conditions of social origin. Contrary to the findings of the Shavit/Blossfeld project (1993), this paper shows that even though there has been some reduction in inequality due to social origin in participation rates for the hierarchical qualification levels in the French educational system, a more differentiated look at a variety of more or less prestigious educational pathways reveals that access to the most prestigious educational certificates continues to depend on social origin to an unchanging degree.
Dimensions of gender occupational differentiation in segregation and inequality: A cross-national analysis;The present research: (a) distinguishes between measures of gender occupational segregation and measures of gender occupational inequality, and (b) examines whether occupational segregation and occupational inequality are differentially related to structural characteristics of national labor markets. Analysis of data from 56 nations shows that measures of nominal segregation are not equivalent to measures of hierarchical inequality. Nominal segregation seems to increase with industrialization and in the presence of service industries but decreases as female labor force participation increases. By contrast, occupational inequality seems to decrease with industrialization and in the presence of service industries but to increase as both female labor force participation and level of educational inequality rise. The data further demonstrate that nominal segregation and ordinal status inequality are interrelated. Where nominal segregation is high, women's relative representation in high status occupations tends to rise. We argue that occupational segregation should not be equated with occupational inequality, and that theoretical propositions regarding gender-occupational segregation may not be applicable to issues concerning occupational inequality. We obtain a better understanding of, and insight into the nature of gender-occupational differentiation by simultaneously considering these two dimensions of gender-occupational differentiation.
The study of social interaction in educational settings: Accomplishments and unresolved issues;The study of face-to-face interaction in educational settings is placed in historical context. The major themes of interactional analysis - that social and cognitive structures are constructed in social interaction, human behavior is context-specific, cultural discontinuity helps explain educational inequality, and learning is a sociocultural process - are reviewed, and the contributions of these findings to theory, methodology and pedagogy are assessed. The paper concludes with a discussion of two unresolved issues: the integration of social structure and interaction in interactional analysis and the reconciliation of conflictual and consensual dimensions of learning.
The persistence of class origin inequalities among school leavers in the Republic of Ireland, 1984-1993;This paper examines changes in the relationship between class origins and the position young people occupy one year after finishing post-primary education in the Republic of Ireland over the period 1984-1993. We find that class differentials in the position occupied after leaving school do not change over time, although, among young women, the relationship between educational attainment and the position occupied does change slightly. We show that the reason why this latter change can co-occur with an absence of change in class differences is because class origin effects on the position a school leaver occupies one year after leaving school are substantially independent of educational attainment effects. In other words, class differences in how young people fare after leaving school are only weakly mediated by education. Other channels of class influence must therefore be operating, and their cumulative impact is much greater than that of class based educational inequalities.
Education and life expectancy in Germany. An empirical longitudinal study from a life-history perspective;In this study, the causal impact of education on life expectancy is investigated from a life-history perspective. Compulsory school education can be considered to be institutional capital for the duration of a life cycle. It contributes-together with education and training (economic captial) and general knowledge (cultural capital) acquired in the socialization process-to the postponement of mortality risks to the (relatively) later stages of life. The empirical analyses in this study are based on longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and German Life History Study for the period between 1871 and 1989. Cohort design and methods of event history analysis are used. Controlling for relevant social determinants, in particular, social class, the relationship between educational inequality and inequality of life expectancy is confirmed empirically, as is the long-term impact of education on the duration of life courses. On the one hand, increasing levels of education have contributed to a general increase in life histories. On the other hand, however, the persistence of inter-generational inequality of educational attainment is responsible for variations in life expectancy according to social status and class.

Differential fertility, intergenerational educational mobility, and racial inequality;Recent commentary has suggested that the relatively high fertility of poorly educated women tends to dampen the average intellectual qualifications of the population. To evaluate this claim requires a model of population growth that takes account of fertility differences among women with varying levels of educational attainment and patterns of intergenerational educational mobility. This article describes such a model and applies it to census, vital statistics, and survey data on fertility, mortality, and intergenerational mobility data for African-American and white women in the United States from 1925 to 1995. Although fertility rates are generally higher for women at the lower end of the educational distribution, this has had a negligible effect on the trend in average educational attainment. These fertility differences are neither large enough nor consistent enough to lower educational attainment. More important, high rates of intergenerational educational mobility almost completely offset the effects of differential fertility. Although black women have historically had more children than white women, fertility differences within and between the races have not had much effect impact on educational inequality between the races. Indeed, in the most recent period, only white women continue to exhibit a negative correlation between education and fertility. Thus, if recent fertility patterns persist, they will accelerate a convergence of educational attainment between blacks and whites. (C) 1997 Academic Press.
Explaining educational differentials - Towards a formal rational action theory;"In this paper we seek to provide an explanation of three widely documented empirical phenomena. These are: (i) increasing educational participation rates; (ii) little change in class differentials in these rates; and (iii) a recent and very rapid erosion of gender differentials in educational attainment levels. We develop a formal mathematical model, using a rational action approach and drawing on earlier work that seeks to explain these three trends as the product of individual decisions made in the light of the resources available to, and the constraints facing, individual pupils and their families. The model represents children and their families as acting rationally, i.e. as choosing among the different educational options available to them on the basis of evaluations of their costs and benefits and of the perceived probabilities of more or less successful outcomes. It then accounts for stability, or change, in the educational differentials that ensue by reference to a quite limited range of situational features. So, both class and gender differences in patterns of educational decisions are explained as the consequence of differences in resources and constraints. We do not, therefore, invoke 'cultural' or 'normative' differences between classes or genders to account for why they differ in their typical educational decisions (though we have something to say about the role of norms in such an account). Because the model is presented mathematically, testable corollaries are easy to derive as are other implications of our model for patterns of relevant behaviour."
'Spoilt for choice': The working classes and educational markets;"Drawing on data from an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded study of market forces in secondary education, this paper explores the ambivalence displayed by many working-class parents in the research to the idea of choice of school. School is frequently associated with powerful memories and images of personal failure. The authors argue: that for working-class parents choice can sometimes involve complex and powerful accommodations to the idea of 'school' and is very different in kind from middle-class choice making; that social class remains a potent differentiating category in the analysis of home-school relations; and that choice is a new social device through which social class differences are rendered into educational inequality. Extracts front interview data are quoted to support and illustrate these arguments."
The contribution of transfers between school types to the openness of the general educational system in Germany;In the (West)German school system, people can transfer from one type of secondary school to another under certain conditions. The paper provides analyses of such transitions based on the German Life History Study. It contains information about the (West)German birth cohorts from 1919-21, 1929-31, 1939-41, 1949-51, 1954-56, and 1959-61. The number of transfers between school types has risen considerably in the two youngest cohorts. While upward moves between school types dominate in the older cohorts, upward and downward moves were almost equally likely in the two youngest cohorts. In all the cohorts, transfers from the Volksschule, a general secondary school and from the academically oriented Gymnasium to other school types have contributed to the transmission of educational inequality from one generation to the next. The effects of social origin on changes from the Realschule, a ''middle'' type of secondary school, to other types of school were weak. The influence of social origin on changes from the Volksschule to other school types has weakened over cohorts, while the effects of social origin on changes from the Gymnasium to other school types have not decreased over cohorts.
Race, gender, and the role of education in earnings inequality: An introduction;This article serves as an introduction to an issue of the Economics of Education Review devoted to research on the role of education in explaining economic inequality among different ethnic/race and gender groups in national labor markets. The article admits that the broad nature of this topic implies that the research presented here is only a small sampling of the work being done worldwide. It argues nevertheless that these seven articles go beyond most in not only attempting to understand why individuals of certain ethnicities earn less or more than individuals from other groups and why men almost universally earn more than women, but in explaining why such ethnic and gender inequalities change over time, and what the role of educational inequality may have to do with these changes. The main contribution of the pieces, therefore, is in presenting alternative models and empirical data testing them for analyzing changing ethnic/gender inequalities worldwide. The articles cover Hong Kong, Israel, Peru, the Republic of Korea and the United States. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd
Self-help secondary education in Kenya;Diverse viewpoints on the role of education in the development of Third World countries have spawned a variety of theories of Third World education. Some scholars contend that Third World states are too weak and ''fragile'' to implement development programs for education, health, and other social services. This paper examines secondary education in Kenya with regard to issues of educational inequality and quality of education, emphasizing the role of civil society in the provision of education. The role of the state as a major actor in the provision of education, and additionally as a determinant of who gets the benefits from educational efforts of both the state and the civil society, is also discussed in detail. It is argued that despite the major expansion of secondary education, the overall provision of education remains inadequate in relation to equity considerations. Although impressive quantitative expansion has occurred, access to educational opportunities in Kenya is still not evenly distributed with respect to gender and region. With regard to regional inequalities in the provision of education, it clearly emerges from this analysis that educational benefits are distributed in favor of the economically and politically dominant districts and provinces in the country. It is argued that, despite the state's ceding of most of its influence on the educational arena to the civil society, educational outcomes are still largely determined, directly or indirectly, by structures instituted, or supported, by the state. The paper demonstrates how an intricate interplay of social, political, and economic factors has worked against the efforts of the state and the civil society to improve the quality of education and eradicate inequality in the provision of education in Kenya.
Educational inequality among white and Mexican-origin adolescents in the American southwest: 1990;Adolescents of Mexican origin complete fewer years of schooling than do non-Hispanic White adolescents. Researchers rt ho have focused on such factors as family background, English-language ability and migration history as explanations for this finding have often neglected the relationships among these factors. Using data from the 1990 Public Use Microdata Samples, this analysis integrates several explanations for the educationally disadvantaged position of Mexican-origin adolescents. Although family-background factors account best for ethnic-group differences in adolescents' success in school, English-language ability and migration history are also associated with adolescents' schooling outcomes. However, English-language ability and migration history do relatively little to explain the gap in schooling outcomes between Mexican-origin and non-Hispanic White adolescents. Finally even after all these factors are taken into account, adolescents of Mexican origin are still at an educational disadvantage relative to non-Hispanic White adolescents in the final years of high school.
Educational expansion and educational inequality on income distribution;This study examines the effects of educational variables on income distribution using cross-section data covering 59 countries. The empirical results show that a higher level of educational attainment of the labor force has an equalizing effect on income distribution, while the larger the dispersion of educational attainment among the labor force, the greater the income inequality. It is also found that the dispersion of schooling among the labor force has a much greater disequalizing effect on income equality than previous studies have suggested.
Teacher quality and inequality;
Equal opportunity and educational expansion?;This paper presents a new empirical analysis of the changes in educational inequality in (West)Germany. It is based on the life history data of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Education in Berlin (cohorts 1919-21, 1929-31, 1939-41, 1949-51, 1954-56 and 1959-61) which allows an exact reconstruction of the interviewees' school careers. Concerning the effects of social origin, we observe a decline of inequality over cohorts. This is true for the decision to attend a middle or upper secondary school (boys and girls) as well as for completion of an occupational qualification (girls) but not for the decision between a middle and an upper secondary school. Concerning the effects of region, we observe a declining difference between the choice of schooltype after primary education in cities and in the country. But the differences between north and south remain for this decision. The difference between city and country reverses for the occupational qualification of girls: For the younger cohorts, the girls living in cities are less likely to finish occupational training.
Social structure, political institutions, and mobilization potential;The increasingly diverse set of issues that form the basis of both traditional and nontraditional political activity has been attributed to the structural changes occurring in postindustrial societies. In the social movement literature, surprisingly lit tie attention has been paid to the specific ways in which social structure, rather than structural change, impacts interest formation and interest articulation. In this article I argue that some forms of structural differentiation promote distributions of interests in which some interests cannot effectively be channelled into electoral politics. Variables measuring the structural differentiation of Colorado counties, in income inequality, educational inequality, ethnic heterogeneity, and industrial heterogeneity, are used to examine the relationship or the ''fit'' between party voting and voting on ballot initiatives concerning social or cultural issues.
INEQUALITIES IN EDUCATIONAL FINANCING;There are sharp inequalities in school financing. The disparity is even more profound given the inverse relationship between per-pupil expenditures and actual educational need. Education, moreover, competes with other major entitlement programs for increasingly scarcer funding resources. Equality in educational financing is a worthy goal but it does not confront the basic cause of educational inequality. Fear of school integration perpetuates the existence of a multiplicity of school districts. This substantially increases the burden to fund education and ultimately costs society dearly.
EDUCATIONAL-INEQUALITY IN ADULT MORTALITY - AN ASSESSMENT WITH DEATH CERTIFICATE DATA FROM MICHIGAN;Education was added to the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death in 1989. The current study uses Michigan's 1989-1991 death certificates, together with the 1990 Census, to evaluate the quality of data on education from death certificates and to examine educational differences in mortality rates. With log-rates modeling, we systematically analyze the variability in educational differences in mortality by race and sex across the adult life cycle. The relative differences in mortality rates between educational levels decline with age at the same pace for all sex and race categories. Women gain a slightly greater reduction in mortality than men by reaching the secondary-education level, but a modestly smaller reduction by advancing beyond it. Blacks show a reduction in predicted mortality rates comparable to whites' by moving from the secondary to the postsecondary level of education but experience less reduction than whites by moving from the primary to the secondary level. Thus, the secular decline in mortality rates that generally accompanies historical improvements in education might actually be associated with an increase in the relative differences between blacks' and whites' mortality. We discuss limitations of the data and directions for future research.
ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION;The decade of the 1980s was a period of intense educational reform, with emphasis on equalized funding, higher standards, and testing. inadequate results from these reforms have prompted educators to reach deeper into the mechanisms that produce educational inequality, focusing on the goals of program equity and program adequacy. However this strategy contains the misconception that educational equality may be achieved solely by focusing on what goes on within schools. Output goals for schools must be tied to explicit programs and standards to create a level playing field by raising up the schools serving the poor and knocking down barriers that stratify educational opportunity by race and class.
PERMISSIVE SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL-INEQUALITY 40 YEARS AFTER BROWN;
SOCIAL CHANCE AND EDUCATIONAL-INEQUALITY;Using data from several independent sources the contribution investigates the development of educational inequalities in Germany for men and women born in the period from 1910 to 1969. With the availability of data including more recent birth cohorts it now becomes possible to evaluate more adequately the consequences of educational expansion for the inequality structure in the educational system. In contrast to the widely held thesis of constant educational inequalities, the results indicate a remarkable decrease in the differences of educational attainment and educational participation between social classes - a trend which started in the years between the wars and continued in the post-war period. As demonstrated by the analysis of grade progression probabilities at different educational levels, the reduced social selectivity can mainly be attributed to a decreasing impact of social origin at the transition from lower secondary to intermediate or higher secondary education. Consequently however, we also observe decreasing inequalities at higher educational levels what concerns the attainment of higher secondary- and tertiary qualifications. The investigation further reveals that the reduction of educational inequalities varies according to different periods of time and that the dimensions and family characteristics related to that trend are not of equal importance. The contribution concludes by discussing specific hypotheses potentially explaining parts of the observed results.
INDUSTRIALIZATION AND RACIAL-INEQUALITY IN EMPLOYMENT - THE BRAZILIAN EXAMPLE;"In Brazil, the relationship between industrialization and racial inequality has been central to the discussion of post-Abolition race relations because the country has had high levels of racial inequality along with rapid but uneven industrialization. I examine how racial inequality in occupations varies with levels of industrialization across 74 Brazilian metropolitan areas in 1980. I find that industrialized areas have lower occupational inequality overall and especially in blue-collar occupations; but at higher occupational levels, racial inequality is either greater or is unaffected by industrialization. These results persist despite controls for the percent nonwhite in the population and educational inequality. Thus, this study supports the conventional view that race loses salience to class as industrial development increases, but only for blue-collar occupations; inequality at the white-collar level is unaffected or even increases with industrialization. Increased educational opportunity has effects on inequality similar to those of industrialization. Implications for Brazilian race relations are discussed."
EDUCATIONAL-INEQUALITY AND ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE;
PERMANENT INEQUALITIES - CHANGES IN THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL BACKGROUND ON EDUCATIONAL-OPPORTUNITY IN 13 INDUSTRIAL-NATIONS;The authors report the results of an international comparative project in which changes in educational inequality in thirteen industrialized countries were systematically analyzed. The nations included in this analysis reflect a wide range of important constellations of background variables regarding the level of industrial modernization, culture, the political system, historical development, and different basic types of school systems. The countries compared are the United States, the former Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Taiwan, Japan, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Israel. The main result of the analysis is that in eleven of these thirteen extremely different countries the impact of social background on educational opportunity has hardly changed - despite the fact that the lower social strata increasingly participate in education. On the basis of these findings, the authors argue that educational expansion is in fact one of the decisive prerequisites for the continuing social inequality in educational opportunity.
SCHOOL SEGREGATION - MANAGED INTEGRATION OR FREE CHOICE;As the proportion of immigrant minorities has increased in Dutch cities there has been a corresponding increase in the levels of minority versus Dutch pupil segregation in the schools. At the same time the levels of segregation in residential neighborhoods has remained stable. A specific analysis of school attendance patterns in Amsterdam shows that the reason for the increasing segregation in schools is that there is a strong tendency to choose schools of the same ethnicity. The choices both by Dutch and by immigrant parents are serving to increase levels of separation but until there is evidence of educational inequality as a result we argue policy intervention should proceed with caution. The current government approach is to provide supplementary funding to 'minority schools' rather than to assign children to schools.
