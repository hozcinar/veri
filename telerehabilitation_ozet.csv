Telerehabilitation-the use of telecommunications technology to provide rehabilitation and long-term support to people with disabililies-offers exciting possibilities for the delivery and support of assistive technology services. This article describes the experiences of a specialty hospital serving persons with disabilities in exploring telerehabilitation to support assistive technology use in the home. Four case studies are presented to illustrate how telerehabilitation may be used in relation to seating evaluation, evaluation of home accessibility, setup of computer access systems, and training in use of augmentative communication devices.;1998;1
A PC-based orthopedic rehabilitation system was developed for use at home, while allowing for remote monitoring from the clinic. The home rehabilitation station has a Pentium II PC with graphics accelerator, Polhemus tracker, and a novel Multipurpose Haptic Control Interface with its own Pentium board. This interface is used to sample patient's hand positions and to provide resistive forces using the Rutgers Master II (RMII) glove. A library of virtual rehabilitation routines was developed using WorldToolKit software. At the present time, it consists of two physical therapy exercises (DigiKey and Ball) and two functional rehabilitation exercises (Peg Board test and Ball game). All VR exercises allow automatic and transparent patient data collection into an Oracle database. A remote Pentium II PC is connected with the home-based PC over the Internet and an additional videoconferencing connection. The remote computer running Oracle server is used to maintain the patient database, monitor progress and change exercise level of difficulty. This allows for timely patient progress monitoring and repeat evaluations over time from the Clinic. The system will soon start clinical trails at Stanford Medical School, with progress being monitored remotely from Rutgers University. Other rehabilitation haptic interfaces under development include devices for elbow, and knee rehabilitation connected to the Multipurpose Haptic Control Interface.;1999;1
Human factors engineering and system design are critical elements in the newly developing field of telerehabilitation. Telerehabilitation is the remote delivery of rehabilitative services such as monitoring, training, and long-term care of persons with disabilities using telecommunications technology. This paper describes projects at the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) on Telerehabilitation in the context of three conceptual models: telecounseling and training, telemonitoring and assessment, and teletherapy. Issues pertaining to human factors engineering design are identified, and ongoing challenges are discussed.;1999;1
"In the last three years, the delivery of rehabilitation services at a distance by means of electronic information and communication technologies has come to be known as telerehabilitation. It is part of both the larger spectrum of telemedicine activities that have waxed, waned and waxed again since the early seventies; and the growing array of non-medical applications of consumer electronics and communication technology that can provide tele-enhancement of independent living for individuals with neurological and other disabilities. While telerehabilitation is still largely hypothetical, activities are underway at several clinical rehabilitation centers. Most commonly, inexpensive video phone connections are used to provide face-to-face two-way image and voice contact between patient and provider, but transmission of data from sensors that monitor health and rehabilitation is technically feasible and promising. Telerehabilitation provides access to quality services for patients who are immobile or geographically remote from direct service. Some view it as a means of compensating for shortened lengths of stay in acute rehabilitation hospitals, while others emphasize the cost reductions it offers. Telerehabilitation methods, both current and in-the-works, are promising but it remains to be seen whether and how the reimbursement policy-makers at HCFA and private payers will respond to its potential.";1999;1
This paper presents an overview of a group of research and development projects that constitute the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) on Telerehabilitation, at Catholic University of America and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington, D.C., and Sister Kenny institute in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This RERC's purpose is to improve the delivery of rehabilitative services to persons who live in rural areas or who for other reasons cannot easily travel to rehabilitation hospitals. More broadly, its goal is to explore the utility of telecommunications and emerging virtual reality technologies for the benefit of persons with disabilities.;1999;1
A PC-based orthopedic rehabilitation system was developed for use at home, while allowing remote monitoring from the clinic. The home rehabilitation station has a Pentium IT PC with graphics accelerator, a Polhemus tracker, and a multipurpose haptic control interface. This novel interface is used to sample a patient's hand positions and to provide resistive forces using the Rutgers Master II (RMII) glove. A library of virtual rehabilitation routines was developed using WorldToolKit software, At the present time, it consists of three physical therapy exercises (DigiKey, ball, and power putty) and two functional rehabilitation exercises (peg board and ball game). These virtual reality exercises allow automatic and transparent patient data collection into an Oracle database. A remote Pentium II PC is connected with the home-based PC over the Internet and an additional video conferencing connection, The remote computer is running an Oracle server to maintain the patient database, monitor progress, and change the exercise level of difficulty, This allows for patient progress monitoring and repeat evaluations over time. The telerehabilitation system is in clinical trails at Stanford Medical School (CA), with progress being monitored from Rutgers University (NJ), Other haptic interfaces currently under development include devices for elbow and knee rehabilitation connected to the same system.;2000;1
"As the delivery of healthcare services within our society changes, new challenges and opportunities emerge. It is suggested that an opportunity is unfolding that could move motion analysis approaches into a new clinical practice paradigm. This involves taking advantage of emerging advances in information technologies and communications standards, and of upcoming societal investment in wireless and intelligent systems technologies. To effectively design systems that address clinical needs, certain barriers need to be overcome; strategies are suggested.";2000;1
Modem telecommunication technology (telematics) has the potential to improve the quality of life for elders with physical and mental impairments as well as for their care giving relatives. Videophones, internet resources, and multimedia computers can be used for networking them together with social workers, nurse practitioners, physicians and therapeutic staff in service-centers. This can be viewed as a unique opportunity to establish and maintain instant and personalized access to various medical services in a situation where increasing needs are opposed to decreasing resources. However, it is not yet clear whether telematics is adequate, efficient, and effective in supporting care for geriatric patients. Some studies already showed its applicability and feasibility, but there are still no larger trials showing that maintenance or enhancement of autonomy can be achieved effectively by using new technologies. This article reviews the literature on telematics in geriatrics and presents data of a tele-rehabilitation project (TeleReha, conducted at the Berlin Geriatric Center) which comprised mobility-impaired patients (N=13, mean age 72 yrs), care giving relatives (N=8), and geriatric professionals. Networking was established using ISDN technology with videophones or PC-based videoconferencing systems. Results showed that participants regard telecommunication devices as a valuable resource for their informational and communicational needs. Use of telecommunication systems was inversely related to physical mobility. Having access to professional service and counselling was rated highly important but also the opportunity to establish reliable contacts with non-professionals (relatives, other participants). Despite experienced technical problems, use of telecommunication systems was evaluated more positively in the post-test as compared to the pre-test. In summary, current experience suggests that telematics can be used efficiently by geriatric patients and by relatives and professionals caring for them. However, evidence for a medically and economically effective use is still scarce. A lack of structural and organizational concepts for geriatric telematics initiatives can be identified which in part may be due to the fact that the considerable potentials of telematics applications are still largely unrecognized by geriatricians.;2000;1
Rehabilitation interventions in remote areas are problematic because of distance and available resources. Orthopedic impairments acquired by individuals in remote areas can then lead to permanent disabilitles/loss of function because of lack of appropriate rehabilitation. A system being developed by Rutgers and Stanford Universities provides therapy at the patient's home, with remote monitoring and periodic re-assessment. This telerehabilitation system uses virtual reality and haptic interfaces, and a pair of networked PCs. It is intended for rehabilitation of patients with hand, elbow, knee and ankle impairements. Data from the first patient treated with the telerehabilitation system is encouraging.;2000;1
Telerehabilitation is defined as the application of multimedia technologies to deliver rehabilitation services to consumers at a distance - and to support independent living for individuals with disabilities. The panelists are members of the r&d team of the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) on Telerehabilitation, the center on this topic funded in October, 1998 by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR). They address the challenges to universal usability posed by the diversity of consumers and professionals in telerehab, illustrating their comments with their own projects. They also take part in a real-time design-for-usability exercise and engage the audience in their deliberations.;2000;1
There have been several recent advances in wheelchair technology that could bring about greater mobility for people with disabilities and people who are elderly. These advances are dependent upon the proliferation of computing technology (both hardware and software), and developments in materials and their manufacturing processes. While the new designs of mobility products and the commercial experimentation with robotics technology for personal mobility are exciting, the delivery of these products to people in diverse and distributed environments must also be addressed. Telerehabilitation may provide a means for the limited expertise in the advances in mobility products to become available on a large scale.;2000;1
We established a telerehabilitation system to link staff at the University of Alberta with clinicians and students located in Two Hills, a rural community approximately 180 km east of Edmonton. From February 1996 to March 1999, the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine conducted a total of 254 telehealth sessions, most of which involved participants in the rehabilitation discipline. Of these connections, only 11 were unsuccessful owing to technical or telecommunication problems (i.e. 96% were successful). The average duration of a session was 1 h 15 min. There were benefits to the Faculty in the areas of clinical supervision of students, clinical consultation, undergraduate and graduate education as well as professional development. The future benefits of such an initiative will depend on how well we address challenges pertaining to training, human resource and infrastructure.;2000;1
A data glove is a typical input device to control a virtual environment. At the same time it measures movements of wrist and fingers. The purposes of this investigation were to assess the ability of BrainMaker (TM), a neural network, to recognize movement patterns during an opposition task that consisted of repetitive self-paced movements of the fingers in opposition to the thumb. The neural network contained 56 inputs, 3 hidden layers of 20 neurons, and one output. The 5th glove '95 (TM) (5DT), a commercial glove especially designed for virtual reality games, was used for finger motion capture. The training of the neural network was successful for recognizing the thumb, the index finger and the ring finger movements during the repetitive self-paced movements and neural network performed well during testing.;2001;1
Brain injury as a result of stroke and trauma is a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Unfortunately, little technology is currently available for individuals with brain injury to practice and monitor therapy on their own at home. This paper describes an inexpensive robotic telerehabilitation system for arm and hand therapy following brain injury. Java Therapy is a Web site with a library of evaluation and therapy activities. The activities can be performed with a commercial force feedback joystick, and the joystick can physically assist or resist in movement as the user performs therapy. The system also provides quantitative feedback of movement performance, allowing users and their caregivers to assess rehabilitation progress via the Web.;2001;1
The potential of modern telecommunications and computing technologies as tools in the delivery and evaluation of assistive technology (AT) has been discussed and has been termed telerehabilitation. The problems of providing AT in rural areas parallels the delivery of health care to rural areas where the proportion of people with chronic illnesses is higher and the means to pay for them is reduced. Large distances mean long travel times, increasing costs associated with any service delivered and consuming valuable tune skilled professionals could be rising to provide services elsewhere. The technology available for practicing telerehabilitation is significant and expanding at a rapid rate. Currently, plain old telephone systems (POTS) and broad-band videoconferencing equipment, Internet and World Wide Web, and embedded processor systems are most widely available. These technologies continue to evolve as well as emerging technologies such as wearable sensors that will have telerehabilitation applications. Issues of payment, safety, liability. and licensure need to be resolved, as legislation lags the development of new technologies.;2001;1
The Rutgers Ankle is a Stewart platform-type haptic interface designed for use in rehabilitation. The system supplies six-DOF resistive forces in response to virtual reality-based exercises running on a host PC. The Stewart platform uses double-acting pneumatic cylinders, linear potentiometers as position sensors, and a six-DOF force sensor. The Rutgers Ankle controller contains an embedded Pentium board, pneumatic solenoid valves, valve controllers, and associated signal conditioning electronics. Communication with the host PC is over a standard RS232 line. The platform movement and output forces are transparently recorded by the host PC in a database. This database can be accessed remotely over the Internet. Thus, the Rutgers Ankle Orthopedic Rehabilitation Interface will allow patients to exercise at home while being monitored remotely by therapists. A prototype was constructed, and proof-of-concept trials were conducted at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The results indicate that the system works well as a diagnostic tool. The subjective evaluation by patients was very positive. Further medical trials are needed before the system clinical efficacy in rehabilitation can be established.;2001;1
Advancements in sensor, telecommunications, computer, and information technologies present opportunities for providing at home health care and other services required by America's rapidly aging population. The HomeCare & Telerehabilitation Technology Center at The Catholic University of America has been investigating and evaluating current and emerging technologies for applications to care for elderly populations. This paper discusses a spectrum of technologies for interactive communications, physiologic monitoring, health and safety monitoring, health data collection, as well as storage and archiving. An integrated approach to combine and implement these technologies in the home environment may serve to promote successful aging in the elderly by avoiding disease, by maintaining cognitive and physical function, and by enabling lifelong engagement.;2002;1
Current VR telerehabilitation systems use offline remote monitoring from the clinic and patient-therapist videoconferencing. Such store and forward and video-based systems cannot implement medical services involving patient therapist direct interaction. Real-time telerehabilitation applications (including remote therapy) can be developed using a shared Virtual Environment (VE) architecture. We developed a two-user shared VE for hand telerchabilitation. Each site has a telerehabilitation workstation with a videocamera and a Rutgers Master 11 (RMII) force feedback glove. Each user can control a virtual hand and interact hapticly with virtual objects. Simulated physical interactions between therapist and patient are implemented using hand force feedback. The therapist's graphic interface contains several virtual panels, which allow control over the rehabilitation process. These controls start a videoconferencing session, collect patient data, or apply therapy. Several experimental telerehabilitation scenarios were successfully tested on a LAN. A Webbased approach to real-time patient telemonitoring - the monitoring portal for hand telerehabilitation - was also developed. The therapist interface is implemented as a Java3D applet that monitors patient hand movement. The monitoring portal gives real-time performance on off-the-shelf desktop workstations.;2002;1
Objective: To investigate the use of telerehabilitation to support families caring at home for individuals with prolonged states of reduced consciousness. Design: A comparison group approach. Participants: Participants were recruited from a special program that is part of a Model Systems brain injury program located in the Southeast. Five patients, ranging from Rancho I to Rancho 3 were discharged home with family members as the primary caregivers. Procedures: Participant families were followed for 4 to 8 weeks via videophone. Follow-up telephone surveys were conducted with a family member 6 to 9 months after discharge and compared with a similar group that had not received the videophone follow-up. Main Outcome Measures: Present living status, number of emergency room visits, number of hospitalizations, the caregivers' perceptions of functional status and care needs, readmission for rehabilitation and perceived family needs as measured by the Family Needs Questionnaire (FNQ). Results: More patients in the videoconferencing group were still living at home and had returned for rehabilitation. On the FNQ, families in the videophone group reported more of their needs met than families in the comparison group. Conclusions: The use of videoconferencing to bridge the transition to home for families caring for a family member at the Rancho I to Rancho 3 level may assist families in successfully caring for the individual in the home and reducing the number of perceived family needs.;2002;1
Objective: To survey individuals with acquired brain injury to assess multiple facets of interest, access, and familiarity necessary to implement new telerehabilitation technologies. Design: Anonymous mail survey. Setting: Community. Participants: Seventy-one respondents to a survey. These individuals had experienced acquired brain injury (predominantly severe traumatic brain injury [TBI]) and were living in the community. Surveys were mailed by a state chapter of the Brain Injury Association to a random selection of members with acquired brain injury. Main Outcome Measure: Survey designed specifically for this investigation. Results: The survey responses indicate that there is great interest in the possibility of accessing telerehabilitative services among individuals with acquired brain injury. In particular, there was strong interest expressed in services that could be used to assist with problems in memory, attention, problem-solving, and activities of daily living. Conclusions: Telemedicine, and more specifically telerehabilitation, holds great promise as an adjunct to traditional clinical service delivery. Little research in thus area has been applied, however, to individuals with acquired brain injuries. Although on the surface, telerehabilitation seems to be an appropriate assessment and treatment modality for individuals with brain injury, it will only succeed if those individuals have the interest-and tine access-necessary to use new and evolving technologies.;2002;1
Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the United States and yet little technology is currently available for individuals with stroke to practice and monitor rehabilitation therapy on their own. This paper provides a detailed design description of a telerehabilitation system for arm and hand therapy following stroke. The system consists of a Web-based library of status tests, therapy games, and progress charts, and can be used with a variety of input devices, including a low-cost force-feedback joystick capable of assisting or resisting in movement. Data from home-based usage by a chronic stroke subject are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of using the system to direct a therapy program, mechanically assist in movement, and track improvements in movement ability.;2002;1
"Stroke rehabilitation is a challenge that is being continuously addressed in the therapeutic world. A unique system is proposed to address upper-extremity stroke rehabilitation. This system incorporates a modified mass-marketed joystick with three distinct subsystems: a) an extended joystick that enables a larger range of motion and arm movements in both the horizontal and vertical fields that can be augmented with passive springs; b) a controller that implements user-centered assistive or resistive forces based on therapist input to a fuzzy expert system; and c) game-centered forces. The system is currently under evaluation with IRB-approval for both stroke and non-stroke patients.";2002;1
The field of clinical rehabilitation is rooted in the premise that carefully planned and delivered therapeutic intervention enhances patient outcomes. Underlying this statement is a deeper scientific reality: The field exists because biosystems (e.g., tissues, cells, organs, persons) are inherently adaptive and can dynamically change as a function of a sequence of inputs (e.g., exercise, pharmaceuticals). The tools of telerehabilitation hell) minimize the barrier of distance, both of patients to rehabilitative services and of researchers to subject populations. This enhanced access opens up new possibilities for discovering and implementing optimized intervention strategies across the continuum of care. Telecommunications technologies are reviewed from the perspective of systems models of the telerehabilitation process, with a focus on human-technology interface design and a special emphasis on emerging home and mobile technologies. Approaches for providing clinical rehabilitation services through telerehabilitation are addressed, including innovative consumer-centered approaches. Finally, telerehabilitation is proposed as a tool for reinvigorating the rehabilitative bioengineering research enterprise.;2002;1
The motivation behind an intelligent telerehabilitation assistant is described. This system is implemented for mobile telebealth applications that use either PocketPC((R)) or Laptop computers with various types of wireless telecommunications. The system structure includes a telepractitioner terminal, a patient terminal, and a Web-based central station. Multimedia conferencing is possible between terminals, with the telepractitioner having added capabilities such as remote operation. The embedded expert system modules, based on neurofuzzy technology, fall into two categories: task-based modules that facilitate ease of use and implementation of evaluative and therapeutic protocols, and decision-support modules that assist practitioners with outcomes evaluation and helping optimize the rehab intervention strategy.;2002;1
The present cutting-edge communication technology applied to the rehabilitation may change the real possibility of providing therapeutic treatments to the patients at their home. In order to confirm this assertion a current study on motor telerehabilitation was undertaken. Through a virtual reality based system, and a complementary video conference apparatus, we supplied five post stroke patients with a motor rehabilitation therapy. The rehabilitation technique was based on the augmented feedback. Subjects underwent the telerehabilitation program for six weeks. Before and after the therapy, arm motor performance and the activities of daily living were evaluated by the means of clinical scales and measuring the affected arm velocity (end-effector). This pilot study suggested that telerehabilitation could promote the learning of arm motor abilities at distance from the health facilities. From an economic point of view, it could be proposed also as an opportune strategy for saving resources.;2002;1
The Rutgers Master II-ND glove is a haptic interface designed for dextrous interactions with virtual environments. The glove provides force feedback up to 16 N each to the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingertips. It uses custom pneumatic actuators arranged in a direct-drive configuration in the palm. Unlike commercial haptic gloves, the direct-drive actuators make unnecessary cables and pulleys, resulting in a more compact and lighter structure. The force-feedback structure also serves as position measuring exoskeleton, by integrating noncontact Hall-effect and infrared sensors. The glove is connected to a haptic-control interface that reads its sensors and servos its actuators. The interface has pneumatic servovalves, signal conditioning electronics, A/D/A boards, power supply and an imbedded Pentium PC. This distributed computing assures much faster control bandwidth than would otherwise be possible. Communication with the host PC is done over an RS232 line. Comparative data with the CyberGrasp commercial haptic glove is presented.;2002;1
This research project st udies the use of videoconferencing technology to assess functional status from outside the clinic. The technologies under use meet the H.320 and H.324 videoconferencing standards. The Wolf Motor Function Test, Arm Motor Ability Test, Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test, Barthel Test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Motor Activity Log are the measures under investigation. For each of these assessment instruments, the aim is to both evaluate whether remote evaluation is as effective as face to face, and to disseminate recommendations regarding specific protocols.;2002;1
Advances in the design and delivery of trauma care and acute medical management have increased the number of survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI), producing societal consequences and medical challenges. Although access to health care for rural patients remains a critical challenge, teletherapy may represent a viable means for the delivery of therapeutic services to such patients. A case study is presented in which teletherapy was successfully utilized to improve the functional outcomes, both physical and cognitive, of a patient with a severe TBI. A physical therapist from a metropolitan rehabilitation center employed teletherapy to provide Neuro Developmental Treatment for a patient and to mentor staff in a nursing home located over 100 miles from the metro area. The patient, who participated in 48 physical teletherapy sessions over a 24-week period, demonstrated improvements in physical functioning and neuropsychological status. During the course of therapy, goals were adjusted upward to match the patient's improvements. This case study provides confirmatory evidence that teletherapy represents an effective and efficient means for providing rehabilitation services for patients in rural communities, as well as for facilitating mentoring relationships between seasoned professionals and trainees located in rural settings.;2003;1
An interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering and allied health clinician-scientists forms the basis for the development and testing of virtual reality technology and it delivery. An overview of the development of the haptic interface used for lower extremity rehabilitation and its interface with web-based technology for the delivery of rehabilitation is described. Preliminary findings are discussed. Future endeavors are outlined.;2003;1
Decreased length of inpatient rehabilitation stay, greater long-term injury survival rates, broader access to information technologies, and the growing role of the Internet create potential for new models of rehabilitation that are more community- and person-centered rather than historically hospital- and provider-centered services. In recent years, information-based rehabilitation technologies have grown rapidly, expanding the possibilities for numerous interventions to promote independent living. These programs have centered primarily on providing rehabilitation health services over a distance (telerehabilitation). Telerehabilitation can be conceived as part of a broader approach that includes elements of direct rehabilitation services, service coordination. community resources, and information relay between numerous individuals, service providers, and community members (rehabilitation informatics). Because of the complexity of these information types and sectors, this broader conceptual approach of rehabilitation informatics borrows heavily from fields such as adaptive computing, robotics, computer networking, and high-level systems programming. As such, innovation in rehabilitation informatics will require new models of training that span these domains. This paper proposes a rationale for the new field of rehabilitation informatics, and offers a multidisciplinary training model for the next generation of rehabilitation informaticians.;2003;1
Delivery of rehabilitative health care at remote distances becomes feasible with neural net-assisted automation. Using neural nets trained to recognize characteristics of extensive/reflective responses, a series of rules can be invoked to guide functional restoration for individuals with neurological disorders of movement. The key to reeducation follows from sensory feedback substitution.;2003;1
Distance monitoring of rehabilitation exercises has been primarily conducted using two-way video conferencing. This paper presents a real-time web-based monitoring system that greatly enhances the capability of the clinician to direct rehabilitation therapies.;2003;1
Hand motor tasks, even those commonly required by daily life activities, entail complex muscle activation. This article describes a self-contained experimental set-up for the objective kinetic and kinematic analysis of each finger function under several working conditions. Special attention is given to grasping and pressing under isometric conditions. The analysis of the contribution of the thumb is particular to this system. This system has proved accurate, reliable, easy-to-use, and suitable for applications in research environments, and as a support to clinicians for diagnosis and during rehabilitation.;2003;1
Objectives: To discuss the advantages and disadvantages of rehabilitation applications of virtual reality. Methods: VR can be used as an enhancement to conventional therapy for patients with conditions ranging from musculo-skeletal problems, to stroke-induced paralysis, to cognitive deficits. This approach is called VR-augmented rehabilitation. Alternately, VR can replace conventional interventions altogether, in which case the rehabilitation is VR-based. If the intervention is done at a distance, then it is called telerehabilitation. Simulating exercises for past-stroke patients have been developed using a teacher object approach or a video game approach. Simulations for musculo-skeletal patients use virtual replicas of rehabilitation devices (such as rubber ball, power putty, peg board). Phobia-inducing virtual environments are prescribed for patients with cognitive deficits. Results: VR-augmented rehabilitation has been shown effective for stroke patients in the chronic phase of the disease. VR-based rehabilitation has been improving patients with fear of flying. Vietnam syndrome, fear of heights, and chronic stroke patients. Telerehabilitation interventions using VR have improved musculo-skeletal and post-stroke patients, however less data is available at this time. Conclusions: Virtual reality presents significant advantages when applied to rehabilitation of patients with varied conditions. These advantages include patient motivation, adaptability and variability based on patient baseline, transparent data storage, online remote data access, economy of scale, reduced medical costs. Challenges in VR use for rehabilitation relate to lack of computer skills on the part of therapists, lack of support infrastructure, expensive equipment (initially), inadequate communication infrastructure (for telerehabilitation in rural areas), and patient safety concerns.;2003;1
One of the main goals of the System for Integrated Development of the Family is to offer outpatient rehabilitation services. One strategy to provide these services to outlying populations was to create community-based rehabilitation services via the Basic Rehabilitation Units. Since there is a shortage of qualified rehabilitation personnel, the BRU are managed by Physical Therapy Assistants. In Baja California Sur, as in other Mexican states, geographic and economic issues limit the current supervision, professional support, and up-to-date knowledge. Between 26 February 2002 and 20 February 2003, four BRU were linked to the Rehabilitation and Special Education Center (RSEC) to carry virtual rehabilitation services, called telerehabilitation. An evaluation of the first year showed that telerehabilitation services have been useful and cost-effective.;2003;1
"Survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience cognitive and physical impairments. The aims of this study were to: 1) build an internet-based, Virtual Rehabilitation Center (VRC) that provides rehabilitation, education and support services to individuals with TBI; and 2) to determine the relationships between the nature and severity of the participants' cognitive impairments and their ability to use the VRC. Eight individuals with brain injuries (Age: M = 43, SD = 15.4; Years of Education: M = 13.8, SD = 3.15) participated. The Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Exam (NBCSE) was used to assess intellectual functioning. The VRC modules consisted of reaction time, functional modules, and communication capabilities. All participants learned how to use the VRC. However, those requiring more trials to acquisition showed greater cognitive impairment than those requiring fewer trials in: Construction (p = 0.02), Reasoning-Similarities (p = 0.01) and in calculation and language repetition. (i.e., a non-significant trend). Importantly, all participants learned how to use the system although learning rates varied. Moreover, one case-study demonstrated that learning on the VRC generalized to the community. Overall, impairments on the NBCSE in visual-constructional integration and executive-type functions, as well as language processing appeared to be related to how effectively participants teamed how to use the VRC.";2003;1
Telerehabilitation is the provision of rehabilitation services at a distance using electronic information and communication technologies. This paper describes two clinical programs that utilize videoconferencing to provide rehabilitation specialist consultations to individuals living in remote areas. Needs assessments for the two areas revealed that local clinicians were interested in access to specialty consultation. Administrative processes and a data collection tool were developed for these programs. High speed videoconferencing that allows for real-time audio and video interaction was used. Each consultation includes the patient, the local caregivers and specialists from our facilities interacting via videoconferencing. A total of 117 telerehabilitation encounters have been completed. All consultations resulted in changes to the plan of care. Clinicians who participated in the projects consistently rated the clinical effectiveness of teleconsults as good or excellent. Thirty-eight consultations have been neurologic in nature. Of that set, 25 of the visits were initial assessments, and thirteen were follow-up visits. Two case studies of individuals with neurologic diagnoses are presented. Recommendations to others who are providing rehabilitation services via telehealth technologies are included. The authors conclude that the care of individuals with neurologic issues can be augmented and supported via specialty consultation using telehealth technology.;2003;1
The aim of this study is to investigate the acceptability and usability of information technology as one means of psycho-social rehabilitation of paraplegic and quadriplegic patients with spinal cord injury. From a group of 66 selected individuals, 17 (25.7%) prioritised a course in information technology as a form of rehabilitation. Out of the 16 people who were offered activities within the project to be described, courses in informatics were rated sixth i.e. rated as more popular than other possible activities. I I individuals out of 14 who entered the course (78.6%), successfully finished it and rated the course very highly. (4.5 on scale 1-5). The informatics course presented the possibilities of teleconferencing and discussed information and communication technology applications within the framework of telerehabilitation.;2003;1
"The reintegration of students after acquired/traumatic brain injury (ABI/TBI) continues to be fraught with difficulties. Presented are (1) case studies exploring the potential of online support for teachers of students with ABI after returning from a paediatric rehabilitation centre; (2) results of Internet-based courses about reintegrating students with ABI; (3) outcomes of videoconferencing-based and Internet email-based support; (4) development of an online support process that uses Questions and Answers as a quick and immediate resource for teachers. The authors recommend that a collaborative process be instituted, in order to generate a relatively small number of high quality online resources about re-integrating students into their school and community. A second recommendation focuses on the development of online support network which may be text or email based or which may use videoconferencing over the Internet. Such networks allow students with ABI to maintain contact with their family and friends in the home community and facilitate their reintegration An Internet-based support structure also allows professionals to provide consultation, collaboration and continuing input.";2003;1
"There is a need to develop and evaluate alternative techniques for upper-extremity stroke rehabilitation. Currently there are many promising therapeutic techniques; however, the cost is generally too high and the participation tends to drop off. A unique design is proposed that modifies a mass-marketed joystick and features: a) an extended joystick that enables a larger range of motion and arm movements in both the horizontal and vertical fields that can be augmented with passive springs, b) motors in series with mechanical springs capable of providing moderate assistive forces, and c) an approach emphasizing computer-assisted motivating therapy that takes advantage of commercial gaming industry products.";2003;1
There is increasing interest and activity in the provision of teleassessment and telerehabilitation services to individuals with traumatic brain injury. Yet, little formal research exists, and there are no large-scale clinical trials or evidence-based applications of these technologies in TBI. The present commentary will address several areas that warrant critical consideration before telerehabilitation is likely to be widely implemented and reimbursed.;2003;1
This study reports on secondary data, depression, fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), collected on people with advanced multiple sclerosis (MS) as part of a larger study of the impact of a telerehabilitation intervention on people with severe mobility impairment. People with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) (n = 111) and the prevention of pressure sores were the primary group of interest of the project. The focus here is on data collected from people with advanced MS (n = 27), who were included as an exploratory cohort, as they experience increased risk of pressure ulcer development as their level of mobility declines. The study consisted of a nine-week intervention with three randomized groups: video, telephone, and standard care. Aside from information on pressure sores, data were also collected on fatigue, depression, and HRQOL for a two-year follow-up period. For the video group HRQOL scores trended higher and fatigue and depression scores lower for 24 months. Fatigue scores were significantly lower for the video group at month six, 12, and 18. In the sample overall, fatigue symptoms were far more prominent than depressive symptoms and affected 100% of the sample at month 12. Men exhibited significantly higher rates of depression than women. At baseline, controlling for Extended Disability Status Score (EDSS), depression and fatigue were correlated. However, contrary to indications from previous cross-sectional studies, no consistent relationship was observed over time between the two. Telerehabilitation interventions for people with advanced MS warrant further investigation. Findings here suggest that such interventions may be beneficial, although the results need affirmation through larger samples. In addition, the higher prevalence of male depression merits serious attention.;2003;1
We have developed a low-bandwidth, Internet-based telerehabilitation system to provide outpatient rehabilitation to patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty. The preliminary efficacy of this treatment programme in terms of both physical and functional objective outcome measures was assessed on 21 patients. Subjects receiving a six-week rehabilitation programme were randomized to the telerehabilitation system or the usual face-to-face method. The physical and functional improvements in the telerehabilitation group were similar to those in the control group. There was a non-significant trend for greater improvements in the telerehabilitation group for most outcome measurements. The telerehabilitation programme was well received by patients. The results of this study provide evidence for the efficacy of low-bandwidth telerehabilitation consultations.;2003;1
"We investigated the accuracy and reliability of observational kinematic gait assessments performed via a low-bandwidth Internet link (118 kbit/s) and a higher-speed Internet link (128 kbit/s). Twenty-four subjects were randomized to either bandwidth group. Gait was assessed with the Gait Assessment Rating Scale (GARS) in the traditional manner, which is from video-recordings, and with repeated measurements via the online method. Online assessment was found to provide as accurate a measure of gait performance as the traditional assessment (limits of agreement<1 GARS point; intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC=0.96) regardless of the speed of the Internet connection. The online assessment also demonstrated high intra-rater (ICC=0.96) and inter-rater (ICC=0.92) reliability. Low-bandwidth telerehabilitation applications appear to be feasible via the Internet.";2003;1
A study was undertaken to determine the technical acceptability of information available via a customized telere-habilitation system regarding patients with lower-limb ulcers or recent lower-limb amputations receiving care at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Among the 54 participants, 57 wounds (39 ulcers, 19 amputation incisions) were evaluated by means of still photographs and skin temperature data sent via ordinary telephone lines. Three experienced clinicians served as raters. Intrarater agreements and McNemar chi(2) tests were assessed between decisions made after telerehabilitation sessions and decisions made by the same rater after in-person sessions. Interrater agreements and kappa coefficients were assessed between two raters for both telerehabilitation and in-person sessions. The intrarater agreement on 57 wounds for the primary rater was 93%, and the McNemar test indicated no significant difference in the ratings (p < 0.63). Interrater agreement on 18 wounds was 78% (kappa = 0.55, p < 0.02) for the telerehabilitation sessions and 89% (kappa = 0.77, p < 0.001) for the in-person sessions. Most qualitative comments by three clinicians on picture quality (54/63 = 86%) and temperature data (39/44 = 88%) were favorable (good to excellent). The information yielded from this study provides evidence that the telerehabilitation system has the potential to present sufficient information to experienced clinicians so they can make informed decisions regarding wound management. The next phase of the study will include in-home trials and improvements in the technology.;2004;1
Background: Telerehabilitation (telerehab) is the method of using technology to provide rehabilitation services at a distance. The concept of delivering remote speech-language pathology (SLP) services using telerehab tools and techniques has been acknowledged for more than 25 years. While research has demonstrated videoconference-based telerehab to be a feasible, effective, and appropriate method for providing SLP services to a broad range of clients, studies have been primarily limited to technical feasibility or demonstration projects with relatively small sample sizes. There is an expressed need in the literature for controlled, randomised studies that track both quantitative outcomes of services delivered via telerehab as well as qualitative measures of satisfaction. Aims: The purpose of the study was to measure performance of adults with acquired brain injury on a standardised SLP assessment conducted in both face-to-face (FF) and videoconference-based telerehab (T) settings. The objective was to determine if performance on the assessment, or subjective feedback from the participants, differed between settings. Methods & Procedures: A total of 40 participants with a recent onset of brain injury--12 with traumatic brain injury (TBI), 14 with a left cerebrovascular accident (LCVA), and 14 with a right cerebrovascular accident (RCVA)--were enrolled in the study. Participants were asked to retell stories from the Story Retell Procedure (Doyle, McNeil, Spencer, Goda, Cotrell, & Lustig, 1998) in both FF and T settings. Responses from the stories were scored by the clinician using the percent information unit scoring metric (McNeil, Doyle, Fossett, Park, & Goda, 2001). Additionally, a survey tool was used to probe each participant's level of satisfaction and willingness to use telerehab services in the future. Outcomes & Results: Across all participants, and within the TBI, LCVA, and RCVA groups, no significant difference in performance between the FF and T settings was found. Feedback from survey data demonstrated a high level of acceptance of the T setting. When compared to participants with LCVA or RCVA, however, participants with TBI were significantly more likely to show a lack of interest in future videoconferencing use. Conclusions: Story-retelling performance by brain-injured adults was not affected by setting. Additionally, participants expressed a high level of interest in using videoconferencing in the future. These findings offer additional support for telerehab as a viable alternative mode of SLP treatment for survivors of stroke and TBI. Further research is needed to investigate the utility of telerehab for delivering services to clients with attention impairments as well as those with severe cognitive-communicative impairment, dysarthria, or aphasia.;2004;1
Community resources for stroke clients are underdeveloped in Hong Kong and stroke survivors often face difficulties in community reintegration. We have examined the feasibility of using videoconferencing for community-based stroke rehabilitation. The sample comprised 21 stroke patients living at home. All the subjects participated in an eight-week intervention programme at a community centre for seniors. The intervention, which comprised educational talks, exercise and psychosocial support, was conducted by a physiotherapist via a videoconference link. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS), State Self-Esteem Scale (SSES), Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) and a stroke knowledge test were administered at the start and end of the programme. In addition, at the start of the study the Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item Short Form, the Elderly Mobility Scale and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale were used to assess subjects' baseline status, and a focus group was also held at the end of the programme to gather qualitative findings. Nineteen subjects completed the eight-week intervention. The baseline functional status was high, although 52% had symptoms of depression. After the intervention, there were significant improvements in BBS, SSES and knowledge test scores and scores on all subscales of the SF-36. All the subjects accepted the use of videoconferencing for delivery of the intervention. The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility, efficacy and high level of acceptance of telerehabilitation for community-dwelling stroke clients.;2004;1
Continuing advances in virtual reality (VR) technology along with concomitant system cost reductions have supported the development of more useful and accessible VR systems that can uniquely target a wide range of physical, psychological, and cognitive rehabilitation concerns and research questions. VR offers the potential to deliver systematic human testing, training, and treatment environments that allow for the precise control of complex dynamic three-dimensional stimulus presentations, within which sophisticated interaction, behavioral tracking, and performance recording is possible. The next step in this evolution will allow for Internet accessibility to libraries of VR scenarios as a likely form of distribution and use. VR applications that are Internet deliverable could open up new possibilities for home-based therapy and rehabilitation. If executed thoughtfully, they could increase client involvement, enhance outcomes and reduce costs. However, before this vision can be achieved, a number of significant challenges will need to be addressed and solved. This article will first present three fictional case vignettes that illustrate the ways that VR telerehabilitation might be implemented with varying degrees of success in the future. We then describe a system that is currently being used to deliver virtual worlds over the Internet for training safety skills to children with learning disabilities. From these illustrative fictional and reality-based applications, we will then briefly discuss the technical, practical, and user-based challenges for implementing VR telerehabilitation, along with views regarding the future of this emerging clinical application.;2004;1
Due to rising costs of health care and decreasing length of conventional therapy, it has become imperative to develop affordable, motivating devices that can be used in the home for upper-extremity stroke rehabilitation. In the TheraJoy project, a commercial joystick has been modified to enlarge the range of arm movement used during therapeutic movement tasks, and to support the application of light passive and actuated forces. The enhanced version presented here allows for motion in both the horizontal and vertical planes, uses a dynamic linkage model to map joystick-hand position and force data, uses motivating gaming technology, and can be used in both therapy and in home settings. This study compares performance and benefits of motion in the horizontal to vertical plane, evaluates user performance during assessment and therapy tasks, and documents user opinions of potential uses of this technology for stroke rehabilitation.;2004;1
For telehealth to become an accepted component of rehabilitation, a scientific base verifying that telehealth improves outcomes must be developed. A conceptual framework based on theory and empirical findings is necessary for this area of inquiry to flourish. Most academic curricula possess such an educational pillar, which serves to help prepare professionals to practice in the new arena, and scholars to perform quality research. Currently, the authors are involved in developing areas of the biomedical engineering and nursing curricula at Marquette University to address key areas of telerehabilitation. This paper outlines the conceptual framework for these curricular areas. The conceptual framework is derived from three areas that modulate each other, and ultimately impact the outcomes of telerehabilitation. These areas are rehabilitative biosystems, human-technology interfaces, and behavioral compliance. Each can be viewed from the context of an optimization process, and the model can be applied to help identify the weak link for a given telerehabilitative approach under study. Examples of how the model can be used to frame telerehabilitation research are presented, with a special focus on designing home-based solutions for two societal challenges of large scope and great need-stroke and cardiac rehabilitation. The authors conclude that the proposed framework can be used to conceptualize, understand, and optimize the key components of a telerehabilitative process and to analyze alternative approaches for optimizing outcomes.;2004;1
"In this paper we examine the issues pertaining to development of a low-cost telerehabilitation framework for upper-limb dysfunction, that is suitable for deployment in patients' homes. We use the example of a Virtual Driving Environment (VDE) to present the overall architecture and discuss issues of: (i) quantitative data-acquisition using commercial-off-the-shelf gaming devices; (ii) model-based parametric data transmission/playback; and (iii) parametric biomechanical identification and data reduction; to support individualization within the telerehabilitation regimen.";2004;1
Information technology (IT) is an important part of society and has assumed an increasing role in education, medicine, commercial, leisure, and sociopolitical applications. However, while progress in developing IT hardware and software has advanced, our understanding of user needs and how these needs can be translated into more accessible and effective system design lags behind. The challenge that we face is rooted in the fact that many individuals across this planet who are differently-abled due to aging, developmental or neurologic conditions or to individual differences in learning, face obstacles in using and accessing IT. The central thesis of this paper is that the effective delivery of IT to the differently-abled is contingent on deriving enough information about user populations to allow for the development and use of personalized interfaces and customized content. To this end, it is proposed that a combination of adaptive hypermedia and cognitive adaptive strategies integrating metadata, architecture for representing the results of cognitive and functional assessments be designed and implemented.;2004;1
Objective: To assess current payment practice for telerehabilitation in state Medicaid programs. Design: Telephone survey. Setting: State Medicaid programs. Participants: State Medicaid directors. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: Descriptive. Results: Half of the 35 state Medicaid programs contacted reimbursed at least some telemedicine services other than radiology in 2002. The primary reason for reimbursing for telemedicine is to make services available when there is no local practitioner. Consultation and evaluation and management services were most likely to be reimbursed (12 states). Seven state programs reimbursed telepsychology, and 4 states reported reimbursing for telespeech and language pathology, physical therapy, or occupational therapy. Conclusions: Telemedicine helps Medicaid programs deliver specialized care to locations with provider shortages. Telerehabilitation is not yet widespread, despite its potential benefit to people with disabilities who cannot travel to a clinic for rehabilitation therapy. Most Medicaid programs calculate the financial costs and patient benefits when considering payment policies, and about half of states require a state law to allow payment for telerehabilitation. Minnesota, Hawaii, and Nebraska, among the responding states, currently reimburse for telerehabilitation. Research is needed to evaluate the appropriateness of telerehabilitation for Medicaid beneficiaries.;2004;1
Objective: To compare a computer-aided training program with a conventional training program in orthopedic rehabilitation. Design: The study was a randomized, nonblinded, controlled trial in which follow-up data were obtained at 6 mos. In an inpatient rehabilitation center, a consecutive sample was taken of patients with first total hip replacements or first total knee replacements 23-42 days after surgery. Indication groups were examined separately. The study population included 189 women and 85 men. Mean age was 69 yrs (38-86 yrs). Patients received either computer-aided training (case group) or conventional training (control group) within the framework of their inpatient rehabilitation program. The main outcome measures were levels of acceptance and effectiveness (Harris Hip Score, Hospital for Special Surgery Score, FIM(TM) instrument, and Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire). Results: Both forms of training showed significant improvements until discharge in scores and items used for the result evaluation independent of patient sex, age, and educational level. The 6-mo follow-up showed that between the groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the level of improvement concerning functional capacity. Furthermore, patients displayed their acceptance of the system by rating it with average values between good and very good. Conclusions: For patients with total hip replacements or total knee replacements, computer-aided training can be regarded as the equivalent to conventional training in relationship to the results of the rehabilitation program. The system is a new tool in orthopedic rehabilitation. To identify the relative importance of the system, further research is needed.;2004;1
"One of the overriding needs in the field of telerehabilitation is for user-centered interfaces that provide individuals with differing abilities with access to effective remote communication. This paper provides a foundation for developing and evaluating interfaces that move towards the aim of universal accessibility, and reports on progress for four types of interfaces: multimedia conferencing technologies involving persons with different roles and disabilities participating in goal-directed tasks; :physical devices for therapy and assessment; communication/control for computer-assisted teletherapy; and an intelligent telerebabilitation assistant that supports the dynamic rehabilitative process.";2004;1
"Primary objective: The advanced communication technology may allow rehabilitative interventions to patients living at home from a remote provider. We evaluated the effects of a tele-rehabilitation system for the therapy of arm motor impairments due to a stroke. Research design: Experimental observational study. Methods and procedures: We selected five patients suffering from mild/intermediate arm motor impairments due to a long-lasting ischaemic stroke. Two workstations were utilized, one in the patient's house and the other in the rehabilitation hospital, connected through the phone lines. A virtual reality based software allowed the patient to perform adequate motor tasks created by the physiotherapist. During performance, the patient could see not only their movement but also the correct trajectory that they had to accomplish. The feedback derived from the patient's action, its outcome, and feedback from the supervision of the physiotherapist may favour the acquisition of new motor abilities. Main outcome measures: The arm motor performance and the activities of daily living were evaluated using the Fugl-Meyer and Functional Independence Measure scale, together with the determination of the velocity and duration of 10 representative reaching movements. Results: Subjects underwent the tele-rehabilitation programme for 4 weeks. The therapy significantly improved the Fugl-Meyer mean score, the mean duration and the velocity of the movements, but not the Functional Independence Measure scale score. Conclusions: These results indicated that this tele-rehabilitation system did not appear to adversely affect rehabilitation; rather it may improve arm motor deficits due to a stroke. If these evidences are further confirmed, tele-rehabilitation may represent a new home-based therapy to treat disabled people.";2004;1
Purpose: To describe the design and development process for an information network that meets the complex needs for information exchange by persons with disabilities. This paper describes the needs assessment and design processes that drove the selection of specific system features, and discusses the range of entities with whom persons with disabilities must exchange information. The authors delineate the design goals and their associated specifications for a network of local resource information that serves the needs of persons with disabilities. A model program has been specified and is currently under development. It will enable users to exchange personal, health, and resource information with service entities and with other members of the disability community who depend on detailed information to support their performance of everyday tasks. As an outcome this activity, a highly portable, replicable, sustainable, scalable, and secure model of consumer-driven information exchange will become available to persons with disabilities and to those who provide services to them. The impact of this system will be amplified when it is launched and replicated in interested communities nationwide.;2004;1
Teleconferencing technology has great potential for providing cost-effective in-home assessment for home modification services from anywhere to anyone in need. Despite its enormous potential, the use of this technology as a means to deliver these specific services had not been investigated. This project investigated the use of televideo technology to provide remote home assessment services to patients prior to discharge so that they could function as independently as possible in their own homes after being discharged from a specialty clinic. Specifically, an assessment protocol that could be implemented using video-conferencing technology was developed and feasibility of the remote assessment process was determined by validating it against the standard of practice, an in-home assessment by a home modifications specialist. Independent in-home and remote home assessments were completed by two occupational therapists who specialize in home modifications. The results were compared for agreement in identification of specific accessibility problems in and quantitative measurements of the home. The remote assessment correctly identified a total of 51 of the 59 problems (86.4%) identified by the in-home assessment and only identified five problems (8.9%) that were not identified by the on-site assessment. In addition, 54 of 60 (90%) of the quantitative measurements from the remote assessment matched those from the in-home assessment. Findings suggest that remote telerehabilitation assessments have the potential to enable specialists to diagnose potential accessibility problems in home environments and prescribe appropriate modifications regardless of the location of the client, home, or specialist.;2004;1
Telemedicine technology provides new offers for all fields of stroke care such as prevention, acute stroke therapy and rehabilitation. Telehomecare and screening-programs may support detection and control of risk factors. In acute stroke management telemedicine will help to bring expertise from stroke centers out to patients in local institutions. Various studies have shown that besides transfer of imaging data (CT/MRI) a clinical examination is possible and reliable via audiovisual devices. This was the basis for first projects in clinical routine. First results have been published from USA and Germany. Especially in Bavaria a number of pilot studies for telemedicine based stroke networks (TESS, TEMPIS, STENO) were initiated. Technical problems, such as limited data transfer rate, and requirements of data security hinder broader use of telemedicine. Furthermore problems of liability and reimbursement have to be clarified. However use of telemedicine will increase in the future.;2004;1
Telerehabilitation is a promising alternative health-care delivery system, but currently lacks broad-based empirical support for the efficacy and cost utility of its interventions. This article describes the development of a database at INTEGRIS Jim Thorpe Rehabilitation Center (IJTRC) that will link the delivery of telerehabilitation services, reimbursement, and outcomes evaluation. The database is a culmination of the combined efforts of administrators, clinicians, and information technology professionals. Feasibility of the project was first established from technical, economic, and organizational perspectives. The current workflow and documentation processes were analyzed and enhanced. This was followed by data modeling and design of the database architecture in terms of network, security, scalability, and system specification. A prototype was created in Microsoft Access with the final product planned in Structured Query Language (SQL) with a front-end in JAVA JSP. The initial results with the database have been encouraging in terms of increased efficacy and security, process streamlining, error reduction, and collection of comprehensive standardized data for statistical analysis of clinical and research outcomes.;2004;1
The goal of this project is to develop a means for individuals with stroke to practice arm movement therapy at home with remote monitoring. We previously developed a web-based system for repetitive movement training (Java Therapy). This paper describes a new input device for the system that measures and assists in naturalistic arm movement, as well as software enhancements. The new input device is an instrumented, adult-sized version of Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton (WREX), which is a five degrees-of-freedom orthosis that counterbalances the weight of the arm using elastic bands. To test the ability of the new device (Training-WREX or T-WREX) to measure and assist in functional arm movements, we measured five chronic stroke subjects' movement ability while wearing the orthosis without gravity balance compared to wearing the orthosis with gravity balance. T-WREX's gravity balance function improved a clinical measure of arm movement (Fugl-Meyer Score), range of motion of reaching movements, and accuracy of drawing movements. Coupled with an enhanced version of Java Therapy, T-WREX will thus provide a means to assist functional arm movement training at home, either over the Web in real-time, or stand-alone with periodic communication with a remote site.;2004;1
The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of transmitting moving pictures via the Internet for processing by a three-dimensional motion analyser. The movements of two patients were filmed by a videocamera and transmitted from a hospital to a university department of physiotherapy. After advanced analysis using a three-dimensional motion analyser, physiotherapists prepared a treatment plan. The transmitted moving pictures were clear enough for analysis. The physiotherapists in the hospital were satisfied with the results of the motion analysis and found the guidance from an expert physiotherapist valuable. In the future, a large number of video-sequences could be transmitted during the night, stored at the university and then analysed later by an expert physiotherapist.;2004;1
"There is significant potential for delivering speech-language pathology services using telemedicine methods. However; current telemedicine and videoconferencing equipment has limitations that constrain the speech-language therapeutic interventions that can be delivered remotely. This work aimed to develop a telemedicine system that would extend the capabilities of existing videoconferencing equipment and integrate an array of clinically relevant and validated therapeutic tools and techniques. Through a user-centered iterative design framework, an earlier prototype system was expanded and enhanced to enable greater interaction between a speech-language clinician and client during a telemedicine session. The final system utilizes H.323 Internet-based videoconferencing with integrated T.120 data sharing features and allows for a wide range of treatment material and therapeutic interventions to be delivered to a remote client. The protocol for a case-study evaluation designed to evaluate the system as a means for providing comprehensive speech-language treatment has been developed. and testing is underway. Preliminary results indicate that the system is a viable alternative to face-to-face treatment for adult clients with neurological impairments.";2004;1
This paper describes an ongoing researched remote rehabilitation assessment system that has a 6-freedom double-eyes vision robot to catch vision information, and a group of wearable sensors to acquire biomechanical signals. A server computer is fixed on the robot, to provide service's to the robot's controller and all the sensors. The robot is connected to Internet by wireless channel, and so do the sensors to the robot. Rehabilitation professionals can semi-automatically practise an assessment program via Internet. The preliminary results show that the smart device, including the robot and the sensors, can improve the quality of remote assessment, and reduce the complexity of operation at a distance.;2004;1
This paper is an analysis of the economics of physical telerehabilitation, at home, in the clinic, and at work. This study was a precursor to generating a business case for manufacturing telerehabilitation systems. Pilot studies were performed and structured interviews conducted with providers, payers, patients, and employers. The data obtained were analyzed, in conjunction with published data, to understand the economics with respect to parameters such as lost opportunity costs at work, faster rehabilitation, and cost savings to patients, providers, payers, and employers. The results showed that telerehabilitation has a positive business case with respect to all the stakeholders. The ability to quantify and analyze data from patients remotely is convenient and economical to providers. Patients benefit by getting back to their normal activities faster, both at home as well as work. Telerehabilitation at work allows employees to be treated at work without having to take time to go to a clinic. Lost opportunity costs for employers are minimized when workers return to work faster and are treated onsite. The ability to measure progress quantitatively is beneficial for patients, providers, payers, and employers. Additionally, malingering can be detected and eradicated using telerehabilitation. Proper application of appropriate telerehabilitation technologies makes eminent economical sense. There is a strong business case for the application of telerehabilitation, onsite, in large corporations and therefore is profitable to medical device manufacturers.;2004;1
This paper presents results from a study conducted at the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) on Telerehabilitation at the National Rehabilitation Hospital. The study was designed to measure performance by brain-injured subjects, with medical diagnoses of stroke or traumatic brain injury, on a standardized Speech-Language Pathology evaluation conducted in both face-to-face and videoconference-based telerehabilitation settings. The Story Retelling Procedure (SRP), which measures connected language production and comprehension of spoken narratives, was administered to each subject in both settings. The primary objectives of this study were to: (1) compare communication as measured by the SRP between experimental settings, and (2) determine if subject variables (such as age, education, technology experience or gender) had an effect on performance differences between settings. The rationale was that any difference in this aspect of performance must be identified and characterized before this mode of intervention can be used clinically. Across all subjects (n=40), no significant difference (p>0.05) was found between SRP performance measured in the two settings. Additionally, variables including age, education, technology experience, and gender did not significantly affect the difference between performance in the two settings. Overall, subjects reported a high level of acceptance of videoconferencing with 34 subjects responding yes, 4 responding no, and 2 responding maybe when asked if they would use videoconferencing again to talk to a clinician. Results of this study confirm the potential for SLP treatment using videoconferencing and indicate a need for continued research in the field.;2004;1
A group of 15 patients with amputee-related diagnoses were given a satisfaction survey after telemedicine assessment. Most of the videoconferencing sessions used an IP connection at 768 kbit/s. The patients were at four sites. The average connection time was less than 5 min and the average time for a session was approximately 40 min. Thirteen questions required scaled responses (poor, fair, good, excellent) and two required yes/no answers. The 13 categories broadly related to satisfaction with the telemedicine service and the quality of specialist care. In all categories, 97% of the responses fell in the good to excellent range. Concerns were raised about ease of access to local telemedicine sites, connection waiting times and lack of familiarity with telemedicine technology. The study showed that telemedicine was acceptable to patients with amputations and provided a reliable assessment of the amputee.;2005;1
Before starting the development of a new care application, researchers often want to evaluate recent developments in mainstream technology and assistive technology first. Laboratory experiments with new technology lack the realism of a field environment with real users and real caregivers. Field studies offer a more natural environment for the evaluation of new technology, but do not offer much room for experimentation. Caregivers are often aware of the possibilities of new technology but do not have the infrastructure to do research. Researchers at the Institute for Rehabilitation Research, TNO Prevention and Health Care, TNO-TPD, and caregivers of the Hoensbroeck Rehabilitation Centre in the Netherlands decided to combine the better of two worlds in a small-scale approach that allows experimentation in a care setting. Four field experiments were carried out. This paper describes the results, and conclusions are drawn concerning a methodology for small experiments.;2005;1
Brace treatment is the most common form of non-surgical intervention for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, the efficacy of brace treatment for AIS has been hampered by the lack of comprehensive information about compliance and wear patterns. Subjective feeling is the most commonly used method to evaluate how well patients are able to adhere to treatment protocol. Telerehabilitation enables continuous monitoring and adjustment of orthoses to optimize treatment. A smart brace system was developed to monitor loads exerted by braces during daily living. In addition to the data logging capability, the system is able to send the data or be remotely controlled via the Internet. This feature allows the treatment team members to review the data, provide advice and change the treatment protocol remotely if required.;2005;1
Healthcare costs in the U.S. are described. The potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) coupled with Telemedicine is reviewed as alternatives to addressing healthcare costs as well as its impact on delivery of care. Obstacles to widespread use of Expert Systems, Fuzzy Logic, and Neural Net technologies are described. Al, coupled with delivery of healthcare at a distance (Telemedicine) is considered. In particular, Telerehabilitation (neuromuscular reeducation) is shown to impact enhanced treatment, lower cost, and greater access to professional consultation.;2005;1
"In this paper, the current state of the art for virtual reality (VR) applications in the field of motor rehabilitation is reviewed. The paper begins with a brief overview of available equipment options. Next, a discussion of the scientific rationale for use of VR in motor rehabilitation is provided. Finally, the major portion of the paper describes the various VR systems that have been developed for use with patients, and the results of clinical studies reported to date in the literature. Areas covered include stroke rehabilitation (upper and lower extremity training, spatial and perceptual-motor training), acquired brain injury, Parkinson's disease, orthopedic rehabilitation, balance training, wheelchair mobility and functional activities of daily living training, and the newly developing field of telerehabilitation. Four major findings emerge from these studies: (1) people with disabilities appear capable of motor learning within virtual environments; (2) movements learned by people with disabilities in VR transfer to real world equivalent motor tasks in most cases, and in some cases even generalize to other untrained tasks; (3) in the few studies (n = 5) that have compared motor learning in real versus virtual environments, some advantage for VR training has been found in all cases; and (4) no occurrences of cybersickness in impaired populations have been reported to date in experiments where VR has been used to train motor abilities.";2005;1
Objective: To assess the feasibility of providing in-home adjunctive and supportive services to per sons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their families via a Web site. Design: Nineteen families were provided with access to the Web site intervention for 6 months. Those who needed it were provided with a computer and Internet service in their homes. Participants: Adult women who were the significant others of adult males with moderate-to-severe TBI. Main Outcome Measure: Value and ease of use of the Web site. Each participant's usage of the Web site was automatically tracked including each page visited, time of day, and time spent on the page. Results: Female significant others found the Web site to be valuable and easy to use, and used it throughout the 6-month period. The on-line support group was the most used and valued module. Conclusions: Family caregivers will use Web-based interventions to help meet their needs for social support, information, and guidance following the return home of persons with TBI.;2005;1
Over four million Americans are affected by stroke. Current theories of stroke rehabilitation point towards paradigms of intense, concentrated use of the afflicted limb as a means for motor program reorganization and partial function restoration. A home system for stroke rehabilitation to train recovery of hand function has been designed and deployed in a research study. The system measures finger and wrist flexion and extension motions on both hands. Patients use joint motion to control the cursor on a screen in a concentrated tracking task for several hours each day over the course of 10 days. A tele component was added so that a therapist can check in with the patient and monitor progress. Fifteen patients have used the system in their homes. The equipment has been reliable and patients have generally responded that the system is easy to use.;2005;1
Research has focused on improvement of the quality of life of stroke patients. Gait detection, kinematics and kinetics analysis, home-based rehabilitation and telerehabilitation are the areas where there has been increasing research interest. The paper reviews position-sensing technologies and their application for human movement tracking and stroke rehabilitation. The review suggests that it is feasible to build a home-based telerehabilitation system for sensing and tracking the motion of stroke patients.;2005;1
Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability among American adults. Each year, nearly 400,000 people survive but suffer from neurological disability. Patients' motivation and engagement during rehabilitation therapy is important because the amount, type and intensity of practice available to the patients during the recovery process is critical for the functional recovery after stroke. In the current paper we will introduce a National Institutes of Health-supported interdisciplinary project, involving researchers from the fields of Communication, Cell Neurobiology, Computer Science, Psychology, and Physical Therapy, to develop virtual therapeutic environments for post-stroke recovery. The purpose of the project is to develop virtual environments (VEs) that include different levels of haptic sensory feedback and to evaluate the effectiveness of these applications for neurorehabilitation training. The current system development, including applications using the PHANToM and CyberGrasp (haptic devices) as well as future research plans are discussed.;2005;1
Task-oriented repetitive movements can improve muscle strength and movement co-ordination in patients with impairments due to neurological lesions. The application of robotics and automation technology can serve to assist, enhance, evaluate and document the rehabilitation of movements. The paper provides an overview of existing devices that can support movement therapy of the upper extremities in subjects with neurological pathologies. The devices are critically compared with respect to technical function, clinical applicability, and, if they exist, clinical outcomes.;2005;1
The Remote Console (ReCon) telerehabilitation system provides a platform for therapists to guide rehabilitation sessions from a remote location. The ReCon system integrates real-time graphics, audio/video communication, private therapist chat, post-test data graphs, extendable patient and exercise performance monitoring, exercise pre-configuration and modification under a single application. These tools give therapists the ability to conduct training, monitoring/assessment, and therapeutic intervention remotely and in real-time.;2005;1
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized objectoriented modeling language. We used a visual UML tool, Rational XDE, in our development in order to set up a web-based, customer-centered telerehabilitation software system. We adopted a progressive strategy, establishing a basic system at first, and then expanding it, in the development. The results showed that UML improved greatly the readability and the object oriented properties of the telerehabilitation software system, and facilitated the update of the system.;2005;1
The use of virtual-reality technology in the areas of rehabilitation and therapy continues to grow, with encouraging results being reported for applications that address human physical, cognitive, and psychological functioning. This article presents a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis for the field of VIR rehabilitation and therapy. The SWOT analysis is a commonly employed framework in the business world for analyzing the factors that influence a company's competitive position in the marketplace with an eye to the future. However, the SWOT framework can also be usefully applied outside of the pure business domain. A quick check on the Internet will turn up SWOT analyses for urban-renewal projects, career planning, website design, youth sports programs, and evaluation of academic research centers, and it becomes obvious that it can be usefully applied to assess and guide any organized human endeavor designed to accomplish a mission, It is hoped that this structured examination of the factors relevant to the current and future status of VR rehabilitation will provide a good overview of the key issues and concerns that are relevant for understanding and advancing this vital application area.;2005;1
This paper addresses how UniTherapy, a telerehabilitation platform developed primarily for computer-assisted motivating rehabilitation applications, is being turned into an accessible service. This process has involved transformation to a service-oriented universal access infrastructure that also supports intelligent context-aware user interface generation that is dependent on current and emerging standards such as the V2 standard for Universal Remote Consoles. It also has involved support for a steadily increasing, diverse menu of approaches for performance assessment, and of interfaces for promoting universal access. Progress and key issues are discussed.;2005;1
This paper presents preliminary results from a virtual reality (VR)-based system for hand rehabilitation that uses a CyberGlove and a Rutgers Master II-ND haptic glove. This computerized system trains finger range of motion, finger flexion speed, independence of finger motion, and finger strength using specific VR simulation exercises. A remote Web-based monitoring station was developed to allow telerehabilitation interventions. The remote therapist observes simplified versions of the patient exercises that are updated in real time. Patient data is stored transparently in an Oracle database, which is also Web accessible through a portal GUI. Thus the remote therapist or attending physician can graph exercise outcomes and thus evaluate patient outcomes at a distance. Data from the VR simulations is complemented by clinical measurements of hand function and strength. Eight chronic post-stroke subjects participated in a pilot study of the above system. In keeping with variability in both their lesion size and site and in their initial upper extremity function, each subject showed improvement on a unique combination of movement parameters in VR training. Importantly, these improvements transferred to gains on clinical tests, as well as to significant reductions in task-completion times for the prehension of real objects. These results are indicative of the potential feasibility of this exercise system for rehabilitation in patients with hand dysfunction resulting from neurological impairment.;2005;1
this paper presents the design and implementation of a suite of computer-assisted rehabilitation platform techniques that are intended especially for individuals with upper-extremity motor impairments. It utilizes force-reflecting and other devices to provide interactive upper limb assessment and therapy. It includes a rich menu of user-centered performance assessment capabilities, and includes support for telerehabilitation links, for protocol design, and for data analysis. Preliminary results of its use as a research tool for several projects are presented and discussed.;2005;1
This paper presents the design and implementation of UniTherapy, a telerehabilitation platform which builds on other efforts at web-based therapy [1] and targets software support for Computer-Assisted Motivating Rehabilitation (CAMR) [2] protocols that are intended especially for individuals with stroke-induced disability. It utilizes mass-marketed force-reflecting joysticks and other input devices to provide interactive upper limb assessment and therapy, and includes four modes of robot assistance. It also includes a rich menu of performance assessment capabilities, and support for telerehabilitation links, for protocol design, and for data analysis. Preliminary results of its use as a research tool for several projects are presented and discussed.;2005;1
This study was a needs assessment to inform the design and evaluation of a home-based telerehabilitation network for rural elderly patients. We conducted a literature review of telerehabilitation studies and a needs-assessment by interviewing 43 professionals, including homecare nursing staff, members of volunteer organizations and service agencies, social workers, discharge planners, researchers, and rehabilitation therapists. The survey addressed perceived needs, advantages, and disadvantages with the use of telemedicine technologies for rehabilitation services. All respondents agreed that there are unmet needs among elderly people who are discharged from hospital settings, and identified several problems including: medication noncompliance, isolation, limited access to specialists and community-based services. Our findings defined a framework for the development of a client-oriented rural telehealth network that will be used to guide patients discharged to homecare following stroke, through a complex array of health, mental health, and social services, spanning all levels of care.;2005;1
"Us ing video-conference-based telerehabilitation technology to provide valid wheelchair assessment results call be a difficult task for occupational therapists (OT) due to the necessity of working on a 3D task within a 2D video-based screen. New virtual reality (VR) technology could improve this process by providing a real-time, 3D representation of the client and their wheelchair that can be remotely manipulated by the rehabilitation specialist. This; pilot study examined the potential of combining the Zaxel Virtual Viewpoint (TM) System (ZaxelVV) with the TightVNC application shoring software as a mean to improve visualization during an online wheelchair assessment. Following evaluation by two OT's, the current system was found to be appropriate for assessing overall posture in the wheelchair and wheeling handposition while a series of recommendations were also made before such a system could be used clinically. We also discuss the advantages and potential of the 3D approach including the possibilities for 3D measurements as well as automated assessments by a virtual therapist.";2005;1
Usability studies are an essential and iterative component of technology development and ease its transfer from the laboratory to the clinic. Although such studies are standard methodology in today's graphical user-interface applications, it is not clear that current methods apply to new technologies such as virtual reality. Thus experimentation is needed to examine what existing methods can be viably transferred to the new user-interaction situations. In this paper, 5 integrated inter-faces with 3 simultaneous users are evaluated via a set of usability studies, which adapt traditional methods for assessing the ease of use of the inter-face design, A single expert domain user was run in an intensive study that examined the therapist manual and inter-faces of the Rutgers Ankle Rehabilitation System (RARS). The interface and manual were extensively modified based on this evaluation. A second study involving 5 therapists was then conducted to evaluate the telerehabilitation component of the RARS system. In both studies, the tester and developer's observations, along with the session videotapes and therapist-user questionnaires, were triangulated to identify user problems and suggest design changes expected to increase the usability of the system. Changes that resulted from the analysis with the domain expert are described and recommendations for how to conduct usability studies in such multiuser remote virtual reality situations are proposed. Results from the pilot usability telemonitoring studies are also presented. The validity of usability studies in the development and refinement of rehabilitation technology is highlighted.;2005;1
"Virtual Reality (VR) provides useful rehabilitation applications, motivation, and feedback, for chronic stroke patients who might benefit from intensive massed therapies. Extensive therapy is required to take advantage of brain plasticity to modify neural organization and improve motor skills during the chronic phase after a stroke. Existing measurements used in a clinical setting are expensive, offer gross scales, and are subjective making it difficult to measure improvement or to detect refractory symptoms. Robotics applications are constrained to specific movements. New methods and tools are needed that use an inexpensive architecture, objective analysis techniques, and that offer hope for assessing motor skills more frequently or in a telerehabilitation environment. Management of motor disorders would benefit from practical automated objective techniques to monitor activities, measure and track kinetics and kinematics of complex motor skills associated with activities of daily living (ADL's) during exercise sessions and throughout the course of a patient's treatment process. We developed and tested a VR system using an unconstrained low-cost data glove and motivational games; patients can partake in intensive therapies while a data gathering application tracks hand and finger movements including x, y, z, yaw, pitch, and roll, finger flexion, speed, and session duration. These monitoring capabilities facilitate innovative telerehabilitation, compliance, and disease management models for people who have hand dysfunction as a result of neurological impairment. Specific movement routines may also be used for periodic objective assessment of the patient's performance.";2005;1
We describe a telerehabilitation system that has been developed in our laboratory, and initial results following use of the system on 2 patients with stroke. The system allows a therapist in a remote location to conduct treatment sessions, using a virtual-environment-based motor-training system, with a patient who is located at home. The system consists of a patient computer with motion-capture equipment and video camera, a therapist computer with video camera, and virtual-environment software that is synchronized over a high-speed Internet connection. The patient's movements are animated within the context of a virtual scene as she attempts to imitate a prerecorded movement, while the therapist can direct and monitor the activity in real time, as displayed in the animated virtual scene and via videoconference. The design, technical testing, and clinical feasibility testing of the system are reported. Results from the first 2 stroke patients to use the system indicate that patients made significant gains in upper-extremity function as measured by standard clinical tests and by their subjective report. As well, both patients demonstrated gains on quantitative kinematic measures of upper-extremity trajectories performed in the real world, indicating transfer of training from VE to real-world performance.;2005;1
What started as an opportunity to strengthen collaborative efforts between University of Alberta faculties and Capital Health has resulted in the development of a new Centre of Excellence in Telerehabilitation in Edmonton, Alberta. This Centre should bring improved services, education and support to clients and health service providers in rural and remote areas across Alberta and beyond. This paper describes the governance structure, and the results of a visioning session are presented in the form of action plans and strategies for the Centre.;2005;1
"A Remote Accessibility Assessment System (RAAS) that uses three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction technology is being developed; it enables clinicians to assess the wheelchair accessibility of users' built environments from a remote location. The RAAS uses commercial software to construct 3-D virtualized environments from photographs. We developed custom screening algorithms and instruments for analyzing accessibility. Characteristics of the camera and 3-D reconstruction software chosen for the system significantly affect its overall reliability. In this study, we performed an accuracy assessment to verify that commercial hardware and software can construct accurate 3-D models by analyzing the accuracy of dimensional measurements in a virtual environment and a comparison of dimensional measurements from 3-D models created with four cameras/settings. Based on these two analyses, we were able to specify a consumer-grade digital camera and PhotoModeler (EOS Systems, Inc, Vancouver, Canada) software for this system. Finally, we performed a feasibility analysis of the system in an actual environment to evaluate its ability to assess the accessibility of a wheelchair user's typical built environment. The field test resulted in an accurate accessibility assessment and thus validated our system.";2006;1
A tele-rehabilitation system has been designed for general use. The service can extend the rehabilitation treatment of patients affected by neurological diseases such as stroke or multiple sclerosis to their home, while under the control, supervision and responsibility of a hospital. Part of the initial work involved identifying the functional blocks of a tele-rehabilitation service. There are three parties involved in the tele-rehabilitation service: the health provider (the central unit of the system), the health operator (the medical unit of the system, generally a therapist) and the home platform (a central console with a high level of modularity). Tele-rehabilitative services that are easy to use could radically change the routine care and rehabilitation process.;2006;1
"An important goal in rehabilitation engineering is to develop technology that allows individuals with severe motor impairment to practice arm movement without continuous supervision from a rehabilitation therapist. This paper describes the development of such a system, called Therapy WREX or (T-WREX). The system consists of an orthosis that assists in arm movement across a large workspace, a grip sensor that detects hand grip pressure, and software that simulates functional activities. The arm orthosis is an instrumented, adult-sized version of the Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton (WREX), which is a five degrees-of-freedom mechanism that passively counterbalances the weight of the arm using elastic bands. After providing a detailed design description of T-WREX, this paper describes two pilot studies of the system's capabilities. The first study demonstrated that individuals with chronic stroke whose arm function is compromised in a normal gravity environment can perform reaching and drawing movements while using T-WREX. The second study demonstrated that exercising the affected arm of five people with chronic stroke with T-WREX over an eight week period improved unassisted movement ability (mean change in Fugl-Meyer score was 5 points +/- 2 SD; mean change in range of motion of reaching was 10%, p < 0.001). These results demonstrate the feasibility of automating upper-extremity rehabilitation therapy for people with severe stroke using passive gravity assistance, a grip sensor, and simple virtual reality software.";2006;1
Background: Technical feasibility was evaluated for conducting standard motor assessment instruments in a remote setting. Remote assessment was compared to co-located assessment for five evaluation instruments. Developing teleassessment methods is important for delivering rehabilitation services to those whose access is limited by distance or the abflity to travel to comprehensive rehabuitation clinics. The five clinical measures utilized were joint Range'of Motion (ROM), Manual Muscle Test (MMI), Berg Sit-toStand, Berg Forward Reach and the Timed Up and Go (TUG). Methods: Co-located and remote rooms were in the same buflding, connected by broadband video and audio. Ten subjects without impairments participated, but were given simulated impairments to mimic the patient population commonly seen in rehabilitation clinics. One therapist performed all co-located testing while another performed all remote assessments. The two therapists were blinded to each others' test results. Measurements followed standard clinical methods. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and paired Wests. Results: No significant differences were found between co-located and remote assessments, but the power to detect small differences was low. Remote ROM tests using snapshots and a virtual goniorneter were preferred. A digital dynamometer added no additional information to a visually-based remote MMT assessment. Conclusions: Remote application of several clinical test instruments was shown to be technically feasible and there are advantages to particular methods for conducting remote assessments. A clinical study with patients is needed to determine efficacy, reliability and validity of remote assessment.;2006;1
Continuing advances in virtual environment (VE) technology such as the new addition of force and touch feedbacks have enhanced VE realism and supported the development of more useful and accessible VE systems. One of the useful VE systems is telerehabilitation system. This paper introduces the framework of a new VE telerehabilitation system. A training exercise in the system is designed for users with hand dysfunction. The exercise is to train hand movement from two aspects of motion speed and precision. A haptic device PHANTOM Premium 1.0 is used to give the user immediate force feedbacks and make him/her feel more immersed in the VE while he/she implements the training task The implementation performances are calculated and given to the user after each exercise. They are also saved in files for the evaluation and prescription from the therapist.;2006;1
d A cooperative tandem canoeing task with haptic feedback is developed for internet application. A pair of InMotion2 robots provide stroke commands to the boat and force feedback to the operators while a flat screen panel displays the virtual environment to the participants. OpenInventor is used to generate the graphical environment while a realistic dynamics engine runs concurrently on all RT Linux box. Experimental results are presented for racing a straight-line canoe course, and future work involving new input devices and virtual environments are discussed.;2006;1
"In this paper we describe our experience in designing and testing a virtual environment based (VE) Telerehabilitation system. The system allows a therapist to conduct interactive treatment sessions remotely with a patient who is located at home. Some of the technical and practical issues encountered during development and testing are described, as well as how we adapted the system to allow training of more skilled hand functions. Preliminary results of the first 12 subjects with stroke to use the system showed significant gains in upper extremity function following 30 one-hr treatment sessions (FuglMeyer, p < 0.0001; Wolf Motor p=0.0097; shoulder (p=0.0027) and grip (p=0.025) strength. These changes were maintained, for the most part; at 4-month follow-up.";2006;1
In this paper, teleoperation of a master-slave robot system with haptic feedback and network traffic reduction for rehabilitation are presented. At first, the stability of the teleoperation system with haptic feedback via time delay communication environment is mathematically shown for multi-joint robot arm system. Experiments show that the system is stable, despite of time delay. In order to reduce packet transfer rate for transmission of data, deadband control approach is used. A new data reconstruction algorithm is proposed to improve system's performance for telerehabilitation while keeping the stability of the system. The validity of the approach is shown in simulations.;2006;1
"ISS is currently conducting a web-based learning activity within the EU Project HELLODOC [1]. The Project core is a home-based telerehabilitation service for patients with Traumatic Brain Injury, Stroke or Multiple Sclerosis. The homecare device consists of an instrumented activity desk [1] which allows the execution and monitoring of configurable sets of upper limb exercises. A distance educational programme was designed and setup within the Project to train professionals to the effective management of the telerehabilitation service. In order to implement the programme, ISS adapted the Moodle e-learning platform [2] and used the Problem Based Learning methodology. Two e-learning modules were prepared, one more clinically and the other more technically oriented. The courses started on January 9(th) 2006. They will remain open until October 2006. The modules contain traditional leaming sources as well as interactive learning tools. Each module includes 4 Units, whose working cycle is 5 days each. Each Unit is tutored one week every four; however, it will be available throughout the entire course. Overall continuous support is offered by ISS staff. At the end of the on-line period, statistics on quality and effectiveness of the courses will be elaborated.";2006;1
Obiectives: To assess the impact of a Brain Injury (BI) Rehabilitation curriculum delivered via videoconferencing on participant's clinical practice. Methods: Self-volunteered participants were contacted for a three-month follow-up telephone interview after curriculum completion. A structured schedule of questions was utilized to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. Qualitative results were analysed using a constant comparative method of analysis to generate themes. Results: 49 interviews were conducted out of the 58 subjects initially identified. 91.8 % of the interviewees reported their expectations of the curriculum were met, 67.3% agreed or strongly agreed their confidence in working with BI clients was improved, and 77.6% felt their ability to provide clinical service to this population was improved. Conclusions: A videoconferenced brain injury curriculum reached participants over broad geographic areas. The curriculum increased participants' confidence in dealing with BI clients and had a positive impact on participants' ability to provide clinical service.;2006;1
One of the key challenges in home rehabilitation field is the need for more personalized protocols and interfaces. This paper presents how UniTherapy, a telerehabilitation platform developed primarily for coniputer-assisted motivating rehabilitation (CAMR) applications, is being turned into a home rehabilitation appliance. This includes support for emerging standards, including Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) and the User Interface Socket (UI Socket) that is enables a Universal Remote Console (URC) to fully operate and automatically generate user interfaces on various available devices. Progress and related issues are discussed.;2006;1
Our ability to provide in-home rehabilitation is limited by distance and available personnel. We may be able to meet some rehabilitation needs with videoconferencing technology. This article describes the feasibility of teletechnology for delivering multifactorial, in-home rehabilitation interventions to community-dwelling adults recently prescribed a mobility aid. We used standard telephone lines to provide twoway video and audio interaction. The interventions included prescription of and/or training in ftinctionally based exercises, home-hazard assessment, assistive technology, environmental modifications, and adaptive strategies. Patients were evaluated in three transfer and three mobility tasks, and appropriate treatment was provided over the course of four visits. To date, 13 of the 14 subjects enrolled in the rehabilitation study have completed all four visits (56 visits total). Equipment-related problems were most common early in the study, particularly on the initial visit to a subject's house.We identified (mean standard deviation [SD]) 13.1 +/- 7.9 mobility/self-care problems per subject and made 12.5 +/- 8.3 recommendations per subject to address those problems. At 6-week follow-up, 60.1 percent of our recommendations had been implemented. The greatest number of problems was identified for tub transfers (mean +/- SD = 3.4 +/- 1.4), the greatest number of recommendations was made for toilet transfers (mean +/- SD = 3.1 +/- 3.4), and the most frequently implemented recommendations were for transition between locations. Overall, our results show promise that both the telerehabilitation technology and intervention procedures are feasible.;2006;1
"Primary objective: The present study reports the results of 103 persons with acquired brain injury who were randomly assigned to one of three 20-session analogy problem-solving skill training groups, namely: online training ( through computer video conferencing with interactive software); computer-assisted training ( through interactive patient-directed software); therapist administered training (face-to-face therapist guided training activities); and a no-treatment control group. Research design: Pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design. Main outcome and results: Individuals' problem-solving skills and self-efficacy in all four groups were assessed over a four-week period. Overall, the training methods were found to be effective in improving problem solving skills regardless of the modes of delivery ( except in the case of the control group). The continuous human touch characteristics of the therapist-administered group showed significant better improvements in self- efficacy in problem-solving. Conclusion: The statistically significantly improvement in problem solving skills in the online-group suggests that this approach could effectively improve cognitive functions of person with ABI and yield training outcomes comparable to other modes of delivery such as the face-to-face training. The conceptualization and applicability of tele-cognitive rehabilitation, its implications for persons with ABI, and future studies in this research area are also discussed.";2006;1
Primary objective: To evaluate the effects of different trainer-trainee interaction patterns on the self-efficacy outcomes of trainees with brain injury. Research design: A pre-test and post-test randomized clinical trial design. Methods and procedures: One hundred and three subjects with brain injury were recruited and 83 subjects participated in analogical problem-solving training that was delivered in three respective interaction modes: (a) direct trainer-trainee interaction, (b) self-paced computer-assisted and (c) on-line training with real-time audio-visual interaction. Quizzes on daily behavioural problem-solving and a problem-solving self-efficacy rating scale were adopted as outcome measures. The trainees in the trainer-administered group that received instructions in person with a continuous 'human touch' showed more significant improvement in their problem-solving self-efficacy than the two other groups. Conclusions: Interactive modes of cognitive skill training can be flexible enough to match the needs of individual trainees. However, human interaction is considered important in promoting self-efficacy in trainees with brain injury.;2006;1
Purpose. Evaluate clinical service characteristics of a physical rehabilitation outreach clinic. Method. A retrospective analysis on service- related factors and patient information (every clinical encounter between 1983 and 2002) was performed on the Terry Fox Mobile Clinic. The Terry Fox Mobile Clinic provided multidisciplinary physical rehabilitation outreach services for adults with disabilities in Eastern and North Eastern Ontario, Canada (on-site visits by rehabilitation specialists). Subjects include 4816 clients with physical disabilities from Eastern and North Eastern Ontario, Canada. Patient data (age, residence, diagnosis, inpatient/ outpatient), clinic data (type, location, totals), team data (clinical disciplines), and assistive device utilization over the last 15 years of data were used for analysis. Results. Over 15 years, 4816 clients (1032 clinic days, 1.46 patient-contact ratio) were seen by the outreach team. Single discipline days were the best 'number of clinic days' predictor. Following 1999, the 35-64 age group became predominate (instead of over-65). Most patients lived in their own residence. Stroke, amputations, neck and back pain, and cerebral palsy accounted for 53% of patient diagnoses. Wheelchairs and orthoses were the highest ranked assistive device consultations/ prescriptions (total 6304). Physicians were involved with the majority of patient contacts. Most clinic activity occurred at sites within 100 km driving distance. Sites over 200 km away had the lowest correlation with the number of clinic days. Conclusions. The 15 years of physical rehabilitation outreach service data is valuable for planning new outreach programs, benchmarking existing services, and telerehabilitation comparisons. Multidisciplinary physical rehabilitation can make a positive contribution to healthcare that extends beyond direct patient contact time.;2006;1
"Purpose: This pilot study explored the feasibility and effectiveness of an Internet-based telerehabilitation application for the assessment of motor speech disorders in adults with acquired neurological impairment. Method: Using a counterbalanced, repeated measures research design, 2 speech-language pathologists assessed 19 speakers with dysarthria on a battery of perceptual assessments. The assessments included a 19-item version of the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA; P. Enderby, 1983), the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech (K. M. Yorkston & D. R. Beukelman, 1981), perceptual analysis of a speech sample, and an overall rating of severity of the dysarthria. One assessment was conducted in the traditional face-to-face manner, whereas the other assessment was conducted using an online, custom-built telerehabilitation application. This application enabled real-time videoconferencing at 128 kb/s and the transfer of store-and-forward audio and video data between the speaker and speech-language pathologist sites. The assessment methods were compared using the J.M.Bland and D.G.Altman (1986, 1999) limits-of-agreement method and percentage level of agreement between the 2 methods. Results: Measurements of severity of dysarthria, percentage intelligibility in sentences, and most perceptual ratings made in the telerehabilitation environment were found to fall within the clinically acceptable criteria. However, several ratings on the FDA were not comparable between the environments, and explanations for these results were explored. Conclusions: The online assessment of motor speech disorders using an Internet-based telerehabilitation system is feasible. This study suggests that with additional refinement of the technology and assessment protocols, reliable assessment of motor speech disorders over the Internet is possible. Future research methods are outlined.";2006;1
Rehabilitative interventions may be provided to disabled people at home by means of telerebabilitation. We evaluated the effects of a telerehabilitation program designed for ameliorating motor deficits in post-stroke patients with arm impairment. We also compared the. effects of home-based traditional rehabilitation provided by physiotherapists. We selected 24 patients suffering from mild/intermediate arm motor impairments due to a long-lasting ischemic stroke in the territory of middle cerebral artery. A new virtual reality (vr) based system working on Internet connections provided adequate motor tasks to the patients from a remote rehabilitation facility. Both, the home-based traditional and the telerehabilitation programs, lasted four weeks. Before, at the end of the therapies and one month thereafter, we assessed the motor deficit and the functional activities of the upper extremity with the Fugl-Meyer scale and the Abilhand scale. In addition, the spasticity of the arm was determined with the Ashworth scale. Finally, we examined at the same evaluation times the mean linear velocity and the duration of 30 consecutive reaching movements. Both the rehabilitative therapies improved significantly the Fugl-Meyer mean score and the Abilhand scale score. The clinical outcomes were not different between the two groups. In the telerehabilitation treated group, mean duration and mean velocity of the reaching movements improved by 20.5 % and by 16.3%, respectively. These results supported the observations that some post stroke patients may benefit from a home-based telerehabilitation program to improve their motor deficits. This fact may favor an early discharge from hospital and have beneficial effects on the quality of life. In addition, telerehabilitation program may spare the available resources since allows physiotherapists and physicians to rehabilitate and monitor the patients remotely from rehabilitation facilities.;2006;1
"Survivors of brain injury or stroke can improve movement ability with intensive, supervised practice. Since the hours of supervised therapy with a physical or occupational therapist are limited, telerehabilitation will enable patients to greatly expand the hours that they practice therapeutic exercises. The Jerusalem TeleRehabilitation System (JTRS) consists of patient and therapist systems plus a central server and database connected via the internet. The system can work in two modes: (1) a cooperative mode in which the therapist and patient are on-line at the same time, and (2) a stand-alone mode in which the patient uses the system on his own. In both cases, the system will monitor the status and progress of the patient and various parameters of his movement abilities, and prepare reports for the patient and for the therapist. From the clinic, the therapist will be able to change the screen seen by the patient and change the level and types of tasks, as needed. Compared to existing systems, our system will have the following advantages: (1) inexpensive and easy to use; (2) remote monitoring and control of the patient's computer by the therapist in the clinic; (3) more detailed analysis of patient status and progress; (4) a smart system which self-adapts to the patient's capabilities in real time, increasing or decreasing the difficulty of the exercise as needed; and (5) a central, international database which, by gathering data on many patients over time, will provide the basis for smart therapy and will also facilitate coordinated multicenter research studies.";2006;1
Telemedicine and its application of telerehabilitation (TR) appear to offer endless possibilities for creative, personalized therapies and interventions beyond the initial applications with videoconferencing. Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute (SKRI) has been practicing TR and applying virtual reality (VR) to physical rehabilitation for almost ten years. Our experience has shown that many rural patients lack access to rehabilitation services, which can lead to poor clinical outcomes. Urban patients may have access to services, but poor outcomes still may result due to non-compliance. Bridging of distance, provision of expertise to locales where little exists and the potential of web based delivery and simulation are areas developed by SEM. Experience of over 5 years of video teleconferencing (VTC) TR program and expansion of the concept of distance therapy applications to homes of patients will be discussed, along with the barriers to implementation. The application of VR in TR holds much promise in engaging and motivating patients in home-based therapies.;2006;1
Telerehabilitation is the provision of rehabilitation services at a distance, by a therapist at a remote location. Telerehabilitation, integrated with virtual reality, is a relatively new addition to this field. This paper describes the technical and patient performance of a virtual reality based telerehabilitation system for ankle training. Telerehabilitation was introduced in the fourth week of a lower extremity virtual reality-based training program for individuals post-stroke. Technical performance of the system was assessed based on bandwidth and time lag of message transmission, which were found to be suitable for clinicto-clinic communication. Patient performance in the transition from the third to the fourth week of training remained the same (for accuracy of ankle movement, exercise duration and training efficiency) or increased (mechanical power of the ankle and number of repetitions). These findings strengthen the case for virtual reality based telerehabilitation.;2006;1
"The care of a spinal cord injury (SCI) person constitutes a great challenge for the provider: SCI persons are mobility impaired, and they are prone to develop multiple comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, bladder infections, wounds, and depression. Furthermore, disease manifestations can be misleading depending on the level of injury. The utilization of telemedicine to monitor patients and deliver care has opened a new horizon for SCI persons. Several telehealth programs are now in use to monitor pressure ulcers and post-discharge rehabilitation in SCI persons. To answer the need for a more comprehensive approach to the multifaceted manifestation of SCI at the James J. Peters VAMC, we have started a customized telerehabilitation program. The program monitors the most common comorbidities of SCI, it is instrumental in the reintegration of the SCI person in the community, it offers individualized in-home rehabilitation programs, it addresses safety issues, and it offers counseling, weight reduction, and maintenance plans. A team of SCI specialists - including an internist, a registered nurse, a physical therapist, a nutritionist, a psychologist, and a recreational therapist - are available for weekly meetings with the patients. The programs are tailored to the patients' needs and agreed upon by both parties. Both messaging devices and videomonitors are utilized. An interdisciplinary template is used to record assessments and plans. Preliminary results are encouraging; coordination of the team and relative poor technology are some of the obstacles we have identified. Further evaluation is necessary to determine cost effectiveness.";2006;1
The Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) has been shown to be highly effective in treating the speech disorder in Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, patient access to this treatment remains limited in Australia, due to availability of speech pathologists, patient mobility and distance issues. We have investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of an Internet-based telerehabilitation application (eREHAB) for the delivery of the LSVT to persons with PD and disordered speech. Ten participants with PD and dysarthria were treated online with the LSVT for a total of 16 sessions. There were significant improvements in sound pressure levels for vowel prolongation, reading and conversational monologue (P < 0.01), pitch range (P < 0.05) and in perceptual features of pitch and loudness variability, loudness level (P < 0.01) and breathiness (P < 0.05). A participant satisfaction questionnaire indicated that 70% of participants expressed overall satisfaction with the online treatment. Telerehabilitation was feasible and effective in delivering the LSVT to people with PD.;2006;1
The potential for remote diagnosis and treatment over the Internet using robotics is now a reality. The state of the art is exemplified by several Internet applications, and we explore the current trends in developing new systems. We review the technical challenges that lie ahead, along with some potential solutions. Some promising results for a new bilateral system involving two InMotion2 robots are presented. Finally, we discuss the future direction and commercial outlook for rehabilitation robots over the next 15 years.;2006;1
The Remote Console (ReCon) is a telerehabilitation application that allows therapists to remotely communicate with patients while monitoring and controlling their virtual rehabilitation exercises. It provides therapists visual feedback of patients' movements, their exercise simulations replicated in real time and with tools to conduct training without a face-to-face session. The Recon underwent a formative evaluation (a type of usability engineering methodology) used to refine its design. Five physical therapists from different practice settings acted as representative users. During the evaluation, these users made errors related to manipulation and finding and understanding controls. Technical issues with the server and audio communication were identified. These findings were used to fine-tune the ReCon system.;2006;1
This article describes an online problem-solving cognitive rehabilitation training programme with twenty interactive pictorial sessions. Disseminated through a media server, therapists are able to conduct interactive training programme to remote patients. In this study, it was hypothesized that the programme can help people with brain injuries to learn better problem-solving skills through systematic, theoretically driven learning strategies.;2006;1
"To examine the effect on mobility self-efficacy of a multifactorial, individualized, occupational/physical therapy (OT/PT) intervention delivered via teletechnology or in-home visits. Randomized, clinical trial. One Department of Veterans Affairs and one private rehabilitation hospital. Sixty-five community-dwelling adults with new mobility devices. Thirty-three were randomized to the control or usual care group (UCG), 32 to the intervention group (IG). Four, once-weekly, 1-hour OT/PT sessions targeting three mobility and three transfer tasks. A therapist delivered the intervention in the traditional home setting (trad group n = 16) or remotely via teletechnology (tele group n = 16). Ten-item Likert-scale measure of mobility self-efficacy. The IG had a statistically significantly greater increase in overall self-efficacy over the study period than the UCG (mean change: IG 8.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.8-13.7; UCG 1.2, 95% CI = -5.8-8.2). Descriptively, the IG exhibited positive changes in self-efficacy for all tasks and greater positive change than the UCG on all items with the exception of getting in and out of a chair. Comparisons of the two treatment delivery methods showed a medium standardized effect size (SES) in both the tele and trad groups, although it did not reach statistical significance for the tele group (SES: tele = 0.35, 95% CI = -2.5-0.95; trad = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.06-1.14). A multifactorial, individualized, home-based OT/PT intervention can improve self-efficacy in mobility-impaired adults. The trend toward increased self-efficacy irrespective of the mode of rehabilitation delivery suggests that telerehabilitation can be a viable alternative to or can augment traditional in-home therapy.";2006;1
We have developed a device called AutoCITE (Automated Constraint-Induced Therapy Extension) that automates the intensive training component of constraint-induced (CI) movement therapy, also known as Cl therapy. This study evaluated the effectiveness of AutoCITE training in a telerehabilitation setting when supervised remotely and with only intermittent interaction with a therapist. Seven participants with chronic stroke trained with AutoCITE for 3 h/d for 10 consecutive weekdays. The therapist supervised the training from a different room in the clinic using remote control of the AutoCITE computer and teleconferencing equipment when needed. Treatment gains on the Motor Activity Log were quite large (p < 0.001, d ' = 3), while gains on the Wolf Motor Function Test and the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test were large (p < 0.05, d ' < 0.9). Gains were comparable in size with those previously reported for participants who received equal intensities of directly supervised AutoCITE training or standard one-on-one CI therapy without the device.;2006;1
We present a haptic telerehabilitation framework for patients with upper-limb dysfunction that is well-suited for deployment in patients' homes. Specifically, a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) haptic force-feedback driving wheel interfaces with a PC to create a haptic Virtual Driving Environment (hVDE). Coupling this framework with parametric exercise/ movement protocols-structured as driving exercises along paths of varying complexity-is the key to the creation of an inexpensive, immersive, and yet individualized personal-movement trainer.;2006;1
We reviewed the methodology used in telemedicine research concerning patients with Postural and movement disorders. Literature searches were performed using various computerized databases through to October 2005. Twenty-two studies met the criteria for review. Two broad models of telemedicine delivery were represented in the literature: (1) telemedicine between health-care professionals at each telemedicine site (n = 16) and (2) telemedicine between health-care professionals and a patient at a remote site (n = 6). Disparate research methodologies were used to investigate these two models. Most studies were limited to investigating the technical feasibility and acceptability of a telemedicine service rather than focusing on the overall effect of introducing the telemedicine service into routine health care. Nonetheless, it is possible to conclude that telemedicine is acceptable for both patients and professionals when used in rehabilitation. Since the two models of telemedicine evaluation tend to explore different outcomes (diagnostic accuracy versus health status), it is recommended that separate methodologies should be used. In contrast to evaluations of telemedicine model 2, randomized controlled trials appear to be less valuable for telemedicine model 1.;2006;1
A portable tele-assessment system was designed for remote evaluation of the elbow joint with spasticity and contracture in patients with neurological disorders. A master device and a slave device were used to drive a manikin arm and the patient's arm, respectively. The elbow flexion angle and torque were measured at both the master and slave devices, fed back to their counterparts. The examiner moved the manikin arm at selected velocities and haptically felt the resistance from the patient's elbow to evaluate the spasticity in terms of the velocity dependence of the resistance torque and the catch angle. To minimize the effect of network latency in the tasks with fast speed, a quasi real-time tele-operation scheme was developed which provided the examiner with transparent and stable haptic feeling of the patient's elbow. The tele-assessment system provided truthful haptic feeling through the internet and allowed us to evaluate the spasticity in elbows of patients post stroke quantitatively.;2007;1
Advances in wireless sensor network management have potential applications in urban telehealth. Telehealth is the delivery of health related services and information via telecommunications technologies. Previous efforts on telemedicine management have focused on medical care for rural populations, however urban communities will benefit significantly from advances in wireless network design and management. Within the domain of occupational and physical therapy, known as telerehabilitation, expected active benefits to urban communities include greater adherence to rehabilitation protocol due to ease of use and removal of the travel requirement for multiple weekly trips to clinical site and clinical appointments. Additionally, passive benefits are envisioned to include monitoring of the environment, such as balconies, interior and hallway spaces for detection of road and urban pollutants, including cigarette, exhaust, and cleaning products. The integration of active and passive sensing would provide a more complete picture of the therapy client's living environment and the therapy practice within that environment. This information can be provided by the proposed wireless sensor network application.;2007;1
As the number of persons with disabilities increases because of factors such as aging combined with chronic illnesses, the challenge of providing rehabilitation also increases. Unfortunately, financial considerations have shortened length of stay in acute and subacute settings and reduced rehabilitation services. With earlier discharges, there is an increased need to deliver services to patients in their homes in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Telerehabilitation is an emerging practice that uses communications technology for the remote delivery of rehabilitative care. The Low ADL Monitoring Program is a telerehabilitation program designed to deliver rehabilitation services through the provision of home environmental interventions, together with communications technology and care coordination.;2007;1
Background: technical feasibility was evaluated for conducting standard motor assessment instruments in a remote setting. Remote assessment was compared to co-located assessment for five clinical evaluation instruments: joint range-of-motion (ROM), manual muscle test (MMT), Berg sit-to-stand, Berg forward reach, and timed up and go (TUG). Methods: co-located and remote rooms were in the same building connected by broadband video and audio. Ten subjects without impairments participated, but were given simulated impairments to mimic the patient population commonly seen in rehabilitation clinics. One therapist performed all co-located testing while another performed all remote assessments. Measurements followed standard clinical methods. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and paired t-tests. Results: no differences were found between co-located and remote assessments except for some cases using screen-based ROM measures. Remote ROM tests using snapshots and a virtual goniometer were preferred. A digital dynamometer added no additional information to a visually-based remote MMT assessment.;2007;1
Background: There is a need to improve semi-autonomous stroke therapy in home environments often characterized by low supervision of clinical experts and low extrinsic motivation. Our distributed device approach to this problem consists of an integrated suite of low-cost robotic/computer-assistive technologies driven by a novel universal access software framework called UniTherapy. Our design strategy for personalizing the therapy, providing extrinsic motivation and outcome assessment is presented and evaluated. Methods: Three studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of the suite. A conventional force-reflecting joystick, a modified joystick therapy platform (TheraJoy), and a steering wheel platform (TheraDrive) were tested separately with the UniTherapy software. Stroke subjects with hemiparesis and able-bodied subjects completed tracking activities with the devices in different positions. We quantify motor performance across subject groups and across device platforms and muscle activation across devices at two positions in the arm workspace. Results: Trends in the assessment metrics were consistent across devices with able-bodied and high functioning strokes subjects being significantly more accurate and quicker in their motor performance than low functioning subjects. Muscle activation patterns were different for shoulder and elbow across different devices and locations. Conclusion: The Robot/CAMR suite has potential for stroke rehabilitation. By manipulating hardware and software variables, we can create personalized therapy environments that engage patients, address their therapy need, and track their progress. A larger longitudinal study is still needed to evaluate these systems in under-supervised environments such as the home.;2007;1
Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by the compression of the median nerve as it transits the carpal tunnel, with an incidence of about 1 % of the population. If surgery is needed, the treatment involves decompression of the median nerve followed sometimes by musculoskeletal outpatient rehabilitation. This paper presents a proof-of-concept pilot clinical trial in which the Rutgers Masters II haptic glove was tested on five subjects, who were two weeks post-hand surgery. Subjects trained for 13 sessions, 30 min per session, three sessions per week, and had no conventional outpatient therapy. Computerized measures of performance showed group effects in hand mechanical energy (1200% for the virtual ball squeezing and DigiKey exercises and 600% for the power putty exercise). Improvement in their hand function was also observed (a 38% reduction in virtual pegboard errors, and 70% fewer virtual hand ball errors). Clinical strength measures showed increases in grip (by up to 150%) and key pinch (up to 46%) strength in three of the subjects, while two subjects had decreased strength following the study. However, all five subjects improved in their tip pinch strength of their affected hand (between 20%-267%). When asked whether they would recommend the virtual reality exercises to others, four subjects very strongly agreed and one strongly agreed that they would.;2007;1
Hand rehabilitation, following stroke or hand surgery, is repetitive and long duration and can be facilitated with the assistance of complex, heavy and cumbersome haptic gloves based on sensors. The present paper describes a virtual glove, software based, which tracks hand movements by using images collected from webcams and numerical analysis. Finger forces are calculated from the deformations impressed to some objects (of known elastic coefficient) grasped by the patient hand. The presented system is notable for simplicity, generality and low cost. Implementation and results of the proposed virtual glove will be the objects of a future paper. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we describe our experience in designing a virtual environment-based (VE) telerehabilitation system, and the results of a clinical study of the first 11 subjects with stroke to use the system. Our telerehabilitation system allows a therapist to conduct interactive VE treatment sessions remotely with a patient who is located at home. The system, software architecture, and development experience are described. Results of the clinical study on subjects with stroke showed significant improvements in upper extremity function following 30 1-h VE treatment sessions as measured by three standard clinical tests: Fugl-Meyer test of motor recovery (FM) (p < 0.0001), Wolf motor test (WMT) (p = 0.0097, and shoulder strength (ShS) (p = 0.0027). Grip strength (GS) showed a trend toward improvement (p = 0.025). These changes were maintained, for the most part, at four-months follow-up (FM + 7.6, WMT - 18.4 s, ShS, + 169 %, GS, + 53 %).;2007;1
"Objective. To compare 2 telerehabilitation training strategies, repetitive tracking movements versus repetitive simple movements, to promote brain reorganization and recovery of hand function. Methods. Twenty subjects with chronic stroke and 10 degrees of voluntary finger extension were randomly assigned to receive 1800 telerehabilitation trials over 2 weeks of either computerized tracking training (track group) with the affected finger and wrist involving temporospatial processing to achieve accuracy or movement training (move group) with no attention to accuracy. Following movement training, the move group crossed over to receive an additional 2 weeks of tracking training. Behavioral changes were measured with the Box and Block test, Jebsen Taylor test, and finger range of motion, along with a finger-tracking activation paradigm during fMRI. Results. The track group showed significant improvement in all 4 behavioral tests; the move group improved in the Box and Block and Jebsen Taylor tests. The improvement for the track group in the Box and Block and Jebsen Taylor tests did not surpass that for the move group. A consistent group pattern of brain reorganization was not evident. The move group, after crossing over, did not show further significant improvements. Conclusion. Telerehabilitation may be effective in improving performance in subjects with chronic stroke. Tracking training with reinforcement to enhance learning, however, did not produce a clear advantage over the same amount of practice of random movements. Two weeks of training may be insufficient to demonstrate a behavioral advantage and associated brain reorganization.";2007;1
"Objective: To examine effect of coaching intervention on psychological adjustment to illness and health-related QOL (HRQOL) in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Subjects: Twelve independently living patients with spinocerebellar degeneration aged 20-65 years old, without cognitive impairment or psychiatric disorder received coaching intervention, which was postponed in another 12 (control). Interventions: Three physician coaches telephoned assigned patients for 15-30 minutes in each of 10 weekly coaching sessions over three months. Main outcome measures: Primary endpoints were HRQOL (SF-36) and psychological adjustment to illness (Nottingham Adjustment Scale, Japanese version; NAS-J). Results: Two-way analysis of variance (group x time) showed statistically significant main effects of time for vitality (F=5.00; P=0.036), anxiety/depression (F=5.15; P=0.033), and locus of control (F=5.58; P=0.027), indicating improvement of scores over time in both coaching and control groups. No main effect of group or interaction was seen. However analysis of covariance with baseline scores as the covariate showed the coaching group to have better self-efficacy scores than controls at follow-up (least-square mean, experimental group, 65.1; control group, 52.7;, P= 0.037). Conclusion: Carefully structured telephone coaching can improve self-efficacy in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration.";2007;1
Repetitive movements can improve muscle strength and movement coordination in patients with neurological disorders and impairments. Robot-aided approaches can serve to enhance the rehabilitation process. They can not only improve the therapeutic outcome but also support clinical evaluation and increase the patient motivation. This chapter provides an overview of existing systems that can support the movement therapy of the upper extremities in subjects with neurological pathologies. The devices are compared with respect to technical function, clinical applicability, and clinical outcomes.;2007;1
Telemedicine plays a critical role within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration by allowing the surveillance and care of patients who are isolated by geography, poverty, and disability. In military settings, telemedicine is being widely used to identify injury and illness and aid in the treatment, rehabilitation, and recovery of combat-wounded soldiers in theater. Rapid advances in both domains are transforming the way clinicians provide care, education, and support to patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their families. This article discusses the military and VA telemedicine capabilities that are supporting the care of service members and veterans with TBI. These capabilities include new technologies that enhance the identification of TBI, management of symptoms in theater, and application of proven technologies (interactive video, Internet, and World Wide Web) to improve overall care coordination throughout military and VA systems. The impact of distance learning, tele-consultation, telerehabilitation, and home telehealth programs is also described within this context.;2007;1
"Telerehabilitation is the provision at a distance of rehabilitation services such as physiotherapy, speech pathology or occupational therapy. The primary aim is to provide equitable access to rehabilitation services. Broadly speaking, the technologies used for telemedicine-based physical rehabilitation can be classified as: (1) image-based telerehabilitation; (2) sensor-based telerehabilitation; and (3) virtual environments and virtual reality telerehabilitation. To date, much of the research has been technology focused, and has consisted of single case or small sample research designs. The next step is to demonstrate viable telerehabilitation services in real world environments using well controlled research methodologies with large patient cohorts. In addition, the broader issues of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness require investigation. If this can be done, then the undoubted potential benefits of telerehabilitation, for both the patient and health-care systems, can be realized.";2007;1
Telerehabilitation is the provision of rehabilitation services at a distance by a therapist at a remote location. Integration with virtual reality (VR) is a relatively new addition to this field. This paper describes the technical and patient performance of a telerehabilitation application the remote console (ReCon) that is, integrated with a VR system. The VR system consists of the Rutgers Ankle prototype robot, a local PC which is connected with a remote PC connected over the Internet. Six individuals in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a four week training program. They used the robot to interact with two VR simulations, while the therapist was in the same room during the first three weeks or in another room during the fourth week. Technical and patient performance was assessed in the transition from the third to the fourth week of training. Technical performance of the system was assessed based on bandwidth and lag of message transmission, which were found to be suitable for clinic-to-clinic communication. Patient performance (in terms of accuracy of ankle movement, exercise duration and training efficiency, mechanical power of the ankle, and number of repetitions) did not decrease during telerehabilitation in the fourth week. These preliminary findings over a short telerehabilitation intervention support the feasibility of remote monitoring of VR-based telerehabilitation without adverse effects on patient performance.;2007;1
The hand rehabilitation process needs a continuous and frequent monitoring of the patient's functionality in order to test the delivered therapy and/or adapt it to the patient's progress. In order to contain costs for the rehabilitation program, a tele-homecare rehabilitation system is suitable. We have proposed a tele-home-care allowing the assessment of the hand fingers' dynamics and kinematics by integrating with a dedicated software two particular devices: the first was a commercial glove, the HumanGlove by Humanware (Pisa, Italy) and the second was a set of instruments for the measurement of the hand fingers' force comprehending an Instrumented Keyboard W and an Instrumented Mouse-Like (IML) device. The platform has been successfully tested at Istituto Superiore di Saniti (ISS).;2007;1
The main objective of this study was demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of the Home Care Activity Desk (HCAD) system in a home setting. The study was partly a randomized control trial study in which HCAD is compared to usual care. The patients using the HCAD system show during the month of treatment significant improvements on the individual tasks measured by the execution time. The overall results of the HCAD system concerning clinical effectiveness are positive. The HCAD system for chronic Stroke, TBI and MS patients is shown to be at least as effective as usual care.;2007;1
This paper presents a new hand motion assist robot for rehabilitation therapy. The robot is an exoskeleton with 18 DOFs and a self-motion control, which allows the impaired hand of a patient to be driven by his or her healthy hand on the opposite side. To provide such potential that the impaired hand is able to recover its ability to the level of a functional hand, the hand motion assist robot is designed to support the flexion/extension and abduction/adduction motions of fingers and thumb independently as well as the opposability of the thumb. Moreover, it is designed to support a combination motion of the hand and the wrist. The design specifications and experimental results are shown.;2007;1
This paper presents a pilot study carried out in our Rehabilitation Institute to verify the feasibility of implementation of a telerehabilitation approach based on the use of robotic devices for upper limb treatment. Its application was tested only in the clinical environment. The systems architecture implemented consists of three rehabilitation stations and a supervision workstation, located in different laboratories, and interconnected by means of a standard Ethernet H network. The systems architecture was tested during the rehabilitation of four patients after chronic stroke. The performance charts showed a typical increasing/decreasing trend of the parameters measured by the robot devices, indicating a continuous improvement of the patient's performance throughout treatment similar to that obtained in controlled laboratory conditions. The telerehabilitation approach should thus allow to optimize the therapeutic intervention, despite the fact that the patient does not directly interact with the therapist.;2007;1
This paper presents the implementation of a framework for computer-assisted neurorehabilitation that intends to address the need for more personalized healthcare technologies. This framework called UniTherapy is applied to home neurorehabilitation for individuals with stroke-induced disability. It supports interactive upper limb assessment and therapy that makes use of mass-marketed force-reflecting joysticks and wheels, as well as some customized therapeutic devices. A novel service-oriented technical infrastructure is presented, which includes a rich menu of performance assessment capabilities and support features that include telerehabilitation links, protocol design, and data analysis tools. Results are presented that demonstrate its potential as a sensor-based assessment tool. User feedback is summarized.;2007;1
This study explored the equivalence of physical function assessment by physical therapists (PTs) during face-to-face and remote administration of the European Stroke Scale (ESS) and the Functional Reach Test (FRT) to 26 subjects with a history of stroke. Patients were randomized to remote or face-to-face administration groups. Each patient was simultaneously rated by both the face-to-face and remote PTs. The PTs were blinded to each other's results. Equivalence was set at the 95% limits of agreement. When the face-to-face PT directed the patient, the two PTs reported equivalent values in more than 90% of the patients for the FRT and for all ESS components, with the exception of gait (83%) and maintaining leg position (85%). When the remote PT directed the patient, the two PTs reported equivalent values in more than 90% of the patients for the FRT and more than 83% for all ESS components. Televideo assessment of function by PTs is substantially equivalent to a face-to-face encounter.;2007;1
We examined the equivalence of videoconferencing assessment of communication by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Using a randomized, double-crossover agreement study, 24 post-stroke patients were randomized to a remote or face-to-face administration of a subset of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination and to remote or face-to-face assessment of speech comprehension, speech expression and motor speech. The videoconferencing equipment was operated at a transmission speed of 384 kbit/s. Each patient was simultaneously scored by both the face-to-face and the remote SLPs. SLPs were blind to each other's results. Percentage agreement within the 95% limits of agreement ranged from 92% to 100% for each functional communication measure, regardless of assessment site and administration of the aphasia examination. The results suggest that assessment of a patient's functional communication using videoconferencing is equivalent to a face-to-face encounter.;2007;1
We propose a novel force feedback-based teleoperation system for medical application. Most teleoperation systems are based on the visual feedback from the camera with the occasional use of force feedback. We present the concept and principle of a virtual force feedback in a teleoperation system. The circle tracking experiment was considered using the proposed virtual force feedback. The experimental results showed that the relative tracking error decreased by more than 50% when using the virtual force feedback. We also performed another experiment studying the cutting of a piece of bean curd using the real force feedback. Using real force feedback resulted in a 0.4 N decrease in the contact force of the knife and the object. After further experimentation, the system will be suitable for telesurgical training.;2007;1
We validated an Internet-based telerehabiliatation system designed to assess the oromotor, swallowing and communication outcomes of patients following laryngectomy. Simultaneous online and face-to-face (FTF) assessments were made of 20 patients. The online assessment was conducted using a videoconferencing system developed specifically for telerehabilitation. There was greater than 80% agreement between the online and FTF clinician for all variables relating to oromotor function, swallowing status and communication ability. However, visualization of the stoma was poor. Clinician satisfaction with the functionality of the system was low, although their ratings were high for ease of use and the potential for telerehabilitation as a service delivery method. Patients were 100% satisfied with the usability of the system and the quality of service received. The study suggests that online assessment is a potentially viable service delivery method for evaluating the speech and swallowing status of patients post laryngectomy.;2007;1
Weight bearing is an important clinical variable for rehabilitation specialists. The objectives of this proof of concept study were to design and build a wireless system for weight bearing measurement that would provide accurate dynamic and static measurements of plantar forces from multiple sites. The proposed system consists of two shoes instrumented with miniature load cells connected to ankle modules for wireless communication to a computer and signal conditioning. Force plates were used as the gold standard to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system during quiet standing, walking and weight-shifting tasks in 30 young subjects. The performance of the system was characterized for each task using the following variables: percentage of body weight (PBW), heel-strike (HS) peak force value, stance time (ST), double support time (DST), excursion of center of pressure (COP) in the anteroposterior axis (Delta COPx). For the measurement of the PBW, the standard deviation of errors in comparison to data obtained from forces plates during quiet-standing and weight-shifting activities was between 3.96% and 5.13%. With respect to gait parameters, the standard deviation of errors for the measurement of the peak forces during walking was between 6.10% and 8.82% for both shoes, and errors on timing variables during gait cycles were small (less than 18 msec for one standard deviation). For the Delta COPx during a front weight-shifting trial, the standard deviation of errors was 19.20% for the right foot. The accuracy of the proposed system offers acceptable performances in the context of its proposed clinical applications. The envisioned embodiment and use of the system are instrumented shoes individually calibrated to assess in combination with real time video from videoconferencing codecs weight bearing capabilities in the context of telerehabilitation care. Work on the integration of the system with a clinical system for telerehabilitation is on-going.;2007;1
A portable teleassessment system was designed for remote evaluation of elbow impairments in patients with neurological disorders. A master device and a slave device were used to drive a mannequin arm and the patient's arm, respectively. The elbow flexion angle and torque were measured at both the master and slave devices, and sent to each other for teleoperation. To evaluate spasticity/contracture of the patient's elbow remotely, the clinician asked the patient to relax the elbow, moved the mannequin arm at a selected velocity, and haptically felt the resistance from the patient's elbow. In other tasks, the patient moved his/her elbow voluntarily and the clinician observed the corresponding mannequin arm movement and determined the active range of motion (ROM). The clinician could also remotely resist the patient's movement and evaluate the muscle strength. To minimize the effect of network latency, two different teleoperation schemes were used depending on the speed of the tasks. For slow movement tasks, real-time teleoperations were performed using control architectures that considered causality of the tasks, with performance similar to that during an in-person examination. For tasks involving fast movements, a teach-and-replay teleoperation scheme was used which provided the examiner with transparent and stable haptic feeling. Overall, the teleassessment system allowed the clinician to remotely evaluate the impaired elbow of stroke survivors, including assessment of the passive ROM, active ROM, muscle strength, velocity-dependent spasticity, and catch angle.;2008;1
"A randomized clinical trial was undertaken to examine the effect of a multi-factorial, individualized, physical/occupational therapy intervention on mobility self-efficacy delivered via teletechnology and traditional in-home visits. Sixty-five community-dwelling adults with new mobility devices were randomized to either the control or usual care group (n=33); or the intervention group (n=32). The intervention included four, one-hour PT/OT sessions, one time per week targeting 3 mobility and 3 transfer tasks. The intervention group (Tele and Trad) had a statistically significant increase in overall self-efficacy over the study period compared to the controls (UCG). Moreover, comparisons of the two treatment delivery methods showed a medium standardized effect size (SES) in both the Tele and Trad Groups compared to UCG, suggesting that a multi factorial, individualized, home-based MOT intervention delivered either by teleconference or by traditional in-home therapy can improve self-efficacy in mobility-impaired adults.";2008;1
A secure telemonitoring system was developed to transform CosmoBot system, a stand-alone speech-language therapy software, into a telerehabilitation system. The CosmoBot system is a motivating, computer-based play character designed to enhance children's communication skills and stimulate verbal interaction during the remediation of speech and language disorders. The CosmoBot system consists of the Mission Control human interface device and Cosmo's Play and Learn software featuring a robot character named Cosmo that targets educational goals for children aged 3-5 years. The secure telemonitoring infrastructure links a distant speech-language therapist and child/parents at home or school settings. The result is a telerehabilitation system that allows a speech-language therapist to monitor children's activities at home while providing feedback and therapy materials remotely. We have developed the means for telerehabilitation of communication skills that can be implemented in children's home settings. The architecture allows the therapist to remotely monitor the children after completion of the therapy session and to provide feedback for the following session.;2008;1
"A technical assessment activity has been conducted by Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS) in the European project HELLODOC (Healthcare service linking tele-rehabilitation to disabled people and clinicians) for evaluating the tele-rehabilitation service. The activity was mainly focussed on architectural aspects and a step by step monitoring of the service. It was mainly related to the following aspects: service implementation, service performances, service integration and fault management. The technical assessment analysis demonstrated that the service worked in a quite satisfactory way, also considering the pioneering aspect of the project; the set of malfunctioning occurred, which had a low impact on the service continuity, are typical of a post-debug phase.";2008;1
Aphasia, a language disturbance, frequently occurs following acquired brain impairment in adults. Because management of aphasia is often long-term, provision of ongoing and equitable access to treatment creates a significant challenge to speech-language pathologists (SLPs). This study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of assessing aphasia using standardized language assessments via an Internet-based videoconferencing system using a bandwidth of 128 kbits/sec. Thirty-two participants with aphasia due to stroke or traumatic brain injury were assessed simultaneously in either a face-to-face or online-led environment by two SLPs. Short forms of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE-3) and the Boston Naming Test (BNT, 2nd edition) were administered. An eight-item participant satisfaction questionnaire was completed by 15 participants assigned to the online-led assessment. Results failed to identify any significant differences between the 24 subtest scores of the BDAE-3 and the BNT scores obtained in the online and face-to-face test environments (p > 0.01). Weighted kappa statistics indicated moderate to very good agreement (0.59-1.00) between the two assessors for the 24 subtests and eight rating scales of the BDAE-3, the BNT, and for aphasia diagnosis. Good to very good inter- and intra-rater reliability for the online assessment was found across the majority of assessment tasks. Participants reported high overall satisfaction, comfort level, and audio and visual quality in the online environment. This study supports the validity and reliability of delivering standardized assessments of aphasia online and provides a basis for ongoing development of telerehabilitation as an alternate mode of service delivery to persons with aphasia.;2008;1
Cognitive disorders are a common long-term consequence of many forms of acquired neurological damage of different aetiology. The already high prevalence of diseases causing cognitive deficits (in particular stroke) is expected to increase in the near future, leading to a greater need for cognitive rehabilitation. The impact of cognitive impairment on daily functioning may be even greater than that of physical limitations in affected patients, contributing to the high cost of brain disorders. New technologies, including telerehabilitation, may provide an effective response to this challenge, allowing increased access to rehabilitation services as well as reduced care costs for individuals needing cognitive rehabilitation.;2008;1
Communication disorders in adults and children can have a significant effect on their quality of life and on that of their families. Speech-language pathologists face several challenges in providing assessment and treatment services to such people. Challenges include facilitating equitable access to services and providing appropriate management within a changing social and economic context. Telerehabilitation has the potential to deliver services in the home or local community via videoconferencing and through interactive computer-based therapy activities. This form of service delivery has the capacity to optimize functional outcomes by facilitating generalization of treatment effects within the person's everyday environment, and enable monitoring of communication and swallowing behaviours on a long-term basis. A number of image-based telerehabilitation applications have been used in the management of adult neurogenic speech and language disorders, stuttering, voice disorders, speech and language disorders in children, laryngectomy and swallowing dysfunction. Further development of such applications and other computer-based therapies, cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses, and professional education are needed if telerehabilitation is to become an integral part of speech-language pathology practice.;2008;1
During stroke rehabilitation at home, the most used equipment is the Codivilla spring for both bilateral and one-side stroke damage. A novel Codivilla spring prosthesis has been electronically sensorized in order to allow new functionalities pertinent to telerehabilitation, such as the step counting and biofeedback mapping of gait-phases. The principal elements of the electronics are a couple of force-sensing resistors affixed in the plantar area of the prosthesis, and a wearable unit with a microprocessor-based on Microchip technology (Microchip Technology, Inc., Chandler, AZ) for data processing and a telemetric system based on Aurel technology (Aurel, Modigliana, Italy) for data tansfer. While ambulating, the foot-sensing resistors detect the pressure of the foot-tip and heel. The microprocessor provides step-counting on the basis of an algorithm. The microprocessor also drives two vibrotactile actuators (one at the foot-tip and the other at the heel). These actuators are fixed at the level of the belt directly in contact with the skin and give biofeedback mapping of the gait-phases to the patient wearing the prosthesis, who can then walk without looking at his or her feet. The sensorized prosthesis was tested on six subjects undergoing stroke rehabilitation at level 2 of the Tinetti test. These subjects performed five repetitions of 100 steps with three different instructions (fast, slow, and normal). The mean error was lower than 0.6%. A test conducted by means of Cosmed devices (Cosmed USA, Chicago, IL) also showed that the biofeedback function provided by means of the actuators diminished the energy expenditure by 0.7% in mean value. The next phase will be the optimization of the equipment for long-term medical application in a patient's home.;2008;1
During the last decade we assisted to relevant progress in rehabilitation studies and in technological development. From the combination of these issues rises the tele-rehabilitation - a subfield of telemedicine consisting of a system to control rehabilitation at distance - as an actual possibility of application and a promising development in the future. The present paper offers a short review of the state of the art in the field of tele-rehabilitation, with a special focus on upper limb tele-rehabilitation. The experience is also briefly reported of the preliminary application of the H-CAD (home care activity desk) system and the HELLODOC (Healthcare service linking tele-rehabilitation to disabled people and clinicians) tele-rehabilitation service, conducted by the authors within two European projects in the period 2003-2005 and 2005-2007 respectively.;2008;1
"Hand rehabilitation requires continuous and frequent monitoring of the functionality in order to assess therapy and/or refine it. In order to contain costs for the rehabilitation program, a telehomecare rehabilitation system is suitable. The purpose of this paper was to describe the setup and configuration of a homecare device for telemonitoring/telerehabilitation of patients who underwent hand transplant. The telehomecare device allows the assessment of dynamics and kinematics of hand function by integrating dedicated software in two components. The first was a commercial glove, the HumanGlove by Humanware (Pisa, Italy). The second was a set of instruments for the measurement of digit force using an Instrumented Keyboard and an Instrumented Mouse-Like device. The software integrating the devices is composed of two modular components. The first is to drive the devices; the second is for the data-analysis and display. The methodology was validated at the Istituto Superiore di Sanita (the Italian National Institute of Health) in the framework of an Italian National Project, funded by the Ministry of Health.";2008;1
In this paper we present a telerehabilitation system aiming to help physiotherapists on the shoulder and elbow treatment. Our system is based on a two-arm haptic force feedback to avoid excessive efforts and discomfort with the spinal column and is remotely controlled by smart phone. The validation of our system, with the help of muscular effort measurements (EMG) and supervised by a physiotherapist, provides very promising results.;2008;1
"In this paper, we introduce an interactive telecommunication system that supports video/audio signal acquisition, data processing, transmission, and 3D animation for post stroke rehabilitation. It is designed for stroke patients to use in their homes. It records motion exercise data, and immediately transfers this data to hospitals via the internet. A real-time videoconferencing interface is adopted for patients to observe therapy instructions from therapists. The system uses a peer-to-peer network architecture, without the need for a server. This is a potentially effective approach to reducing costs, allowing easy setup and permitting group-rehabilitation sessions. We evaluate this system using the following steps: (1) motion detection in different movement patterns, such as reach, drink, and reach-flexion; (2) online bidirectional visual telecommunication; and (3) 3D rendering using a proposed offline animation package. This evaluation has subjectively been proved to be optimal.";2008;1
In this paper, we present a novel sensing and data fusion system to track 3-D arm motion in a telerehabilitation program. A particle filter (PF) algorithm is adopted in the system to fuse data from inertial and visual sensors in a probabilistic manner. It is able to propagate multimodal distributions of system states based on an importance sampling technique by using sets of weighted particles. To avoid the problem of conventional PF algorithms that suffer from particle degeneracy and perform poorly in a narrow distribution situation, we adopt two strategies in our system, namely state space pruning and an arm physical geometry constraint. Experimental results show that the proposed PF framework outperforms other fusion methods and provides accurate results in comparison to the ground truth.;2008;1
Nowadays, stroke is one of the most frequent causes of severe adult disability in the world. Virtual reality and haptic technologies have emerged as promising assistive tools for effective diagnosis and rehabilitation intervention. The objective of this paper is to develop and test a set of five virtual exercises on top of a framework, which is designed for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of patients with hand impairments. We have implemented task-oriented exercises based on well-established and common exercises, namely the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and the Box and Block Test. These include moving a cup, arranging blocks, navigating a maze, training with a dumbbell, and grasping a rubber ball. Furthermore, key performance measures (metrics) are proposed for each exercise to quantitatively evaluate and judge the performance of stroke patients. Our evaluation of these exercises shows promising potential to define golden reference metrics for healthy subjects, against which the performance of a patient is compared. This will facilitate the ability of occupational therapists to assess the patient's progress.;2008;1
"Objective: To compare the 6-month outcomes of telerehabilitation intervention with those of standard care for spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Multicenter randomized controlled trial. Setting: Home, nursing, or unspecialized hospital care provided after discharge from 1 spinal cord unit. Participants: Adult patients with nonproggressive, complete, or incomplete SCI discharged for the first time from the spinal cord unit to their homes (Belgium and Italy) or to their homes or another facility (England). Interventions: All patients received the standard care they would have normally received after discharge from the spinal cord unit. In addition, patients in the telemedicine group received 8 telemedicine weekly sessions in the first 2 months, followed by biweekly telemedicine sessions for 4 months. Main Outcome Measures: Functional status at 6 months, clinical complications during the postdischarge period, and patient satisfaction. Results: No significant differences in the occurrence of clinical complications were found between the study groups. A higher improvement Of functional scores in the telemedicine group was found only at the Italian site: FIM total score 3.38 +/- 4.43 (controls) versus 7.69 +/- 6.88 (telemedicine group), FIM motor score 3.24 +/- 4.38 (controls) versus 7.55 +/- 7.00 (telemedicine group; P <.05). Items contributing to this difference were grooming. dressing upper body, dressing lower body, and bed/chair/wheelchair transfer. Higher satisfaction with care was reported by patients in the telemedicine group across all sites. Conclusions: Our Study provides some of the first quantitative evidence, based on results from I site, that telerehabilitation may offer benefits to patients discharged from a spinal cord unit compared with standard care in terms of functional improvement. Further research is warranted to confirm or disprove this finding.";2008;1
Objective: To determine the value of the Remote Accessibility Assessment System (RAAS), a 3-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction technology designed to analyze accessibility of the target built environment in a virtualized reality, in assessing a built environment's accessibility by calculating the congruence level between the RAAS and conventional in-person method. Design: Repeated-measures (within-subject) design. Setting: A university research laboratory. Participants: Three homes for people who use wheeled mobility devices. Intervention: Home physical environment was divided into several potential problem areas such as entrance, hallway, bathroom, and living room. Each area was identified by several tasks that might be performed in it. All possible tasks in each area within each home were evaluated using 2 methods: RAAS and the conventional in-person assessment. The evaluations were performed by a different home modification specialist for each method. Main Outcome Measures: Conventional in-person assessments Were cross-tabulated with assessments from RAAS, with which there are 4 possible assessment combinations. A true positive (checked-checked) occurs when the RAAS method checks the target task as problematic and it is also checked as problematic by the conventional in-person method. True negative (not checked-not checked), false positive (not checked-checked), and false negative (checked-not checked) were also identified as the same way. Results: The proportion of overall agreement was high at 94.1% and the overall sensitivity and specificity was 95.6% and 90.3%. respectively. A significant K coefficient of 857 and the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio of 104.062 to 404.921 were calculated and a high level of overall agreement rate was shown. A high P value (.868) of the McNemar test implied that there was no marginal homogeneity, that is, no tendency to identify the task incorrectly in the positive or negative direction. Conclusions: This system proved that virtualized reality and 3D reconstruction technology may provide an effective means to investigate the architectural features of a built environment without an expert visiting the site. This system could become an efficient tool for the service provider and can provide expert service to underserved clients that would otherwise be unavailable.;2008;1
Occupational therapy is an important component of neurological rehabilitation. Clients in rural areas have fewer opportunities to receive rehabilitation than those in metropolitan areas. Telehealth is a potential method of closing these gaps in service delivery, although research into telehealth applications for neurological rehabilitation is extremely limited. To assist in the development of appropriate telehealth applications, this study aimed to identify the nature of occupational therapy services for neurological rehabilitation in areas of Queensland other than the capital city of Brisbane, the barriers to service delivery, and the current uses of various information and communication technologies among occupational therapists. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to occupational therapists working in adult neurological rehabilitation in all areas of Queensland other than the capital city of Brisbane. Contact details were obtained from OT AUSTRALIA Queensland. Responses were received from 39 eligible participants. The client's home was the most frequent setting in which participants saw clients. Home visits and modifications, equipment prescription, client/family education, and activities of daily living assessment and retraining were the most common interventions provided by participants. Frequently identified barriers to service provision included travelling distance to clients, large workloads and limited resources. Telephone, email, fax, the Internet and videoconferencing were available in most workplaces. Few participants used the Internet or videoconferencing for purposes other than continuing professional development. Home-based assessment and intervention appear to be frequent components of occupational therapy practice among therapists working in neurological rehabilitation. The use of telehealth to provide direct home-based client services is currently limited, but should be explored as a possible solution to overcome some of the identified barriers to occupational therapy service provision for clients with neurological conditions in rural and remote areas.;2008;1
Primary objective: The goal of the current study was to assess the feasibility of an Internet-based cognitive rehabilitation program for individuals with acquired brain injuries and memory impairment. Methods: Participants were 10 individuals with a history of an acquired brain injury and documented memory impairment. All participants received training in how to use a secure IM system. They were then scheduled to log into the system weekly to participate in online cognitive rehabilitation therapy sessions over the Internet. Treatment focused on training to use a calendar system aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency in home and work tasks. Participants underwent assessment of cognitive function, psychological status, level of functioning and use of compensation techniques both pre- and post-treatment. Results: All participants were able to learn to use the IM system. Only two of the 10 participants missed any planned sessions, despite severe memory impairments. Conclusions: Individuals with a history of an acquired brain injury with concomitant memory impairment appear to be able to learn how to successfully use an Internet-based cognitive rehabilitation program. Future research will assess whether participation in this Internet based cognitive rehabilitation program results in improved daily functioning.;2008;1
Remote therapy, involved in a tele-rehabilitation program, should monitor daily motion activity. Furthermore, patients should have all possible means to improve rehabilitation care at their disposal, such as suitable prostheses and biofeedback tools. During stroke rehabilitation at home, the most used equipment is the AFO prosthesis, which is also called codivilla-spring, as it is used in cases of both bilateral and mono-lateral damage. A new codivilla-spring prosthesis with sensors for telemonitoring / telerehabilitation has been designed and constructed. It provides step counting. It is based on a couple of force sensing resistors affixed in the plantar area of the prosthesis, and a wearable unit with a micro-processor mu P PIC 1617877 (Microchip, USA). The data exchange is assured by the Aurel-XTR-434H telemetric system. While ambulating, FSRs detect the pressure of the foot-tip and heel. The PIC on the basis of an algorithm furnishes the step-counting. The proposed sensorized-codivilla-spring (SECOSP) was tested as a step-counter on three subjects after stroke-rehabilitation with mono-lateral damage at Level 2 of the Tinetti test of unbalance. These subjects performed 100 steps with two different instructions (fast, slow). The mean error was lower than 0.6 %. The next phase will be the optimization of SECOSP for long term medical application in a patient's home.;2008;1
Step counting is an important index of motion in telemonitoring. One of the most diffused wearable systems, designed for this purpose, is the pedometer. The accuracy of commercial pedometers has been reported in the literature. Several limits have been found in many commercial systems both in healthy subjects and in people with disabilities. Furthermore, commercial pedometers lack interoperability. This paper introduces a new wearable system for step counting for telemonitoring applications. This system is based on a wearable device with a force-sensing resistor. It is affixed on the gastrocnemius muscle for monitoring muscular expansion correlated with the gait. The data exchange is assured by the XTR-434H (Aurel, FC, Italy) telemetric system. The proposed gastrocnemius expansion measurement unit (GEMU) was tested on 5 subjects with Parkinson's disease at Level 3 of the Tinetti test of unbalance. Ten repetitions of 500 steps with three different speeds (fast, slow, and normal) were performed. The mean error was < 0.5%. Results also showed that GEMU performed better than an accelerometer unit (considered in the literature the best solution for this disability). The study showed that GEMU had a high performance in subjects with Parkinson's disease, causing a high degree of unbalance that confounded motion style. The next phase will be the optimization of GEMU for long-term medical applications at the patient's home.;2008;1
"Stroke and traumatic brain injury affect an increasing number of people, many of whom retain permanent damage in cognitive functions. Conventionally, cognitive function has been assessed by a paper-based neuropsychological evaluation. However these test environments differ substantially from everyday life. This problem can be overcome by using virtual reality (VR) to objectively evaluate behaviors and cognitive function in simulated daily activities. With our virtual shopping simulation, we compared people who had undergone a stroke with control participants in an immersive VR program that used a head-mounted display (HMD). We evaluated user satisfaction with the tests, complications, and the user interface. Significant differences were consistently found between the stroke group and the control group for the following tasks: stage 1 performance index, interaction error; stage 2 delayed recognition memory score, attention index; and stage 3 executive index (p < 0.001). Perceptive dysfunction, visuospatial dysfunction, level of computer experience, and level of education affected the performance of the stroke group. The frequency of complications in the stroke group, calculated using the cut-off score for the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, was 9.6% for nausea, 41.9% for oculomotor complications, and 25.8% for disorientation. The frequency of complications between the stroke and control groups was not significantly different. Thirtyfive percent of participants in the stroke group and 13% in the control group reported difficulties with using the joystick. This computer-generated VR-based cognitive test shows promise in assessing cognitive function in patients with stroke. More refinements are needed in the user interface and the projection methods.";2008;1
Telemedicine services must be designed and implemented with the users in mind. When conducting telerehabilitation, factors such as age, education and technology experience must be taken into account. In addition, telerehabilitation must also accommodate a range of potential patient impairments, including deficits in language, cognition, motor function, vision and voice. Telerehabilitation technology and treatment environments should adhere to universal design standards so as to be accessible, efficient, usable and understandable to all. This will result in improved access to a wider range of telerehabilitation services that will facilitate and enhance the rehabilitative treatment and recovery of people living with varying levels of injury, impairment and disability.;2008;1
Teleoperated from a distant location, a mobile robot with some autonomous capabilities can become a beneficial tool in telerehabilitation applications. Safety being of prime concern in such settings, we took special care in coming up with the proper teleoperation interfaces that can provide pertinent information about the system states and conditions (objects, persons, free space, data, etc.) in conjunction with an efficient control system. In order to enhancement operator's performances we tested our new robot with three modalities of visual information presentation in the teleoperation interfaces, with the use of virtual reality for operator interfaces, in a setup reproducing home like environment.;2008;1
Telerehabilitation in which rehabilitation services are provided at a distance using communication technologies is a new and developing field of telehealth. Primarily developed to provide equitable access to individuals who are geographically remote and to those who are physically and economically disadvantaged, telerehabilitation also has the capacity to improve the quality of rehabilitation health care. Online delivery of rehabilitation enables the rehabilitation therapist to optimize the timing, intensity and duration of therapy that is often not possible within the constraints of face-to-face treatment protocols in current health systems. This chapter outlines the advances made to date in telerehabilitation applications in the fields of physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and biomedical engineering and provides evidence for the success of these applications. Applications to date encompass systems ranging from low-bandwidth low-cost videophones, to highly expensive, fully immersive virtual reality systems with haptic interfaces. A number of barriers to the establishment and advancement of telerehabilitation within health care systems have been outlined and include professional issues relating to the inherent hands-on approach of some treatments, licensure laws, professional skill development, patient disability, reimbursement, and the paucity of online assessment and treatment tools and outcomes data. In response, possible solutions to these barriers such as the development and validation of alternative assessment and treatment procedures, involvement in the international policy debate, as well as the resolution of national professional policies which hinder the wider uptake of telerehabilitation technologies, have been outlined. The future of telerehabilitation is promising as a new, yet complex form of telehealth with the capacity to provide a wide range of services specifically designed to suit the needs of the individual.;2008;1
The ability to measure activities of daily living (ADL) and hand function for people with Parkinson's disease via an Internet-based telerehabilitation system would have a significant impact on the equity, accessibility, and management of the condition for patients who live in rural and remote communities. A low-bandwidth computer-based telerehabilitation system, which incorporates videoconferencing with calibrated assessment tools, has been recently developed at the University of Queensland. This study aimed to determine the validity, intra-and inter-rater reliability of the telerehabilitation system in measuring ADL and hand function in 12 people with Parkinson's disease. ADL status was assessed using the motor component of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and selected items from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The Nine Hole Peg Test, Jamar dynamometer and Preston pinch gauge were also used to assess hand function. For half of the participants, an assessor administered assessments in the traditional face-to-face manner while another assessor simultaneously scored the same assessments via the telerehabilitation system. For the remaining participants, the telerehabilitation assessor administered the assessments via the telerehabilitation system while a face-to-face assessor simultaneously scored the assessments. The telerehabilitation system was found to be a valid measure of ADL status and hand function in people with Parkinson's disease and to have a high level of intra- and inter-rater reliability (all ICCs > 0.80). These results suggest that therapists can confidently use a low-bandwidth telerehabilitation system to assess ADL status and hand function in people with Parkinson's disease.;2008;1
The authors compared outcomes of 19 participants who received computer-based cognitive teletherapy rehabilitation with 20 participants who received face-to-face speech-language rehabilitation. The study compared outcomes from 2 real-word treatment programs provided by an outpatient rehabilitation center. A total of 39 participants with moderate to severe closed head traumatic brain injuries and a minimum of I year following injury were analyzed. Outcome measures included clinical indicators of independent living status, return to work or school, and independent driving. Cost measures included the total cost of the treatment and a measure of service costs per hour. Time since injury was a covariate, and an analysis of covariance revealed no differences between groups in independent living, driving status, return to work or school, or total treatment costs. The computer-based teletherapy cognitive rehabilitation program provided similar functional outcomes as face-to-face speech-language therapy at a similar total cost.;2008;1
"The goal of this study was to describe the movement pattern of the body-segment rotations of healthy subjects in the horizontal plane while they were standing on a supporting platform that imposed steady sinusoidal horizontal rotations under three visual conditions: (a) eyes closed with no instructions (EC-NI), (b) eyes open with instructions to gaze at a stationary black dot located at eye level on a wall surface about four meters in front of them (EO-WI), and (c) eyes closed with instructions to imagine looking at the same target (EC-WI). The selected input signal was a sinusoid with an amplitude of +/- 45 deg at different frequencies equal to 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 Hz, which were referred to as L, M and H. Bipedal balance measurements were taken in 10 adult subjects (mean age 30 +/- 9 years; three men and seven women). Subjects' kinematics were analyzed with an optoelectronic system. Under the three visual conditions, the movements of the pelvis, the trunk, and the head decreased and were inversely dependent on platform frequency; specifically, both the head and the trunk decreased their gain rotation of about 1.8-2.9 times from L to H, while the pelvis decreased its by about 1.3 times. However, the arm oscillations showed a gain and phase tendency opposite to that of the other body segments, with the gain rotation having increased of about 1.8-3.7 times from L to H. Comparing the three visual conditions, the finding suggests that the subjects were able to stabilize their head as a reference frame to maintain postural balance in a similar way under the EC-WI and EO-WI conditions. Instead, in the EC-NI trials, the subjects compensated less, in particular at the hip, the external perturbation producing higher absolute body rotations and lower relative body rotations. In fact, the head rotation was about four and three times the one showed in EC-WI and EO-WI, while for the trunk and the pelvis it was always equal to two and 1.5 times the correspondent rotation observed under the WI conditions. These results provide a quantitative assessment of compensatory balance reactions in healthy subjects to periodical horizontal perturbations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.";2008;1
The Low Activities of Daily Living Monitoring Program (LAMP) at the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System is a telerehabilitation program that promotes independence for veterans experiencing difficulties with activities of daily living by focusing on a combination of care coordination, assistive technology/adaptive equipment, and home environmental modifications. Initially designed to serve elders at risk of institutionalization, LAMP now is being adapted to the needs of veterans living with the effects of multisystem polytrauma. This article provides an overview of telehealth, explains the LAMP model, and presents a case history of a veteran who sustained complete tetraplegia and traumatic transfemoral amputation as the result of a blast injury and who lives successfully at home with the support of LAMP A recent cost analysis of LAMP patients compared to a matched cohort receiving standard care also is presented. The LAMP model shows promise as a method for home-based management of combat-wounded veterans who experience multisystem polytrauma.;2008;1
The objective of this work was to provide computer and telecommunications skill training for paraplegics using a telemedicine training center in a curriculum that would support connectivity and offer new skills for career applications in the rehabilitation phase and beyond. This was a hospital- based, cross- sectional study. The study was conducted from October 10, 2005 to May 10, 2006 in the hospitals of Rawalpindi Medical College and the Melody Rehabilitation Center, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. These centers provided care for casualties of the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan. One hundred and ninety four ( 194) paraplegics were admitted to Rawalpindi Medical College allied hospitals after injuries in the rural mountains near the epicenter. Surveys assessed the education level of the patients, and a sample of 12 patients was enrolled in computer training classes. Of the 194 patients, 144 were female and 50 were male. The majority, 78% ( 151) were 16 - 39 years of age. Although only 60% were literate, the overall literacy rate of Pakistan is just 48.7%. Telephone service at home was available after discharge for 40% of patients. Only 8% of patients had basic computer skills. All patients participated in the survey and sought to take the course. All the enrolled patients demonstrated full competency in the skills taught. The social disruption of disaster plus the new challenge of a neurological deficit in paraplegia did not deter a remarkable number of patients from a rural area from engaging in computer and telemedicine training. This study demonstrated the feasibility of educating rural paraplegics in computer skills for telemedicine. The telemedicine training center was used for this task without special equipment or personnel, thereby increasing the utilization of the facility.;2008;1
"The purpose of this paper is to explain the development, methodology, and implementation of an assistive technology (AT) service delivery protocol using a telerehabilitation consultation model for evaluation of remote wheelchair prescriptions. The provision of wheeled mobility and seating interventions can be complex when considering people with intricate seating and positioning needs, environmental factors, and wide array of product interventions. The availability of qualified practitioners with specialty expertise in this area is limited, especially outside of urban areas. Therefore, people are potentially isolated from rehabilitation services due to geography or physical limitations. A repeated measure study design is used to evaluate the service delivery protocol measured by the effectiveness of wheeled mobility and seating interventions provided in a remote location by a generalist occupational and/or physical therapy practitioner with consultation from an expert therapist via interactive teleconferencing. Effectiveness is measured by magnitude of change and scored by pre and post scores of the Functioning Everyday with a Wheelchair (FEW) outcome measure tool. Two model programs have been specified and are currently implementing the service delivery protocol. The live interaction has enabled remote therapists the ability to exchange personal and health information to experts in the field from an urban facility. The impact of this service delivery protocol will be augmented as it is to be launched and replicated in three additional sites. Telerehabilitation is a new field that can only be measured by its long-term impact; however, its success can be looked at by its development and implementation into everyday clinical service delivery.";2008;1
This paper explains a 6-DOF gait rehabilitation robot, which may allow a patient to navigate in virtual reality (VR) by upper and lower limbs interactions. The suggested robot is composed of an upper limb device, a sliding device, two footpad devices, and a partial body support system. The footpad device on the sliding device will generate 3-DOF spatial motions on sagittal plane for each foot. The upper limb device will allow arm of a user to swing naturally with a simple pendulum link with a passive prismatic joint. It is possible to use this robot inside normal home for the purpose of telerehabilitation since its size is compact and its power consumption is small. Synchronized gait patterns for this robot are designed to represent natural gait with the upper and lower limbs connections. In gait rehabilitation robots, one of the important concerns is not only to follow the robot motions passively, but also to allow the patient to walk by his/her intention. Thus, this robot allows automatic walking velocity update by estimating interaction torques between the human and the upper limb device, and synchronizing the upper limb device to the lower limb device. In addition, the upper limb device acts as user-friendly input device for navigating in virtual reality. By pushing the switches located at the right and left handles of the upper limb device, a patient is able to do turning motions during navigation in virtual reality. Through experimental results of a healthy subject, we showed that rehabilitation training can be more effectively combined to virtual environments with upper and lower limb connections, which will allow various rehabilitation training modes.;2008;1
This study assessed feasibility and patient acceptance and estimated the magnitude of the clinical impact of physical telerehabilitation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We recruited 12 consecutive patients with a known diagnosis of MS. Each patient received a custom-tailored rehabilitative exercise program prescribed by a physical therapist during a clinic visit. The patients were guided by the home telecare units in following their individualized exercise plan. After the patients used the physical telerehabilitation system for 12 weeks, a statistically significant improvement was shown in a timed 25-foot walk (from 13.8 +/- 8.3 s to 11.3 +/- 5.4 s), 6-minute walk (from 683.3 +/- 463.8 ft to 806.5 +/- 415.0 ft), and Berg Balance Scale score (from 38.8 +/- 11.1 to 43.1 +/- 9.9) as compared with the baseline. (Values are shown as mean +/- standard deviation.) Patients were highly satisfied with the service. Home-based physical telerehabilitation can improve functional outcomes significantly in patients with MS.;2008;1
To examine the use of video teleconferencing (VTC) technology in the supervision of a 41-year-old man with expressive aphasia during community reintegration in a host home setting 3 years after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: U sing a 3-month A-B-A design, weekly VTC meetings were substituted for in-person visits by the client's case coordinator. Main outcome measures: Weekly ratings of satisfaction with the medium of communication used (VTC vs in-person meetings) by each participant. Results: The client and the case coordinator found VTC meetings to be as effective as face-to-face supervision visits for communication of clinical concerns and problems. The client reported feeling self-conscious about having the equipment in his living space because of privacy concerns. The mentor reported that VTC helped focus on questions and answers in goal-oriented conversations, was easier to schedule, and had the advantage of not requiring preparation of the house for in-person meetings. Reported disadvantages included feelings of camera shyness as well as impatience due to slow video transmission speed at times. The case coordinator also found VTC meetings easier to schedule and reported savings in travel time and expense. Reported disadvantages included reduced transmission quality and speed on some occasions. The cost break-even point for VTC was reached at I year with substitution of VTC sessions for half of weekly case coordinator home visits and 2 home visits per year by the coordinator's supervisor. Conclusion: VTC might be liberally substituted for in-person supervision visits in the context of an ongoing clinical relationship during Community reintegration following TBI.;2008;1
We are developing a low-cost robotic system, the Jerusalem Telerehabilitation System, using a force-feedback joystick and a standard broadband internet connection. In this study, the system was found to be user-friendly by therapists, older and younger normal subjects, and a post-stroke subject. Kinematic analysis of the joystick movements showed differences between the older and younger normal subjects and between the post-stroke subject and older normal subjects. Preliminary data indicate that our low-cost and straightforward system has the potential to provide useful kinematic information to the therapist in the clinic, thereby improving patient care.;2008;1
We conducted a pilot telerehabilitation study with post-stroke patients with arm motor impairment. We compared the degree of satisfaction of patients undergoing a virtual reality (VR) therapy programme at home (Tele-VR group) to satisfaction experienced by those undergoing the same VR therapy in a hospital setting (VR-group). The rehabilitation equipment used a 3D motion tracking system to create a virtual environment in which the patient's movement was represented. In tele-therapy, the patient equipment was installed in their homes, connected to the hospital by four ISDN lines at a total bandwidth of 512 kbit/s. Rehabilitation data were transmitted via one line and videoconferencing via the other three. Ten patients with mild to intermediate arm motor impairment due to an ischaemic stroke, were randomized into VR or Tele-VR groups. A questionnaire was used at the end of treatment to measure each patient's degree of satisfaction. Tele-VR treated patients showed median values equal to or higher than the VIR group patients in all 12 items investigated, except one. In motor performance, the Tele-VR group improved significantly (P <= 0.05), while the VR group showed no significant change. Patients assigned to the Tele-VR group were able to engage in therapy at home and the videoconferencing system ensured a good relationship between the patient and the physical therapist whose physical proximity was not required.;2008;1
"We conducted a randomized controlled multicentre trial to investigate the feasibility of a telerehabilitation intervention for arm/hand function (the Home Care Activity Desk [HCAD] training) in a home setting. Usual care was compared to HCAD training. The hypothesis was that the clinical outcomes of the HCAD intervention would be at least the same as those measured after a period of usual care for patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and multiple sclerosis (MS) with respect to their arm/hand function. Eighty-one patients with affected arm/hand function resulting from either stroke, MS or TBI were recruited in Italy, Spain and Belgium; 11 were lost during follow-up (14%). The outcome measures were the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT). There were no significant differences between the two groups on the outcome measures (ARAT and NHPT); in both groups, patients maintained or even improved their arm/hand function. The HCAD training was found to be as feasible as usual care in terms of clinical outcomes, and both therapists and patients were satisfied with the HCAD intervention. A telerehabilitation intervention using HCAD may increase the efficiency of care.";2008;1
We describe the use of telehealth technology in the rehabilitation of a college student with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The present telerehabilitation application was necessitated by the absence of a formal university-based pulmonary rehabilitation program at Texas State University - San Marcos. Patient referral, evaluation, and rehabilitation were accomplished via interdisciplinary efforts of 3 separate university entities. Initial referral was obtained from the student health center, with pulmonary evaluation provided by the respiratory care department. Commercially available telerebabilitation equipment was then utilized to resolve exercise supervision and physiologic data-acquisition concerns. Forty-five individualized exercise sessions were administered by physical therapists via telerehabilitation distance voice and vision technology. Results reveal no substantive changes in pulmonary function test results, but there was improvement in functional aerobic capacity. Given the reduced life expectancy associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, investigators were afforded a unique opportunity to study an adult patient with this condition. Further, it appears the combined application of telerebabilitation technology and interdisciplinary cooperation among university departments is efficacious in the identification, evaluation, and rehabilitation of students with selected pulmonary disorders.;2008;1
"We evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of conducting occupational therapy home visits using the Internet. Studies were conducted at the homes of 40 patients who were scheduled to undergo a total hip or knee replacement: home visits were conducted, on the same day, by both a face-to-face therapist and an online therapist. The online therapist conducted the visit via a low-speed, dial-up Internet connection using a specially developed telerehabilitation system. This system combines real-time videoconferencing (320 x 240 pixel resolution) with a suite of calibrated assessment tools which the operator can use to measure real-scale angular displacement/velocity and linear distances during the videoconference. Both therapists completed a home environment questionnaire, assessed patients' transfer ability and measured the heights of six objects/pieces of furniture. For the questionnaire items which related to variables in the home environment, the mean percentage exact agreement was 98.9% (SD 2.6; range 90-100), while there was 100% agreement on the items related to transfers. The mean absolute difference in measured heights between the two therapists ranged from 0.1 -3.3 cm. The results suggest that conducting pre-admission orthopaedic occupational therapy home visits via the Internet is both feasible and accurate.";2008;1
"We have designed and constructed force measurement equipment to assess hand-finger function in pressing tasks. The equipment was used for monitoring the follow-up of five hand-transplanted subjects. Interactive software was integrated into the instrument to monitor the functionality of the hand and fingers during exercises in realtime. The interactive software included biofeedback to provide realtime quantitative responses for the patient and the therapist. Acceptance of the system was investigated with patients and therapists: the system was found to be user-friendly and effective; it was practical both for patients and therapists. The system could be used in a telerehabilitation centre or in a patient's home.";2008;1
We present an application based on X3D technologies for the telerehabilitation of patients affected by neurological diseases. In particular the virtual world is designed to integrate the activity made on NU!Reha Desk product with the activities performed on the virtual world. The main target of our system are patients with heavy neurological disease (people not able to move a forced in static positions because of therapies, etc). The system is designed to allow the remote monitoring and assessment of the patient's activities by the staff at the hospital.;2008;1
We studied the workings of a rehabilitation team in a videoconference setting to note the pros and cons of videoconferencing in the development of interprofessional care plans (ICPs). We recorded every videoconference held by the teams of the specialized centre and the regional centre for clients with traumatic brain injuries over an 18-month period. Thirteen recorded videoconferences, lasting for 30-98 min, were analysed through an observation grid. On the whole, efficient teamwork was observed: the mean productivity level was 96%, while the percentage of time dedicated to the resolution of technical issues was 2%. During the videoconferences, the clinical coordinator and the client addressed the group most often. One of the most commonly mentioned advantages was the good visual contact provided by videoconferencing. The most often quoted disadvantage was the poor sound quality. The findings from the study support the adoption of videoconferencing and suggest a few guidelines for the development of ICPs.;2008;1
A previous study revealed that reliable assessment of dysarthria was feasible. However, that study also revealed a number of system limitations and suggested that technological enhancements and improvements in study design and clinical assessment protocols were needed before validity and reliability of assessment of dysarthria via telerehabilitation could be confirmed. In the current study, improvements in technology, study design, and clinical assessment protocols were implemented in order to re-examine the validity and reliability of assessing and diagnosing dysarthria via the telerehabilitation medium. The aim of this study was to explore the validity and reliability of assessing dysarthria using both formal standardized and informal assessments via a purpose-built telerehabilitation system. Twenty-four participants with an acquired dysarthria were assessed simultaneously via telerehabilitation and face-to-face (FTF) on a battery of assessments. A custom-built telerehabilitation system enabled real-time telerehabilitation assessment over a 128 Kbps Internet connection. Data analysis included an analysis of strength of agreement between the two methods using percentage agreement and weighted. statistics. Inter-rater and intrarater reliability were also examined for both the FTF and telerehabilitation-led assessments. Good strength of agreement was found between the FTF and telerehabilitation assessment methods. High intrarater and inter-rater reliability within both the FTF and telerehabilitation assessment methods supported these findings. Participants reported high overall satisfaction in the telerehabilitation environment. This study describes the improvements made to the telerehabilitation system reported previously and confirms that valid and reliable assessment of dysarthria using both standardized and informal assessments over the Internet is possible using this system.;2009;1
AXARM is a multimedia tool for rehabilitation specialists that allow remote assistance and monitoring of patients activities. This tool is the evolution of the work done in 2005-06 between the BCDS research group of UdG and the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation (FEM in Spanish) in Girona under the TRiEM project. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease (ND) that can provoke significant exhaustion in patients even just by going to the medical centre for rehabilitation or regular checking visits. The tool presented in this paper allows the medical staff to remotely carry on patient consults and activities from their home, minimizing the displacements to medical consulting. AXARM has a hybrid P2P architecture and consists essentially of a cross-platform videoconference system, with audio/video recording capabilities. The system can easily be extended to include new capabilities like, among others, asynchronous activities whose result can later be analyzed by the medical personnel.;2009;1
"Background/Objective. The authors previously developed a passive instrumented arm orthosis (Therapy Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton [T-WREX]) that enables individuals with hemiparesis to exercise the arm by playing computer games in a gravity-supported environment. The purpose of this study was to compare semiautonomous training with T-WREX and conventional semiautonomous exercises that used a tabletop for gravity support. Methods. Twenty-eight chronic stroke survivors with moderate/severe hemiparesis were randomly assigned to experimental (T-WREX) or control (tabletop exercise) treatment. A blinded rater assessed arm movement before and after twenty-four 1-hour treatment sessions and at 6-month follow-up. Subjects also rated subjective treatment preferences after a single-session crossover treatment. Results. All subjects significantly improved (P <= .05) upper extremity motor control (Fugl-Meyer), active reaching range of motion (ROM), and self-reported quality and amount of arm use (Motor Activity Log). Improvements were sustained at 6 months. The T-WREX group maintained gains on the Fugl-Meyer significantly better than controls at 6 months (improvement of 3.6 +/- 3.9 vs 1.5 +/- 2.7 points, mean +/- SD; P = .04). Subjects also reported a preference for T-WREX training. Conclusion. Gravity-supported arm exercise, using the T-WREX or tabletop support, can improve arm movement ability after chronic severe hemiparesis with brief one-on-one assistance from a therapist (approximately 4 minutes per session). The 3-dimensional weight support, instant visual movement feedback, and simple virtual reality software provided by T-WREX were associated with modest sustained gains at 6-month follow-up when compared with the conventional approach.";2009;1
Background: Telerehabilitation is the remote delivery of rehabilitation services via information technology and telecommunication systems. There have been a number of recent studies that have used video conferencing to assess language skills in people with aphasia. These studies have highlighted the possibility that severity of impairment and aetiology may have an effect on the administration of telerehabilitation language assessment protocols. Furthermore, anecdotal accounts of difficulties in administering language assessment via telerehabilitation also demonstrate the need for research into the effects of severity of aphasia. It is important that the effects of severity of aphasia are determined as part of the overall evidence base for telerehabilitation language assessment protocols. Aims: To investigate the influence of severity of aphasia on the ability to assess acquired aphasia via telerehabilitation methods. Methods Procedures: A total of 32 participants with an acquired aphasia were assessed simultaneously via telerehabilitation and face-to-face methods on the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination 3rd Edition Short Form (BDAE-3) and the Boston Naming Test (BNT) (2nd Edition Short Form). A custom-built telerehabilitation system developed at the University of Queensland enabled real-time telerehabilitation assessment over a 128kbit/s Internet connection. Participants were grouped according to their severity level. Data analysis was conducted on the differences in scores from the two assessors. Outcomes Results: Results revealed that severity of aphasia did not greatly influence the accuracy of the telerehabilitation assessment for the majority of the BDAE-3 clusters. However, severity of aphasia appeared to affect the ability to assess naming and paraphasia via telerehabilitation methods. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the scores given in the face-to-face and telerehabilitation environments were comparable within each severity level. Conclusions: Results suggest that severity of aphasia may influence the ability to assess some language parameters via telerehabilitation. Further research should use larger sample sizes to confirm these results and to refine the telerehabilitation technology to enable these parameters to be adequately assessed. Additionally, clinician satisfaction with telerehabilitation assessment should be qualitatively researched so as to widen clinician acceptance of this method.;2009;1
"Background: Telerehabilitation is the remote delivery of rehabilitation services via information technology and telecommunication systems. There have been a number of studies that have used videoconferencing to assess speech and language skills in people with acquired neurogenic communication disorders. However, few studies have focused on cases of apraxia of speech. In order to perform accurately differential diagnosis via the telerehabilitation medium, it is important that validation of the assessment of apraxia of speech be established as part of the overall evidence base for telerehabilitation communication assessment protocols. Aims: To determine if valid and reliable assessment of apraxia of speech using a standardized assessment tool was feasible via telerehabilitation. Methods & Procedures: Eleven participants with an acquired apraxia of speech were assessed simultaneously via telerehabilitation and face-to-face methods on the Apraxia Battery for Adults - 2 (ABA-2). A custom-built telerehabilitation system developed at the University of Queensland enabled real-time telerehabilitation assessment over a 128 kbit/s internet connection. Data analysis included tests of significant difference between raw scores using the Wilcoxon signed rank statistic and analysis of the degree of agreement between the two methods using weighted Kappa statistics. Inter-and intra-rater reliabilities were also examined for the telerehabilitation-led assessments. Outcomes & Results: Results revealed no significant differences between the subtest scores of the ABA-2 obtained in the telerehabilitation and face-to-face test environments (p=0.06-0.68). Weighted Kappa statistics indicated moderate to very good agreement (0.59-1.00) between the two environments for the subtests of the ABA-2. The reliability study was hampered by small sample size; however, the data were suggestive of reasonable reliability. Participants reported high overall satisfaction, comfort level, and audio and visual quality in the telerehabilitation environment. The speech-language pathologists (SLP) reported some difficulties assessing participants with severe apraxia of speech via the telerehabilitation system. Conclusions & Implications: This study suggests that valid assessment of apraxia of speech using the ABA-2 over the internet is feasible. The reliability study on the telerehabilitation assessments was encouraging with results suggesting that telerehabilitation assessment using the ABA-2 could be reliable. Findings from the participant satisfaction questionnaire were favourable. However, comments from the SLP suggested that participants exhibiting severe apraxia of speech might be better suited to face-to-face assessment. These findings may have implications for the development of evidence-based guidelines for the use of telerehabilitation in the assessment of apraxia of speech. The authors propose that future research should include larger sample sizes with a range of participant severity levels and be conducted over higher bandwidth connections to explore further the validity and reliability of telerehabilitation assessment of apraxia of speech.";2009;1
Chronic illnesses account for approximately 75% of all healthcare costs in the United States today, resulting in functional limitations and loss of independence, as well as increased medical expenditures. The elderly population is at a higher risk for developing chronic conditions, increasing their risk for disabilities. Given the rapid growth of the aging population, and the chronic illnesses, disabilities, and loss of functional independence endemic to elders, novel methods of rehabilitation and care management are urgently needed. Telehealth models that combine care coordination with communications technology offer a means for managing chronic illnesses, thereby decreasing healthcare costs. We examined the effects of a Veterans Administration (VA) telerehabilitation program (Low Activities of Daily Living [ADL] Monitoring Program-LAMP) on healthcare costs. LAMP is based on a rehabilitative model of care. LAMP patients received adaptive equipment and environmental modifications, which focused on self-care and safety within the home. LAMP Care Coordinators remotely monitored their patient's vital signs and provided education and self-management strategies for decreasing the effects of chronic illnesses and functional decline. The matched comparison group;2009;1
Current theories of stroke rehabilitation point toward paradigms of intense concentrated use of the afficted limb as a means for motor program reorganization and partial function restoration A home based system for stroke rehabilitation that trains recovery of hand function by a treatment of concentrated movement was developed and tested A wearable goniometer measured finger and wrist motions in both hands An interface box transmitted sensor measurements in real time to a laptop computer Stroke patients used joint motion to control the screen cursor in a one-dimensional tracking task for several hours a day over the course of 10-14 days to complete a treatment of 1800 tracking trials A telemonitoring component enabled a therapist to check in with the patient by video phone to monitor progress to motivate the patient and to upload tacking data to a central file server The system was designed for use at home by patients with no computer skills The system was designed for use at home by patients with no computer skills The system was placed in the homes of 20 subjects with chronic stroke and impaired finger motion ranging from 2-305 mt away from the clinic plus one that was a distance of 1057 miles Fifteen subjects installed the system at home themselves after instruction in the clinic while nine required a home visit to install Three required follow up visits to fix equipment A post treatment telephone survey was conducted to assess ease of use and most responded that the system was easy to use Functional improvements were seen in the subjects enrolled in the formal treatment study although the treatment period was too short to trigger cortical reorganization We conclude that the system is feasible for home use and that tracking training has promise as a treatment paradigm;2009;1
Improving walking for individuals with musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions is an important aspect of rehabilitation. The capabilities of clinicians who address these rehabilitation issues could be augmented with innovations such as virtual reality gaming based technologies. The chapter provides an overview of virtual reality gaming based technologies currently being developed and tested to improve motor and cognitive elements required for ambulation and mobility in different patient populations. Included as well is a detailed description of a single VR system, consisting of the rationale for development and iterative refinement of the system based on clinical science. These concepts include: neural plasticity, part-task training, whole task training, task specific training, principles of exercise and motor learning, sensorimotor integration, and visual spatial processing.;2009;1
In the management of stroke, after the first critical care period at the hospital, it is important for the subjects to plan a neural and motion rehabilitation program at home. Telerehabilitation could represent a valid aid for subjects involved in a rehabilitation process at home. Motion and neural rehabilitation are strictly correlated. Prompt motion rehabilitation is essential to ensure good recovery performance from the stroke defect. Remote therapy, which involves a telerehabilitation program, should monitor daily motion activity. An optimal telerehabilitation program should be capable of monitoring patient activity starting from a high disability of imbalance, when there is the need for properly designed aids or prosthesis. The program should continue when the patient improves his or her condition, and progressively changes or abandons aids or prosthesis. New home care for remote activity monitoring has been proposed. It includes a sensorized-codivilla-spring and a gastrocnemius expansion measurement unit to allow activity monitoring in terms of step-counting for the continuity of care at home. This home care has been integrated in a telerehabilitation process. Preliminary clinical trials have shown the effectiveness and the high degree of client satisfaction (patient and therapist). The next phase will be the integration with other units to allow the monitoring of other physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose) useful to investigate in stroke telerehabilitation.;2009;1
In this paper, a teleoperation mechanism capable of providing force feedback by means of adjusting the system's impedance is proposed for a master-slave telerehabilitation robot system. The stability of the teleoperation with haptic feedback via a time-delay communication environment is mathematically proved. By using the proposed teleoperation mechanism, the telerehabilitation system can work theoretically with both passive assisted movement and active assisted movement for the rehabilitation of upper limb function. Experiments with single DOF master-slave robot system show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.;2009;1
In this paper, we describe PREVIRNEC, a distributed system for cognitive telerehabilitation based on virtual environments. Our system allows personalized treatments by means of 2D and 3D exercises that can be built according to single patient's characteristics. Patients realize their exercises remotely. Depending on their obtained results, the system readjusts automatically the levels of difficulty of the tasks, and switches from one task to the other. The paper focuses on technological issues of the system design. We analyze its structure, components, and we discuss the decisions adopted in the interaction mode design and well as in the tasks layout.;2009;1
Indiana University School of Medicine and the Rutgers Tele-rehabilitation Institute have collaborated for over a year on a clinical pilot study of in-home hand telerehabiltation. Virtual reality videogames were used to train three adolescents with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Training duration varied between 6 and 11 months. The investigators summarize medical, technological, legal, safety, social, and economic issues that arose during this lengthy study. Solutions to deal with these multitude of issues are proposed. The authors stress the importance of choosing multiple outcome measures to detect clinically meaningful change. The authors believe that in-home telerehabilitation is the future of rehabilitation.;2009;1
Introduction of successful telerehabilitation into the variety of techniques that are available to the therapist will forever change the field of rehabilitation. Accurate perception of the remote environment's mechanical properties and of stiffness in particular is extremely important for successful telerehabilitation. In the current study we present the framework for exploring perception of delayed stiffness when probing is executed using movement with different joints, and provide experimental results supporting the existence of proximodistal gradient in the perception of delayed stiffness. We found that delayed stiffness was underestimated to a larger extent after probing with wrist than with elbow. We suggest that the observed gradient in perception reveals a proximodistal gradient in control: proximal joints are dominated by force control, whereas distal joints are dominated by position control.;2009;1
Motor retraining following stroke can occur through intensive, repetitive motion tasks that require concentration to promote new connections in the brain. Conducting intensive, repetitive therapy in the clinic is time consuming for both patient and therapist. A home-based, clinician-directed tracking training system for rehabilitation is presented. Two biofeedback motion training systems have been developed, one for hand and wrist motor relearning and the other for the ankle. The systems include a potentiometer joint sensor, a smart box interface and a laptop host computer. An internet connection allowed for periodic video teleconferencing between patient and therapist. The hand/wrist system was evaluated in a pilot project with 24 subjects. The results demonstrated technical feasibility for the technology. The ankle system is currently undergoing evaluation.;2009;1
Objective: Telerehabilitation enables a remotely controlled programme to be used to treat motor deficits in post-stroke patients. The effects of this telerehabilitation approach were compared with traditional motor rehabilitation methods. Design: Randomized single-blind controlled trial. Patients: A total of 36 patients with mild arm motor impairments due to ischaemic stroke in the region of the middle cerebral artery. Methods: The experimental treatment was a virtual reality-based system delivered via the Internet, which provided motor tasks to the patients from a remote rehabilitation facility. The control group underwent traditional physical therapy for the upper limb. Both treatments were of 4 weeks duration. All patients were assessed one month prior to therapy, at the commencement and termination of therapies and one month post-therapy, with the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity, the ABILHAND and the Ashworth scales. Results: Both rehabilitative therapies significantly improved all outcome scores after treatment, but only the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity scale showed differences in the comparison between groups. Conclusion: Both strategies were effective, but the experimental approach induced better outcomes in motor performance. These results may favour early discharge from hospital sustained by a telerehabilitation programme, with potential beneficial effects on the use of available resources.;2009;1
Objective: To describe the development and the implementation of a Web-based, videoconferencing training program for caregivers of adults with traumatic brain injury in rural areas to manage cognitive and behavioral changes in the person with the injury. Design: Feasibility study, with satisfaction and perceived utility assessed. Intervention: Six Web-based videoconference sessions, combining didactic education and problem-solving. Participants: Fifteen caregivers of persons with complicated mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury, who were admitted to a level III trauma center in a rural area of Texas. Measures: Satisfaction survey and perceived utility questions conducted immediately following training and at an average of 18 months after training. Results: Participants' overall satisfaction and comfort with the training was high. They perceived that they gained knowledge that was applicable to the everyday problems being experienced. At follow-up, all participants reported having used the knowledge gained to help cope with problems and all had referred to the written materials at least once since the training. Conclusions: Web-based videoconferencing can be used to provide training to caregivers to manage cognitive and behavioral problems resulting from traumatic brain injury. However, there are obstacles related to willingness to seek help among persons in rural areas that must be overcome.;2009;1
"Patient's and operator's satisfaction is one of the major requirements to be addressed in the implementation of a tele-rehabilitation service, to render it a valuable and effective means to administer remote rehabilitation treatment. This aspect was deeply investigated within the European Project HELLODOC (acronym for HEaLthcare Service Linking Tele-rehabilitation to Disabled PeOple and Clinicians; March 2005 February 2007). The project focused on a home care upper limb tele-rehabilitation service delivered to a wide number 81 patients in all of neurological patients affected by traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke (S) or multiple sclerosis (MS). The core of the service was the Portable Unit (PU) to be installed at patient's home; the PU allows the execution of daily-like tasks and the measurement of some related kinetic and kinematic quantities. For evaluating general acceptability of the PU system a survey was delivered to patients and therapists, and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess their satisfaction. The present study reports on main results of this activity. The analysis showed a general acceptability and satisfaction for both groups - patients and therapists - and some correlations were found among acceptability levels, pathologies and patient's age.";2009;1
Primary objective: The current study examined whether cognitive rehabilitation delivered over the Internet was associated with improvements in functioning. Research design: A total of 14 individuals with medically documented traumatic brain injury completed this study. Participants completed 30 sessions of an active calendar acquisition intervention and 30 sessions of a control diary intervention in a cross-over study design for a total of 60 online sessions. All sessions were completed using an instant messaging system via the Internet. Measures of cognitive functioning, ratings of memory and mood and frequency of use of common memory and cognitive compensation techniques were gathered from participants and family members. Main outcomes and results: There were no significant differences between the active and control conditions on the primary outcome measure of memory functioning. However, significant improvements in use of compensatory strategies as well as family reports of improved memory and mood were observed following completion of all sessions. Individuals with less use of compensatory strategies at baseline were significantly less likely to complete the study. Conclusions: These results suggest that the Internet may be an effective delivering mechanism for compensatory cognitive rehabilitation, particularly among individuals who are already utilizing some basic compensatory strategies.;2009;1
Providing health core and assistance at home becomes more and more important due to the aging society and - in general - a health system under financial pressure. It is generally accepted that these services have to be supported by an eHealth infrastructure that enables the exchange of patient related data between different health institutions and assistance systems at home (referred to by the term AAL). In this paper a service-oriented architecture for delivering eHealth / AAL services at home using a hardware platform such as a residential gateway or a set-top-box is proposed and exemplified by three different services: (1) telerehabilitation of patients after heard surgery (2) support of hearing impaired people and (3) the monitoring of Activities of Daily Living (ADL).;2009;1
Purpose. To identify clinical outcomes, clinical process, healthcare utilization and costs associated with telerehabilitation for individuals with physical disabilities. Method. Relevant databases were searched for articles on telerehabilitation published until February 2007. Reference lists were examined and key journals were hand searched. Studies that included telerehabilitation for individuals with physical impairments and used experimental or observational study designs were included in the analysis, regardless of the specific clientele or location of services. Data was extracted using a form to record methodological aspects and results relating to clinical, process, healthcare utilization and cost outcomes. Study quality of randomized clinical trials was assessed using the PEDro rating scale. Results. Some 28 articles were analysed. These dealt with rehabilitation of individuals in the community, neurological rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, follow-up of individuals with spinal cord injuries, rehabilitation for speech-language impairments, and rehabilitation for varied clienteles. Clinical outcomes were generally improved following a telerehabilitation intervention and were at least similar to or better than an alternative intervention. Clinical process outcomes, such as attendance and compliance, were high with telerehabilitation although few comparisons are made to alternative interventions. Consultation time tended to be longer with telerehabilitation. Satisfaction with telerehabilitation was consistently high, although it was higher for patients than therapists. Few studies examined healthcare utilization measures and those that did reported mixed findings with respect to adverse events, use of emergency rooms and doctor visits. Only five of the studies examined costs. There is some preliminary evidence of potential cost savings for the healthcare facility. Conclusions. While evidence is mounting concerning the efficacy and effectiveness of telerehabilitation, high-quality evidence regarding impact on resource allocation and costs is still needed to support clinical and policy decision-making.;2009;1
Purpose: Moving On after STroke (MOST) is an established self-management programme for persons with stroke and their care partners. Through 18 sessions over 9 weeks, each including discussion and exercise, participants learn about goal-setting, problem-solving, exercise, and community-reintegration skills. This study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of telehealth delivery of MOST. Method: Efficacy was evaluated using an experimental non-randomized trial comparing a telehealth MOST intervention group (T-MOST) (n=10) with a waiting list control group (WLC) (n = 8). Outcome measures included the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Reintegration to Normal Living Index, the Stroke-Adapted Sickness Impact Profile, Goal Attainment Scaling, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. The feasibility evaluation included attendance rates, focus groups, and facilitator logs. In MOST Telehealth, one co-facilitator was local and the other was connected by videoconference. Results. Attendance rates for persons with stroke (83.9%, SD=2.6) and care partners (76.7%, SD=2.9) and participant and facilitator experiences indicated feasibility of this mode of programme delivery. There was a significant difference in BBS scores between the T-MOST group and the WLC group (mean difference -4.27, 95%CI: -6.66 to -1.87). Participants reported additional benefits, including increased motivation and awareness of partners' needs. Videoconferencing was reported to decrease their sense of isolation. Conclusion: It appears feasible to deliver the MOST programme with two facilitators, one connected by videoconference and one in person. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that the programme is associated with improved well-being in persons with stroke and their care partners. Practitioners delivering self-management programmes may consider wider dissemination using videoconferencing.;2009;1
"Telemedicine represents a valid aid in rehabilitation process. A remote therapist in a telerehabilitation program could monitor daily motion activity and assign motion-rehabilitation tools on the basis of the fall risk. However, one problem is detection of the fall risk itself. Web-based video-camera images alone do not help the remote assessment of the fall risk using the most commonly used qualitative tests based on visual observation. A novel wearable system to assess fall risk in telerehabilitation has been proposed based on an Inertial Measurement Unit and a medical protocol. It provides a score in four levels (1: no fall risk; 4: major fall risk). The telemedicine tool is integrated to the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) net. Each component of the wearable system has been designed and integrated. Each component in the system has been tested individually and in a closed loop. One subject was monitored in a telemedicine link. The test showed a high degree of acceptance. The tool will be furnished to subjects along with a homecare device for daily routine monitoring of motion activity and could eventually be integrated with other systems designed to monitor other physiological parameters along with different aids and monitoring tools.";2009;1
Telerehabilitation refers to the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to provide rehabilitation services to people remotely in their homes or other environments. By using ICT, client access to care can be improved and the reach of clinicians can extend beyond the physical walls of a traditional healthcare facility, thus expanding continuity of care to persons with disabling conditions. The concept of telecare, when telerehabilitation is used to deliver services to clients in their homes or other living environments, empowers and enables individuals to take control of the management of their medical needs and interventions by enabling personalized care, choice and personal control. A wide variety of assessment and treatment interventions can be delivered to clients using remote monitoring systems, robotic and virtual reality technologies, and synchronized collaboration with online material. This chapter will present a brief history of telerehabilitation and telecare and offer an overview of the technology used to provide remote rehabilitation services. Emphasis will be given to the importance of human factors and user-centered design in the planning, development, and implementation of telerehabilitation systems and programs. The issue of self-care in rehabilitation and self-management will be discussed along with the rationale for how telerehabilitation can be used to promote client self-care and self-management. Two case studies of real-world telerehabilitation systems will be given, with a focus on how they were planned and implemented so as to maximize their potential benefits. The chapter will close with a discussion of obstacles and challenges facing telerehabilitation and suggestions for ways to promote its growth in use and acceptance.;2009;1
Ten laryngectomy patients were assessed using a purpose-designed, multimedia videoconferencing system incorporating a freestanding, self-focusing camera. Swallowing, stoma and communication status were assessed simultaneously by a remote clinician and face-to-face, by a second clinician at the patient's site. The remote trial took place over a distance of approximately 1700 km using a commercial 3G phone network. A satisfaction questionnaire was also completed. There was excellent agreement between the two assessing clinicians. Image quality obtained via the freestanding camera was rated as lower than direct observation, but it was sufficient to assess the stoma and status of the voice prosthesis. During the trial, occasional difficulties with audio delays and image distortion were experienced, although these were manageable. Both patient and clinician satisfaction with remote assessment was high. The results provide further evidence to support the use of telerehabilitation for evaluating the speech and swallowing status of laryngectomy patients following discharge from acute care.;2009;1
The aim of the research is to develop an objective evaluation tool for use in stroke rehabilitation clinical practice. Stroke patients are prone to particularly high risk of fall, which may differ for various directions of movement. An apparatus enabling perturbations and postural response assessment in eight directions in transversal plane during standing was used to assess data in seven neurologically intact volunteers and 10 stroke patients before and after the rehabilitation. Ground reaction force and center of pressure were acquired during the perturbation, signal processed and compared to Berg Balance Scale (BBS), a clinical outcome mea sure of balance. The results of the weight load ratio between the affected and unaffected lower extremity demonstrated objective positive outcomes of the rehabilition and also correlated with the clinical instrument BBS. Additionally, the center of pressure ratio between the anterior/posterior and media/lateral peak for each perturbation direction have shown identifiable postural response strategies in selected directions of transverse plane. The directional postural information can he helpful when identifying and evaluating the objective rehabilitation progress which can lead to application of targeted rehabilitation techniques. The directional indicator also demonstrated correlation with the BBS in directions indicating rehabilitation progress. When considering the common use with the clinical instrument, the proposed objective rehabilitation progress evaluation tool may also become helpful in directional fall risk indication. The proposed tool may become a powerful instrument, when the balance training and postural response assessment will move to remote or home environment as a telerehabilitation service.;2009;1
The paper presents a virtual reality based dynamic balance training. The telerehabititation balance training in stroke subject took place in smarthome, simulating a home environment. Virtual environment was designed as a game in web-explorer enabling the medical professionals to remotely supervise and control the balance training. In preliminary testing a right-side hemiparetic subject participated and demonstrated high motivation, high level of learning and accomplished the therapy with promising clinical outcomes. The subject performed the therapy five times a week, each time for 17 to 20 minutes for four weeks. The results were evaluated by objective game parameter as track time, number of hits and clinical instruments Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up&Go and 10m Walk tests. The outcomes indicate similar progress to those obtained in the clinical environment.;2009;1
"The rapid development of Virtual Reality-based technologies over the past decade is both an asset and a challenge for neuro-rehabilitation. The availability of novel technologies that provide interactive, functional simulations with multimodal feedback enable clinicians to achieve traditional therapeutic goals that would be difficult, if not impossible, to attain via conventional therapy. They also lead to the creation of completely new clinical paradigms which would have been hard to achieve in the past. In applications of rehabilitation for both motor and cognitive deficits the main focus of much of the early exploratory research has been to investigate the use of virtual reality as an assessment tool. To date such environments are primarily: (a) single user (i.e., designed for and used by one clinical client at a time) and (b) used locally within a clinical or educational setting. More recently, researchers have begun the development of new and more complex VR-based approaches according to two dimensions: the number of users and the distance between the users. Driven by a push-pull phenomenon, the original approach has now expanded to three additional avenues: multiple users in co-located settings; single users in remote locations; and multiple users in remote locations. After a presentation of examples that illustrate theses various approaches, we will conclude in addressing questions and ethical considerations raised by this evolution in the use of virtual environments in rehabilitation.";2009;1
There has been a steady increase in the number of telerehabilitation programmes, as well as studies of telerehabilitation technology development, efficacy and effectiveness. However, few studies have examined the impact of telerehabilitation when it is actually implemented in a clinical setting. The objective of this study was therefore to explore how the properties of the technologies used for telerehabilitation affect clinical practice and interprofessional communication in a rehabilitation setting. A qualitative case study of an interorganisational telerehabilitation programme for traumatic brain injured and spinal cord injured patients was conducted, using data obtained from focus groups and interviews, along with observations of recordings of videoconference sessions. A conceptual framework based on technology adoption and organisational change theories was used to structure the data collection and thematic analysis. Several key characteristics of the telerehabilitation technologies were identified that impacted on interprofessional and interorganisational collaborations and patient participation, including the audio and video quality, the real-time communication capability, user-friendliness and time restrictions. The technology was used primarily for interdisciplinary care plan meetings, and occasionally for direct patient interventions in speech therapy and sexology, although additional uses had been identified in the planning stages. Implications for the development of future telerehabilitation programmes are discussed, in particular relating to sensitizing team members to each other's roles and organisational cultures.;2009;1

This paper shows the general concept and the primary implementation of a pervasive intelligent system for rehabilitation. The scope of this work is to highlight the possibility to join two important research fields, i.e. rehabilitation and ambient assisted living, to enhance the capabilities and independence of disable and aged people. The described system was composed of a ZigBee network, with coordinator, sensor and actuator nodes, able to identify and control patient's activities and send warning to caregiver if requests in warning functionality, and of a software interface to manage the whole network and to monitor patient in outdoor environment.;2009;1
We conducted a modified narrative review of the literature on telehealth applications used in speech-language pathology assessment and treatment. The following databases and information resources were used: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PSYCInfo, ERIC, Digital Dissertations, CSA Social Services Abstracts, CSA Sociological Abstracts, On-line ASHA publications and personal contacts. Sixty-two full-text documents were located. Twenty-eight provided sufficient detail to be reviewed using a checklist adapted from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) recommendations for level of evidence rankings and quality assessment ratings. Five of the 28 studies received a ranking indicating a high level of evidence (larger sample sizes, assessed outcomes with valid and reliable measures, performed statistical analysis of study results, measured reliability of study results, ensured internal and external validity, and ensured randomization of participants to groups). These five studies concluded that the service delivery results from telehealth were equivalent to traditional face-to-face results. However, telehealth was not a complete replacement for face-to-face service delivery and further research is required.;2009;1
We explored the benefit of video communication in home rehabilitation after shoulder joint replacement and compared it to referral for physiotherapy in the conventional way. A total of 22 patients were included in the study. The intervention group (n = 10) had training at home under the supervision of a physiotherapist at the hospital using videoconferencing. The control group (n = 12) had physiotherapy training in a conventional way in their home town. All patients had the same Postoperative, three-phase-program me for two months. The outcome measures were a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, range of motion (ROM), shoulder function ability (Constant score and SRQ-S) and health-related quality of life (SF-36). Questions about areas of priority for improvement and general satisfaction with the shoulder were also included. The telemedicine group received a greater number of treatments compared to the control group. After the intervention, there were significant improvements in VAS-pain, Constant score and SRQ-S for both groups. The telemedicine group improved significantly more in all three measurements than the control group (P < 0.001 for all). When changes from baseline to follow-up were compared, the telemedicine group improved significantly more in terms of decrease in pain (P = 0.004) and vitality (P = 0.001) than the control group. Despite some limitations, there seem to be clear benefits from physiotherapy at a distance with a telemedicine technique that allows patients to obtain access to physiotherapy at home.;2009;1
Assessing the accessibility using 3D Virtual Reality and telecommunication technology has influenced home adaptation to improve accessibility in homes for individuals with disabilities, especially with Spinal Cord Injury. To provide clients with quantitative ideas on home adaptation with levels of accessibility, we propose a tentative method of measuring accessibility in home. There are a number of assessment protocols to assist rehabilitation professionals and architects in gaining wheelchair accessibility. In this paper, we briefly introduce quantitative assessment method of wheelchair accessibility in home. The feasibility of mathematical expressions of the quantitative accessibility was discussed.;2010;2
Background: Although there are treatments that can alleviate stuttering in adults for clinically significant periods, in Australia there are barriers to the accessibility and availability of best-practice treatment. Aims: This parallel group, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial with multiple blinded outcome assessments investigated whether telehealth delivery of the Camperdown Program provides a non-inferior alternative to face-to-face treatment for adults who stutter. Methods & Procedures: Forty participants who presented to a university speech clinic were randomized: 20 to the telehealth arm and 20 to the face-to-face arm. Exclusion criteria were age younger than 18 years, frequency of stuttering less than 2% of syllables stuttered and previous speech-restructuring treatment within the past 12 months. The Camperdown Program for adults who stutter was the intervention. Primary outcome measures were frequency of stuttering measured in per cent syllables stuttered (%SS) before treatment and at 9 months post-randomization and efficiency, measured by counting the number of speech pathologist contact hours used by each participant. Intention to treat analysis was conducted using last observation carried forward. Secondary outcome measures were speech naturalness, self-reported stuttering severity, and treatment satisfaction. Outcomes & Results: There was no statistically or clinically significant difference in %SS between the two groups at 9 months post-randomization. Analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline %SS showed telehealth had 0.8% absolute lower per cent syllables stuttered than face-to-face. There were also no differences in %SS between groups immediately post-treatment, or at 6 months and 12 months post-treatment (p = 0.9). In the second primary outcome measure, the telehealth group used statistically less contact time (221 min) on average than the face-to-face group (95% confidence interval = -387 to -56 min, p = 0.01). Conclusions & Implications: The results provide evidence to support the use of the Camperdown Program delivered by telehealth as an alternate to the face-to-face treatment delivery of this programme for adults who stutter. Such a model will increase accessibility to this evidence-based treatment for adults currently isolated from treatment services.;2010;2
Background: Patients with Parkinson's disease face numerous access barriers to speech pathology services for appropriate assessment and treatment. Telerehabilitation is a possible solution to this problem, whereby rehabilitation services may be delivered to the patient at a distance, via telecommunication and information technologies. A number of studies have demonstrated the capacity of telerehabilitation to provide reliable and valid assessments of speech, voice and language. However, no studies have specifically focused on assessing patients with Parkinson's disease. Aims: To investigate the validity and reliability of a telerehabilitation application for assessing the speech and voice disorder associated with Parkinson's disease. Methods & Procedures: Sixty-one participants with Parkinson's disease and hypokinetic dysarthria were simultaneously assessed in an online and face-to-face environment by two speech-language pathologists. The assessment protocol included perceptual measures of voice and oromotor function, articulatory precision, speech intelligibility, and acoustic measures of vocal sound pressure level, phonation time and pitch range. Online assessments were conducted via a personal computer-based videoconferencing system with store-and-forward capabilities, operating on a 128 kbit/s Internet connection. The level of agreement between the online and face-to-face ratings was determined using several different analyses, depending on the parameter. These included per cent close agreement, quadratic weighted Kappa, and the Bland and Altman limits of agreement. Outcomes & Results: Per cent close agreement between the two environments was within a predetermined clinical criterion of 80% agreement for all voice and oromotor parameters, articulatory precision and speech intelligibility in conversation. Levels of agreement between the environments, based on quadratic weighted Kappa, ranged from poor to good for vocal parameters and from fair to very good for oromotor parameters. Bland and Altman limits of agreement analyses revealed comparability between online and face-to-face environments for vocal sound pressure level, phonation time, pitch range, sentence intelligibility and communication efficiency in reading. Intra- and inter-rater reliability scores for all tasks were comparable between the online and face-to-face environments. Conclusions & Implications: For the majority of parameters, comparable levels of agreement were achieved between the two environments. Online assessment of disordered speech and voice in Parkinson's disease appears to be valid and reliable. The telerehabilitation application described in this study provides evidence for the delivery of online assessment for the dysarthric speech disorder associated with Parkinson's disease.;2010;2
"Background: Stroke is one of the most disabling and costly impairments of adulthood in the United States. Stroke patients clearly benefit from intensive inpatient care, but due to the high cost, there is considerable interest in implementing interventions to reduce hospital lengths of stay. Early discharge rehabilitation programs require coordinated, well-organized home-based rehabilitation, yet lack of sufficient information about the home setting impedes successful rehabilitation. This trial examines a multifaceted telerehabilitation (TR) intervention that uses telehealth technology to simultaneously evaluate the home environment, assess the patient's mobility skills, initiate rehabilitative treatment, prescribe exercises tailored for stroke patients and provide periodic goal oriented reassessment, feedback and encouragement. Methods: We describe an ongoing Phase II, 2-arm, 3-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) that determines primarily the effect of TR on physical function and secondarily the effect on disability, falls-related self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction. Fifty participants with a diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: (a) TR; or (b) Usual Care. The TR intervention uses a combination of three videotaped visits and five telephone calls, an in-home messaging device, and additional telephonic contact as needed over a 3-month study period, to provide a progressive rehabilitative intervention with a treatment goal of safe functional mobility of the individual within an accessible home environment. Dependent variables will be measured at baseline, 3-, and 6-months and analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model across all time points. Discussion: For patients recovering from stroke, the use of TR to provide home assessments and follow-up training in prescribed equipment has the potential to effectively supplement existing home health services, assist transition to home and increase efficiency. This may be particularly relevant when patients live in remote locations, as is the case for many veterans.";2010;2
Background: While adults with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) can have significant upper limb dysfunction, the effects of movement-based training has not been investigated. Objective: This uncontrolled trial assessed the effects of a home and internet-based upper limb intervention program targeting motor and sensory function. Methods: Twelve adults, aged 21 to 57 yrs, GMFCS levels I-III with asymmetric upper limb involvement participated in the Upper Limb Training and Assessment (ULTrA) program. Clinical and functional measures included the Motor Activity Log (MAL), the Nine-Hole Peg test, and grip strength. An upper limb training system consisting of a laptop, webcam, target light board, and hand manipulation/discrimination devices was installed in each participant's home. Training occurred 40 min/day, 5 days/wk for 8 wks and included both unilateral and bilateral reach movements as well as a series of hand sensorimotor tasks such as card turning, stereognosis, and tactile discrimination. Data generated during each session were transmitted to the laboratory via the Internet. Main outcome measures were movement time, interlimb delay time, and performance on hand sensorimotor tasks. Results: Following training, affected limb reach movement time decreased significantly for unilateral and bilateral tasks. Interlimb delay during sequential reaching also decreased. Significant improvement in hand manipulation tasks was also seen. Compliance was excellent and there were no adverse effects. Conclusion: The ULTrA program had beneficial effects for adults with CP and is safe and convenient to use. This system contrasts sharply with programs with similar intent that require participant travel and hours of therapist-based intervention.;2010;2
"Golomb MR, McDonald BC, Warden Si. Yonkman J, Saykin AJ, Shirley B, Huber M, Rabin B. AbdelBaky M, NWOSU ME, Barkat-Masih M, Burdea GC. In-home virtual reality videogame telerehabilitation in adolescents with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2010;91:1-8. Objective: To investigate whether in-home remotely monitored virtual reality videogame-based telerehabilitation in adolescents with hemiplegic cerebral palsy can improve hand function and forearm bone health, and demonstrate alterations in motor circuitry activation. Design: A 3-month proof-of-concept pilot study. Setting: Virtual reality videogame-based rehabilitation systems were installed in the homes of 3 participants and networked via secure Internet connections to the collaborating engineering school and children's hospital. Participants: Adolescents (N=3) with severe hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Intervention: Participants were asked to exercise the plegic hand 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week using a sensor glove fitted to the plegic hand and attached to a remotely monitored videogame console installed in their home. Games were custom developed, focused on finger movement, and included a screen avatar of the hand. Main Outcome Measures: Standardized occupational therapy assessments, remote assessment of finger range of motion (ROM) based on sensor glove readings, assessment of plegic forearm bone health with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and per quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of hand grip task. Results: All 3 adolescents showed improved function of the plegic hand on occupational therapy testing, including increased ability to lift objects, and improved finger ROM based on remote measurements. The 2 adolescents who were most compliant showed improvements in radial bone mineral content and area in the plegic arm. For all 3 adolescents, fMRI during grip task contrasting the plegic and nonplegic hand showed expanded spatial extent of activation at posttreatment relative to baseline in brain motor circuitry (eg, primary motor cortex and cerebellum). Conclusions: Use of remotely monitored virtual reality videogame telerehabilitation appears to produce improved hand function and forearm bone health (as measured by DXA and pQCT) in adolescents with chronic disability who practice regularly. Improved hand function appears to be reflected in functional brain changes.";2010;2
In The Netherlands, a web application for speech training, E-learning- based speech therapy ( EST), has been developed for patients with dysarthria, a speech disorder resulting from acquired neurological impairments such as stroke or Parkinson's disease. In this report, the EST infrastructure and its potentials for both therapists and patients are elucidated. EST provides patients with dysarthria the opportunity to engage in intensive speech training in their own environment, in addition to undergoing the traditional face-to-face therapy. Moreover, patients with chronic dysarthria can use EST to independently maintain the quality of their speech once the face-to-face sessions with their speech therapist have been completed. This telerehabilitation application allows therapists to remotely compose speech training programs tailored to suit each individual patient. Moreover, therapists can remotely monitor and evaluate changes in the patient's speech. In addition to its value as a device for composing, monitoring, and carrying out web-based speech training, the EST system compiles a database of dysarthric speech. This database is vital for further scientific research in this area.;2010;2
In this work, a simplified interface system for education of people with disabilities is presented. This platform allows the control of different tools (PC games, robot, and electric wheelchair) using different interfaces (mouse, joysticks, etc.). This interface system can be automatically reconfigured to match user's ability, and it is operated locally or remotely through the internet. Saving of experimental progress data for later analysis can be done. Quantitative indicators are defined for evaluation purposes and to determine the needed assistance and adaptation. The system is tested on different age groups for people without physical disability. Results are presented and discussed.;2010;2
Inertial sensors are widely used in telerehabilitation systems since they permit to monitor the patient's movement and determine the position of their limbs. Limbs angle measurement is carried out through the integration of the angular velocity measured by a rate sensor and the decomposition of the components of static gravity acceleration measured by an accelerometer. Different factors derived from the sensors nature, such as the Angle Random Walk (ARW), and dynamic bias lead to erroneous measurements. Dynamic bias effects can he reduced through the use of adaptive filtering based on sensor fusion concepts. Most existing published works use a Kalman filtering sensor fusion approach. Our aim is to perform a comparative study among different adaptive filters. Several LMS and RLS variations are tested with the purpose of finding the best method leading to a more accurate limb angle measurement. An angle wander compensation sensor fusion approach based on Least Mean Squares (LMS) and Recursive Least Squares (RLS) filters has been developed.;2010;2
Introduction. Telemedicine is the application of telemedicine. There is not a new branch of medicine, but a way of exercising through systems that seek to alleviate the physical separation of its protagonists. There are many activities closely related to telemedicine, such as the telecare of socio-distance services, telehealth, which is responsible for increasing the welfare and health of individuals, teleeducation (health) and telesurgery. Development. The neurorehabilitation is a process designed to reduce disability and social disadvantage suffered by a person as a result of a neurological disease, in which the telerehabilitation is positioning as a therapeutic measure. The telerehabilitation refers to the provision of rehabilitation services through electronic systems, based on information and communication technologies. Conclusions. The development of these technologies have made telemedicine a reality, enabling extended rehabilitative care beyond the hospitalarian process, in a ecologic environment, where new constraints detect and evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, compared with the activities of daily living and quality of life of patients at a sustainable cost, is a challenge today. However, current evidence of telerehabilitation measures in neurological patients is scarce in our country, so is necessary a larger number of studies focusing on the validity, reliability, effectiveness and efficiency of the technique.;2010;2
Introduction. The consequences of acquired brain injury include impairments in cognition, emotion and behaviour. Neuropsychology provides techniques for treating these disorders, but it is still important to establish which of all the available tools are most effective for this purpose. Development. This article reviews existing studies on the effectiveness of neuropsychological rehabilitation, focusing on those areas more often affected after acquired brain injury. The purpose of the article is to guide and orient neuropsychological rehabilitation of these patients based on the strongest evidence available in the literature. In this second part, we will focus on the rehabilitation of executive functions, the behaviour modification, and psychotherapy applied in this area, as well as the application of new technologies. Conclusion. There is enough evidence to recommend the neuropsychological rehabilitation of executive functions, and the application of the above mentioned tools in patients with acquired brain injury.;2010;2
Numerous rehabilitation robots have been developed to deliver therapy for hemiplegic patients with a unilateral-disabled limb or for aged persons with motor-function degenerated limbs. Recently, much attention has been paid to the development of robots that support bilateral arm training in various patterns. It has been proved that the coordination of two limbs can reduce hypertonia and abnormal synergies compared to unilateral limb training. However, traditional robots realized different modes with the robot providing a corresponding force for the impaired limb. This paper proposes a novel bimanual training system. A subject controls master and slave terminal handles with his/her two limbs. The less impaired limb provides a corresponding force for the more impaired limb to achieve different training patterns. No matter in which mode, the two limbs accomplish symmetric movement. An experimental prototype was built. Frequency response test and training tests on 9 healthy subjects in active-resisted and active-assisted modes were performed. Experimental results confirm that the system can correctly respond a subject's commands if velocity was changed within the frequency range of 30 Hz. For each training mode, the average position error, and RMS (root mean square) values of position errors and velocity errors that between the reference values and actual values of a motion tracking task were reduced after practice. This proves the effectiveness of the system for self-assisted rehabilitation training.;2010;2
OBJECTIVE. We examined the efficacy of a remotely based arm rehabilitation regimen. A 62-year-old man participated in occupation-based, task-specific practice of activities of daily living (ADLs) > 3 years after stroke. The entire regimen was administered over the Internet using personal computer based cameras and free network meeting software. METHOD. Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FM), Action Research Arm Test (ARA), and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) were administered before intervention. One week after treatment, FM, ARA, and COPM were readministered. RESULTS. The participant exhibited reduced impairment and reduced functional limitation. He also expressed enhanced satisfaction with his ability to perform ADLs and rated his ADL performance better after intervention. The participant could now drive using both hands, use eating utensils, and catch and throw a ball. CONCLUSION. Data suggest feasibility and efficacy of a remotely based, inexpensive approach using functional electrical stimulation for affected arm rehabilitation after stroke.;2010;2
"Objective: Musculoskeletal conditions are highly prevalent and disabling, particularly in rural and remote areas. In these areas, access to rehabilitation services is limited by the availability of physical therapists. Telerehabilitation may be a feasible solution to the issue of rural physical therapy service access; however, there is little existing evidence for clinical efficacy. The aim of this study was to establish the criterion validity and reliability of remote physical assessment and diagnosis of nonarticular lower limb musculoskeletal conditions via telerehabilitation. Materials and Methods: Nineteen participants with existing nonarticular lower limb musculoskeletal conditions were assessed by a face-to-face therapist and a remote therapist to establish criterion validity of telerehabilitation. Video recordings from the telerehabilitation session were reviewed after 1 month by the remote therapist to establish intrarater reliability and by a second remote therapist to establish interrater reliability. Patho-anatomical diagnoses, system diagnoses, and the findings of the physical examination were compared statistically. Results: There was 79% or higher primary diagnosis agreement (same or similar diagnoses) and 79% or higher exact system diagnosis agreement for validity, intrarater reliability, and interrater reliability studies. The physical examination findings showed substantial agreement (0.61 < kappa < 0.80) in the validity study and almost perfect agreement 0.81 < kappa < 1.00) in the intrarater and interrater reliability studies. Conclusions: Using telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal physical therapy assessment of nonarticular lower limb conditions was found to be valid and reliable. Existing diagnostic reasoning can be applied; however, new methods of patient self-examination are needed to enable differential diagnosis.";2010;2
Objective: This study looked at patient satisfaction with an Internet-based cognitive rehabilitation program, which has been previously shown to be associated with functional improvements. Materials and Methods: Fourteen individuals with documented traumatic brain injury and memory impairments completed this study. Participants completed 60 sessions of Internet-based cognitive rehabilitation: 30 sessions of an active calendar intervention and 30 sessions of a control diary intervention. A four-question satisfaction questionnaire (responses were generated using a seven-point Likert scale) was completed after 30 sessions and again after 60 sessions. Results: No significant differences in satisfaction were found between time of assessment and treatment condition. In addition, a higher level of calendar use prior to beginning the study was associated with greater satisfaction at study completion. Conclusion: These results suggest that persons with traumatic brain injury are not only willing to use the Internet to receive cognitive rehabilitation treatment, but are generally highly satisfied with the treatment. Further, individuals with some baseline compensatory strategies may be particularly well suited to this method of treatment.;2010;2
Objective: To evaluate the equivalency of wheeled mobility and seating assessments delivered under 2 conditions: in person (IP) at a local clinic and via Telerehabilitation at remotely located clinics. Design: The study used a prospective, multicenter controlled nonrandomized design to investigate wheeled mobility and seating assessments. Setting: Five wheelchair clinics in Western Pennsylvania. Participants: Participants (N=98) in need of new wheeled mobility and seating were recruited and consented for IP assessments at the Center for Assistive Technology (n=50) and Telerehabilitation (n=48) assessments at remotely located clinics. Interventions: The telerehabilitation condition used a custom videoconferencing system to connect a wheeled mobility and seating expert at the University of Pittsburgh's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Telerehabilitation to a remote clinic. Main Outcome Measures: Study findings were based on the level of function the participants showed with their new wheeled mobility and seating devices as measured by using the Functioning Everyday with a Wheelchair (FEW) outcome tool. Results: The results revealed no significant differences between the FEW pretest average or item scores for the 2 conditions or the FEW posttest average or item scores except for the FEW transportation item. The average FEW and FEW item scores reached the established clinically relevant pretest-posttest difference of 1.85, and the change scores were significantly different. The difference between FEW means based on posttest confidence intervals indicated that telerehabilitation was equally effective as IP rehabilitation. Conclusions: An expert practitioner located at least 125 miles away from each of the remote sites used a secured videoconferencing system to consult from a geographic distance on wheeled mobility and seating evaluations via telerehabilitation. Compared with participants receiving standard IP care, the telerehabilitation treatment condition was equally effective on all but 1 outcome.;2010;2
Outcome measures in physical therapy provide the basis for determining the patient's rehabilitation needs, developing an individual intervention plan, and reassessing the evolution of the condition after therapeutic intervention. Questions surrounding the validity and reliability of outcome measures obtained in the context of telerehabilitation remain. The goal of this study was to explore which outcome measures can be used reliably in the context of telerehabilitation after discharge from an acute care hospital for lower limb orthopedic surgery. Fifteen patients recently discharged after total knee arthroplasty were evaluated by two experienced therapists. Each therapist evaluated under a given condition (face-to-face assessment, telerehabilitation assessment) eight outcome measures taken from standard clinical tests routinely used in the management of orthopedic rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty. Evaluations were measured at 1-day intervals. Telerehabilitation evaluations were conducted with a videoconference link (H. 264 CoDecs with Pan, Tilt, Zoom cameras) between either the participant's home or a clinical environment and a remote clinical station over residential DSL lines at 512 kbps. Interrater agreement between the two measurement modes was analyzed using the Bland and Altman method and Kripendorff's alpha reliability estimate. The 95% confidence interval for mean difference between evaluation methods varied between -20% and 8% for knee range of motion measures, -85% and 55% for scar management, -33% and 29% for functional evaluations. Five out of the eight outcome measures showed reliability estimates of >0.80, with lowest reliability obtained for the scar assessment scale (0.34) and the highest reliability for the evaluation of the range of motion at the knee (0.87 in flexion and 0.85 in extension). Clinical variables typically measured in face-to-face evaluations can be measured successfully under telerehabilitation conditions with moderate reliability.;2010;2
Purpose of review The field of new technologies for upper-limb rehabilitation is exploding. The review presents new trends and studies of effectiveness from recent literature regarding robots, virtual reality and telerehabilitation for neurorehabilitation of the upper limb. Recent findings There appears to be a greater focus on technological developments than on clinical trials or studies to evaluate the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of these systems. Developments are most abundant in the field of robotics. However, the first well designed and powered randomized-controlled trial on robot rehabilitation has appeared, confirming that the effectiveness of robot therapy lies in the number of repetitions provided. There is a move towards studies in populations other than stroke, particularly cerebral palsy with a few studies on multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. There is also an increasing trend for the use of robotic devices as evaluation tools. Summary Despite the fact that new technologies are based on knowledge from motor control and learning literature and that they provide an exciting potential for varied rehabilitation, recent evidence suggests that the only contribution to clinical practice currently is the provision of intensive, repetitive movements.;2010;2
Purpose. Reliable assessment of balance abilities and determination of the likelihood of falling in the elderly requires a skilled clinician to guide and assist the individual throughout the scoring of a suitable balance assessment method. The most widely used clinical instrument is the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The aim of this study was to develop an objective balance assessment measure that would correlate well with BBS and could thus be used to test balancing abilities remotely. Methods. Twenty elderly individuals were divided into two groups: fallers and non-fallers based on their falling records. Balance abilities were assessed by means of BBS as well as through analysis of peak amplitude of center-of-pressure (COP) responses that followed induced-sway, provoked by a moveable standing frame in the medio-lateral plane. An independent t-test was used to compare BBS scores and COP based measures between both groups. Additionally, correlation between both tests was determined by use of the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results. Fallers exhibited significantly lower BBS scores as well as significantly lower peak values of COP responses. The coefficient of correlation between both tests was relatively high (0.68) and statistically significant. Conclusion. The high degree of correlation between both tests implies that the proposed objective balance testing apparatus and methods could be used for remote assessment of balance abilities in the elderly, which has implications for the development of home-based mobility training programs.;2010;2
Purpose. The Facebook web site is an exceptionally fast-growing social networking site (SNS) containing membership groups with discussion boards on a wide variety of issues. This study uses content analysis to scrutinise postings on Facebook groups related to concussion and examine the purpose of these postings. Method. 472 Facebook groups related to concussion were screened by three researchers using a specifically developed coding scheme to examine demographic information and the purpose of the posting. In those cases where agreement was not obtained, post-analysis discussion allowed consensus to be reached. Results. From the 17 Facebook groups which met the inclusion criteria, 145 postings were included for analysis. The predominant demographic group which posted on the Facebook discussion boards were North American males. In the main part, individuals utilised the Facebook group to relate personal experiences of concussion (65%), although it was also used to seek (8%) or offer advice (2%). Supporting quotes were extracted. Conclusions. This study highlights the evolving nature of healthcare support in the twenty-first century and the rich information present relating to concussion on SNSs such as Facebook. Although the information being shared on these sites is important, the peer-to-peer interaction may be the key aspect of this health education medium.;2010;2
Purpose. To investigate the effect of different aspects and types of augmented feedback on motor functions and motor activities of the hemiparetic arm after stroke. Method. Systematic search of the scientific literature was performed in the Pubmed and Cochrane database from 1975 to March 2009. The augmented feedback used in the intervention was classified with respect to aspects (nature, timing and frequency) and types (auditory, sensory and visual). Results. The systematic literature search resulted in 299 citations. On the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 full-text articles were included for analysis. There are some trends in favour of providing augmented knowledge of performance feedback, augmented auditory and combined sensory and visual feedback. No consistent effects on motor relearning were observed for summary or faded, terminal or concurrent, solely visual or solely sensory augmented feedback. Conclusions. On the basis of this study, it was not possible to determine which combinations of aspects and types of augmented feedback are most essential for a beneficial effect on motor activities and motor functions of the hemiparetic arm after stroke. This was due to the combination of multiple aspects and types of augmented feedback in the included studies. This systematic review indicates that augmented feedback in general has an added value for stroke rehabilitation.;2010;2
"Purpose: Telehealth has the potential to improve children's access to speech-language pathology services. Validation of telehealth applications, including the assessment of childhood language disorders, is necessary for telehealth to become an accepted alternative mode of service provision. The aim of this study was to validate an Internet-based telehealth system for assessing childhood language disorders. Method: Twenty-five children ages 5 to 9 years were assessed using the core language subtests of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4th Edition (CELF-4; Semel, Wiig, & Secord, 2003). Each participant was simultaneously assessed online and face-to-face (FTF). Assessments were administered by either an online or an FTF speech-language pathologist (SLP), but were simultaneously rated by both SLPs. Results: No significant difference was found between the online and FTF total raw scores and scaled scores for each subtest. Weighted kappas revealed very good agreement on the individual items, total raw scores, scaled scores, core language score, and severity level. Intra-and interrater reliability were determined for a sample of online ratings, with intraclass correlation analysis revealing very good agreement on all measures. Conclusion: The results of this study support the validity and reliability of scoring the core language subtests of the CELF-4 via telehealth.";2010;2
"Stoykov ME, Stinear JW: Active-passive bilateral therapy as a priming mechanism for individuals in the subacute phase of post-stroke recovery: A feasibility study. Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2010;89:873-878. Objective: To assess the feasibility of treating inpatient stroke survivors with active-passive bilateral therapy as a motor priming technique before occupational therapy. Design: Single case series with two matched pairs in the subacute post-stroke rehabilitation phase. The test patients received active-passive bilateral therapy plus upper limb motor training. Control patients received only the motor training. Results: Both Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity scores and Action Research Arm Test scores improved in this small group of test and control patients. The magnitude of improvement was greater in test patients who received active-passive bilateral therapy plus unilateral training. Conclusions: We conclude that it is feasible and safe to administer active-passive bilateral therapy in a hospital setting.";2010;2
Telehealth assistive technologies for homes constitute a very promising avenue to decrease load on the health care system to reduce hospitalization period and to improve quality of life Teleoperated from a distant location a mobile robot can become a beneficial tool in health applications However design issues I elated to such systems are broad and mostly unexplored (e g locomotion and navigation in-home settings remote interaction and patient acceptability evaluation of clinical needs and their integration into health care information systems) Designing a safe and effective robotic system for in-home teleassistance requires taking into consideration the complexities of having novice users remotely navigate a mobile robot in a home environment while they interact with patients This paper presents the progress made by adopting an interdisciplinary and exploratory design methodology to develop a telepresence assistive mobile robot for homecare assistance of elderly people Preliminary studies using robots focus groups and interviews allowed us to derive preliminary specifications to design a new mobile robotic system named Telerobot Telerobot s locomotion mechanism provides improved mobility when moving on uneven surfaces helping to provide stable video feed to the user Its control system is implemented for safe teleoperation A study involving 10 rehabilitation professionals confirms that the system is usable in home Environments Analysis of teleoperation strategies used by novice teleoperators suggest that it is essential in a home environment that the teleoperation interface provides the user with a visual feedback of the objects surrounding the robot their distances relative to the robot and the size of the robot in the environment Enhanced user interfaces to augment the operator s perception of the environment were elaborated and tested in controlled conditions Based on the progress made so far the paper outlines issues that will be addressed in future work with the objective of coming up with a complete efficient and us dale in-home teleassistance mobile robotic system (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved;2010;2
"The aim of this study was to develop a system for and determine the feasibility of monitoring home exercise for physically inactive older adults using a Health Buddy (HB) text messaging device (Robert Bosch Healthcare; Palo Alto, California). Questions and messages related to exercise adherence are displayed on the HB screen and participants choose a response by pressing the corresponding button on the device. Responses are transmitted through a landline connection and high-risk responses are highlighted by the system for follow-up. We developed the questions and messages based on input from patient and clinician focus groups. We evaluated feasibility by administering the intervention to inpatient and outpatient adults aged 60 or older. We gave participants a choice of exercise monitoring by HB (n = 20) or telephone (n = 18). The results showed that home exercise monitoring by HB and telephone is safe, as evidenced by low adverse event rates. We saw a decline in exercise adherence rates to both the HB and telephone after 8 weeks, although adherence was better for HB than telephone. Taken together, the results demonstrate the feasibility of using text messaging to monitor home exercise adherence in physically inactive older adults.";2010;2
The availability of virtual environments on the Web is fostering new applications of virtual reality in several fields, including some therapeutical applications. We present an application of virtual reality applied to the tele-rehabilitation of patients with traumatic brain injury and stroke. Our system, based on X3D and Ajax3D technologies, enhances the possibility of making tele-rehabilitation exercises aimed at the recovery of the neurological disease. The system, called Nu!RehaVR, has been designed to integrate the activity carried out on a tele-rehabilitation system, Nu!Reha (Nu!Reha is a trademark of Pragma Engineering srl. See http://www.nureha.eu) desk, with the activities performed in the virtual worlds, through some rehabilitation exercises in contexts incompatible with the patients' impairments (not able to move or forced in static positions because of therapies, etc.). The architecture of Nu!RehaVR and the environments associated to two exercises, Utilising an elevator to reach a given floor and Crossing a road using a traffic light, are illustrated. These exercises can be considered as prototypes of a series of tele-rehabilitation exercises which help to stimulate the patients performing actions in relatively dangerous scenarios. The system is designed to allow the remote monitoring and assessment of the patient's activities by the medical staff at the hospital using the communication facilities of the tele-rehabilitation system.;2010;2
The convergence of game technology, the Internet, and rehabilitation science forms the second-generation virtual rehabilitation framework. This paper presents the first pilot study designed to look at the feasibility of at-home use of gaming technology adapted to address hand impairments in adolescents with hemiplegia due to perinatal stroke or intraventricular hemorrhage. Three participants trained at home for approximately 30 min/day, several days a week, for six to ten months. During therapy, they wore a Fifths Dimension Technologies Ultra sensing glove and played custom-developed Java 3D games on a modified PlayStation 3. The games were designed to accommodate the participants' limited range of motion, and to improve finger range and speed of motion. Trials took place in Indiana, while monitoFring/data storage took place at Rutgers Tele-Rehabilitation Institute ( New Jersey). Significant improvements in finger range of motion ( as measured by the sensing glove) were associated with self- and family-reported improvements in activities of daily living. In online subjective evaluations, participants indicated that they liked the system ease of use, clarity of instructions, and appropriate length of exercising. Other telerehabilitation studies are compared to this study and its technology challenges. Directions for future research are included.;2010;2
The objective of this study was to design a viable business model for commercially deploying a telerehabilitation service innovation in the R&D deployment phase In the paper the business model engineering approach used to conceptualize the deployment of this telerehabilitation service is described, analyzed and evaluated An iterative, multi-method and combined qualitative and quantitative action design approach was used for developing the business model and related value network of the telerehabilitation service. Insights from surveys, desk research, expert interviews, workshops and quantitative modeling were combined to engineer the business model and consequently refine it in three design cycles.;2010;2
The purpose is to show three technological innovations used in in-home telerehabilitation and results regarding the efficacy pilot studies. Telerehabilitation systems in enhanced by TERAS software, externals sensors and control of the camera. Based on our experience, residential Internet network is of sufficient quality to make in home teletreatment feasible. Innovative technologies improve teletreatment sessions. Telerehabilitation seems to be a practical alternative for home visits by a physiotherapist for dispensing rehabilitation services.;2010;2
The research in this paper presents a business model engineering approach for the introduction of telemedicine services. We use cost benefit analysis to allocate activities onto a value network. Traditional approaches use cost benefit analysis to build the business case in a much later phase of development. In the paper the business model engineering approach used to conceptualize the deployment of this telerehabilitation service is described, analyzed and evaluated. We demonstrate that the business model engineering approach leads to critical deployment insights that would otherwise be unknown or learned at a much later phase of the development process.;2010;2
The versatile and integrated system for telerehabilitation (VISYTER) is a software platform for developing various telerehabilitation applications. VISYTER has been designed to take into account the environments and requirements of rehabilitation services. The requirements considered in the platform design include minimal equipment beyond what is available in many rehabilitation settings, minimal maintenance, and ease of setup and operation. In addition, the platform has been designed to be able to adjust to different bandwidths, ranging from the very fast new generation of Internet to residential broadband connections. VISYTER is a secure integrated system that combines high-quality videoconferencing with access to electronic health records and other key tools in telerehabilitation such as stimuli presentation, remote multiple camera control, remote control of the display screen, and an eye contact teleprompter. The software platform is suitable for supporting low-volume services to homes, yet scalable to support high-volume enterprise-wide telehealth services. The VISYTER system has been used to develop a number of telerehabilitation applications, including a remote wheelchair prescription, adult autistic assessments, and international physical therapy teleconsultations. An evaluation of VISYTER for delivering a remote wheelchair prescription was conducted on 48 participants. Results of the evaluation indicate a high level of satisfaction from patients with the use of VISYTER. The versatility and cost-effectiveness of the platform has the potential for a wide range of telerehabilitation applications and potentially may lower the technical and economic barriers of telemedicine adoption.;2010;2
"This cross-sectional research design compares the efficiency of videoconferencing in distance communication for signing deaf persons with that of teletypewriter (TTY)-based telecommunication for the deaf. The efficiency of message transmission was evaluated among 30 signing deaf persons (18 to 65 years) under the six following experimental conditions: (a) Omnitor Allan eC software, (b) Polycom ViaVideo II software, (c) Microsoft Windows Live Messenger software, (d) the D-Link videophone, (e) TTY (written French), and (f) face to face (reference standard). Three timed intelligibility tests and a satisfaction assessment were carried out for each of the experimental conditions. Results showed that videoconferencing technologies offer a better efficacy/time ratio for communication than does TTY. Communication using videoconferencing technologies was very similar to face-to-face communication; this was also true for technologies that are not designed specifically for the deaf population. Equivalent satisfaction levels were observed between TTY and videoconferencing technologies. Microsoft Windows Live Messenger was less preferred due to image fluidity issues.";2010;2
"This paper aims at delivering a structured overview of telerehabilitation literature by analysing the entire set of articles under the search terms telerehabilitation or tele-rehabilitation to portray state of the art ten years after the publication of the first scientific article on the topic. A structured study has been conducted by considering all those articles containing the word telerehabilitation or telerehabilitation. Medline, Embase, Cochrane. UK Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health databases have been interrogated for articles between 1998 and 2008. 146 scientific articles were found. 56 articles focus on patient treatment, 23 are reviews, 3 are to be considered as both patient treatment papers and reviews,.53 are either technical reports, system descriptions or analyses of new approaches; 8 are general discussion on telerehabilitation. The present paper draw the scenario of the first ten years of telerehabilitation, focussing on clinical applications and technologies. Basically, it confirms the lack of comprehensive studies providing evidence for supporting decision and policy-makers in adopting telerehabilitation technologies in the clinical practice. An overall lack of standardisation in the used terminology also results from the analysis of keywords, which is typical of quite recent fields of application.";2010;2
This paper describes user testing of a technological system which enables stroke survivors to independently undertake rehabilitation exercises at home. The prototype is based on advanced movement sensors which are worn by the user when performing prescribed exercises. Sensor data are transmitted to a computer which displays the user's movements and progress. The number and type of sensors, methods of attaching them to the user's body in the correct locations, the type of computer screen and the input devices were changed and refined as the project progressed in response to feedback from people with stroke, their carers and physiotherapists. Home-based testing of the system highlighted usability issues concerned with the appropriateness and acceptability of the equipment in domestic settings, the sensors and methods of attachment, and use of, and interpretation of the screen presentation. Users required education as well as support throughout the testing period. Increasing sophistication of the technological aspects of the system over time resolved some usability issues but also created others, as did meeting the aims of improved clinical utility. The interplay between technology development, clinical utility and usability must be taken into account for devices to be successfully developed for practice.;2010;2
This paper presents a 6-DOF gait rehabilitation robot that allows patients to update their walking velocity on various terrain types and navigate in virtual environments (VEs) through upper and lower limb connections. This robot is composed of an upper limb device, a sliding device, two footpad devices, and a body support system. The footpad device on the sliding device generates 3-DOF spatial motions on the sagittal plane for each foot. This allows the generation of various terrain types for diverse walking training. The upper limb device allows users to swing their arms naturally through the use of a simple pendulum link with a passive prismatic joint. Synchronized gait patterns for this robot are designed to represent a normal gait with upper and lower limb connections. To permit patients to walk at will, this robot allows walking velocity updates for various terrain types by estimating the interaction torques between the human and the upper limb device, and synchronizing the lower limb device with the upper limb device. In addition, the patient is able to navigate in VEs by generating turning commands with switches located in the handles of the upper limb device. Experimental results using a healthy subject show that the user can update the walking velocity on level ground, slopes, and stairs through upper and lower limb connections. In addition, the user could navigate in the VEs with walking velocity updates and turning input command allowing various rehabilitation training modes. During a pilot clinical test, a hemiplegic patient could use the suggested gait rehabilitation robot with a slow walking speed. The rehabilitation plan was also suggested for the patient and the possible therapeutic effects of the suggested rehabilitation robot system are discussed.;2010;2
This paper reports results and implications of two related studies which investigated (a) access of residents and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) of rural Australia to information and communication technologies (ICT) and (b) their attitudes towards the use of ICT for delivery of speech-language pathology services. Both studies used mail out questionnaires, followed by interviews with a subset of those who completed the questionnaires. Data were obtained from 43 questionnaires from rural residents and 10 interviews with a subset of those residents, and from questionnaires returned by 49 SLPs and 4 interviews with a subset of those SLPs. Results show a mismatch between rural residents' and SLPs' access to and attitudes towards use of ICT for speech-language pathology service delivery. Rural residents had better access and more positive attitudes to the use of ICT for speech-language pathology service delivery than expected by SLPs. The results of this study have important implications for education and professional development of SLPs and for research into the use of ICT for telespeech-language pathology.;2010;2
Traditional upper-limb rehabilitation robots usually realize force feedback with force sensors or impedance controllers. Otherwise, assistant or resistant force required in different training modes is given by the robot, which does not motivate the initiative of patients sufficiently. This article introduces a self-controlled upper-limb rehabilitation robot to implement force sensing without a force sensor or an impedance controller. The system supports bimanual exercises in different training modes with one limb providing a proper force for the contralateral limb. The above characteristics and the capability of master-slave motion tracking with a kind of energy recycling were verified with preliminary experiments.;2010;2
We investigated the use of surface electromyography with biofeedback for telerehabilitation. The aim was to investigate the therapist's point of view, and the general acceptability of the system for the patient and for the therapist. The system allowed a therapist to modulate the rehabilitation protocol remotely, by changing the configuration variables, e.g. threshold and duration. The case study focused on a patient with arm impairment following a stroke. After two weeks of daily usage, there were some differences between the patient and the therapist about the ease of use of the equipment. However, there was general agreement about the usefulness of the system, ease of the performed tasks, appropriateness of the performed tasks and overall opinion. Wireless technology would reduce the complexity of the tasks required of the patient.;2010;2
Wheeled mobility and seating assessments for individuals with mobility impairments living in rural or distant locations are problematic due to the lack of expertise and available resources. The objective of this study was to measure satisfaction based on one's evaluation and prescription as well as comfort level when being evaluated by telerehabilitation (TR). Patient satisfaction data from real-time interactive TR clinical consultations between an expert practitioner located at least 125 miles away and four remote wheelchair clinics set up by the research team were collected and evaluated. The results revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between participants' pre- and postevaluation scores, t(39) = -13.92, p < .05, as well as pre- and postprescription scores, t(39) = -13.15, p < .05. In addition, all mean scores were significantly higher than the scale midpoint of 3.5 on a TR survey. The study's findings are consistent with those of previous telemedicine satisfaction studies. Overall, the results indicate a high level of patient satisfaction using TR.;2010;2
A telerehabilitation programme for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary lung disease has been developed. Aim: The aim of the paper is to explore how telerehabilitation technology influences cooperation and coordination between healthcare professionals in the Telekat network. Theory: Network theory has been applied. Methods: A triangulation of data collection techniques such as documentary materials, participant observations (n=163 hours), and qualitative interviews (n=24) has been used in a case study of the Telekat project. Findings: Telerehabilitation technologies influences cooperation and coordination between healthcare professionals in themes like: interdisciplinary decision making, mutual learning processes and new professional roles. Conclusion: A combination of telerehabilitation technologies is a facilitator for cooperation and coordination between healthcare professionals in a network.;2011;2
Ambulatory surgery continues to grow and is slowly becoming routine in the majority of cases. Although the development of ambulatory surgery in Germany appears to be somewhat delayed, this is actually a chance to learn from worldwide experiences and avoid the mistakes others made earlier. This article investigates current trends and developments in day case surgery and discusses the extended role and influence of the anesthetist in the perioperative setting.;2011;2
As life expectancy increases, so does the number of ambient assisted living (AAL) initiatives. These IT initiatives often traverse several research fields: from embed devices to multiple data streams analysis. Advanced processing and reasoning of such data streams poses a complex problem usually solved using local processing resources. This paper addresses this problem from a cloud computing perspective.;2011;2
Background and purpose: Reinforced feedback in virtual environment (RFVE) therapy is emerging as an innovative method in rehabilitation, which may be advantageous in the treatment of the affected arm after stroke. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of assisted motor training in a virtual environment for the treatment of the upper extremity (UE) after stroke compared to traditional neuromotor rehabilitation (TNR), studying also if differences exist related to the type of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic). Material and methods: Eighty patients affected by a stroke (48 ischaemic and 32 haemorrhagic) that occurred at least 1 year before were enrolled. The clinical assessment comprising the Fugl-Meyer UE (F-M UE), modified Ashworth (Bohannon & Smith) and Functional Independence Measure scale (FIM) was administered before and after the treatment. Results: A statistically significant difference between RFVE and TNR groups (Mann-Whitney U-test) was observed in the clinical outcomes of F-M UE and FIM (both p < 0.001), but not Ashworth (p = 0.053). The outcomes of F-M UE and FIM improved in the RFVE haemorrhagic group and in the TNR haemorrhagic group with a significant difference between groups (both p < 0.001), but not for Ashworth (p = 0.651). Comparing the RFVE ischaemic group to the TNR ischaemic group, statistically significant differences emerged in F-M UE (p < 0.001), FIM (p < 0.001), and Ashworth (p = 0.036). Conclusions: The RFVE therapy in combination with TNR showed better improvements compared to the TNR treatment only The RFVE therapy combined with the TNR treatment was more effective than the TNR double training, in both post-ischaemic and post-haemorrhagic groups. We observed improvements in both groups of patients: post-haemorrhagic and post-ischaemic stroke after RFVE training.;2011;2
Background: Telerehabilitation may be a feasible solution to the current problems faced by people with Parkinson's disease in accessing speech pathology services. Aim: To investigate the validity and reliability of online delivery of the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT (R)) for the speech and voice disorder associated with Parkinson's disease. Method & Procedures: Thirty-four participants with Parkinson's disease and mild-to-moderate hypokinetic dysarthria took part in the randomized controlled non-inferiority laboratory trial and received the LSVT (R) in either the online or the face-to-face environment. Online sessions were conducted via two personal computer-based videoconferencing systems with real-time and store-and-forward capabilities operating on a 128 kbit/s Internet connection. Participants were assessed pre- and post-treatment on acoustic measures of mean vocal sound pressure level, phonation time, maximum fundamental frequency range, and perceptual measures of voice, articulatory precision and speech intelligibility. Outcomes & Results: Non-inferiority of the online LSVT (R) modality was confirmed for the primary outcome measure of mean change in sound pressure level on a monologue task. Additionally, non-significant main effects for the LSVT (R) environment, dysarthria severity, and interaction effects were obtained for all outcomes measures. Significant improvements following the LSVT (R) were also noted on the majority of measures. The LSVT (R) was successfully delivered online, although some networking difficulties were encountered on a few occasions. High participant satisfaction was reported overall. Conclusions & Implications: Online treatment for hypokinetic dysarthria associated with Parkinson's disease appears to be clinically valid and reliable. Suggestions for future research are outlined.;2011;2
Background: Total knee arthroplasty is an effective means for relieving the symptoms associated with degenerative arthritis of the knee. Rehabilitation is a necessary adjunct to surgery and is important in regaining optimum function. Access to high-quality rehabilitation services is not always possible, especially for those who live in rural or remote areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the equivalence of an Internet-based telerehabilitation program compared with conventional outpatient physical therapy for patients who have had a total knee arthroplasty. Methods: This investigation was a single-blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial. Sixty-five participants were randomized to receive a six-week program of outpatient physical therapy either in the conventional manner or by means of an Internet-based telerehabilitation program. The primary outcome measure was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) measured at baseline and six weeks by a blinded independent assessor. Secondary outcomes included the Patient-Specific Functional Scale, the timed up-and-go test, pain intensity, knee flexion and extension, quadriceps muscle strength, limb girth measurements, and an assessment of gait. Noninferiority was assessed through the comparison of group differences with a noninferiority margin and with linear mixed model statistics. Results: Baseline characteristics between groups were similar, and all participants had significant improvement on all outcome measures with the intervention (p < 0.01 for all). After the six-week intervention, participants in the telerehabilitation group achieved outcomes comparable to those of the conventional rehabilitation group with regard to flexion and extension range of motion, muscle strength, limb girth, pain, timed up-and-go test, quality of life, and clinical gait and WOMAC scores. Better outcomes for the Patient-Specific Functional Scale and the stiffness subscale of the WOMAC were found in the telerehabilitation group (p < 0.05). The telerehabilitation intervention was well received by participants, who reported a high level of satisfaction with this novel technology. Conclusions: The outcomes achieved via telerehabilitation at six weeks following total knee arthroplasty were comparable with those after conventional rehabilitation.;2011;2
"Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CI therapy) has been shown to be an effective approach for improving arm function in stroke survivors with mild to severe hemiparesis. Given the time-intensive nature of the intervention, and the inherent costs and travel required to receive in-clinic treatment, the accessibility and availability of CI therapy is limited. To facilitate home-based CI therapy, a telerehabilitation platform has been developed. It consists of a table-top workstation configured with a range of physical task devices (e.g. pegboard, object flipping, threading, vertical reaching). A desktop PC is used to acquire data from sensors embedded in the task devices; display visual instructions, stimuli, and feedback to the patient during tasks; and provide videoconferencing and remote connection capabilities so the therapist can interact with and monitor the patient during at-home therapy sessions. This system has potential to greatly expand access to CI therapy and make it a more realistic option for a larger number of stroke survivors with upper extremity impairment.";2011;2
"Houlihan BV, Jette A, Paasche-Orlow M, Wierbicky J, Ducharme S, Zazula J, Cuevas P, Friedman RH, Williams S: A telerehabilitation intervention for persons with spinal cord dysfunction. Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2011;90:756-764. Pressure ulcers and depression are common preventable conditions secondary to a spinal cord dysfunction. However, few successful, low-cost preventive approaches have been identified. We have developed a dynamic automated telephone calling system, termed Care Call, to empower and motivate people with spinal cord dysfunction to improve their skin care, seek treatment for depression, and appropriately use the healthcare system. Herein, we describe the design and development of Care Call, its novel features, and promising preliminary results of our pilot testing. Voice quality testing showed that Care Call was able to understand all voice characteristics except very soft-spoken speech. Importantly, pilot study subjects felt Care Call could be particularly useful for people who are depressed, those with acute injury, and those without access to quality care. The results of a randomized controlled trial currently underway to evaluate Care Call will be available in 2011.";2011;2

"In this paper a novel electrically actuated parallel robot with three degrees-of-freedom (3 DOF) for dynamic postural studies is presented. The design has been described, the solution to the inverse kinematics has been found, and a numerical solution for the direct kinematics has been proposed. The workspace of the implemented robot is characterized by an angular range of motion of about +/- 10 degrees for roll and pitch when yaw is in the range +/- 15 degrees. The robot was constructed and the orientation accuracy was tested by means of an optoelectronic system and by imposing a sinusoidal input, with a frequency of 1 Hz and amplitude of 10 degrees, along the three axes, in sequence. The collected data indicated a phase delay of 1 degrees and an amplitude error of 0.5%-1.5%; similar values were observed for cross-axis sensitivity errors. We also conducted a clinical application on a group of normal subjects, who were standing in equilibrium on the robot base with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), which was rotated with a tri-axial sinusoidal trajectory with a frequency of 0.5 Hz and amplitude 5 degrees for roll and pitch and 10 degrees for the yaw. The postural configuration of the subjects was recorded with an optoelectronic system. However, due to the mainly technical nature of this paper, only initial validation outcomes are reported here. The clinical application showed that only the tilt and displacement on the sagittal pane of head, trunk, and pelvis in the trials conducted with eyes closed were affected by drift and that the reduction of the yaw rotation and of the mediolateral translation was not a controlled parameter, as happened, instead, for the other anatomical directions.";2011;2
In this work, an evaluation and assistance platform for people with disabilities is presented. This platform allows the control of different systems (PC games, robot, electric wheelchair) using different interfaces (mouse, joystick, etc.). The software facilitates the saving of experimental data for analysis, it can be automatically reconfigured to match user's ability, and it is operated locally or remotely through the internet. Quantitative indicators are defined for evaluation purposes and to determine the needed assistance and adaptation. The system is tested and results are presented and discussed.;2011;2
Mobile robots designed to enhance telepresence in the support of telehealth services are being considered for numerous applications. TELEROBOT is a teleoperated mobile robotic platform equipped with videoconferencingcapabilities and designed to be used in a home environment to. In this study, learnability of the system's teleoperation interface and controls was evaluated with ten rehabilitation professionals during four training sessions in a laboratory environment and in an unknown home environment while performing the execution of a standardized evaluation protocol typically used in home care. Results show that the novice teleoperators' performances on two of the four metrics used (number of command and total time) improved significantly across training sessions (ANOVAS, p<0.05) and that performance in these metrics in the last training session reflected teleoperation abilities seen in the unknown home environment during navigation tasks (r=0,77 and 0,60). With only 4 hours of training, rehabilitation professionals were able learn to teleoperate successfully TELEROBOT. However teleoperation performances remained significantly less efficient then those of an expert. Under the home task condition (navigating the home environment from one point to the other as fast as possible) this translated to completion time between 350 seconds (best performance) and 850 seconds (worse performance). Improvements in other usability aspects of the system will be needed to meet the requirements of in-home telerehabilitation.;2011;2
Motor deficits in the growing population of stroke survivors continue to strain global healthcare capacities. The use of telerehabilitation to address this need has been discussed for over a decade without a clear consensus on development strategy or a clear market success. In this paper, the cyclic and iterative phases of the Planning, Execution, Assessment (PLEXAS) rehabilitation cycle are discussed, and the potential roles of an integrated telerehabilitation platform within this cycle are presented. Some preliminary work on a multicenter project called TeleREHA is presented along with relevant clinical insight and discussion.;2011;2
Nationwide network of auditory telerehabilitation centers was introduced into clinical practice in 2009. It consist of 19 policlinics cooperating with Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing, using state-of-the-art telemedical equipment and methodology, including telefitting. The model of extensive use of teleconsultations performed by experienced specialists from implantation centre to patient in cooperating policlinic proved to be reliable alternative to standard models of postoperative care, additionally providing substantial savings in time, cost and effort for the patient;2011;2
"Objective: Dysphagia (a swallowing disorder) is known to occur in numerous clinical populations, but unfortunately because of issues accessing speech pathology services, not all patients are able to receive dysphagia intervention and rehabilitation services in a timely manner. Existing research supports the use of telehealth technology for providing various aspects of speech pathology service; however, to date there is limited evidence to support the utilization of telerehabilitation in the assessment and management of dysphagia. The aim of this research was to provide pilot information on the basic feasibility and validity of conducting dysphagia assessments via telerehabilitation. Materials and Methods: Ten simulated patients, actors portraying patients with a range of swallowing difficulties, were used rather than actual patients to minimize any potential patient risk from unidentified aspiration. Dysphagia was assessed simultaneously by a face-to-face (FTF) and telerehabilitation speech pathologist (T-SP). Each simulated patient was assessed using a Clinical Swallowing Examination (CSE) protocol that was modified to suit a telerehabilitation environment. The CSE was administered with the support of an assistant via an Internet-based videoconferencing telerehabilitation system using a bandwidth of 128 kilobits per second. Results: Results revealed high to excellent levels of agreement between the T-SP and the FTF-SP across all parameters of the CSE. Agreement for aspiration risk was excellent. Conclusion: The pilot data indicate that the current model of administering a CSE via telerehabilitation has potential to be a feasible and valid method for the remote assessment of swallowing disorders.";2011;2
Objective: No studies have addressed the use of electronic personal health records (e-PHRs) for self-management in complex neurological disorders. We assessed and tested an Internet-based self-management system that utilized the e-PHR and determined its impact on self-assessed well-being, clinician-assessed well-being, and healthcare utilization in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and Methods: Subjects were randomized to usual care (a secure Web-based messaging system) or active intervention, which included secure messaging, self-monitoring, self-management of MS symptoms, and communication about upcoming clinic visits. Computers and Internet access were provided. Subjects were included if they had MS, lived within the county or region surrounding our MS center, had at least two appointments at our center in the previous 12 months, and demonstrated basic typing and computer skills. Study duration was 12 months. Results: Of 220 subjects completing informed consent, 206 met the inclusion criteria. At the study's end, 83 subjects remained in the usual care group and 84 in the enhanced care group. Both groups used the available system components. The groups did not significantly differ on the primary endpoints or healthcare utilization. Conclusions: Self-management support is an emerging aspect of chronic care management. We established the feasibility of conducting a randomized, controlled trial using e-PHRs for patient self-management. We did not find that e-PHR-enabled self-management augmented multidisciplinary MS center-based care, possibly because the differences between interventions were not great enough.;2011;2
Objective: The purpose of this randomized control trial study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital video disc (DVD)-based seated dual-task (DT) stepping exercise to improve the DT walking capability in elderly people. In the DT exercise, participants were asked to perform a verbal fluency task while stepping as quickly as possible. Methods: Eight clusters (n = 93) randomized into a DVD group (4 clusters, n = 48) and a nonexercise control group (4 clusters, n = 45) participated in this trial. In the DVD group, participants received 20 min of group training twice a week for 24 weeks. The exercise class used an exercise DVD that included a 15-min basic exercise and a 5-min DT exercise. No exercise program was prescribed for the control group. The measurements were based on the difference in physical function, including DT walking, between the DVD and control groups. In the DT walking test, participants walked individually at a comfortable speed while carrying a ball on a tray. The relative DT lag was calculated by using simple walking as the comparison condition. The Timed Up and Go test and the 5-chair stand test were also performed. Results: The median relative adherence to the study was 87.5% (25th-75th percentile, 83.3%-95.8%) in the DVD group. The outcome measurements, including the DT walking time and DT time lag (p < 0.05), among participants in the DVD group were significantly improved. However, other outcome measurements were not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The current study reports the effectiveness of a DVD-based exercise for the improvement of the DT walking capability. A larger study is needed to confirm the present results. Study of a Web-based exercise regime would be valuable to identify the most effective exercise for prevention of falls and fall-related fractures.;2011;2
Objective: This pilot study trialled an in-home videoconferencing system to determine the feasibility of delivering rehabilitation services remotely to aged clients. Methods: Patients approved for community-based transition care were prospectively recruited to trial the eHAB (TM) videoconferencing system. Staff completed patient logs to record reasons for patient exclusion/inclusion. A staff satisfaction survey recorded qualitative feedback oil the operation of eHAB (TM). Results: Of 44 patients admitted to transition care, 34(77%) were considered unsuitable for telerehabilitation,due mainly to hearing and/or vision impairment, client/carer anxiety, lack of space in the home, and cognitive impairment. Three proceeded with et-up and use of eHAB (TM). Staff reported that telerehabilitation was particularly challenging because of the complexity of cases, with many requiring hands-on therapy. Conclusion: To implement telerehabilitation more widely in older people there are barriers to be overcome relating to patient limitations, staff issues and the logistics of the system.;2011;2
Objective: We measured the satisfaction of both patients and healthcare professionals with the technologies and services provided during in-home telerehabilitation as an alternative to conventional rehabilitation after discharge from total knee arthroplasty surgery. Methods: This study was embedded in a larger controlled trial where 48 community-living older adults who received total knee arthroplasty were recruited prior to discharge from acute care following surgery and randomly assigned to treatment arms (Tele and Comparison). The participants' satisfaction with the services was assessed at the end of the intervention for both groups using the Healthcare Satisfaction Questionnaire. For the Tele group, the patients' perception of in-home telehealth was assessed before treatment and after completion of teletreatments. The satisfaction of the healthcare professionals with the technology during the telerehabilitation services was noted at the end of each treatment session using a technical quality subjective appreciation questionnaire. Results: Both groups of patients (Tele and Comparison) were satisfied with the services received and no significant difference was observed between them. Moreover, the physiotherapists' satisfaction with regard to goal achievement, patient-therapist relationship, overall session satisfaction, and quality and performance of the technological platform was high. Conclusions: As patient satisfaction is important in maintaining motivation and treatment compliance and the satisfaction of healthcare professionals must be high in order for new treatments to become mainstream in clinics, the results show that in-home telerehabilitation seems to be a promising alternative to traditional face-to-face treatments.;2011;2
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of a novel shoe-based sensor that uses accelerometers, pressure sensors, and pattern recognition with a support vector machine (SVM) to accurately identify sitting, standing, and walking postures in people with stroke. Methods: Subjects with stroke wore the shoe-based sensor while randomly assuming 3 main postures: sitting, standing, and walking. A SVM classifier was used to train and validate the data to develop individual and group models, which were tested for accuracy, recall, and precision. Results: Eight subjects participated. Both individual and group models were able to accurately identify the different postures (99.1% to 100% individual models and 76.9% to 100% group models). Recall and precision were also high for both individual (0.99 to 1.00) and group (0.82 to 0.99) models. Conclusions: The unique combination of accelerometer and pressure sensors built into the shoe was able to accurately identify postures. This shoe sensor could be used to provide accurate information on community performance of activities in people with stroke as well as provide behavioral enhancing feedback as part of a telerehabilitation intervention.;2011;2
Rehabilitation interventions for the hand have shown benefits for children with Hemiplegia due to cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injury. Longer interventions are facilitated if training is provided in the patient's home, due to easier access to care and reduced impact on school or work activities. Providing remote rehabilitation over lengthy periods of time has however its own challenges. This paper presents two pediatric patients with hemiplegia, who practiced virtual hand rehabilitation games using a modified PlayStation 3 and 5DT sensing gloves. Despite severe initial hand spasticity, and occasional technology shortcomings, the subjects practiced for about 14 months, and 6 months, respectively. Game performance data for the second patient is presented. Followup evaluations 14 months from the removal of the PlayStation 3 from the home of the child with cerebral palsy showed that the patient had good retention in terms of grasp strength, hand function and bone health. Challenges of long-term home tele-rehabilitation are also discussed.;2011;2
Stroke survivors with hemiparesis and spinal cord injury (SCI) survivors with tetraplegia find it difficult or impossible to perform many activities of daily life. There is growing evidence that intensive exercise therapy, especially when supplemented with functional electrical stimulation (FES), can improve upper extremity function, but delivering the treatment can be costly, particularly after recipients leave rehabilitation facilities. Recently, there has been a growing level of interest among researchers and healthcare policymakers to deliver upper extremity treatments to people in their homes using in-home teletherapy (IHT). The few studies that have been carried out so far have encountered a variety of logistical and technical problems, not least the difficulty of conducting properly controlled and blinded protocols that satisfy the requirements of high-level evidence-based research. In most cases, the equipment and communications technology were not designed for individuals with upper extremity disability. It is clear that exercise therapy combined with interventions such as FES, supervised over the Internet, will soon be adopted worldwide in one form or another. Therefore it is timely that researchers, clinicians, and healthcare planners interested in assessing IHT be aware of the pros and cons of the new technology and the factors involved in designing appropriate studies of it. It is crucial to understand the technical barriers, the role of telesupervisors, the motor improvements that participants can reasonably expect and the process of optimizing IHT-exercise therapy protocols to maximize the benefits of the emerging technology.;2011;2
Telehealth or telepractice can alleviate shortages of speech-language pathologists, particularly in rural and underserved areas, where specialists in voice and swallowing disorders may not be available. In addition to improving access to services, telehealth offers the opportunity for patients to receive care in their natural environment, as in the case of home health care where treatment can include family members and caregivers. This article presents an overview of telehealth applications in the remote management of voice and swallowing disorders including historical background, current issues, and a brief review of clinical effectiveness studies.;2011;2
Telehealth Test Bed-Quality of Life Studies is a research study investigating, testing, evaluating, and demonstrating technologies that have the potential to improve the quality of life for target populations, such as warriors in transition, veterans, individuals with physical and mental disabilities, and adults age 65 and older, who may require assistive technology devices to aid in maintaining or improving their quality of life. Thousands of soldiers who fought in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom have been wounded in action or have sustained injuries from noncombat accidents. Many of these injuries affecting military populations, as well as the general public, have resulted in amputations, traumatic brain injuries, and other physical or mental impairments. Depending on the severity of the injury, assistive technologies may be temporarily needed, or as a long-term solution, to regain and maintain normal daily functions. Saint Francis University's Center of Excellence for Remote and Medically Under-Served Areas developed an evaluation matrix comparing assistive technologies to identify devices that will improve or maintain the quality of life for these target populations. The integration of telehealth and telerehabilitation applications into patients' daily lives was examined to help improve home rehabilitation via access to healthcare specialties in rural and medically underserved settings. Researchers identified and tested assistive technology devices to be included in a self-sufficient living environment. The continuation of this research involves recruiting individuals to test and evaluate the functions of these commercially available technologies and to complete data collection surveys and questionnaires. The results are useful in selecting devices that will enhance or extend the quality of life of the target populations.;2011;2
"Telemedicine offers an innovative approach to increase access to rehabilitation medicine services for patients who live in areas where physiatrists are scarce or absent. This article reviews the current status of telerehabilitation services delivered through real-time videoconferencing to provide support, assessment, and interventions to individuals with impairments or disabilities. A literature review demonstrates various uses of telerehabilitation by physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language pathologists, audiologists, recreational therapists, neuropsychologists, nurses, other physician specialists, and physiatrists. We also provide more in-depth examples of 2 current programs that involve physiatrists: One furnishes telerehabilitation services to adult stroke survivors, and the other addresses the special health care needs of children with developmental disabilities. We discuss the benefits of using telemedicine via real-time videoconferencing to care for individuals with disabilities, outline the challenges of successfully implementing a physiatric telerehabilitation program, and finish with a list of potential applications for physiatrists interested in incorporating telemedicine into their practice. Further investigation of the use of telehealth technologies to deliver physiatric services, care coordination, and education is needed. We recommend that our professional societies develop and publish guidelines to facilitate development and use of telerehabilitation technologies to increase access to physiatric services.

The paper introduces the structure of telerehabilitation robot system based on network. The detailed design and implementation of the established experimental system is presented, which included the design and the implementation of hardware and software and the settings of the program work and the experiments. The experimental results of the telerehabilitation robot system are shown, which demonstrated the feasibility of the application of teleoperation for rehabilitation robot.;2011;2
This paper presents a personal system and software architecture dedicated for cardiac telerehabilitation. The key idea of the hardware configuration and the software implementation is the integration of a mobile device and an ECG recorder with the application of wireless technologies: Bluetooth, GPS and GPRS. The main goal of the system is the reliable detection of the QRS complex providing a cardiovascular activity information to a cardiac telerehabilitation program. The prototype of the system allows the physician to construct a multistage training program, which can be divided into few levels. At each stage the supervising physician can customize parameters as: duration, speed, maximal and minimal heart rate. Additionally, a simple threshold-based alarm system has been implemented. The application of such monitors can reduce the costs and make the rehabilitation efficient, easier and allow an ubiquitous access.;2011;2
This paper presents a telerehabilitation system that encompasses a webcam and store-and-feedforward adaptive gaming system for tracking finger-hand movement of patients during local and remote therapy sessions. Gaming-event signals and webcam images are recorded as part of a gaming session and then forwarded to an online healthcare content management system (CMS) that separates incoming information into individual patient records. The CMS makes it possible for clinicians to log in remotely and review gathered data using online reports that are provided to help with signal and image analysis using various numerical measures and plotting functions. Signals from a 6 degree-of-freedom magnetic motion tracking system provide a basis for video-game sprite control. The MMT provides a path for motion signals between common objects manipulated by a patient and a computer game. During a therapy session, a webcam that captures images of the hand together with a number of performance metrics provides insight into the quality, efficiency, and skill of a patient.;2011;2
This paper presents Play for Health platform for the rehabilitation of patients suffering from various diseases developed by iBit Foundation and Son Llatzer Hospital. The platform is basically formed by a management module intended for clinical therapies of telerehabilitation and an unlimited number of games that can be combined with different methods of interaction. Users interact with the computer in different ways according to their needs. These games provide an incentive for patients and promote the realization of the exercises planned by the medical staff in a fun, easy and intuitive way. Furthermore, this system is applicable to other fields such as education and social care.;2011;2
This study explored the interrater reliability between a generalist practitioner administering the Functioning Everyday with a Wheelchair-Capacity (FEW-C) in person (IP) and a remote expert practitioner observing via telerehabilitation (TR) from more than 100 miles away. Each of the 46 participants was simultaneously rated by both the IP and TR practitioner, who were masked to each other's results. The 1P-TR raters demonstrated excellent interrater reliability, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.91 for the total FEW-C and 0.96, 0.88, and 0.90 for the constructs of independence, safety, and quality, respectively. Internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) was 0.94 for the total FEW-C tool and 0.91, 0.83, and 0.82 for independence, safety, and quality, respectively, indicating good internal consistency without redundancy. Using TR and the FEW-C, an expert practitioner more than 100 miles away was able to accurately assess the functional mobility needs of clients being assessed for new wheeled mobility devices.;2011;2
User preferences need to be taken into account in order to be able to design devices that will gain acceptance both in a clinical and home setting. Sensor systems become redundant if patients or clinicians do not want to work with them. The aim of this systematic review was to determine both patients' and clinicians' preferences for non-invasive body-worn sensor systems. A search for relevant articles and conference proceedings was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents Connect, and EEEI explore. In total 843 papers were identified of which only 11 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion. A range of different clinically relevant user groups were included. The key user preferences were that a body-worn sensor system should be compact, embedded and simple to operate and maintain. It also should not affect daily behavior nor seek to directly replace a health care professional. It became apparent that despite the importance of user preferences, they are rarely considered and as such there is a lack of high-quality studies in this area. We therefore would like to encourage researchers to focus on the implications of user preferences when designing wearable sensor systems.;2011;2
Virtual reality videogames can be used to motivate rehabilitation, and telerehabilitation can be used to improve access to rehabilitation. These uses of technology to improve health outcomes are a burgeoning area of rehabilitation research. So far, there is a lack of reports of long-term outcomes of these types of interventions. The authors report a 15-year-old boy with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and epilepsy because of presumed perinatal stroke who improved his plegic hand function and increased his plegic forearm bone health during a 14-month virtual reality videogame hand telerehabilitation intervention. A total of 14 months after the intervention ended, repeat evaluation demonstrated maintenance of both increased hand function and forearm bone health. The implications of this work for the future of rehabilitation in children with neurological disabilities are discussed in this article.;2011;2
We compared the activity estimated by a pedometer and an accelerometer in coronary artery disease patients included in a phase III cardiac rehabilitation programme. Nine patients were divided into two groups and wore the pedometer for four weeks, and then subsequently the accelerometer for four weeks, or vice versa. The recorded daily exercise level (total daily steps and calories burned) was measured for each patient and compared with oxygen uptake and ventilatory threshold measured by ergospirometry at the end of the study. There was a significant correlation between the calories measured by the accelerometer and the ventilatory threshold (i.e. the sub-maximal capacity), r = 0.75 (P = 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the measured steps on the accelerometer and the ventilatory threshold, r = 0.72 (P = 0.07). There were no significant correlations for the pedometer. A questionnaire concerning ease of use of the sensors indicated that the cardiac patients favoured the pedometer.;2011;2
We compared the effectiveness of home telerehabilitation with conventional rehabilitation following knee replacement surgery (total knee arthroplasty, TKA). Forty-eight patients (mean age 66 years) who received TKA were recruited prior to discharge from hospital after surgery and were randomly assigned to telerehabilitation or usual care. Telerehabilitation sessions (16 per participant over two months) were conducted by trained physiotherapists using videoconferencing to the patient's home via an Internet connection (512 kbit/s upload speed). Disability and function were measured using standardized outcome measures in face-to-face evaluations at three times (prior to and at the end of treatment, and four months after the end of treatment). Clinical outcomes improved significantly for all subjects in both groups between endpoints. Some variables showed larger improvements in the usual care group two months post-discharge from therapy than in the telerehabilitation group. Home telerehabilitation is at least as effective as usual care, and has the potential to increase access to therapy in areas with high speed Internet services.;2011;2
We conducted a systematic review of literature relating to videoconferencing in therapeutic interventions for chronic conditions. Two hundred articles were reviewed in detail, 35 of which were relevant to the study. Of these, eight were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the remainder were service evaluations, pilot studies and case studies. Two major themes emerged, relating specifically to videoconferencing: clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. There were 14 studies which measured clinical outcomes of interventions for chronic conditions delivered by videoconferencing. A range of evidence, including four RCTs of high quality, indicates that interventions for a variety of conditions, including psychological and physical, delivered by videoconferencing produce similar outcomes to treatment delivered in-person. Evidence suggests that levels of patient satisfaction with telerehabilitation are high and that the formation of a good therapeutic alliance is possible. Several papers reported that clinical staff showed lower levels of satisfaction in using telerehabilitation than patients. It is feasible to use videoconferencing as a means of delivering therapeutic interventions for people with chronic conditions in rural communities.;2011;2
We conducted a systematic review of telerehabilitation interventions in stroke care. The following databases were searched: Medline, Embase, DARE-NHSEED-HTA (INAHTA) and the Cochrane Library. Nine studies, all published after 2000, were included in the review. A wide variety of telemedicine interventions in post-stroke rehabilitation care was identified. Four studies had been carried out in the USA, two in the Netherlands, two in Italy and one in China. There were four randomized controlled trials and one qualitative analysis. Four studies used an observational study design/case series. Home-based telerehabilitation interventions showed promising results in improving the health of stroke patients and in supporting caregivers. Telemedicine systems based on a virtual environment for upper extremity exercise can improve the physical health of stroke patients. Health professionals and participants reported high levels of satisfaction and acceptance of telerehabilitation interventions. There was no evidence regarding the effects on resource utilization or cost-effectiveness. Most studies showed promising results, although overall, the quality of the evidence on telerehabilitation in post-stroke care was low.;2011;2
We examined the efficacy of a remotely based occupational therapy intervention. A 40-year-old woman who suffered a stroke participated in a telerehabilitation program. The intervention method is based on virtual reality gaming to enhance the training experience and to facilitate the relearning processes. The results indicate that Virtual TeleRehab is an effective method for motivational, economical, and practical reasons by combining game-based rehabilitation in the home with weekly distance meetings.;2011;2
"We investigated the experience of ten patients who received video-based physiotherapy at home for two months after a shoulder joint replacement. Videoconferencing took place via the patient's home broadband connection at a bandwidth of 256-768 kbit/s. Qualitative interviews were carried out, transcribed and analysed. Through qualitative content analysis six categories were identified: (1) a different reinforced communication; (2) pain-free exercising as an effective routine; (3) from a dependent patient to a strengthened person at home; (4) closeness at a distance; (5) facilitated daily living; and (6) continuous physiotherapy chain. The access to bodily knowledge, continuity, collaboration and being at home were all aspects that contributed to the patients' recovery. The patients described experiences of safety, and strengthening during their daily exercise routine at home. The frequent interplay with the patient during telerehabilitation made it possible for the physiotherapist to make an individual judgement about each patient; this could be one reason for the positive findings. Home video-based physiotherapy may be useful in other kinds of physiotherapy.";2011;2
We present work in progress on a tele-immersion system for tele-rehabilitation using real-time stereo vision and virtual environments. Stereo reconstruction is used to capture user's 3D avatar in real time and project it into a shared virtual environment, enabling a patient and therapist to interact remotely. Captured data can also be used to analyze the movement and provide feedback to the patient as we present in a preliminary study of stepping-in-place task. Such tele-presence system could in the future allow patients to interact remotely with remote physical therapist and virtual environment while objectively tracking their performance.;2011;2
We systematically reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation (TR) applications. The review included reports on rehabilitation for any disability, other than mental health conditions, and drug or alcohol addiction. All forms of telecommunications technology for TR and all types of study design were considered. Study quality was assessed using an approach that considered both study performance and study design. Judgements were made on whether each TR application had been successful, whether reported outcomes were clinically significant, and whether further data were needed to establish the application as suitable for routine use. Sixty-one scientifically credible studies that reported patient outcomes or administrative changes were identified through computerized literature searches on five databases. Twelve clinical categories were covered by the studies. Those dealing with cardiac or neurological rehabilitation were the most numerous. Thirty-one of the studies (51%) were of high or good quality. Study results showed that 71% of the TR applications were successful, 18% were unsuccessful and for 11% the status was unclear. The reported outcomes for 51% of the applications appeared to be clinically significant. Poorer-quality studies tended to have worse outcomes than those from high- or good-quality studies. We judged that further study was required for 62% of the TR applications and desirable for 23%. TR shows promise in many fields, but compelling evidence of benefit and of impact on routine rehabilitation programmes is still limited. There is a need for more detailed, better-quality studies and for studies on the use of TR in routine care.;2011;2
A new era in speech-language pathology practice is pending, and one that impels us to innovate and diversify as we move forward into the 21st century. The impetus for this transformation will include the increasing cost and demand for healthcare services as the population ages, changes in Australian society, rapid developments in technology, and major advances in neuroscience. New models of service delivery will need to be considered in line with evidence-based treatment protocols, the concept of a continuum of care for chronic disorders, and the need to engage clients in self-management. Innovations in technology will provide the means by which these new models of service delivery might be achieved. The exponential increase in electronic therapy resources and devices will transform the therapeutic process and provide clinicians with engaging and flexible therapy options. Clinicians will be challenged by this paradigm shift in service delivery, and their long-held perceptions of their clients' capacity to respond to these changes. Other challenges will include the preparation of future speech-language pathologists, reimbursement for services, availability of appropriate technology, and widespread connectivity. The future of the profession is an exciting one as we move forward into an era of unprecedented change.;2012;2
A significant number of studies show the positive effects clinical rehabilitation programs have on improving patients' health. However, these studies also, often mention that these health benefits decrease if a post-therapeutic regimen is not integrated into a patients' daily routine. Existing barriers such as travel times to sports facilities, irregular working times, caring for family members or a simple lack of desire are reasons why good intentions quickly fade and the aftercare recommendations are not put into practice. The necessary changes in behaviour and in the mind set of a patient that are reached during the clinical rehabilitation process often disappear. The motivation to continue the rehabilitation program at home is low, even if further therapy is necessary for the stabilization of the patients' health. In this paper we describe the need for innovative rehabilitation technologies for home environments after a clinical rehabilitation phase. First we introduce the therapeutic applications like cardiovascular training, fall prevention and stroke rehabilitation as well as the corresponding options for interactive multimedia training devices. After that we describe the stakeholder and system requirements for new prevention and rehabilitation technologies. We give an overview over current projects and ambient technologies enabling health prevention and home rehabilitation. At the end of the paper we argue that these technologies should be integrated into the health systems.;2012;2
"According to the present guidelines for heart failure patients, regular exercise training has obtained the class of recommendation I, level of evidence A. Despite the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation, many heart failure patients are inactive. Common patient's rejection of existing forms of rehabilitation and limitations resulting from the disease itself hinder the outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. That is why home telerehabilitation seems to be the optimal form of physical activity for heart failure patients. (Cardiol J 2012; 19, 3: 243-248)";2012;2
Ankle deficiencies occur quite often among poststroke patients and people working in physically demanding professions in general. Computerized telerehabilitation systems have emerged as promising assistive tools for effective diagnosis and rehabilitation interventions. Consequently, the process of recording and analyzing the medical data captured by such systems has become vital for the generation of efficient reports that can assist clinicians to assess their patient's health. In this paper, we present our telerehabilitation system called Tele-Wobble that consists of a modified version of a wobble board mounted with sensors and actuators, a software training game, and a web-service architecture that allows for remote monitoring of the patient's training progress. The system aims to provide clinicians with key performance measurements captured during the patient's training session. Our evaluations showed that Tele-Wobble may offer an efficient and cost-effective home-based rehabilitation for patients with ankle deficiencies.;2012;2
"Background and Purpose. This case report describes the clinical reasoning process used to examine a person after stroke and intervene with a novel integrated motor imagery treatment designed for the rehabilitation of walking and delivered in the home through telerehabilitation. The integrated motor imagery treatment consisted of patient-centered goal setting and physical practice combined with motor and motivational imagery. Case Description. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who had had a diffuse left subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke 10 years earlier. She lived independently in an assisted living complex and carried a straight cane during long walks or in unfamiliar environments. Examination revealed a slow gait speed, reduced walking endurance, and decreased balance confidence. Although she was in the chronic phase, patient-centered integrated motor imagery was predicted to improve her community mobility. Treatment sessions of 45 to 60 minutes were held 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The practiced tasks included transitioning from sitting to standing, obstacle clearance, and navigation in interior and exterior environments; these tasks were first executed and then imagined at ratios of 1:5. Task execution allowed the creation of a scene based on movement observation. Imagery scenarios were customized to address the patient's goals and observed movement problems. Motivational elements of arousal, problem solving, and reward were embedded in the imagery scenarios. Half of the sessions were provided on site, and the remaining sessions were delivered remotely. Seven sessions were delivered by the clinician in the home, and 5 sessions were delivered using telerehabilitation. Outcomes. Improvements in motor imagery ability, gait parameters, and balance were observed after training. Most gains were retained at the 3-month follow-up. Compared with on-site delivery, the telerehabilitation sessions resulted in less therapist travel time and cost, as well as shorter therapy sessions. Discussion. The delivery of integrated motor imagery practice for walking recovery was feasible both on site and remotely.";2012;2
"Background and Purpose-To determine the effect of a multifaceted stroke telerehabilitation (STeleR) intervention on physical function, and secondarily on disability, in veterans poststroke. Methods-We conducted a prospective, randomized, multisite, single-blinded trial in 52 veterans with stroke from 3 Veterans Affairs medical centers. Veterans with a stroke in the preceding 24 months were randomized to the STeleR intervention or usual care. The STeleR intervention consisted of 3 home visits, 5 telephone calls, and an in-home messaging device provided over 3 months to instruct patients in functionally based exercises and adaptive strategies. Usual care participants received routine rehabilitation care as prescribed by their physicians. The primary outcome measures were improvement in function at 6 months, measured by both the motor subscale of the Telephone Version of Functional Independence Measure and by the function scales of the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument. Results-The 2 complementary primary outcomes (Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument Function and Telephone Version of Functional Independence Measure) improved at 6 months for the STeleR group and declined for the usual care group, but the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.25, Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument; P = 0.316). Several of secondary outcomes were statistically significant. At 6 months, compared with the usual care group, the STeleR group showed statistically significant improvements in 4 of the 5 Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument disability component subscales (P < 0.05), and approached significance in 1 of the 3 Function component subscales (P = 0.06). Conclusions-The STeleR intervention significantly improved physical function, with improvements persisting up to 3 months after completing the intervention. STeleR could be a useful supplement to traditional poststroke rehabilitation given the limited resources available for in-home rehabilitation for stroke survivors.";2012;2
Background. Telerehabilitation allows rehabilitative training to continue remotely after discharge from acute care and can include complex tasks known to create rich conditions for neural change. Objectives. The purposes of this study were: (1) to explore the feasibility of using telerehabilitation to improve ankle dorsiflexion during the swing phase of gait in people with stroke and (2) to compare complex versus simple movements of the ankle in promoting behavioral change and brain reorganization. Design. This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial. Setting. Training was done in the participant's home. Testing was done in separate research labs involving functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multi-camera gait analysis. Patients. Sixteen participants with chronic stroke and impaired ankle dorsiflexion were assigned randomly to receive 4 weeks of telerehabilitation of the paretic ankle. Intervention. Participants received either computerized complex movement training (track group) or simple movement training (move group). Measurements. Behavioral changes were measured with the 10-m walk test and gait analysis using a motion capture system. Brain reorganization was measured with ankle tracking during MM. Results. Dorsiflexion during gait was significantly larger in the track group compared with the move group. For fMRI, although the volume, percent volume, and intensity of cortical activation failed to show significant changes, the frequency count of the number of participants showing an increase versus a decrease in these values from pretest to posttest measurements was significantly different between the 2 groups, with the track group decreasing and the move group increasing. Limitations. Limitations of this study were that no follow-up test was conducted and that a small sample size was used. Conclusions. The results suggest that telerehabilitation, emphasizing complex task training with the paretic limb, is feasible and can be effective in promoting further dorsiflexion in people with chronic stroke.;2012;2
"Background: Hallux valgus (HV) is a very common deformity of the first metatarsophalangeal joint that often requires surgical correction. However, the association between structural HV deformity and related foot pain and disability is unclear. Furthermore, no previous studies have investigated concerns about appearance and difficulty with footwear in a population with HV not seeking surgical correction. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate foot pain, functional limitation, concern about appearance and difficulty with footwear in otherwise healthy adults with HV compared to controls. Methods: Thirty volunteers with HV (radiographic HV angle >15 degrees) and 30 matched controls were recruited for this study (50 women, 10 men; mean age 44.4 years, range 20 to 76 years). Differences between groups were examined for self-reported foot pain and disability, satisfaction with appearance, footwear difficulty, and pressure-pain threshold at the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Functional measures included balance tests, walking performance, and hallux muscle strength (abduction and plantarflexion). Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: All self-report measures showed that HV was associated with higher levels of foot pain and disability and significant concerns about appearance and footwear (p < 0.001). Lower pressure-pain threshold was measured at the medial first metatarsophalangeal joint in participants with HV (MD = -133.3 kPa, CI: -251.5 to -15.1). Participants with HV also showed reduced hallux plantarflexion strength (MD = -37.1 N, CI: -55.4 to -18.8) and abduction strength (MD = -9.8 N, CI: -15.6 to -4.0), and increased mediolateral sway when standing with both feet with eyes closed (MD = 0.34 cm, CI: 0.04 to 0.63). Conclusions: These findings show that HV negatively impacts on self-reported foot pain and function, and concerns about foot appearance and footwear in otherwise healthy adults. There was also evidence of impaired hallux muscle strength and increased postural sway in HV subjects compared to controls, although general physical functioning and participation in physical activity were not adversely affected.";2012;2
Background: In New Zealand, around 45,000 people live with stroke and many studies have reported that benefits gained during initial rehabilitation are not sustained. Evidence indicates that participation in physical interventions can prevent the functional decline that frequently occurs after discharge from acute care facilities. However, on-going stroke services provision following discharge from acute care is often related to non-medical factors such as availability of resources and geographical location. Currently most people receive no treatment beyond three months post stroke. The study aims to determine if the Augmented Community Telerehabilitation Intervention (ACTIV) results in better physical function for people with stroke than usual care, as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale, physical subcomponent. Methods/design: This study will use a multi-site, two-arm, assessor blinded, parallel randomised controlled trial design. People will be eligible if they have had their first ever stroke, are over 20 and have some physical impairment in either arm or leg, or both. Following discharge from formal physiotherapy services (inpatient, outpatient or community), participants will be randomised into ACTIV or usual care. ACTIV uses readily available technology, telephone and mobile phones, combined with face-to-face visits from a physiotherapist over a six-month period, to help people with stroke resume activities they enjoyed before the stroke. The impact of stroke on physical function and quality of life will be assessed, measures of cost will be collected and a discrete choice survey will be used to measure preferences for rehabilitation options. These outcomes will be collected at baseline, six months and 12 months. In-depth interviews will be used to explore the experiences of people participating in the intervention arm of the study. Discussion: The lack of on-going rehabilitation for people with stroke diminishes the chance of their best possible outcome and may contribute to a functional decline following discharge from formal rehabilitation. Best practice guidelines recommend a prolonged period of rehabilitation, however this is expensive and therefore not undertaken in most publicly funded centres. An effective, cost-effective, and preference-sensitive therapy using basic technology to assist programme delivery may improve patient autonomy as they leave formal rehabilitation and return home.;2012;2
"Background: Millions of patients who survive medical and surgical general intensive care unit care every year experience newly acquired long-term cognitive impairment and profound physical and functional disabilities. To overcome the current reality in which patients receive inadequate rehabilitation, we devised a multifaceted, in-home, telerehabilitation program implemented using social workers and psychology technicians with the goal of improving cognitive and functional outcomes. Methods: This was a single-site, feasibility, pilot, randomized trial of 21 general medical/surgical intensive care unit survivors (8 controls and 13 intervention patients) with either cognitive or functional impairment at hospital discharge. After discharge, study controls received usual care (sporadic rehabilitation), whereas intervention patients received a combination of in-home cognitive, physical, and functional rehabilitation over a 3-month period via a social worker or master's level psychology technician utilizing telemedicine to allow specialized multidisciplinary treatment. Interventions over 12 wks included six in-person visits for cognitive rehabilitation and six televisits for physical/functional rehabilitation. Outcomes were measured at the completion of the rehabilitation program (i.e., at 3 months), with cognitive functioning as the primary outcome. Analyses were conducted using linear regression to examine differences in 3-month outcomes between treatment groups while adjusting for baseline scores. Results: Patients tolerated the program with only one adverse event reported. At baseline both groups were well-matched. At 3-month follow-up, intervention group patients demonstrated significantly improved cognitive executive functioning on the widely used and well-normed Tower test (for planning and strategic thinking) vs. controls (median [interquartile range], 13.0 [11.5-14.0] vs. 7.5 [4.0-8.5]; adjusted p < .01). Intervention group patients also reported better performance (i.e., lower score) on one of the most frequently used measures of functional status (Functional Activities Questionnaire at 3 months vs. controls, 1.0 [0.0 -3.0] vs. 8.0 [6.0-11.8], adjusted p = .04). Conclusions: A multicomponent rehabilitation program for intensive care unit survivors combining cognitive, physical, and functional training appears feasible and possibly effective in improving cognitive performance and functional outcomes in just 3 months. Future investigations with a larger sample size should be conducted to build on this pilot feasibility program and to confirm these results, as well as to elucidate the elements of rehabilitation contributing most to improved outcomes.

Cardiopulmonary diseases affect millions of people and cause high costs in health care systems worldwide. Patients should perform regular endurance exercises to stabilize their health state and prevent further impairment. However, patients are often uncertain about the level of intensity they should exercise in their current condition. The cost of continuous monitoring for these training sessions in clinics is high and additionally requires the patient to travel to a clinic for each single session. Performing the rehabilitation training at home can raise compliance and reduce costs. To ensure safe telerehabilitation training and to enable patients to control their performance and health state, detection of abnormal events during training is a critical prerequisite. Therefore, we created a model that predicts the heart rate of cardiopulmonary patients and that can be used to detect and avoid abnormal health states. To enable external feedback and an immediate reaction in case of a critical situation, the patient should have the possibility to configure the system to communicate warnings and emergency events to clinical and non-clinical actors. To fulfill this task, we coupled a personal health record (PHR) with a new component that extends the classic home emergency systems. The PHR is also used for a training schedule definition that makes use of the predictive HR model. We used statistical methods to evaluate the prediction model and found that our prediction error of 3.2 heart beats per minute is precise enough to enable a detection of critical states. The concept for the communication of alerts was evaluated through focus group interviews with domain experts who judged that it fulfills the needs of potential users.;2012;2
Children who are deaf and hard of hearing and their families need access to appropriate early intervention services that are delivered by professionals who are well trained and experienced using their chosen communication approach. Unfortunately, a lack of qualified practitioners, especially in remote and rural communities, and limited funding can affect the quality of services that are provided to some children. Advances in telecommunication and distance technology have led to models of telepractice that can provide access to appropriate services and reduce overall costs. While more efficacy research is needed, preliminary findings support the delivery of early intervention services through these distant service delivery models. Professionals who embrace models of telepractice can help to ensure that more children with hearing loss and their families receive the intervention to which they are entitled.;2012;2
Current wheelchair selection and evaluation processes are time-consuming, often requiring cumbersome review and re-review of frequently changing wheelchair products and manufacturers. Telerehabilitation (TR) is an emerging field that complements the current in-person assessment for selecting an appropriate wheeled mobility and seating device in underserved areas. One of TR's core functions is remote wheelchair selection (RWS), which requires detailed information on wheelchair characteristics and specifications, policy knowledge, and patient medical conditions including mobility limitation. Stakeholders currently have limited means to access comprehensive, reliable, monitored, and up-to-date information relative to wheeled mobility and seating devices, including performance, coverage criteria, or research evidence as to their benefits and short-comings. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented significant changes to the Healthcare Common Procedures Coding System (HCPCS) for wheeled mobility devices (WMDs) that includes expansion from 4 to 64 unique codes to identify different types of physical mobility devices (PMDs). This 16-fold increase can make it difficult to fully understand where a given product falls within the new structure. In our work we review the current TR research, wheelchair coverage policy issues, and the modern remote wheelchair selection paradigm. We introduce a framework for a web-based decision support system for remote wheelchair selection. These outcomes improve the wheelchair selection and evaluation processes through the capabilities of remote investigation of in-person assessment process, appropriated wheelchair alternatives, advanced wheelchair query and selection, a reusable wheelchair information repository, and systematic wheelchair evaluation. We also discuss lessons learned from a focus group study regarding the user acceptance of RWS-Advisor and the future direction of research on remote wheelchair selection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Dorstyn D, Mathias J, Denson L, Robertson M. Effectiveness of telephone counseling in managing psychological outcomes after spinal cord injury: a preliminary study. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2012;93:2100-8. Objective: To determine whether an individualized counseling intervention delivered by telephone-telecounseling-feasibly improves the emotional adjustment of adults with a newly acquired spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Spinal injuries unit of a rehabilitation center. Participants: Adults (N=40) aged 18 or older, who were recently discharged home from inpatient spinal rehabilitation, were randomly assigned to a telecounseling treatment or standard-care control group. All participants had recently received psychological treatment as inpatients in order to help assist them in adjusting to their disability. Referral to the inpatient psychology service was therefore a key indicator of participants' baseline distress levels and, consequently, their need for counseling support postdischarge. Intervention: Seven telecounseling sessions were delivered over a 12-week period by a single psychologist (D.D.). Pre- and postintervention data, plus a 3-month follow-up assessment, were compared with that of an SCI control group who received standard care. Main Outcome Measures: Psychosocial outcome was measured using the following: Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21; Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview; Spinal Cord Lesion Emotional Wellbeing and Coping Strategies Questionnaires; and the Multidimensional Measure of Social Support. Cost-effectiveness and clinical feasibility were also evaluated. Results: Telecounseling participants reported clinical improvements in depression and anxiety and aspects of SCI coping immediately postintervention. However, these treatment gains were not statistically significant. Additionally, treatment effects were minimal at 3-month follow-up. Delivery related outcomes, including participation rate and cost analyses, were all positive. Conclusions: The results suggest that continued psychological services for individuals reporting distress during their inpatient rehabilitation is important and that such services can be delivered by telephone cost-effectively and efficiently. However, the long-term benefits of telecounseling, once ceased, were not demonstrated.";2012;2
Growing numbers of stroke survivors are leading to increasing numbers of motor deficits, the majority of which include deficiencies in arm function. There is a strong need, therefore, to find new tools and strategies for providing efficient and effective sub-acute patient care. The requirements for such a device are outlined from both patient and therapist perspectives, and a new prototype system for sub-acute arm training in post-stroke care is presented. The complete system is composed of a base module with quick-connecting hand and forearm orthoses, a global position detection mat, and an all-in-one touchscreen PC with telerehabilitation software and interfaces. The size and portability of the system allow it to be easily moved and setup in the patient home to enable increased durations and intensity of training outside of the standard in-clinic care.;2012;2
"In master-slave teleoperator systems used for tele-rehabilitation purposes, the passivity can be violated because of the assistive actions of a therapist; moreover, any type of passivation approach to the design of such a system would defeat the purpose of the assistive therapy. In this paper, a design framework is presented that does not rely on passivity considerations. A number of results are given that deal with stability and transparency properties of the telerehabilitation system in the case of intrinsically non-passive behaviour of the therapist. In particular, a stabilization scheme for the networked tele-rehabilitation system is proposed which guarantees stability regardless of the specific actions of the therapist. Simulation results are presented which confirm the theoretical developments.";2012;2
"In recent years, advances in motion detection, tracking, and classification have made applications in telerehabilitation possible. Monitoring of the lederlies and physically impaired, sports medicine, and physical therapy, are some of the active research areas in telerehabilitation. Furthermore, the gaming industry has provided some low-cost devices to track motion with reasonable accuracy; thus, making telerehabilitation a reality for most people. This work introduces, presents, and discusses the progress in motion tracking and their application in telerehabilitation.";2012;2
Interaction between ventilator and patient's breathing control represents a challenging field of research. The present study presents the comparison among varying level of assistance under three different modalities of mechanical ventilation (i.e., NAVA, PSV and PCV) on a group of fifteen patients with prolonged weaning. Integrated effort of (i) diaphragmatic electromyography and (ii) inspiratory/expiratory time delays under the three modalities were computed. Integrated effort of inspiratory time delay was lower under NAVA compared to PSV and PCV at less comfortable level of assistance. Integrated effort of expiratory time delay was lower under NAVA compared to PCV and lower under PSV compared to NAVA, both at most and less comfortable level of assistance. Our findings showed better patient-ventilator interaction under assisted ventilator support modes, especially under NAVA, compared to PCV.;2012;2
Neurorehabilitation is an emerging field driven by developments in neuroscience and biomedical engineering. Most patients that require neurorehabilitation have had a stroke, but other diseases of the brain, spinal cord, or nerves can also be alleviated. Modern therapies in neurorehabilitation focus on reducing impairment and improving function in daily life. As compared with acute care medicine, the clinical evidence for most neurorehabilitative treatments (modern or conventional) is sparse. Clinical trials support constraint-induced movement therapy for the arm and aerobic treadmill training for walking, both high-intensity interventions requiring therapist time (i.e., cost) and patient motivation. Promising approaches for the future include robotic training, telerehabilitation at the patient's home, and supportive therapies that promote motivation and compliance. It is argued that a better understanding of the neuroscience of recovery together with results from small-scale and well-focused clinical experiments are necessary to design optimal interventions for specific target groups of patients.;2012;2
Objective: The present study seeks to conduct cost-utility analysis (CUA) of the Danish TELEKAT (Telehomecare, Chronic Patients and the Integrated Healthcare System) project. The TELEKAT project seeks to test and develop a preventive home monitoring concept across sectors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The concept of the TELEKAT project is to reduce admissions by enabling the COPD patients to conduct self-monitoring and maintain rehabilitation activities in their own home. COPD patients with severe and very severe COPD were included in the study. Subjects and Methods: This economic evaluation follows international guidelines for the conduction of a CUA alongside a clinical randomized controlled trial. The analysis is based on a health sector perspective. Results: The mean incremental cost efficiency ratio, located in the southeast quadrant, shows that telerehabilitation is less costly and more effective than the rehabilitation given to the control group. The telerehabilitation program produces more value for money and generates savings on healthcare budgets. Conclusions: The telerehabilitation program appears to be more cost-effective than the conventional rehabilitation program for COPD patients. Further studies of cost-effectiveness with a focus on large-scale studies are needed.;2012;2
Objective: The purpose of this study was (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of the e-learning curriculum and (2) to explore the type of questions raised by students through the Health Promotion for Music Performers (HPMP) e-learning curriculum. Materials and Methods: This study was primarily a pedagogical research composed of a pre- and postintervention design coupled with a 1-month longitudinal knowledge retention measurement. The intervention, the HPMP e-learning curriculum, was implemented over 14 weeks, once a week, for a total of 14 classes. Each class consisted of a 60-min prerecorded lecture followed by a 40-min real-time interactive discussion. The interdisciplinary faculty panel consisted of experts from the field of music and medicine. The Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) was used to evaluate knowledge changes concerning (1) Practice and Performance issues and (2) Health and Life Style issues. Results: Fifteen graduate-level music students participated in the study. The SAQ scores on the 1-month follow-up test for Practice and Performance issues were significantly higher than the pretest (t=2.731, p < 0.05). On the other hand, no significant differences were found between the posttest and pretest or between the follow-up test and posttest. Regarding Health and Life Style issues, comparison at all three measurement points did not reveal any significant difference. Questions raised by students fell into four major categories: performance injury (45%), performance anxiety (22%), general physiology (22%), and general psychology (11%). Conclusions: The findings suggest that the HPMP e-learning course enhanced student awareness of Practice and Performance issues but did not have as significant an impact on student awareness of Health and Lifestyle issues.;2012;2
Objective: To assess multiple facets of awareness, understanding, value, needs, and desirability to resolve issues regarding unmet medical needs of individuals with a disability by adopting telerehabilitation. The survey included collection and analysis of current services as well as of supplementary and future services of rehabilitative interventions in South Korea. Study Design and Participants: Thirty-six health professionals who were members of the Korean Academy of Rehabilitation Medicine and 57 individuals with spinal cord injury responded to a survey of those belonging to two non-profit professional groups, one group belonging to the Korean Spinal Cord Injury Association and joining the National Spinal Cord Injury Wheelchair Games and the other group belonging to the Jeong-Sang-Hye (High Quad Spinal Cord Injury Association) and having joined one of the focus groups of the Korea National Rehabilitation Research Institute. The two surveys were designed specifically for investigating each group's perspectives of awareness, understanding, value, needs, and desirability of telerehabilitation. Results: The survey responses indicated that there is great interest in the possibility of telerehabilitative services among individuals with spinal cord injury. In particular, there was a strong interest expressed in services that can be used to resolve issues on unmet medical needs of individuals with a disability related to health monitoring, sustaining health, rehabilitation interventions, and independence of activities of daily living. Conclusions: Telerehabilitation holds great promise as a bridge to traditional face-to-face clinical service delivery. From the results, there are a few categories in the survey that indicate notable differences between the two groups regarding the awareness, desirability, order of preference in rehabilitation service, and telerehabilitation expenses.;2012;2
Objective: To describe the effectiveness of using telehealth programs to provide training or support to family members of people with traumatic brain injury. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Intervention studies were identified by searching Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane library, Embase, PsycBITE and ProQUEST. Study selection: Studies included in the review reported an intervention involving family members of adults or children with traumatic brain injury, delivered at a distance through use of technology (including telephone, websites or videoconferencing). Reliability of inclusion of studies in the review was high (Kappa=0.816) based on a second reviewer evaluating a random sample of 25% of the 830 references originally identified from the database search. Data extraction: Data describing the participants, interventions and outcomes were extracted from each study. The quality of studies was evaluated using the PEDro-P scale. Data synthesis: The review identified 7 randomised controlled trials, 4 non-randomised controlled trials and 5 case series studies. The studies involved a variety of program formats and intervention targets. All but one study reported positive outcomes of the telehealth programs, however very few studies used blinded assessors. Conclusions: Telehealth programs for family members of people with traumatic brain injury are feasible, with positive outcomes reported. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence for the use of telehealth in comparison to face-to-face interventions, and to provide information to guide clinical decision-making.;2012;2
Objectives To explore patients' perceptions regarding prospective telerehabilitation services and the factors that facilitate or impede patients' intentions to use these services. Design Using semi-structured interviews, patients reflected on the pros and cons of various scenarios of prospective telerehabilitation services. Patients' arguments were first arranged according to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Next, using inductive analysis, the data for each UTAUT component were analysed and arranged into subthemes. Setting and participants Twenty-five chronic pain patients were selected from a rehabilitation centre in the Netherlands. Results Overall, participants considered telerehabilitation helpful as a complementary or follow-up treatment, rather than an autonomous treatment. Arguments mainly related to the UTAUT constructs of 'performance expectancy' and 'facilitating conditions'. Patients valued the benefits such as reduced transportation barriers, flexible exercise hours and the possibility to better integrate skills into daily life. However, many patients feared a loss of treatment motivation and expressed concerns about both reduced fellow sufferer contact and reduced face-to-face therapist contact. Few arguments related to 'social norms' and 'effort expectancy'. Conclusions The effect of telerehabilitation on healthcare strongly depends on patients' willingness to use. Our study showed that chronic pain patients valued the benefits of telerehabilitation but hesitate to use it as an autonomous treatment. Therefore, future initiatives should maintain traditional care to some degree and focus on patients' attitudes as well. Either by giving information to increase patients' confidence in telerehabilitation or by addressing reported drawbacks into the future design of these services. Further quantitative studies are needed to explore patients' intentions to use telerehabilitation.;2012;2
Objectives: As an emerging model of health care delivery, telehealth has the potential to provide individuals living in remote regions with access to health care services that are otherwise not available. This paper provides a review of the feasibility, comparative effectiveness, cost effectiveness, client and clinician satisfaction, and the bathers to providing telehealth services. A proof-of-concept study that examined the feasibility of telehealth-based ergonomic assessment and intervention is included in this paper to demonstrate the application of telehealth in occupational therapy and ergonomics. Methods: Ten computer users received a telehealth ergonomic assessment and intervention for their computer workstations via the Telerehabilitation Computer Ergonomics System (tele-CES) - a platform for computer users to access web-based assessments and to communicate with researchers via tele-conferencing. The tele-CES was used to assess participants' computer workstations and pain and comfort levels at baseline and at 4-month follow-up. Ergonomic recommendations were also provided via the tele-CES. Results: Although there was no significant improvement in pain and comfort for participants, a high rate of compliance with ergonomic recommendations - 88% of all recommendations - was observed. Conclusion: Further research examining the comparative effectiveness of telehealth ergonomic assessment and intervention relative to in-person ergonomic assessment and intervention is warranted.;2012;2
Objectives: To compare in-person versus telehealth (TH) assessment of discourse ability in adults with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: Repeated-measures design with random order of conditions. Participants: Twenty adults withmoderate-to-severe TBI. Method: Participants completed conversation, picture description, story-generation, and procedural description tasks. Sessions were video-recorded and transcribed. Measures: Measures of productivity and quality of discourse. Results: Significant differences between conditions were not detected in this sample, and feedback from participants was positive. Conclusions: These preliminary results support the use of TH for the assessment of discourse ability in adults with TBI, at least for individuals with sufficient cognitive skills to follow TH procedures.;2012;2

Purpose: The objective of the telerehabilitation is a continuation of the rehabilitation process on patients' home. The study also compares the balance training in clinical environment with the telerehabilitation approach when the physiotherapists and physicians can follow the progress remotely. Method: In this paper, the preliminary study of the pilot project with virtual reality (VR)-based tasks for dynamic standing frame supported balance training is presented. Six patients with stroke participated in the study. The patients performed the balance training 3 weeks, 2 weeks in the clinical settings and 1 week in the home environment, five times a week, and each time for up to 20 minutes. Objective effectiveness was demonstrated by parameters as track time, number of collisions and the clinical instruments Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up & Go (TUG), 10-m walk test and standing on the unaffected and affected extremity. The outcomes were compared to the balance training group without VR and telerehabilitation support. A 2-way ANOVA was used to explore the differences between the both stroke groups. Results: In patients who were subject to VR supported balance training, the BBS demonstrated improvement for 15%, the TUG for 29%, the 10-m walk for 26%, stance time on the affected and unaffected extremity for 200 and 67%, respectively. The follow-up demonstrated that the patients preserved the gained functional improvement. The VR task performance time and number of collisions decreased to 45 and 68%, respectively. Besides, no statistical differences were found between the telerehabilitation approach with VR supported balance training and conventional balance training in clinical settings either regarding the overall mean level or regarding the mean improvement. Conclusions: The telerehabilitation approach in VR supported balance training improved balance in stroke patients and had similar effect on patients' postural functional improvement as conventional balance training in clinical settings. However, when balance training is continued on patient's home instead of the hospital, it would eventually decrease the number of outpatients' visits, reduce related costs and enable treatment of larger number of patients.;2012;2
Purpose: This review highlights seminal publications of rehabilitation interventions and outcomes in osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. Methods: Medline, CINAHL, and Embase databases from September 2010 through August 2011 were searched using the key words 'osteoarthritis', rehabilitation, physical therapy, exercise, and outcome(s), limited to human and English. Rehabilitation intervention studies were included if they were randomized trials (RCT), systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Studies of surgical interventions were excluded unless they included evaluation of a rehabilitation intervention. Outcome studies were included if they contributed methodologically to advancing outcome measurement. Reviews of measurement properties of outcomes were excluded. Eight publications were selected and reviewed that relate to interventions evaluating manual therapy in hip or knee OA, tele-rehabilitation and performance and participation measures as outcomes. Results: Interventions: One systematic review of hip and knee OA, one meta-analysis of knee OA provide limited support for the benefit of manual therapy with exercise for improving pain and function to a lesser extent in the short-term (3 months). Study quality overall was low. One high quality RCT in knee replacement of usual outpatient physiotherapy vs internet-based telerehabilitation based on a non-inferiority analysis demonstrated comparable outcomes on Western Ontario McMaster Universities' Osteoarthritis questionnaire (WOMAC) pain and function and performance measures. Outcomes: Three studies demonstrated that observed performance measures such as timed walk tests and stair-climbing and timed-up-and-go measure concepts differ from self-report of difficulty with physical function. Additionally, two studies showed differential times of recovery following total knee replacement (TKR). Two studies evaluated participation. One demonstrated the conceptual distinction of activity limitations and participation and a second re-analyzed trial data from knee OA studies. In one study, there were larger effects in combined activity/participation than for activity alone for arthroscopic lavage compared to intraarticular steroid and, in a second study, the effect was larger for activity with an advanced pharmacy intervention whereas the physiotherapy intervention demonstrated a larger effect for activity/participation. Conclusions: Interventions of manual therapy for hip and knee OA provided limited evidence of effectiveness. These studies are of limited quality due to lack of blinding and disclosure of co-intervention. Tele-rehabilitation may be a viable option to improve access to rehabilitation post joint replacement for those in rural and remote areas. Data continue to support the need to include performance measures as well as patient-reported outcomes in evaluating outcomes in OA. Additionally, measures of participation should be considered as core outcomes. (C) 2012 Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012;2
Recent advances in videoconferencing technology have resulted in a substantial increase in the use of live videoconferencing-referred to here as telepractice-to diagnose and treat speech, language, and hearing disorders. There is growing support from professional organizations for use of this service delivery model, as videoconferencing technology can alleviate the effects of distance on access to care. As telepractice becomes a standard mode of conducting diagnostic and treatment services in speech, language, and hearing disorders, it is essential to assure that research supports its application in the field. Search criteria were established to identify publications, primarily in peer-reviewed journals, from 1995 to 2011. These studies generally validate the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic services through telepractice when compared to traditional services delivered in a face-to-face clinical setting. Most studies examined adults and school-age children. The search was then expanded to identify diagnostic and treatment services for infants, toddlers, and young children. The existing literature compels professionals to conduct more research related specifically to the effectiveness and efficacy of telepractice.;2012;2
Recently, extensive research has been carried out to investigate human motion in daily life using micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensors. This study proposes an upper limb position tracking system that uses inertial and magnetic sensors. Two sensor units were attached to an upper arm and a forearm. The sensor unit has a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope, and a three-axis magnetometer. The magnetometer was not used for the forearm to optimize cost and space, which is one of the most important contributions of this study. Each sensor unit fused the sensor signals with a Kalman filter to provide a drift-free and stable orientation. The orientations of the upper arm and the forearm were applied to a joint-link model. The positioning accuracy was evaluated through comparison with a standard motion capture system. The proposed system provided a stable upper limb position. The upper limb position tracking system proposed herein could be applied to various fields, including clinical diagnosis, telerehabilitation, and virtual reality.;2012;2
"Redzuan NS, Engkasan JP, Mazlan M, Freddy Abdullah Si. Effectiveness of a video-based therapy program at home after acute stroke: a randomized controlled trial. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2012;93:2177-83. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention using video to deliver therapy at home for patients with stroke. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: The neurology ward and rehabilitation medicine department of a tertiary hospital. Participants: Patients with stroke (N=90). There were 44 patients in the intervention group and 46 patients in the control group. Interventions: The intervention group received a combination of at-home rehabilitation guided by a digital videodisk containing therapy techniques and twice-monthly outpatient follow-up for 3 months. The conventional therapy group (control) attended weekly outpatient therapy sessions. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the modified Barthel Index (MBI) score. The secondary measures were the incidence of poststroke complications and the Caregiver Strain Index. Results: At 3 months, there were no significant differences with regard to the number of patients with improved MBI score, complication rate, or Caregiver Strain Index score between the 2 groups. Both groups had significant increases in the MBI score at 3 months (P<.001 for both groups). Regression analysis revealed that only stroke severity significantly influenced the MBI score (P<.001), complication rate (P<.01), and caregiver stress level (P<.05). Conclusions: Video-based therapy at home for post-acute stroke patients is safe, does not negatively impact independence, and is not stressful for caregivers.";2012;2
Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability among adults in industrialized nations. The majority of these disabilities include deficiencies in arm function, which can make independent living very difficult. Research shows that better results in rehabilitation are obtained when patients receive more intensive therapy. However this intensive therapy is currently too expensive to be provided by the public health system, and at home few patients perform the repetitive exercises recommended by their therapists. Computer games can provide an affordable, enjoyable, and effective way to intensify treatment, while keeping the patient as well as their therapists informed about their progress. This paper presents the study, design, implementation and user-testing of a set of computer games for at-home assessment and training of upper-limb motor impairment after stroke.;2012;2
"Study design: We analyzed longitudinal data on secondary outcomes from participants in a telerehabilitation study. Objectives: To examine the factors affecting return to productive activities and employment and the time to these events following a spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting: A large southeastern rehabilitation hospital in the United States. Methods: We used hazard regression models to analyze data from newly injured people (n=111) participating in an educational intervention post discharge who were followed for up to 2 years. Outcomes were time to return to productive activities and employment. Results: Increasing age and being on Medicaid significantly decreased the likelihood of returning to productive activities (P < 0.01), while being white (P < 0.05) and having a higher median income (P < 0.001) significantly increased this probability. The same factors, bar being on Medicaid, affected the return to employment. Whites returned to productive activities 2.5 times sooner than African Americans and employment twice as fast (P < 0.001). Being in the 75th income percentile compared with the 25th shortened time to employment by 209 days. Conclusion: Findings here suggest that income and race affect the time to return to productivity and employment, while being on Medicaid also has a role in general post injury productivity.

Telerehabilitation (telerehab) offers cost-effective services that potentially can improve access to care for those with acquired neurologic communication disorders. However, regulatory issues including licensure, reimbursement, and threats to privacy and confidentiality hinder the routine implementation of telerehab services into the clinical setting. Despite these barriers, rapid technological advances and a growing body of research regarding the use of telerehab applications support its use. This article reviews the evidence related to acquired neurologic speech and language disorders in adults, focusing on studies that have been published since 2000. Research studies have used telerehab systems to assess and treat disorders including dysarthria, apraxia of speech, aphasia, and mild Alzheimer disease. They show that telerehab is a valid and reliable vehicle for delivering speech and language services. The studies represent a progression of technological advances in computing, Internet, and mobile technologies. They range on a continuum from working synchronously (in real-time) with a speech-language pathologist to working asynchronously (offline) with a stand-in virtual therapist. One such system that uses a virtual therapist for the treatment of aphasia, the Web-ORLA (TM) (Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL) system, is described in detail. Future directions for the advancement of telerehab for clinical practice are discussed.;2012;2
Telerehabilitation is an emerging field that aims at optimizing the process of rehabilitation by using efficient information exchange methods between different stakeholders. A wide range of technologies have been developed to facilitate this exchange using monolithic application architectures. These architectures are often the reason why projects fail due to disproportionate investment of money and time as well as lack of knowledge. In this paper, we present an overview of projects in the field of telerehabilitation and telemedicine based on the so called CHOPIN architecture, a toolbox for composition of telemedical services into high quality applications. It facilitates reuse and leverage of existing services and components, thus reducing costs and work efforts with each new application that is implemented on the basis of CHOPIN. Our future prospects will focus on even stronger service orientation of the approach developing the whole technology towards a cloud-based approach driven by the metaphor of Reha-Apps from an AAL-eHealth-Store.;2012;2
The aim of the research was to implement a remote heart rate monitoring system. The monitoring system integrates the wireless ECG signal recorder with a mobile device in a Bluetooth-based body surface network (BSN). The main goal of the work was to achieve high QRS detection performance and calculation of the heart rate as the main ECG exercise-dependent parameter on-the-run. The monitoring system integrates the current heart rate of the patient with the GPS data (position, speed, altitude). This gives us the opportunity to observe the dependence of heart rate variability and speed. The application allows the physician to build a cardiac rehabilitation program which can be divided into several levels. Each level let the physician to customize parameters as: duration, maximal and minimal speed, maximal and minimal heart rate and the difference in altitude. Finally, the proposed system has a detection and classification algorithm for abnormal events which makes the rehabilitation effective and safe. Testing of correct implementation of the QRS detection algorithm was carried on records from the MIT-BIH database. Despite of limited resources in a portable platform, the performance was satisfactory for monitoring purposes (sensitivity 98%, error rate 0,77%) Integrating of a GPS signal and SMS messaging system with a typical cardiac recorder can help alleviate the volume of out-hospital patient follow-ups, can give early warnings of cardiac problems that appear at home and allow physicians to monitor patients more effectively. The proposed architecture opens new opportunities in the remote cardiac rehabilitation. In conclusion it makes the follow-up rehabilitation easier and cheaper.;2012;2
The goal of this project was to objectively assess potential impact of home-based physical telerehabilitation program on functional outcomes in seniors with mobility limitations. Nine consecutive seniors with mobility limitations were enrolled into a 12-week physical telerehabilitation program. At the end of the program, the mean time that patients took to walk 25 feet decreased from 13.5 to 10.6 seconds, and the mean distance that patients walked in 6 minutes improved from 722.4 to 805.7 feet. The Berg Balance Score score also increased from 36.6 to 41.7 over the 12-week period. All changes were statistically significant (p<0.05). Patients demonstrated very high acceptance of the home-based program.;2012;2
The Grip-ball is a new dynamometer used to evaluate grip strength, as well as for use in home-based rehabilitation of the hand and forearm. The Grip-ball consists of pressure and temperature sensors and an electronic wireless communication system contained in an airtight ball. That can be inflated to different pressures. The device has advantages over standard dynamometers in that it looks like a simple ball, and can wirelessly communicate via Bluetooth to any compatible receiver, thus have potential to be used for clinical assessment and rehabilitation in a remote setting. The reliability and reproducibility of the device were assessed for the pressure sensor itself, as well as the relationship between the force applied and the pressure measured by the Grip-ball. The initial validation was performed using the pressure sensor without the ball in order to confirm the accuracy of the sensor used. A second validation study was conducted using the Grip-ball rather than just its sensor to examine the relationship between the pressure measured inside the ball and force applied. The results showed that there is a very good correlation (r = 0.997,p < 0.05) between the pressure measured by the Grip-ball sensor and that measured by a Vigorimeter, thus confirming the reliability of the sensor used in the Grip-ball. A quadratic regression equation was calculated in order to predict the force applied based on the pressure measured inside the ball, and the initial pressure to which the ball was inflated (R-2 = 0.97, standard error 10.9 N). Such a finding compares favourably with the variability inherent in Jamar recordings, thus indicating that the Grip-ball could be used to assess grip force. An industrial version of the Grip-ball, which is currently under development, will be able to be used for the entire range of grip force in the population. (C) 2012 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The main goal of this study is to present preliminary results on wrist robot-aided rehabilitation in chronic post-stroke patients, assessed by using clinical scales and kinematic parameters. Eleven chronic stroke patients participated in the study. The InMotion 3 robotic system for the wrist rehabilitation was used. Clinical scales were used for assessment. Kinematic parameters were measured at the robot's end-effector. Outcome clinical measures show a decrease in motor impairment after the treatment. The kinematic data show an improvement between admission and discharge. Our results show that the robot-assisted wrist training can contribute to reduce the motor impairment: clinical outcome measures and kinematic parameters demonstrate this improvement. The analysis of kinematic data associated to a quantitative motor assessment provided by clinical evaluation scales is able to quantify the rate of improvement in the quality of motion obtained after robot-assisted wrist therapy in stroke patients.;2012;2
This paper introducts the designing of a remote assessment information collection system based on fuzzy logic inference. The system has a 6-freedom double-eyes vision robot to catch vision information, and a group of wearable sensors to acquire biomechanical signals. Taking the speed of information collection system for example, analyses and designs the struct and the rule of fuzzy control. The remote auto control of the telerehabilitation information collection system was achieved. Rehabilitation professionals can semi-automatically practice an assessment program via Internet. The results show that the smart device, including the robot and the sensors, can improve the quality of remote assessment, and reduce the complexity of operation at a distance.;2012;2
This paper presents a virtual reality (VR)-enhanced new hand rehabilitation support system that enables patients to exercise alone. This system features a multi-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) motion assistance robot, a VR interface for patients, and a symmetrical master-slave motion assistance training strategy called self-motion control, in which the stroke patient's healthy hand on the master side creates the assistance motion for the impaired hand on the slave side. To assist in performing the fine exercise motions needed for functional recovery of the impaired hand, the robot was constructed in an exoskeleton with 18 DOFs, to assist finger and thumb independent motions such as flexion/extension and abduction/adduction, thumb opposability, and hand-wrist coordinated motions. To enhance the effectiveness of the exercises, audio-visual instructions of each training motion using VR technology were designed with the input of clinician researchers. Experimental results from healthy subjects and patients show sufficient performance in the range of motion of the robot as well as sufficient assistance forces.;2012;2
To assess the validity of conducting clinical dysphagia assessments via telerehabilitation, 40 individuals with dysphagia from various etiologies were assessed simultaneously by a face-to-face speech-language pathologist (FTF-SLP) and a telerehabilitation SLP (T-SLP) via an Internet-based videoconferencing telerehabilitation system. Dysphagia status was assessed using a Clinical Swallowing Examination (CSE) protocol, delivered via a specialized telerehabilitation videoconferencing system and involving the use of an assistant at the patient's end of the consultation to facilitate the assessment. Levels of agreement between the FTF-SLP and T-SLP revealed that the majority of parameters reached set levels of clinically acceptable levels of agreement. Specifically, agreement between the T-SLP and FTF-SLP ratings for the oral, oromotor, and laryngeal function tasks revealed levels of exact agreement ranging from 75 to 100% (kappa = 0.36-1.0), while the parameters relating to food and fluid trials ranged in exact agreement from 79 to 100% (kappa = 0.61-1.0). Across the parameters related to aspiration risk and clinical management, exact agreement ranged between 79 and 100% (kappa = 0.49-1.0). The data show that a CSE conducted via telerehabilitation can provide valid and reliable outcomes comparable to clinical decisions made in the FTF environment.;2012;2
We examined the effect of knowledge and task specific training provided to an allied health assistant (AHA), prior to her involvement in facilitating assessments of dysphagia (swallowing disorders) via telerehabilitation. The AHA received four hours of training, which included basic theoretical information regarding dysphagia as well as hands-on training with simulated patients. A written test examining swallowing function and its evaluation was completed pre- and then immediately post-training, and then again after the 15th and 30th of 31 consecutive patient assessments. In addition, after each set of 5 clinical dysphagia assessments completed with patients following the training, two speech pathologists rated the AHA's competence in relation to performing the tasks and activities required of her during the telerehabilitation swallowing assessment. The AHA also self-rated the perceived level of confidence at these times. Before training, the assistant's knowledge of dysphagia theory was at 40%. Following training, all tests were above the 80% level. The AHA's performance was rated as competent on each evaluation post-training. The AHA also expressed overall satisfaction with the initial training provided and reported feeling confident after the initial sessions with patients. Thus for an AHA with previous clinical experience, competence and perceived comfort in providing assistance in the sessions was achieved with only a few hours of task specific training.;2012;2
"We examined the validity and reliability of a physiotherapy examination of the elbow, using telerehabilitation. The patho-anatomical diagnoses, systems diagnosis and physical examination findings of face-to-face physiotherapy examinations were compared with telerehabilitation examinations. Ten participants attended a single session, during which they were interviewed, a face-to-face physical examination was performed and a remote physical examination was conducted, guided by an examiner at a different location via a telerehabilitation system. Conventional face-to-face physiotherapy physical examination test results, diagnoses and systems diagnoses were compared to those produced by an examiner using the telerehabiliation system. There was substantial agreement for systems diagnosis (73%; P = 0.013) for validity and almost perfect agreement for intra-rater reliability (90%; P = 0.001). The inter-rater reliability had a weaker and non-significant agreement (64%; P = 0.11). Physical examination data demonstrated > 68% agreement across all three datasets, between the examination methods. Performing a telerehabilitation physical examination to determine a musculoskeletal diagnosis of the elbow joint complex is both valid and reliable.";2012;2
[Purpose] A virtual environment (VE) system was designed to facilitate the retraining of motor control by feedback of movement trajectory to patients with neurological impairments, such as stroke victims or those with an acquired brain injury. In this study, we quantitatively assessed motion trajectory of the upper extremity during VE in order to further understand the effect of paralyzed upper extremity movement in YE for each patient as well as the functional clinical evaluations. [Subjects and Methods] Six patients with stroke were participated in this study. The YE system consisted of a computer, an electromagnetic motion tracking device, which monitored and displayed patient movement on the computer, and the YE software, which provided the tools for creating training scenes. This system was used to facilitate motor relearning of the upper extremity for six patients with stroke. [Results] The results showed there were improvements in variability and accuracy of the arm movement in motion trajectory. In addition, the scores of clinical evaluations improved, and YE did not hinder motor relearning of the upper extremity, which is necessary for activities of daily living. [Conclusion] This YE system might be effective at facilitating motor relearning of the upper extremity for stroke patients.;2013;2
"[Purpose] Memory impairment is a common sequela in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Little is known about applications for memory training for patients with TBI. We investigated the effect of a memory training application in a patient with TBI. [Subjects and Methods] A 37 year-old male patient presented with memory impairment since onset of TBI resulting from a traffic accident. We developed a memory training application for use with a tablet PC. It consists of six stages. Each stage is composed of visual and auditory memory training parts. Two training sessions were conducted per day, five days per week, for a period of three months from nine months after onset to 11 months after onset. [Results] The patient's scores on the Memory Assessment Scale showed improvement after participating in the memory training program for a period of three months: global memory, 56.6%; short-term memory, 13.2%; visual memory, 75.0%; and verbal memory, 37.9%. [Conclusions] We observed significant improvement of memory function of this patient after memory training using this application. As a result of these findings, we believe that this application could be useful for improving memory impairment of patients with TBI.";2013;2
A common problem among elderly people is the loss of motor ability. Rehabilitation exercises can help these people recover strength and maintain a good level of mobility. However, high costs and the need for special equipment make professional rehabilitation impractical for regular use in daily life, precluding elderly the possibility to perform focalized training at home. The idea of telerehabilitation is becoming more and more concrete with the rapid development of internet technology. Telerehabilitation would allow the user to perform exercises at home with online professional direction from the doctor. However, at the present state, the doctor cannot obtain real-time and quantitative data from the user, and this limits the training effectiveness. To overcome this problem, an extremely miniaturized, portable motion capture system, named WB-4R, has been developed. Calibration and real-time link orientation reconstruction are very important to improve the accuracy in real-time measurement. In this paper, using the positive results of preliminary experiments on lower limbs, the authors will show the feasibility of the method and confirm the effectiveness of the developed system.;2013;2
Accurate motion monitoring can provide detailed information through qualitative and quantitative analysis of patient movements in the field of rehabilitation and thus can become an effective tool set for treatment of motion problems. Normally patients are doing rehabilitation training programs under the guidance of their supervisor only during some small fragment (1-2 hours) of the day. Remote motion monitoring can enable skilled medical staff to monitor closely patient's training activities at home during the whole day, thus multi-part (morning, afternoon, evening) training sessions can be included easily into the daily life and in certain cases (e.g.: stroke rehabilitation) this can enhance the healing process significantly and can lead to better restoration results. Accurate movement/motion monitoring can enable medical experts to introduce individual (patient specific) rehabilitation programs, and assess the value of the training program at any time with high granularity level. The MOVANDIS framework is a novel, generic, vendor independent motion data collector and movement visualizer software solution. This paper focuses mainly its internal architecture, and its usage scenarios within the field of telerehabilitation.;2013;2
Among the objectives of spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation, (i) prevention of bony, muscular and joint trophism and (ii) limitation of spastic hypertone represent important goals to be achieved. The aim of this study is to use functional electrical stimulation (FES) to activate pedaling on cycle-ergometer and analyse effects of this technique for a rehabilitation training in SCI persons. Five spinal cord injured subjects were recruited and underwent a two months FES-cycling training. Our results show an increase of thigh muscular area and endurance after the FES-cycling training, without any increase of spasticity. This approach, which is being validated on a larger pool of patients, represents a potential tool for improving the rehabilitation outcome of complete and incomplete SCI persons.;2013;2
Background and Purpose Information technology and mobile devices may be beneficial and useful in many aspects of stroke management, including recognition of stroke, transport and triage of patients, emergent stroke evaluation at the hospital, and rehabilitation. In this review, we address the contributions of information technology and mobile health to stroke management. Summary of Issues Rapid detection and triage are essential for effective thrombolytic treatment. Awareness of stroke warning signs and responses to stroke could be enhanced by using mobile applications. Furthermore, prehospital assessment and notification could be streamlined for use in telemedicine and teleradiology. A mobile telemedicine system for assessing the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores has shown higher correlation and fast assessment comparing with face-to-face method. Because the benefits of thrombolytic treatment are time-dependent, treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible. In-hospital communication between multidisciplinary team members can be enhanced using information technology. A computerized in-hospital alert system using computerized physician-order entry was shown to be effective in reducing the time intervals from hospital arrival to medical evaluations and thrombolytic treatment. Mobile devices can also be used as supplementary tools for neurologic examination and clinical decision-making. In post-stroke rehabilitation, virtual reality and telerehabilitation are helpful. Mobile applications might be useful for public awareness, lifestyle modification, and education/training of healthcare professionals. Conclusions Information technology and mobile health are useful tools for management of stroke patients from the acute period to rehabilitation. Further improvement of technology will change and enhance stroke prevention and treatment.;2013;2
Background and Purpose: After stroke, many individuals lack resources to receive the intensive rehabilitation that is thought to improve upper extremity motor function. This case study describes the application of a telerehabilitation intervention using a portable robotic device combined with a home exercise program (HEP) designed to improve upper extremity function. Case Description: The participant was a 54-year-old man, 22 weeks following right medullary pyramidal ischemic infarct. At baseline, he exhibited residual paresis of the left upper extremity, resulting in impaired motor control consistent with a flexion synergistic pattern, scoring 22 of 66 on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment. Intervention: The participant completed 85 total hours of training (38 hours of robotic device and 47 hours of HEP) over the 8-week intervention period. Outcomes: The participant demonstrated an improvement of 26 points on the Action Research Arm Test, 5 points on the Functional Ability Scale portion of the Wolf Motor Function Test, and 20 points on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, all of which surpassed the minimal clinically important difference. Of the 17 tasks of the Wolf Motor Function Test, he demonstrated improvement on 11 of the 15 time-based tasks and both strength measures. The participant reported an overall improvement in his recovery from stroke on the Stroke Impact Scale quality-of-life questionnaire from 40 of 100 to 65 of 100. His score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale improved by 19 points. Discussion: This case demonstrates that robotic-assisted therapy paired with an HEP can be successfully delivered within a home environment to a person with stroke. Robotic-assisted therapy may be a feasible and efficacious adjunct to an HEP program to elicit substantial improvements in upper extremity motor function, especially in those persons with stroke who lack access to stroke rehabilitation centers.

"Background Telerehabilitation is an alternative way of delivering rehabilitation services. Information and communication technologies are used to facilitate communication between the healthcare professional and the patient in a remote location. The use of telerehabilitation is becoming more viable as the speed and sophistication of communication technologies improve. However, it is currently unclear how effective this model of delivery is relative to rehabilitation delivered face-to-face. Objectives To determine whether the use of telerehabilitation leads to improved ability to perform activities of daily living amongst stroke survivors when compared with (1) in-person rehabilitation (when the clinician and the patient are at the same physical location and rehabilitation is provided face-to-face); or (2) no rehabilitation. Secondary objectives were to determine whether use of telerehabilitation leads to greater independence in self care and domestic life and improved mobility, health-related quality of life, upper limb function, cognitive function or functional communication when compared with in-person rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Additionally, we aimed to report on the presence of adverse events, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and levels of user satisfaction associated with telerehabilitation interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (November 2012), the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group Trials Register (November 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 11, 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2012), EMBASE (1980 to November 2012) and eight additional databases. We searched trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of telerehabilitation in stroke. We included studies that compared telerehabilitation with in-person rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. In addition, we synthesised and described the results of RCTs that compared two different methods of delivering telerehabilitation services without an alternative group. We included rehabilitation programmes that used a combination of telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation provided that the greater proportion of intervention was provided via telerehabilitation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified trials on the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated any disagreements. The review authors contacted investigators to ask for missing information. Main results We included in the review 10 trials involving a total of 933 participants. The studies were generally small, and reporting quality was often inadequate, particularly in relation to blinding of outcome assessors and concealment of allocation. Selective outcome reporting was apparent in several studies. Study interventions and comparisons varied, meaning that in most cases, it was inappropriate to pool studies. Intervention approaches included upper limb training, lower limb and mobility retraining, case management and caregiver support. Most studies were conducted with people in the chronic phase following stroke. Primary outcome: no statistically significant results for independence in activities of daily living (based on two studies with 661 participants) were noted when a case management intervention was evaluated. Secondary outcomes: no statistically significant results for upper limb function (based on two studies with 46 participants) were observed when a computer programme was used to remotely retrain upper limb function. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of the intervention on mobility, health-related quality of life or participant satisfaction with the intervention. No studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation. No studies reported on the occurrence of adverse events within the studies. Authors' conclusions We found insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effectiveness of telerehabilitation after stroke. Moreover, we were unable to find any randomised trials that included an evaluation of cost-effectiveness. Which intervention approaches are most appropriately adapted to a telerehabilitation approach remain unclear, as does the best way to utilise this approach.";2013;2
BACKGROUND: Balance and postural control (PC) disorders are frequent motor disorder symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the potential improvements in balance and PC among patients with MS who complete a virtual reality telerehabilitation program that represents a feasible alternative to physical therapy for situations in which conventional treatment is not available. METHODS: 50 patients was recruited. Control group (n = 25) received physiotherapy treatment twice a week (40 min per session). Experimental group (n = 25) received telerehabilitation treatment using the Xbox 360 (R) console monitored via videoconference. Experimental group attended 40 sessions, four sessions per week (20 min per session). The treatment schedule lasted 10 weeks for both groups. A computerised dynamic posturography and clinical outcomes (Berg Balance and Tinettti scales) were used at baseline and at the end of the treatment. RESULTS: Results showed an improvement over general balance in both groups. Visual preference, the contribution of vestibular information, mean response time and Tinetti test yielded significant differences in the experimental group. An ANOVA revealed significant between-group post-treatment differences in the composite equilibrium score, Berg and Tinetti scales in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: We suggest that our virtual reality program enables anticipatory PC and response mechanisms and might serve as a successful therapeutic alternative in situations in which conventional therapy is not readily available.;2013;2
"Background: Breast cancer survivors suffer physical impairment after oncology treatment. This impairment reduces quality of life (QoL) and increase the prevalence of handicaps associated to unhealthy lifestyle (for example, decreased aerobic capacity and strength, weight gain, and fatigue). Recent work has shown that exercise adapted to individual characteristics of patients is related to improved overall and disease-free survival. Nowadays, technological support using telerehabilitation systems is a promising strategy with great advantage of a quick and efficient contact with the health professional. It is not known the role of telerehabilitation through therapeutic exercise as a support tool to implement an active lifestyle which has been shown as an effective resource to improve fitness and reduce musculoskeletal disorders of these women. Methods/Design: This study will use a two-arm, assessor blinded, parallel randomized controlled trial design. People will be eligible if: their diagnosis is of stages I, II, or IIIA breast cancer; they are without chronic disease or orthopedic issues that would interfere with ability to participate in a physical activity program; they had access to the Internet and basic knowledge of computer use or living with a relative who has this knowledge; they had completed adjuvant therapy except for hormone therapy and not have a history of cancer recurrence; and they have an interest in improving lifestyle. Participants will be randomized into e-CUIDATE or usual care groups. E-CUIDATE give participants access to a range of contents: planning exercise arranged in series with breathing exercises, mobility, strength, and stretching. All of these exercises will be assigned to women in the telerehabilitation group according to perceived needs. The control group will be asked to maintain their usual routine. Study endpoints will be assessed after 8 weeks (immediate effects) and after 6 months. The primary outcome will be QoL measured by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 version 3.0 and breast module called The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire. The secondary outcomes: pain (algometry, Visual Analogue Scale, Brief Pain Inventory short form); body composition; physical measurement (abdominal test, handgrip strength, back muscle strength, and multiple sit-to-stand test); cardiorespiratory fitness (International Fitness Scale, 6-minute walk test, International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form); fatigue (Piper Fatigue Scale and Borg Fatigue Scale); anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); cognitive function (Trail Making Test and Auditory Consonant Trigram); accelerometry; lymphedema; and anthropometric perimeters. Discussion: This study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of a telerehabilitation system during adjuvant treatment of patients with breast cancer. If this treatment option is effective, telehealth systems could offer a choice of supportive care to cancer patients during the survivorship phase.";2013;2
Background: In spite of their importance to everyday function, tasks that require both hands to work together such as lifting and carrying large objects have not been well studied and the full potential of how new technology might facilitate recovery remains unknown. Methods: To help identify the best modes for self-teleoperated bimanual training, we used an advanced haptic/graphic environment to compare several modes of practice. In a 2-by-2 study, we compared mirror vs. parallel reaching movements, and also compared veridical display to one that transforms the right hand's cursor to the opposite side, reducing the area that the visual system has to monitor. Twenty healthy, right-handed subjects (5 in each group) practiced 200 movements. We hypothesized that parallel reaching movements would be the best performing, and attending to one visual area would reduce the task difficulty. Results: The two-way comparison revealed that mirror movement times took an average 1.24 s longer to complete than parallel. Surprisingly, subjects' movement times moving to one target (attending to one visual area) also took an average of 1.66 s longer than subjects moving to two targets. For both hands, there was also a significant interaction effect, revealing the lowest errors for parallel movements moving to two targets (p < 0.001). This was the only group that began and maintained low errors throughout training. Conclusion: Combined with other evidence, these results suggest that the most intuitive reaching performance can be observed with parallel movements with a veridical display (moving to two separate targets). These results point to the expected levels of challenge for these bimanual training modes, which could be used to advise therapy choices in self-neurorehabilitation.;2013;2
Background: Individuals with chronic conditions are vulnerable to secondary complications that can be prevented with adherence to self-care routines. They benefit most from receiving effective treatments beyond acute care, usually in the form of regular follow-up and self-care support in their living environments. One such population is individuals with spina bifida (SB), the most common permanently disabling birth defect in the United States. A Wellness Program at the University of Pittsburgh in which wellness coordinators supervise the care of individuals with chronic disease has produced remarkably improved outcomes. However, time constraints and travel costs have limited its scale. Mobile telehealth service delivery is a potential solution for improving access to care for a larger population. Objective: The project's goal was to develop and implement a novel mHealth system to support complex self-care tasks, continuous adherence to regimens, monitoring of adherence, and secure two-way communications between patients and clinicians. Methods: We developed and implemented a novel architecture of mHealth system called iMHere (iMobile Health and Rehabilitation) consisting of smartphone apps, a clinician portal, and a two-way communication protocol connecting the two. The process of implementing iMHere consisted of: (1) requirement analysis to identify clinically important functions that need to be supported, (2) design and development of the apps and the clinician portal, (3) development of efficient real-time bi-directional data exchange between the apps and the clinician portal, (4) usability studies on patients, and (5) implementation of the mHealth system in a clinical service delivery. Results: There were 9 app features identified as relevant, and 5 apps were considered priority. There were 5 app features designed and developed to address the following issues: medication, skin care, bladder self-catheterization, bowel management, and mental health. The apps were designed to support a patient's self-care tasks, send adherence data to the clinician portal, and receive personalized regimens from the portal. The Web-based portal was designed for clinicians to monitor patients' conditions and to support self-care regimens. The two-way communication protocol was developed to facilitate secure and efficient data exchange between the apps and the portal. The 3 phases of usability study discovered usability issues in the areas of self-care workflow, navigation and interface, and communications between the apps and the portal. The system was used by 14 patients in the first 6 months of the clinical implementation, with 1 drop out due to having a poor wireless connection. The apps have been highly utilized consistently by patients, even those addressing complex issues such as medication and skincare. The patterns of utilization showed an increase in use in the first month, followed by a plateau. Conclusions: The system was capable of supporting self-care and adherence to regimen, monitoring adherence, supporting clinician engagement with patients, and has been highly utilized.;2013;2
Background: Mobile phone-based interventions present a means of providing high quality health care to hard-to-reach underserved populations. Migrant farm workers (MFWs) are among the most underserved populations in the United States due to a high prevalence of chronic diseases yet limited access to health care. However, it is unknown if MFWs have access to mobile phone devices used in mobile health (mHealth) interventions, or if they are willing to use such technologies. Objective: Determine rates of ownership of mobile devices and willingness to use mHealth strategies in MFWs. Methods: A demonstration of mHealth devices and a survey were individually administered to 80 Hispanic MFWs to evaluate use of mobile phones and mHealth devices and willingness to use such technologies. Results: Of the 80 participants, 81% (65/80) owned cell phones capable of sending and receiving health-related messages. Most participants (65/80, 81%) were receptive to using mHealth technology and felt it would be helpful in enhancing medication adherence, self-monitoring health conditions, and receiving quicker medication changes from their doctors (median scores >= 4 on 5-point Likert scales). Relations between age and attitudes toward using mHealth were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Hispanic MFWs have access to mobile phones and are willing to use mHealth devices. Future work is needed to comprehensively evaluate the degree to which these devices could be used.;2013;2
"Background: The aim of this study was to determine whether center-based, one-to-one physical therapy provides superior outcomes compared with group-based therapy or a simple monitored home-based program in terms of functional and physical recovery and health-related quality of life after total knee arthroplasty. Methods: Patients awaiting primary total knee arthroplasty at two Sydney metropolitan hospitals were enrolled into this prospective, randomized, superiority trial preoperatively. At two weeks postoperatively, participants were randomly allocated to one of three six-week treatment programs (twelve one-to-one therapy sessions, twelve group-based therapy sessions, or a monitored home program) with use of a computer-generated sequence. Self-reported outcomes (Oxford Knee Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain and function subscales, and Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Survey) and performance-based functional outcomes were measured over twelve months postoperatively by a blinded assessor. The primary outcome was knee pain and function measured with use of the Oxford Knee Score at ten weeks postoperatively. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Results: Two hundred and forty-nine patients (eighty-five who had one-to-one therapy, eighty-four who had group-based therapy, and eighty who were in the monitored home program) were randomized and 233 were available for their one-year follow-up assessment. Participants who received one-to-one therapy did not have a superior Oxford Knee Score at week ten compared with those who received the alternative interventions; the median score was 32 points for the one-to-one therapy group, 36 points for the group-based therapy group, and 34 points for the monitored home program group (p = 0.20). Furthermore, one-to-one therapy was not superior compared with group-based therapy or monitored home program in improving any of the secondary outcomes across the first postoperative year. No adverse events were associated with any of the treatment arms. Conclusions: One-to-one therapy does not provide superior self-reported or performance-based outcomes compared with group-based therapy or a monitored home program, in the short term and the long term after total knee arthroplasty.";2013;2
Background: When designing a complete process of daily telerehabilitation, it should be borne in mind that patients should be furnished with properly designed methodologies for executing specific motion tasks and the assessment of the relevant parameters. In general, such a process should comprehend three basic elements in both the hospital and the home: (a) instrumented walkways, (b) walking aids or supports, and (c) equipment for the assessment of parameters. The objective, with gait being the focus, of this study was thus to design a simple, portable kit-as an alternative to the complex and expensive instruments currently used-to be easily interfaced or integrated with the instrumented walkways and aids/supports both for self-monitoring while patients are exercising with their own aids and for clinical reporting. Materials and Methods: The proposed system is a portable kit that furnishes useful parameters with feedback to both the patient and the trainer/therapist. Capable of being integrated with the most common mechanical tools used in motion rehabilitation (handrail, scales, walkways, etc.), it constantly monitors and quantitatively assesses progress in rehabilitation care. It is composed of one step counter, photo-emitter detectors, one central unit for collecting and processing the telemetrically transmitted data, and a software interface. Results and Discussion: The system has been successfully validated on 16 subjects at the second level of the Tinetti test in a clinical application for both home and the hospital. The portable kit can be used with different rehabilitation tools and on varying ground rugosity. Advantages include (a) very low cost, when compared with optoelectronic solutions or other portable devices, (b) very high accuracy, also for subjects with imbalance problems, compared with other commercial solutions, and (c) integration (compatibility) with any rehabilitative tool.;2013;2
Bilateral teleoperation technology is promising to enable remote assessment for patients in remote location. In this paper intercontinental bilateral teleoperation between National institutes of health in USA and Seoul national university Bundang hospital in Korea is implemented for remote assessment of impaired elbow with patients post stroke. Three assessment tasks, passive ROM test, muscle strength test, and spasticity test, were conducted by using a bilateral teleoperation system, which includes the master/slave devices and bilateral control law. Through clinical test with twelve stroke patients, the real-time remote assessment was evaluated by comparing clinical results of remote assessment and in-person assessment.;2013;2
Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs reduce recurrent events, improve risk factors and enhance quality of life through physical activity and education. However, only one-third of eligible patients attend a CR program. Availability of such programs is limited particular in areas with low levels of development and low population density. Therefore, innovative models for secondary prevention are necessary to increase access by adaption of such programs to the diversity of people and communities. Monitoring cardiovascular risk factors seems to be particularly appropriate for the use of telemedicine. This includes health applications to improve lifestyle by surveillance, education, psychological support and interactive motivational tools with the final goal of reducing metabolic risk factors and reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. So far, telemedical studies have mostly investigated electrocardiogram (ECG)-monitored exercise training at home and internet-based counseling for lifestyle modification in selected low-risk patients after an acute cardiac event. First reports of telerehabilitation in patients with heart failure are also promising. However, we need large scale prospective randomized studies to show that cardiac telerehabilitation is equally effective as it has been shown for exercise-based outpatient CR programs which are provided according to current standards and guidelines. Cardiac telerehabilitation is a promising new tool in particular to include patients in CR which are not living near a center-based CR program or who are not able to attend such a program for various reasons and to improve long-term adherence to a healthy lifestyle after center-based CR.;2013;2
Dynamic movements of the hand, fingers, and thumb are difficult to measure due to the versatility and complexity of movement inherent in function. An innovative approach to measuring hand kinematics is proposed and validated. The proposed system utilizes the Microsoft Kinect and goes beyond gesture recognition to develop a validated measurement technique of finger kinematics. The proposed system adopted landmark definition (validated through ground truth estimation against assessors) and grip classification algorithms, including kinematic definitions (validated against a laboratory-based motion capture system). The results of the validation show 78% accuracy when identifying specific markerless landmarks. In addition, comparative data with a previously validated kinematic measurement technique show accuracy of MCP +/- 10 degrees (average absolute error (AAE) = 2.4 degrees), PIP +/- 12 degrees (AAE = 4.8 degrees), and DIP +/- 11 degrees (AAE = 4.8 degrees). These results are notably better than clinically based alternative manual measurement techniques. The ability to measure hand movements, and therefore functional dexterity, without interfering with underlying composite movements, is the paramount objective to any bespoke measurement system. The proposed system is the first validated markerless measurement system using the Microsoft Kinect that is capable of measuring finger joint kinematics. It is suitable for home-based motion capture for the hand and, therefore, achieves this objective.;2013;2
Emerging information and communication technology is changing medical and psychological practice by enabling the provision of services across time and distance, yet there are significant concerns about these applications. Given the emerging nature of trial evidence in teleneurology, our aim is to provide a narrative review, in order to investigate possible oncoming fields of applications that are very important in healthcare practices delivered to patients affected by neurological diseases. We will focus on the use of Tele-Health in neurological practice, highlighting the potential benefits of applying information and communication technology also to psychosocial and educational aspects of neurological diseases treatment. This work is based on PubMed search, manual search of published abstracts/conference proceedings, and consultation with investigators in neurological disease. We refer also to the broader Tele-Health research concerning mental diseases. Tele-Health has obvious advantages in rural areas, where it improves access to health services, obviating the need for patients and healthcare workers to travel and assuring continuance to healthcare services delivery. Even in urban areas, however, Tele-Health can improve access to health services and to information. It may sometimes also be cheaper than conventional practice, even if there is generally limited knowledge of the cost-effectiveness of Tele-Health services compared to conventional methods of delivering health services.;2013;2
Geriatric rehabilitation facilitates therapeutic interventions whose purpose is to restore functional ability or enhance residual functional capability in elderly people with disabling impairments. Despite great demand for such interventions, limited research has been conducted in utilizing telemedicine to promote geriatric rehabilitation. Previously we reported successful implementation of physical telerehabilitation in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this article, we seek to extend our experience in implementing physical telerehabilitation systems to supporting home-based exercise in older adults. The goal of this report is to describe design and implementation of a geriatric telerehabilitation system facilitating safe cycling exercise at senior citizen homes.;2013;2
"In recent years, advances in motion detection, tracking, and classification have made applications in telerehabilition possible. Monitoring of the elderlies and physically impaired, sports medicine, and physical therapy, are some of the active research areas in telerehabilition. Furthermore, the gaming industry has provided some low-cost devices to track motion with reasonable accuracy; thus, making telerehabilition a reality for patients who need it. This project investigates the feasibility of using the Nintindo Wii Remote Controller as a handheld device that patients can use to perform repetitive motions in physical therapy sessions in a telerehabilitation setting. Patients can use such an instructional (or e-learning) system at home without the cost, effort, and time associated with visiting a medical office. At the same time, the public health care system also benefits from the deployment of these telerehabilitation systems.";2013;2
In the paper a research on enhanced experience of virtual reality supported balance training is presented. Haptic floor, mounted on the dynamic standing frame was used as a biofeedback at collisions in virtual environment. Electromyographic muscle activity of soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, semimembranosus, rectus femoris, tensor fasciae latae and erector spinae at the time of onset and recovery of postural perturbation were monitored using surface electrodes. 12 neurologically intact young adults participated in the research study. The main goal was to identify the differences in postural response strategies at collisions in the virtual world w/o haptic feedback. We found more dynamic responses in all subjects when applying haptic floor, especially in the ankle complex, stabilizing the tibia at the onset of perturbation. Choosing different strategies using the haptic floor may significantly enhance the telerehabilitation experience and thus increase the effectivness of the tele-balance training. Besides telerehabilitation, such system may be also effective for postural reponse assessment and thus simplified telediagnostics. However, the findings call for further study to support the proposed proof of concept.;2013;2
In this paper, a bilateral tele-rehabilitation system capable of providing haptic feedback to both the therapist and the patient is proposed. As internet is used for communication in the proposed system, the problem of time delay must be solved, which may give rise to loss of transparency and even instability. To address the problem, a control strategy is designed, which could deal with not only constant time delay, but also time-varying delay. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by experiments.;2013;2
In this paper, we show the feasibility of remotely controlling the elbow extension through functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the triceps muscle. Particularly, we present the experimental results obtained with the new automatic control method, designed to achieve position tracking between a user and the remote manipulator device. The major advantage of the controller is its ability to compensate for the electromechanical delay (EMD) during an FES and the communication delay (CD) due to a remote actuation. Another advantage of the developed FES controller is that only the error state and delay knowledge are required to elicit desired muscle contractions, i.e., the control implementation does not depend on model knowledge of highly nonlinear and time-varying muscle dynamics. The experimental results show its superior performance in comparison to the proportional integral derivative (PID) controller. The control performance of the PID controller and the new controller were tested for different values of a composite delay (EMD + CD).;2013;2
Inexpensive cycling equipment is widely available for home exercise however its use is hampered by lack of tools supporting real-time monitoring of cycling exercise in elderly and coordination with a clinical care team. To address these barriers, we developed a low-cost mobile system aimed at facilitating safe and effective home-based cycling exercise. The system used a miniature wireless 3-axis accelerometer that transmitted the cycling acceleration data to a tablet PC that was integrated with a multi-component disease management system. An exercise dashboard was presented to a patient allowing real-time graphical visualization of exercise progress. The system was programmed to alert patients when exercise intensity exceeded the levels recommended by the patient care providers and to exchange information with a central server. The feasibility of the system was assessed by testing the accuracy of cycling speed monitoring and reliability of alerts generated by the system. Our results demonstrated high validity of the system both for upper and lower extremity exercise monitoring as well as reliable data transmission between home unit and central server;2013;2
Limited research has been conducted in utilizing telemedicine to promote upper and lower limb rehabilitation using remotely controlled home-based ergometers. The goal of this study was to develop and assess a telerehabilitation system supporting internet-controlled home-based cycling exercise. We designed an interface to control cycling speed of an ergometer from a remote server via Internet. The evaluation of the interface included consecutive transmission of 7 different cycling speed levels, each level of 2-minute duration. Overall, the mean difference between remotely setup and actual cycling speed was 0.002+/-0.03 miles/hour. Our evaluation demonstrated high fidelity of the proposed system and reliability of controlling individualized exercise prescription for home-based cycling equipment via Internet.;2013;2
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of add-on distal upper limb robot-assisted treatment on the outcome of proximal regions. DESIGN: 64 chronic stroke patients divided into two groups participated in the study. Group A was assigned to the proximal robot-assisted rehabilitation, Group B to the proximal and distal. Shoulder/elbow subsection of Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale was collected for Group A, whereas for Group B wrist subsection was also collected. Motricity Index was used and a set of kinematic parameters was computed for both groups. RESULTS: A decrease in impairment after the treatment in both groups of patients (Group A: Shoulder/elbow FM p < 0.001 and MI p < 0.001; Group B: Shoulder/elbow FM p < 0.001 and MI p < 0.001) was found. In the Group B wrist subsection of FM showed an improvement as well (p < 0.001). No difference between groups was found in changes of clinical scales. Movement velocity and accuracy increased after the robot-assisted treatment in both groups; group B showed a greater improvement in velocity. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic treatment is effective to reduce motor impairment in chronic stroke patients even if distal training added to proximal segments in the Group B does not provide any incremental benefit to the proximal segments. It remains unclear if the effectiveness of robot-assisted treatment is directly related to the upper limb segment specifically treated and which order may lead to better outcome. Our study suggests that kinematic parameters should be computed in order to better clarify the role of distal training (wrist) on proximal segments (shoulder/elbow) as well.";2013;2
Objective: This pilot study investigates the use of telerehabilitation to improve upper limb performance in chronic stages of stroke recovery. Design: Intervention study with pre/post/one month follow-up tests. Methods: Seven adults with chronic stroke participated in the study. Tests consisted of lab-based clinical and kinematic assessments. Participants completed the Upper Limb Training and Assessment (ULTrA) program at home. Training was 5.days/week, 60 min/day for 6 weeks with intermittent supervision of participants. Results: Participants showed improvements in the training program tasks as well as clinical and kinematic assessments. Results also suggest there may be auxiliary benefits in cognitive function. Conclusions: A home-based telerehabilitation program is a viable approach to provide rehabilitation in chronic stages of stroke.;2013;2
"Objective: To compare the effectiveness of a new interactive virtual telerehabilitation system and a conventional programme following total knee arthroplasty. Design: Randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial. Participants: A total of 142 total knee arthroplasty. patients. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to receive either: (i) conventional out-patient physical therapy; or (ii) interactive virtual telerehabilitation system. The main outcome was function assessed with active range of knee movement. Other variables, such as muscle strength, walk speed, pain and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, were also collected. Comparisons were made on the basis of data collected routinely before surgery, at the end of the rehabilitation programme, and at 3 months follow-up. Quantitative variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. The agreed alpha risk for all hypothesis testing was 0.05. Results: Baseline characteristics between groups were comparable. All participants improved after the 2-week intervention on all outcome variables (p <0.05). Patients in the interactive virtual telerehabilitation group achieved improvements in the functional variables similar to those achieved in the conventional therapy group. Conclusion: A 2-week interactive virtual telerehabilitation programme is at least as effective as conventional therapy. Telerehabilitation is a promising alternative to traditional face-to-face therapies after discharge from total knee arthroplasty, especially for those patients who have difficulty with transportation to rehabilitation centres.";2013;2
"Objective: To determine whether conditions for use of clinical video telehealth technology might affect the accuracy of measures of physical function. Design: Repeated measures. Setting: Veterans Administration Medical Center. Participants: Three healthy adult volunteers for a sample size of n=30 independent trials for each of 3 physical function tasks. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Three tasks capturing differing aspects of physical function: fine-motor coordination (number of finger taps in 30s), gross-motor coordination (number of gait deviations in 10ft [3.05m]), and clinical spatial relations (identifying the proper height for a cane randomly preset +/- 0-2in [5.1cm] from optimal), with performance simultaneously assessed in person and video recorded. Interrater reliability and criterion validity were determined for the measurement of these 3 tasks scored according to 5 methods: (1) in person (community standard), (2) slow motion review of the video recording (criterion standard), and (3-5) full speed review at 3 Internet bandwidths (64kps, 384kps, and 768kps). Results: Fine-motor coordination Interrater reliability was variable (r=.43-.81) and criterion validity was poor at 64kps and 384kps, but both were acceptable at 768kps (reliability r=.74, validity beta=.81). Gross-motor coordination-Interreliability was variable (range r=.53-.75) and criterion validity was poor at all bandwidths (beta=.28-.47). Motionless spatial relations Excellent reliability (r=.92-.97) and good criterion validity (beta=.84-.89) at all the tested bandwidths. Conclusions: Internet bandwidth had differing effects on measurement validity and reliability for the fine-motor task, the gross-motor task, and spatial relations, with results for some tasks at some transmission speeds well below acceptable quality standards and community standards.

Objective: To investigate the short- and medium-term efficacy of counselling services provided remotely by telephone, video or internet, in managing mental health outcomes following spinal cord injury. Data sources: A search of electronic databases, critical reviews and published meta-analyses was conducted. Review methods: Seven independent studies (N = 272 participants) met the inclusion criteria. The majority of these studies utilized telephone-based counselling, with limited research examining psychological interventions delivered by videoconferencing (N-study = 1) or online (N-study = 1). Results: There is some evidence that telecounselling can significantly improve an individual's management of common comorbidities following spinal cord injury, including pain and sleep difficulties (d = 0.45). Medium-term treatment effects were difficult to evaluate, with very few studies providing these data, although participants have reported gains in quality of life 12 months after treatment (d = 0.88). The main clinical advantages are time efficiency and consumer satisfaction. Conclusion: The results highlight the need for further evidence, particularly randomized controlled trials, to establish the benefits and clinical viability of telecounselling.;2013;2
Objective:Tele-assessment techniques can provide healthcare professionals with easily accessible information regarding patients' clinical progress. Recently, kinematic analysis systems have been used to assess rehabilitative outcomes in stroke patients. Kinematic systems, however, are not compatible with tele-assessment. The objective of our study was to develop a tele-assessment system for acquiring kinematic data of forward reaching movements in stroke patients, with an emphasis on cost-effectiveness, portability, and ease of use.Materials and Methods:We selected four healthy control participants and eight hemiplegic stroke patients for our study. The stroke patients were classified as Brunnstrom stage III, stage IV, or stage V. Our tele-assessment system used two three-axes accelerometers, a potentiometer, a multifunctional data acquisition card, and two computers. A standardized kinematic system was applied simultaneously to validate the measurements recorded by our tele-assessment system during five repetitions of forward reaching movements.Results:The correlation coefficients of the reaching displacement, velocity, and acceleration measurements obtained using our tele-assessment system and the standardized kinematic system were 0.956, 0.896, and 0.727, respectively. Differences in the maximum reaching distance and the maximum reaching velocity of forward reaching movements were observed among the study groups. There were no significant differences in the time required to complete the testing session among the study groups.Conclusions:Our tele-assessment system is valid for the evaluation of upper-extremity reaching ability in stroke patients. Further research is needed to investigate the feasibility of the use of the tele-assessment system in patients' homes.;2013;2
One of the main challenges in implementing an optimal home-based exercise program in older adults and individuals with cardiovascular conditions is the requirement to ensure exercise safety and prevention of any undesirable side effects. A crucial component to achieve this requirement is the ability to monitor blood pressure (BP) during exercise. The goal of this project was to introduce and to test a practical low-cost solution for using pulse transit time (PTT) to estimate BP during exercise. Our approach was based on obtaining 3 calibration points during different levels of exertion for each subject and utilizing the resulting individualized BP estimation equitation for patient-specific monitoring of BP during home-based exercise. Evaluation of the proposed approach showed that the mean difference between reference systolic BP (SBP) and estimated systolic BP was 1.1 mmHg. Telecare systems can be enhanced by utilizing PTT-based individualized estimation equations for monitoring BP changes during exercise.;2013;2
Postural control disorders are among the most frequent motor disorder symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. This study aims to demonstrate the potential improvements in postural control among patients with multiple sclerosis who complete a telerehabilitation program that represents a feasible alternative to physical therapy for situations in which conventional treatment is not available. Fifty patients were recruited. Control group (n = 25) received physiotherapy treatment twice a week (40 min per session). Experimental group (n = 25) received monitored telerehabilitation treatment via videoconference using the Xbox 360 (R) and Kinect console. Experimental group attended 40 sessions, four sessions per week (20 min per session). The treatment schedule lasted 10 weeks for both groups. A computerized dynamic posturography (Sensory Organization Test) was used to evaluate all patients at baseline and at the end of the treatment protocol. Results showed an improvement over general balance in both groups. Visual preference and the contribution of vestibular information yielded significant differences in the experimental group. Our results demonstrated that a telerehabilitation program based on a virtual reality system allows one to optimize the sensory information processing and integration systems necessary to maintain the balance and postural control of people with multiple sclerosis. We suggest that our virtual reality program enables anticipatory PC and response mechanisms and might serve as a successful therapeutic alternative in situations in which conventional therapy is not readily available.;2013;2
Primary objective: Research has shown that traumatic brain injury (TBI) can affect a person's ability to perform previously learned skills. Dysexecutive syndrome and inattention, for example, alongside a number of other cognitive and behavioural impairments such as memory loss and lack of motivation, significantly affect day-to-day functioning following TBI. This study examined the efficacy of video modelling in emerging speech in an adult male with TBI caused by an assault. Research design: In an effort to identify functional relations between this novice intervention and the target behaviour, experimental control was achieved by using within-system research methodology, overcoming difficulties of forming groups for such an highly non-homogeneous population. Methods and procedures: Across a number of conditions, the participant watched a videotape in which another adult modelled a selection of 19 spoken words. When this modelled behaviour was performed in vivo, then generalization across 76 other words in the absence of a videotape took place. Main outcomes and results: It was revealed that video modelling can promote the performance of previously learned behaviours related to speech, but more significantly it can facilitate the generalization of this verbal behaviour across untrained words. Conclusions: Video modelling could well be added within the rehabilitation programmes for this population.;2013;2
Primary objective: To investigate the feasibility of implementing the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance approach (CO-OP) in a telerehabilitation format and to examine its impact on community integration and executive dysfunction for adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Research design: A pilot series of three case studies with 3-month follow-up was conducted. Methods and procedures: Three adults (all males, >10 years post-TBI) and their significant others were recruited. The CO-OP intervention, a meta-cognitive approach, was delivered through videoconferencing via Internet to train three of five participant-identified goals. Two goals were not trained to allow examination of transfer. Outcome measures included the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 Participation Index, and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire. Descriptive statistical analysis was used. Main outcomes and results: The CO-OP approach administered in a telerehabilitation format was found to be feasible. All participants indicated self-reported improvement in both trained and untrained goals. Trends toward fewer symptoms of executive dysfunction and greater community integration were demonstrated. All participants expressed satisfaction with the Internet delivery method. Conclusions: Telerehabilitation shows promise as a way to deliver the CO-OP approach and may help promote community integration of individuals living with TBI. Further study is warranted.;2013;2
Rationale Because many individuals poststroke lack access to the quality and intensity of rehabilitation to improve upper extremity motor function, a home-based robotic-assisted upper extremity rehabilitation device is being paired with an individualized home exercise program. Aims/Hypothesis The primary aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of robotic-assisted home therapy compared with a home exercise program on upper extremity motor recovery and health-related quality of life for stroke survivors in rural and underserved locations. The secondary aim is to explore whether initial degree of motor function of the upper limb may be a factor in predicting the extent to which patients with stroke may be responsive to a home therapy approach. We hypothesize that the home exercise program intervention, when enhanced with robotic-assisted therapy, will result in significantly better outcomes in motor function and quality of life. Design A total of 96 participants within six-months of a single, unilateral ischemic, or hemorrhagic stroke will be recruited in this prospective, single-blind, multisite randomized clinical trial. Study Outcomes The primary outcome is the change in upper extremity function using the Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes include changes in: upper extremity function (Wolf Motor Function Test), upper extremity impairment (upper extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer Test), self-reported quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale), and affect (Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale). Discussion Similar or greater improvements in upper extremity function using the combined robotic home exercise program intervention compared with home exercise program alone will be interpreted as evidence that supports the introduction of in-home technology to augment the recovery of function poststroke.;2013;2
Rehabilitation medicine is the medical specialty that integrates rehabilitation as its core therapeutic modality in disability management. More than a billion people worldwide are disabled, and the World Health Organization has developed the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as a framework through which disability is addressed. Herein, we explore paradigm shifts in neurorehabilitation, with a focus on restoration, and provide overviews on developments in neuropharmacology, rehabilitation robotics, virtual reality, constraint-induced therapy and brain stimulation. We also discuss important issues in rehabilitation systems of care, including integrated care pathways, very early rehabilitation, early supported discharge and telerehabilitation. Finally, we highlight major new fields of rehabilitation such as spasticity management, frailty and geriatric rehabilitation, intensive care and cancer rehabilitation.;2013;2
Several studies have shown that both virtual and augmented reality are technologies suitable for rehabilitation therapy due to the inherent ability of simulating real daily life activities while improving patient motivation. In this paper we will first present the state of the art in the use of virtual and augmented reality applications for rehabilitation of motor disorders and second we will focus on the analysis of the results of our project. In particular, requirements of patients with cerebrovascular accidents, spinal cord injuries and cerebral palsy to the use of virtual and augmented reality systems will be detailed.;2013;2
Studies have shown that pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can help to restore or enhance residual functional capacity and improve quality of life. Home-based telemedicine systems can promote comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients. Successful acceptance of such systems depends on how well they reflect needs, values and preferences of older adults with COPD. However, patient-centered characteristics of pulmonary telerehabilitation systems were not systematically defined particularly in older adults. The goal of this pilot study was to assess older COPD patient acceptance of pulmonarytelerehabilitation and to develop patient-centered characteristics of computer technology to support pulmonary rehabilitation at homes of older adults with COPD based on their values, needs, and preferences. A prototype pulmonarytelerehabilitaton system was developed and demonstrated to patients. The system feasibility and acceptance was assessed by identifying patient ability to operate the system independently and by collecting open-ended feedback via semi-structured qualitative interview and attitudinal surveys. Older adults found this technology easy to operate and potentially useful personal rehabilitation. Patient-centered specifications of a comprehensive pulmonary telerehabilitation system in older adults with COPD were identified.;2013;2
"Study Design. A descriptive study of repeated measures using a crossover design. Objective. To determine the level of agreement between assessments obtained via telerehabilitation and those obtained by traditional face-to-face method in a population of individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP) in a primary care setting. Summary of Background Data. Musculoskeletal assessment using telerehabilitation has shown adequate inter-and intrarater agreement and concordance with face-to-face clinical assessment in different diseases. There have been no published studies on the reliability of a telerehabilitation system to assess LBP. Methods. Fifteen individuals (6 males; mean age, 37 yr) with chronic LBP attended a session for a clinical interview, followed by face-to-face and real-time online telerehabilitation evaluations. There was a 30-minute interval between the 2 assessments, the order of which was randomly selected for each patient. The telerehabilitation system used an Internet application conducted via Internet connection (17 kB/s) between 2 personal computers. Real-time video connection facilitated communication between the therapist and the subject. Outcome measures included lumbar spine mobility, Sorensen test, anterior straight leg raise test, Oswestry Disability Index, visual analogue scale for pain, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire, and Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale. Results. The a reliability between face-to-face and telerehabilitation evaluations was more than 0.80 for 7 of the 9 outcome measures. Lowest reliability was for lateral flexion range of motion (alpha = 0.75). Very good inter-and intrarater intraclass correlation coefficients (rho) were obtained (0.92 0.96). Conclusion. The findings of our pilot study suggest that this telerehabilitation system may be useful to assess individuals with chronic LBP, providing initial support for its implementation in primary care.";2013;2
Study design: Single-blind randomized controlled trial of 6 months' duration. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of a novel telehealth intervention, 'CareCall', on reducing pressure ulcers and depression and enhancing the use of appropriate health care. Setting: General community, Massachusetts and Connecticut, United States Methods: 'CareCall' is an automated, interactive voice response system that combines patient education, cognitive behavioral interventions, screening and referrals, with alerts to a nurse telerehabilitation coordinator for direct non-emergent phone follow up. Participants consisted of a convenience sample of 142 persons with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury using a wheelchair >6h per day. The intervention group received CareCall (n = 71) The control group received usual care (n = 71). The main outcome measures were: The pressure ulcer scale for healing tool, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression scale, Cornell Services Index and Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors-Short Form Question 5. Results: CareCall achieved a reduction in presence of pressure ulcers at 6 months in women (P<0.0001). Among those with baseline depression, CareCall reduced 6-month severity of depression, adjusting for age and gender (P<0.047). CareCall did not have a significant impact on health-care utilization (OR=1.8, P=0.07), but did significantly improve participants' report of health-care availability (OR=2.03, P<0.04). Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of a largely automated telehealth intervention for adults with spinal cord dysfunction. Future research needs to replicate this study in a larger, multisite trial.;2013;2
Telehealth systems represent an ICT solution for delivering health services to the patients from a distance (Patient to Doctor/Doctor to Patient systems, P2D and D2P) or facilitating the consultation between the health professionals (Doctor to Doctor systems, D2D). Whether P2D/D2P systems aim at defining an interaction between the two involved figures crossing the boundaries of the hospital, D2D systems foster a professional interaction between physicians, typically for a second opinion or for a collaborative approach to the treatment. In this paper we present a collaborative extension of a system for telerehabilitation (patent pending), belonging to the P2D category, in order to include also some D2D features. The proposed extension promotes a collaborative scenario involving several actors with different roles and privileges on the system: the patient, the physiotherapist, the physiatrist, a consulting specialist and the administrator. All the involved figures interact through the telehealth system thanks to an expressly designed software infrastructure. The main P2D information flow is ensured by the telerehabilitation kit, able to record and send over the internet the statistics on the main performance parameters extracted during the home rehabilitation sessions. Beyond the administrator, the system enables the interactions between the other figures (D2D) in order to propose, validate and comment possible rehabilitation protocol modifications in response to the performance trend of the patient, taking into account the possible effect of different systemic treatments the patient is subjected to. The design of such a collaborative framework descends from an engineering analysis of the experience gained in the context of the ongoing experimental trials about hand rehabilitation of rheumatic patients with the P2D system.;2013;2
Telemedicine allows prompt assessment of acute stroke patients. This new technology has increased the administration of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) to eligible patients. In addition, telemedicine is being utilized in the rehabilitation of patients with cerebrovascular disease. This article will review the use of telemedicine in patients with acute ischemic stroke and its implementation in telerehabilitation to patients with residual neurologic deficits.;2013;2
Telemedicine for acute stroke care is supported by a literature base. It remains unclear whether or not the use of telemedicine for other phases of stroke care is beneficial. The authors conducted a systematic review of the published literature on telemedicine for the purposes of providing post-stroke care. Studies were included if the title or abstract expressed use of two-way audio/video communication for post-stroke care. From an initial yield of 1,405 potentially eligible hits, two reviewers ultimately identified 24 unique manuscripts to undergo functionality, application, technology, and evaluative (F.A.TE.) scoring. Each article was classified using a scoring rubric to assess the functionality, application, technology, and evaluative stage. It was found that most post-stroke telemedicine studies evaluated rehabilitation of adults. All primary data manuscripts were small and preliminary in scope and evaluative phase, and median F.A.T.E. score for primary data was 2. The use of telemedicine for post-stroke care is nascent and is primarily focused on post-stroke rehabilitation.;2013;2
Telerehabilitation can offer prolonged rehabilitation for patients with stroke after being discharged from the hospital, whilst remote diagnostics may reduce the frequency of the outpatient services required. Here, we compared a novel telerehabilitation system for virtual reality-supported balance training with balance training with only a standing frame and with conventional therapy in the hospital. The proposed low-cost experimental system for balance training enabling multiple home systems, real-time tracking of task's performance and different views of captured data with balance training, consists of a standing frame equipped with a tilt sensor, a low-cost computer, display, and internet connection. Goal-based tasks for balance training in the virtual environment proved motivating for the participating individuals. The physiotherapist, located in the remote healthcare center, could remotely adjust the level of complexity and difficulty or preview the outcomes and instructions with the application on the mobile smartphone. Patients using the virtual reality-supported balance training showed an improvement in the task performance time of 45% and number of collisions of 68%, showing significant improvements in the Berg Balance Scale, Timed 'Up and Go', and 10 m Walk Test. The clinical outcomes were not significantly different from balance training with only the standing frame or conventional therapy. The proposed telerehabilitation can facilitate the physiotherapists' work and thus enable rehabilitation to a larger number of patients after release from the hospital because it requires less time and infrequent presence of the clinical staff. However, a comprehensive clinical evaluation is required to confirm the applicability of the concept.;2013;2
Telerehabilitation has become a reality with the advances of communication and sensing technologies. The past decade has seen much research work done in rehabilitation using sophisticated devices and complex computations. A recent research trend has emerged with the proliferation of gaming devices and sensors. This work investigates rehabilitation of wrist and arm using the affordable Nintendo Wii Remote controller with an USB-equipped personal computer. Other gaming devices such as Microsoft's Kinect are discussed. The impact of positional displacement of the controller is examined. The sensitive of the controller with respect to prescribed motions is studied. Extensive experiments performed with various controllers, motions, and people are discussed. Conclusions are drawn on the suitability of using the Wii Remote controller in rehabilitation.;2013;2
Telerehabilitation may be an alternative service delivery model for people with Parkinson disease (PD) who live in areas where traditional rehabilitation services are not readily accessible. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy and reliability of performing remote physical assessments of people with PD via telerehabilitation when compared with traditional face-to-face assessments. Twelve subjects were simultaneously examined by a face-to-face investigator and a remote investigator via the eHAB telerehabilitation system. The outcome measures evaluated included the timed stance test, Timed Up and Go test, step test, steps in 360 degree turn, Berg Balance Scale, and lateral and functional reach tests. Limits of agreements intervals and weighted kappa statistics demonstrated the telerehabilitation assessments to be accurate within clinically acceptable limits. A high level of inter- and intrarater reliability was demonstrated across all telerehabilitation assessments. This study indicates that it is possible to assess the physical ability of people with PD via telerehabilitation systems and provides support for the further development of telerehabilitation applications for patients with neurological disorders.;2013;2
The ability to orient in space constitutes a main sign of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presently, a peculiar aspect of topographical disorientation in AD linked with spatial reference frame congruence appears to have been only minimally investigated. We aim to study whether there is a decline in performing the allo- to egocentric translation of spatial knowledge during different types of wayfinding in AD patients. We introduced two virtual reality tasks, the VR-Maze and VR-Road Map tasks, in which we compared 26 AD and 26 healthy, elderly subjects. The results emphasize that there is a specific reduction in performing allo- to egocentric spatial tasks in AD, whereas this reduction is not as evident in equivalent allocentric spatial tasks. The data are consistent with the neurological results regarding the early degeneration of the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex in AD, which underlies the ability to translate between these two reference frames.;2013;2
The ArmAssist, developed by Tecnalia, is a system for at-home telerehabilitation of post-stroke arm impairments. It consists of a wireless mobile base module, a global position and orientation detection mat, a PC with display monitor, and a tele-rehabilitation software platform. This paper presents the recent development results on the mobile module augmenting its functionality by adding actuation components. Three DC servo motors were employed to drive the mobile module and a position control algorithm based on the kinematic model and velocity mode control was implemented such that the module tracks a path defined in the training software. Pilot tests of the powered mobile module were performed in experiments with different load conditions and two unimpaired subjects. Both test results show that the module is able to follow the pre-defined path within an acceptable error range for reach movement training. Further study and testing of the system in realistic conditions following stroke will be a future topic of research.;2013;2
The electronic databases Cochrane, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS were searched to collect evidence on the impact of community-based Internet interventions for adult patients with osteoarthritis (OA) on health outcomes. Five studies met our review criteria. We found that Internet-based OA self-management interventions modestly but significantly improved four of six health status measures compared with usual care and have been met with high acceptance and high user satisfaction. Preventive physiotherapy exercise delivered via videoconferencing for patients with OA-related knee pain significantly improved health measures including pain, stiffness, and physical function compared with the initial health status. Postoperative rehabilitation performed by a physical therapist via videoconferencing and in-person resulted in similar health measure improvements. The review findings show that the Internet may be successfully used as a medium for providing community-based self-management and rehabilitation interventions in OA.;2013;2
"The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of upper limb robot-assisted treatment in a group of 25 subacute post-stroke patients using clinical outcome measures and kinematic parameters. Fugl-Meyer (FM) Assessment scale and Motricity Index (MI) were used for clinical assessment, and a set of kinematic parameters was computed. A significant decrease in motor impairment after the robot-assisted treatment (FM p < 0.05 and MI p < 0.05) was found. Significant improvements of upper limb motor performance was found after 2 weeks (p < 0.001); subsequently, no further significant improvements were observed. Our results confirm that robotic treatment is effective to reduce upper limb motor impairment in subacute stroke patients. Kinematic parameters can provide important information on mechanisms underlying motor recovery and the frequent assessment of their values can contribute to identify an appropriate number of robotic therapy sessions as to reach soon substantial improvements.";2013;2
The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of upper limb robot-assisted treatment in chronic post-stroke patients using clinical outcome measures and kinematic parameters. Thirty-two chronic stroke patients participated in the study. Fugl-Meyer (FM) Assessment scale and Motricity Index (MI) were used for clinical assessment, and a set of kinematic parameters was computed. A significant decrease in motor impairment after the robot-assisted treatment (FM p<0.001 and MI p<0.001) was found. Movement mean velocity (p<0.001) and accuracy (p<0.05) increased. Robotic treatment is effective to reduce motor impairment in chronic stroke patients. The exclusive use of clinical scales do not provide an exhaustive evaluation of effectiveness of treatment and our study suggests that kinematic parameters should be computed as well.;2013;2
The paper aims to systematize the work associated with the consolidation of the geographically distributed Living Lab for the development of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems and services. The paper presents the developed methodological approach, the general architecture that supports the development of AAL applications, the implemented physical infrastructure and also an instantiation of the existing infrastructure for the implementation of a telerehabilitation service.;2013;2
this paper introduces a novel service oriented pilot platform developed to support Tele-Supervised rehabilitation programs for patients after hospitalization in Intensive Care Units. The platform is developed under the framework of the TeleRehabilitation project funded by the Cross Border Cooperation Programme Greece Cyprus 2007 - 2013 in order to successfully meet the main technological and clinical objectives of the project. The design and development of the platform is based on composite service architecture (aggregates smaller and fine-grained services such as Web Based applications, Clinical Information Systems and Video Communication Systems). The platform delivers sustainable, maintainable and high quality services and enables multiparty, interregional bidirectional audio/visual communication between clinical practitioners and post-ICU patients, enables patient group-based vital sign real time monitoring, individualized and group-based patient online training and patients clinical record bookkeeping.;2013;2
"This study aimed at exploring patients' perceptions regarding telerehabilitation services received post total knee replacement. In this qualitative embedded single case study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with five patients who had previously received in-home telerehabilitation post total knee arthroplasty. Participants were asked to reflect on their 8-week rehabilitation process and on their experience with the home telerehabilitation program. Interviews were transcribed and a qualitative thematic analysis was conducted. Six overarching themes emerged from the patients' perceptions: (1) improving access to services with reduced need for transportation; (2) developing a strong therapeutic relationship with therapist while maintaining a sense of personal space; (3) complementing telerehabilitation with in-person visits; (4) providing standardized yet tailored and challenging exercise programs using telerehabilitation; (5) perceived ease-of-use of telerehabilitation equipment; and (6) feeling an ongoing sense of support. Gaining a better understating of the patient's experience in telerehabilitation will be essential as programs continue to be developed and implemented.";2013;2
"To gain insight into factors which may influence future acceptance of dysphagia management via telerehabilitation, patients' perceptions were examined before and after a telerehabilitation assessment session. Forty adult patients with dysphagia (M = 66 years, SD = 16.25) completed pre- and post-session questionnaires which consisted of 14 matched questions worded to suit pre- and post-conditions. Questions explored comfort with the use of telerehabilitation, satisfaction with audio and video quality, benefits of telerehabilitation assessments and patients' preferred assessment modality. Questions were rated on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 3 = unsure, 5 = strongly agree). Patients' comfort with assessment via telerehabilitation was high in over 80% of the group both pre- and post-assessment. Pre-assessment, patients were unsure what to expect with the auditory and visual aspects of the videoconference, however there were significant positive changes reported post-experience. In relation to perceived benefits of telerehabilitation services in general, most patients believed in the value of telerehabilitation and post-assessment this increased to 90-100% agreement. Although 92% felt they would be comfortable receiving services via telerehabilitation, 45% of patients indicated ultimate preference for a traditional face-to- face assessment. The data highlight that patients are interested in and willing to receive services via telerehabilitation; however, any concerns should be addressed pre-assessment.";2013;2
Traditional rehabilitation treatment includes repetitive and tedious exercises for the patient. The use of computer games can motivate and engage the patients attention, making the rehabilitation process more pleasant and attractive. In this context, this paper proposes an architecture that allows multiple users to take part simultaneously on a state of the art rehabilitation process using robots and computer games. The main components of this architecture are the impedance control system adopted by the therapy robots, the client-server communication structure (Telerehabilitation server) and the human machine interface based on a serious game. Preliminary experimental tests, involving a cooperative game with two users and individual robots, clearly demonstrate how the experience of the players may be influenced by impedance control.;2013;2
"Use of telecommunication technology to tackle medical accessibility challenges, termed 'Telemedicine', is getting attention from researchers around the world. Realizing such a system in low bandwidth network is even more challenging; majorly due to the heavy data payload caused by video frames. This paper introduces some innovative features so that a regular video conferencing solution can be designed which will be able to function satisfactorily under low bandwidth networks. This work also focuses on categorizing the video transmission into different streaming priority classes based on parameters such as frame rate and resolution, which are important in varying medical applications, in order to achieve a minimum standard across all network speeds starting from as low as 128kbps. Analysis of these classes show that the innovative methods used in reducing the huge data payload of video data indeed are effective and help in making the telemedicine application in low-bandwidth networks a reality.";2013;2
We developed a telehealth system to administer an autism assessment remotely. The remote assessment system integrates videoconferencing, stimuli presentation, recording, image and video presentation, and electronic assessment scoring into an intuitive software platform. This is an advancement over existing technologies used in telemental health, which currently require several devices. The number of children, adolescents, and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has increased dramatically over the past 20 years and is expected to continue to increase in coming years. In general, there are not many clinicians trained in either the diagnosis or treatment of adults with ASD. Given the number of adults with autism in need, a remote assessment system can potentially provide a solution to the lack of trained clinicians. The goal is to make the remote assessment system as close to face-to-face assessment as possible, yet versatile enough to support deployment in underserved areas. The primary challenge to achieving this goal is that the assessment requires social interaction that appears natural and fluid, so the remote system needs to be able to support fluid natural interaction. For this study we developed components to support this type of interaction and integrated these components into a system capable of supporting the entire autistic assessment protocol. We then implemented the system and evaluated the system on real patients. The results suggest that we have achieved our goal in developing a system with high-quality interaction that is easy to use.;2013;2
We evaluated the safety and feasibility of home telerehabilitation for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Eight patients with mean age of 66 years and moderately impaired lung function took part. The telerehabilitation equipment in the participant's home included an exercise bicycle, a tablet computer with webcam for low bandwidth videoconferencing, and a pulse oximeter positioned so that the display was visible while videoconferencing. Participants undertook supervised aerobic training twice a week for eight weeks, with two participants and a physiotherapist attending each class via videoconferencing from separate locations. Primary outcomes were adverse events, sessions attended and system usability. Secondary outcomes were the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). No significant adverse events occurred during the study. Participants attended 76% of possible sessions. System usability ratings were excellent when sessions were delivered via the university network (mean 94 out of 100) but lower when using the hospital network (mean 59 out of 100), with 67% of technical problems related to data network capability. Five participants completed the programme, with clinically significant improvements in 6MWD (mean 27 m, SD 40) and CRQ dyspnoea (4 units, SD 4). Simple home-based telerehabilitation using readily available equipment is safe and feasible for people with COPD. Effective delivery of telerehabilitation requires an adequate data network.;2013;2
We investigated the feasibility of a long-term telerehabilitation service for COPD patients comprising exercise training at home, telemonitoring and education/self-management. The service was offered as a 2-year follow-up programme by a physiotherapist. Equipment included a treadmill, a pulse oximeter and a tablet computer. Participants had weekly videoconference sessions with the physiotherapist. A website was used to access a training programme and to fill in a daily diary and a training diary. Ten patients with moderate or severe COPD participated in a pilot study in Northern Norway. After more than one year, all participants were still participating actively and no drop-outs had occurred. On average, there were 2.0 training sessions/week, 3.3 measurements/week registered via the website and 0.5 videoconference contacts/week. There was a reduction of 27% in the COPD-related hospital costs. Feedback from the participants was very positive. Long-term telerehabilitation of COPD patients at home is feasible and interim results suggest that it reduces healthcare utilization.;2013;2
"We systematically reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of tele-neurorehabilitation (TNR) applications. The review included recent reports on rehabilitation for any disability associated with a neurological deficit or condition. Study quality was assessed using an approach that considered both study performance and study design. Judgements were made on whether each application had been successful, and whether further data were needed to establish the application as suitable for routine use. Nineteen credible studies that reported patient outcomes or administrative changes were identified. These studies related to 13 conditions. The focus of rehabilitation included Internet-supported treatments for management of fatigue, pain and depression; promotion of physical activity; and speech therapy. Sixteen studies were of high or good quality and three were fair to good, with some limitations. In 13 of the 19 studies the TNR application was successful in providing at least equivalent outcomes to conventional approaches. Additional work would be needed on eight applications to establish suitability for routine use, and would be desirable in five. Thus the recent literature provides further support for TNR applications, showing the promise of this field in a number of areas. However, the database of credible studies remains small.";2013;2
"When designing a complete system of daily-telerehabilitation it should be borne in mind that properly designed methodologies should be furnished for patients to execute specific motion tasks and for care givers to assess the relevant parameters. Whether in hospital or at home, the system should feature two basic elements: (a) instrumented and walking aids or supports, (b) equipment for the assessment of parameters. Being gait the focus, the idea was to design, construct and validate - as an alternative to the complex and expensive instruments currently used - a simple, portable kit that may be easily interfaced/integrated with the most common mechanical tools used in motion rehabilitation (instrumented walkways, aids, supports), with feedback to both patient for self-monitoring and trainer/therapist (present or remote) for clinical reporting. The proposed system consists of: one step-counter, three couples of photo-emitter detectors, one central unit for collecting and processing the telemetrically transmitted data; a software interface on a dedicated PC and a network adapter. The system has been successfully validated in a clinical application on two groups of 16 subjects at the 1st and 2nd level of the Tinetti test. The degree of acceptance by subjects and care-givers was high. The system was also successfully compared with an Inertial Measurement Unit, a de facto standard. The portable kit can be used with different rehabilitation tools and different ground rugosity. The advantages are: (a) very low costs when compared with optoelectronic solutions and other portable solutions; (b) very high accuracy, also for subjects with imbalance problems; (c) good compatibility with any rehabilitative tool.

A position-synchronization controller for functional electrical stimulation (FES)-based telerehabilitation was designed. The developed controller synchronizes an FES-driven human limb with a remote physical therapist's manipulator despite constant bilateral communication delays. The control design overcomes a major stability analysis challenge: the unknown and unstructured nonlinearities in the FES-driven musculoskeletal dynamics. To address this challenge, the nonlinear muscle model was estimated through two neural networks with online update laws. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis was used to prove the globally uniformly ultimately bounded tracking performance. The control performance of the state synchronization controller is depicted using a simulation of an FES-elicited elbow extension that is remotely controlled by a manipulator.;2014;2
A wireless architecture of posturographic plate, conceived as a physical interface between the patient at home and a semi-immersive virtual environment of telerehabilitation exergaming, is proposed. The design is aimed at maximizing cost reduction as well as hardware and software flexibility, for integrating third-party rehabilitation applications with the exergaming-oriented approach in a telemedicine open development platform. Apart general-purpose bodyweight exercises, rehabilitation protocols based on twofold exergaming tasks for recovering (i) proprioceptive and manual dexterity, using the board by hands for postural motor coordination, and (ii) lower limb proprioception, using by trunk or feet (from sitting and standing posture) to control static and dynamic balance, are provided. The plate was validated experimentally at functional level by means of posturographic and exergame tests, emulating the shots on goal for soccer penalties. Moreover, results of clinical tests in comparison with a force measuring plate of a high-cost professional state-of-the-art system for posturographic analysis, both in normal and in pathological subjects, with open and closed eyes, highlighted encouraging performance and fostered industrial transfer.

Advancements in telecommunication technologies have been instrumental for the past few decades in making human life easier. Development of telemedicine technology made access to better medical care for the rural population ever more possible. However, telemedicine systems for rehabilitation purposes which are designed to work under low-bandwidth network conditions are rare to find. This work focuses on developing a low-bandwidth telerehabilitation system with customised consultation classes for the user to select from, depending on the requirements. Each class, with its preset parameter values, is discussed in detail demonstrating relevant rehabilitation exercises. A novel bandwidth adaptation algorithm is also presented for optimal utilisation of the dynamic network conditions. Experiment results show that the system is able to perform effectively in each consultation scenario while performing the rehabilitation exercises. The proposed bandwidth adaptation algorithm is also verified for its ability in adapting the content quality and for effectively utilising the network under constrained conditions.;2014;2
After stroke, intensive and active training is important to regain functional use of the arm and hand. By applying a telerehabilitation system (SCRIPT1) supporting active, distal arm practice at home, a patient can practice independently, which enables a larger dosage of treatment than possible during one-to-one supervised rehabilitation. Currently one of the major, but rarely addressed, questions concerning telerehabilitation is whether patients actually use such a system in a self-administered training approach. This paper presents preliminary results about feasibility of self-administered post-stroke home-based SCRIPT1 training. So far, data of 20 chronic stroke patients is available, who have trained for six weeks at home using interactive gaming exercises and a passive wrist/hand orthosis supporting hand opening (SCRIPT1). Findings so far indicated positive perceptions of usability and showed actual use of the system with a mean training duration of 107 min/week. This was accompanied by modest improvements in motor function and dexterity, correlated positively with training duration. These preliminary findings indicate that self-administered, technology-supported distal arm training at home is feasible for chronic stroke patients.;2014;2
Aim: This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive description of the methodologies used in home telemonitoring interventions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and to explore patients' adherence and satisfaction with the use of telemonitoring systems. Methods: A literature search was performed from June to August and updated until December of 2012 on Medline, Embase, Web of Science and B-on databases using the following keywords: [tele(-)monitoring, tele(-)health, tele(-)homecare, tele(-)care, tele-home health or home monitoring] and [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD]. References of all articles were also reviewed. Results: Seventeen articles were included, 12 of them published from 2010 to the present. The methodologies were similar in the training provided to patients and in the data collection and transmission processes. However, differences in the type of technology used, telemonitoring duration and provision of prompts/feedback, were found. Patients were generally satisfied and found the systems useful to help them manage their disease and improve healthcare provision. Nevertheless, they reported some difficulties in their use, which in some studies were related to lower compliance rates. Conclusions: Telemonitoring interventions are a relatively new field in COPD research. Findings suggest that these interventions, although promising, present some usability problems that need to be considered in future research. These adjustments are essential before the widespreading of telemonitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.;2014;2
"Anomia, a word-finding difficulty, is a frequent consequence of poststroke linguistic disturbance, associated with fluent and nonfluent aphasia that needs long-term specific and intensive speech rehabilitation. The present study explored the feasibility of telerehabilitation as compared to a conventional face-to-face treatment of naming, in patients with poststroke anomia. Five aphasic chronic patients participated in this study characterized by: strictly controlled crossover design; well-balanced lists of words in picture-naming tasks where progressive phonological cues were provided; same kind of the treatment in the two ways of administration. ANOVA was used to compare naming accuracy in the two types of treatment, at three time points: baseline, after treatment, and followup. The results revealed no main effect of treatment type (P = 0.844) indicating that face-to-face and teletreatment yielded comparable results. Moreover, there was a significant main effect of time (P = 0.0004) due to a better performance immediately after treatment and in the followup when comparing them to baseline. These preliminary results show the feasibility of teletreatment applied to lexical deficits in chronic stroke patients, extending previous work on telerehabilitation and opening new vistas for future studies on teletreatment of language functions.";2014;2
Background and purpose: There is little evidence available on the use of robot-assisted therapy in subacute stroke patients. A randomized controlled trial was carried out to evaluate the short-time efficacy of intensive robot-assisted therapy compared to usual physical therapy performed in the early phase after stroke onset. Methods: Fifty-three subacute stroke patients at their first-ever stroke were enrolled 30 +/- 7 days after the acute event and randomized into two groups, both exposed to standard therapy. Additional 30 sessions of robot-assisted therapy were provided to the Experimental Group. Additional 30 sessions of usual therapy were provided to the Control Group. The following impairment evaluations were performed at the beginning (T0), after 15 sessions (T1), and at the end of the treatment (T2): Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (FM), Modified Ashworth Scale-Shoulder (MAS-S), Modified Ashworth Scale-Elbow (MAS-E), Total Passive Range of Motion-Shoulder/Elbow (pROM), and Motricity Index (MI). Results: Evidence of significant improvements in MAS-S (p = 0.004), MAS-E (p = 0.018) and pROM (p < 0.0001) was found in the Experimental Group. Significant improvement was demonstrated in both Experimental and Control Group in FM (EG: p < 0.0001, CG: p < 0.0001) and MI (EG: p < 0.0001, CG: p < 0.0001), with an higher improvement in the Experimental Group. Conclusions: Robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation treatment can contribute to increasing motor recovery in subacute stroke patients. Focusing on the early phase of stroke recovery has a high potential impact in clinical practice.;2014;2
Background. Arm paresis remains a major impairment after stroke despite the best conventional rehabilitation. Randomized, controlled trials of intensive exercise programs have demonstrated improvements in arm function for patients with chronic stroke. However, the gains achieved have been relatively modest for the large investments in patient and therapist time. Objective. To evaluate the safety, acceptance, adherence, and effectiveness of a community-based exercise program for upper limb paresis in patients with chronic stroke and the effects of telerehabilitation monitoring in kiosks distributed through the community. Methods. Longitudinal cohort with geographic control group. The experimental group received devices needed for a home exercise program based on the Carr and Shepherd Motor Learning Program and were instructed to practice the exercises at least twice a week at the kiosk and at least 3 more days a week at home. The control group received usual care. Results. Compared with the control group, patients in the experimental group demonstrated significant gains in arm function as measured by the Wolf Motor Function Test, 9-Hole Peg Test, Motricity Index, and Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire. The intervention received high satisfaction ratings and produced no adverse events. Only 30% of the subjects attended kiosks regularly. Outcomes for this group did not differ significantly from those who only practiced at home. Conclusions. Home-and community-based exercise for arm paresis is safe and effective. Telerehabilitation interventions will need additional enhancements to improve effectiveness. The optimal upper extremity exercise prescription poststroke remains to be established.;2014;2
Background: A number of computerised treatments have been developed for aphasia, but few have remediated typing, an important functional task, and/or been implemented over the Internet via teletherapy, which can increase access to therapeutic services. The current study created a computerised version of Verb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) and administered it via telerehabilitation over the Internet. VNeST is a semantic treatment which seeks to improve lexical retrieval of words through the conceptual connection between verbs and thematic roles. Previous iterations of VNeST have shown improvement in both spoken and written lexical retrieval for people with moderate and moderate-to-severe aphasia.Aims: This study investigates changes to lexical retrieval with four hierarchical outcome measures. The research questions were: Does treatment using Computerised VNeST (VNeST-C) result in pre- to post-treatment increases in: (1) spoken and typed lexical retrieval of trained (e.g., The farmer is weighing the apples.) and untrained words (e.g., The carpenter is measuring the lumber.) in a picture description task, (2) untreated single-word naming accuracy of nouns and verbs in spoken and typed modalities, (3) spoken and typed lexical retrieval as measured by informative words, efficiency of production and complete utterances within discourse, and (4) standardised measures of cognitive and language abilities?Methods & Procedures: Two people with aphasia were treated three times per week for 8 weeks using the VNeST-C program. A single-subject experimental design was used to evaluate changes in trained and untrained stimuli and tasks. Additional pre-treatment and post-treatment testing was also conducted.Outcomes & Results: Results indicate improvements on lexical retrieval during sentence production of trained and untrained stimuli. Additional improvement was observed for single-word naming of untrained nouns and verbs in spoken and typed modalities and standardised measures of aphasia and writing-by-hand. Limited generalisation to discourse was also observed, including a general increase in word output and decrease in typed neologisms.Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the VNeST-C program and protocol have promise as a broadly generalising treatment for people with aphasia. With refinement of duration and intensity of the protocol, it may be a viable option for treating aphasia.;2014;2
"Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended as an important component of a comprehensive approach to cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. Data have shown that a small percentage of eligible patients participate in CR despite their well established benefits. Applying telerehabilitation provides an opportunity to improve the implementation of and adherence to CR. The purpose of the study was to evaluate a wide implementation and feasibility of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation (HTCR) in patients suffering from CVD and to assess its safety, patients' acceptance of and adherence to HTCR. Methods: The study included 365 patients (left ventricular ejection fraction 56 +/- 8%; aged 58 +/- 10 years). They participated in 4-week HTCR based on walking, nordic walking or cycloergometer training. HTCR was telemonitored with a device adjusted to register electrocardiogram (ECG) recording and to transmit data via mobile phone to the monitoring center. The moments of automatic ECG registration were pre-set and coordinated with CR. The influence on physical capacity was assessed by comparing changes - in time of exercise test, functional capacity, 6-min walking test distance from the beginning and the end of HTCR. At the end of the study, patients filled in a questionnaire in order to assess their acceptance of HTCR. Results: HTCR resulted in a significant improvement in all parameters. There were neither deaths nor adverse events during HTCR. Patients accepted HTCR, including the need for interactive everyday collaboration with the monitoring center. There were only 0.8% non-adherent patients. Conclusions: HTCR is a feasible, safe form of rehabilitation, well accepted by patients. The adherence to HTCR was high and promising.";2014;2
Background: eHealth potentially enhances quality of care and may reduce health care costs. However, a review of systematic reviews published in 2010 concluded that high-quality evidence on the benefits of eHealth interventions was still lacking. Objective: We conducted a systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the effectiveness/cost-effectiveness of eHealth interventions in patients with somatic diseases to analyze whether, and to what possible extent, the outcome of recent research supports or differs from previous conclusions. Methods: Literature searches were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and Scopus for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on eHealth interventions published between August 2009 and December 2012. Articles were screened for relevance based on preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. Citations of residual articles were screened for additional literature. Included papers were critically appraised using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement before data were extracted. Based on conclusions drawn by the authors of the included articles, reviews and meta-analyses were divided into 1 of 3 groups: suitable, promising, or limited evidence on effectiveness/cost-effectiveness. Cases of uncertainty were resolved by consensus discussion. Effect sizes were extracted from papers that included a meta-analysis. To compare our results with previous findings, a trend analysis was performed. Results: Our literature searches yielded 31 eligible reviews, of which 20 (65%) reported on costs. Seven papers (23%) concluded that eHealth is effective/cost-effective, 13 (42%) underlined that evidence is promising, and others found limited or inconsistent proof. Methodological quality of the included reviews and meta-analyses was generally considered high. Trend analysis showed a considerable accumulation of literature on eHealth. However, a similar percentage of papers concluded that eHealth is effective/cost-effective or evidence is at least promising (65% vs 62%). Reviews focusing primarily on children or family caregivers still remained scarce. Although a pooled (subgroup) analysis of aggregate data from randomized studies was performed in a higher percentage of more recently published reviews (45% vs 27%), data on economic outcome measures were less frequently reported (65% vs 85%). Conclusions: The number of reviews and meta-analyses on eHealth interventions in patients with somatic diseases has increased considerably in recent years. Most articles show eHealth is effective/cost-effective or at least suggest evidence is promising, which is consistent with previous findings. Although many researchers advocate larger, well-designed, controlled studies, we believe attention should be given to the development and evaluation of strategies to implement effective/cost-effective eHealth initiatives in daily practice, rather than to further strengthen current evidence.;2014;2
Background: Integrating rehabilitation services through wearable systems has the potential to accurately assess the type, intensity, duration, and quality of movement necessary for procuring key outcome measures. Objectives: This review aims to explore wearable accelerometry-based technology (ABT) capable of assessing mobility-related functional activities intended for rehabilitation purposes in community settings for neurological populations. In this review, we focus on the accuracy of ABT-based methods, types of outcome measures, and the implementation of ABT in non-clinical settings for rehabilitation purposes. Data sources: Cochrane, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, EMBASE, and IEEE Xplore. The search strategy covered three main areas, namely wearable technology, rehabilitation, and setting. Study selection: Potentially relevant studies were categorized as systems either evaluating methods or outcome parameters. Methods: Methodological qualities of studies were assessed by two customized checklists, depending on their categorization and rated independently by three blinded reviewers. Results: Twelve studies involving ABT met the eligibility criteria, of which three studies were identified as having implemented ABT for rehabilitation purposes in non-clinical settings. From the twelve studies, seven studies achieved high methodological quality scores. These studies were not only capable of assessing the type, quantity, and quality measures of functional activities, but could also distinguish healthy from non-healthy subjects and/or address disease severity levels. Conclusion: While many studies support ABT's potential for telerehabilitation, few actually utilized it to assess mobility-related functional activities outside laboratory settings. To generate more appropriate outcome measures, there is a clear need to translate research findings and novel methods into practice.;2014;2
Background: Large-scale multi-site experimental and clinical speech protocols require high-fidelity, easy-to-use speech recording technologies. However, little is known about the reliability and comparability of affordable, portable and commonly used technologies with traditional wellvalidated devices (e.g., a hard disc recorder with a high-quality microphone). Objective: To examine the comparability of speech and voice samples acquired from protocols involving high-and low-quality devices. Methods: Speech samples were acquired simultaneously from 15 healthy adults using four devices and analyzed acoustically for measures of timing and voice quality. For the purpose of making initial comparisons, methods were deemed comparable if the resultant acoustic data yielded root mean squared error values <= 10% and statistically significant Spearman's correlation coefficients. Results: The data suggest that there is significant and widespread variability in the quality and reliability between different acquisition methods for voice and speech recording. Not one method provided statistically similar data to the protocol using the benchmark device (i.e., a high-quality recorder coupled with a condenser microphone). Acoustic analysis cannot be assumed to be comparable if different recording methods are used to record speech. Conclusions: Findings have implications for researchers and clinicians hoping to make comparisons between labs or, where lower-quality devices are suggested, to offer equal fidelity. (C) 2015 S.

Background: The application of internet technology for telerehabilitation in patients with stroke has developed rapidly. Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of a bidirectional and multi-user telerehabilitation system on balance and satisfaction in patients with chronic stroke living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Method: This pilot study used a multi-site, blocked randomization design. Twenty-four participants from three LTCFs were recruited, and the participants were randomly assigned into the telerehabilitation (Tele) and conventional therapy (Conv) groups within each LTCF. Tele group received telerehabilitation but the Conv group received conventional therapy with two persons in each group for three sessions per week and for four weeks. The outcome measures included Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Barthel Index (BI), and the telerehabilitation satisfaction of the participants. Setting: A telerehabilitation system included. therapist end. in a laboratory, and the. client end. in LTCFs. The conventional therapy was conducted in LTCFs. Results: Training programs conducted for both the Tele and Conv groups showed significant effects within groups on the participant BBS as well as the total and self-care scores of BI. No significant difference between groups could be demonstrated. The satisfaction of participants between the Tele and the Conv groups also did not show significant difference. Conclusions: This pilot study indicated that the multi-user telerehabilitation program is feasible for improving the balance and functional activity similar to conventional therapy in patients with chronic stroke living in LTCFs.;2014;2
Background: The healthcare sector is a significant contributor to global carbon emissions, in part due to extensive travelling by patients and health workers. Objectives: To evaluate the potential of telemedicine services based on videoconferencing technology to reduce travelling and thus carbon emissions in the healthcare sector. Methods: A life cycle inventory was performed to evaluate the carbon reduction potential of telemedicine activities beyond a reduction in travel related emissions. The study included two rehabilitation units at Umea University Hospital in Sweden. Carbon emissions generated during telemedicine appointments were compared with care-as-usual scenarios. Upper and lower bound emissions scenarios were created based on different teleconferencing solutions and thresholds for when telemedicine becomes favorable were estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to pinpoint the most important contributors to emissions for different set-ups and use cases. Results: Replacing physical visits with telemedicine appointments resulted in a significant 40-70 times decrease in carbon emissions. Factors such as meeting duration, bandwidth and use rates influence emissions to various extents. According to the lower bound scenario, telemedicine becomes a greener choice at a distance of a few kilometers when the alternative is transport by car. Conclusions: Telemedicine is a potent carbon reduction strategy in the health sector. But to contribute significantly to climate change mitigation, a paradigm shift might be required where telemedicine is regarded as an essential component of ordinary health care activities and not only considered to be a service to the few who lack access to care due to geography, isolation or other constraints.;2014;2
Background: The incidence of strokes in industrialized nations is on the rise, particularly in the older population. In Canada, a minority of individuals who have had a stroke actually receive intensive rehabilitation because most stroke patients do not have access to services or because their motor recovery was judged adequate to return home. Thus, there is a considerable need to organize home-based rehabilitation services for everyone who has had a stroke. To meet this demand, telerehabilitation, particularly from a service center to the patient's home, is a promising alternative approach that can help improve access to rehabilitation services once patients are discharged home. Methods/Design: This non-inferiority study will include patients who have returned home post-stroke without requiring intensive rehabilitation. To be included in the study, participants will: 1) not be referred to an Intensive Functional Rehabilitation Unit, 2) have a Rankin score of 2 or 3, and 3) have a balance problem (Berg Balance Scale score between 46 and 54). Participants will be randomly assigned to either the teletreatment group or the home visits group. Except for the delivery mode, the intervention will be the same for both groups, that is, a personalized Tai Chi-based exercise program conducted by a trained physiotherapist (45-minute session twice a week for eight consecutive weeks). The main objective of this research is to test the non-inferiority of a Tai Chi-based exercise program provided via telerehabilitation compared to the same program provided in person at home in terms of effectiveness for retraining balance in individuals who have had a stroke but do not require intensive functional rehabilitation. The main outcome of this study is balance and mobility measured with the Community Balance and Mobility Scale. Secondary outcomes include physical and psychological capacities related to balance and mobility, participants' quality of life, satisfaction with services received, and cost-effectiveness associated with the provision of both types of services.;2014;2
"Background: This pilot study compared the effects of lexical-semantic stimulation through telecommunication technology (LSS-tele) with in-person LSS (LSS-direct) and unstructured cognitive treatment (UCS) in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with Alzheimer's disease in the very early stage (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]>26/30) were divided into three groups: seven patients received LSS-tele treatment, ten received standard LSS-direct intervention, and ten participants underwent UCS as control condition. Intervention treatments consisted of two weekly sessions of LSS (through teleconference or face to face depending on group assignment) or UCS exercises administered to small groups throughout a 3-month period. The main outcome measures were changes of global cognitive performance, language abilities, and memory function. Secondary outcome measures were changes in attention, working memory, executive functions, and visual-spatial abilities tests. Results: The mean MMSE score improved significantly in LSS-tele and LSS-direct treatments; LSS-tele improved language abilities, both phonemic and semantic, and stabilized delayed verbal episodic memory with respect to an improved performance after the LSS-direct intervention and to a memory decline observed in the control group. Improvement was not achieved in any neuropsychological test score after UCS. Conclusion: Clinical application of telecommunication technology to cognitive rehabilitation of elderly patients with neurodegenerative cognitive impairment is feasible and may improve global cognitive performance. Technical aspects to ameliorate efficacy of delivery may further improve its impact on domain-specific cognitive abilities.";2014;2
Background: Unfavorable reduction is considered one of the key factors leading to joint degeneration and compromised clinical outcome in acetabular fracture patients. Besides the columns, walls, and superior dome, the postoperative position of hip joint center (HJC), which is reported to affect hip biomechanics, should be considered during the assessment of quality of reduction. We aimed to evaluate the radiographic restoration of HJC in acetabular fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Methods: Patients with a displaced acetabular fracture that received open reduction and internal fixation in the authors' institution during the past five years were identified from the trauma database. The horizontal and vertical shifts of HJC were measured in the standard anteroposterior view radiographs taken postoperatively. The radiographic quality of fracture reduction was graded according to Matta's criteria. The relationships between the shift of HJC and the other variables were evaluated. Results: Totally 127 patients with 56 elementary and 71 associated-type acetabular fractures were included, wherein the majority showed a medial (89.0%) and proximal (93.7%) shift of HJC postoperatively. An average of 2.8 mm horizontal and 2.2 mm vertical shift of HJC were observed, which correlated significantly with the quality of fracture reduction (P < 0.001 for both). The horizontal shift of HJC correlated with the fracture type (P = 0.022). Conclusions: The restoration of HJC correlates with the quality of reduction in acetabular fractures following open reduction and internal fixation. Further studies are required to address the effects of HJC shift on the biomechanical changes and clinical outcomes of hip joint, especially in poorly reduced acetabular fractures.;2014;2
"Background:Back pain is a common and disabling condition for people in rural and remote areas. In these areas, access to rehabilitation services is limited by service availability. Telerehabilitation is suggested as a solution for providing physical therapy services; however, the validity of clinical assessment is largely unproven. The aim of this study was to establish the validity of clinically pragmatic remote assessment of spinal posture, active movements of the lumbar spine, and the passive straight leg raise (SLR) test.Subjects and Methods:Face-to-face physical therapist assessment was compared with telerehabilitation assessment of spinal posture, active movements of the lumbar spine, and the SLR test. Twenty-six participants recruited from a rural population with current or recent low back pain (LBP) were assessed by a face-to-face physical therapist and a remote physical therapist. Pain, disability, and clinical measurements were assessed. Outcomes were compared to establish agreement.Results:High levels of agreement were found with detecting pain with specific lumbar movements, eliciting symptoms, and sensitizing the SLR test. Moderate agreement occurred with identifying the worst lumbar spine movement direction, SLR range of motion, and active lumbar spine range of motion. Poor agreement occurred with postural analysis and identifying reasons for limitations to lumbar movements.Conclusions:Conducted in a rural clinical setting, this study validates elements of the physical assessment of the lumbar spine and identifies technical and clinical issues to be addressed by future research. Important components of the standard musculoskeletal assessment of LBP are valid via telerehabilitation in a clinical setting.";2014;2
"Balance and postural response strategies change when subjects are exposed to horizontal translations of the floor or virtual reality or both. This may impact the balance training strategy and balance capabilities assessment in the future telerehabilitation. In the study 15 neurologically intact volunteers participated. Balance standing frame with virtual reality tasks and our novel haptic floor able to generate horizontal translations were used. The postural responses were measured with center of gravity and muscle electromyography of plantar-dorsiflexors, quadriceps, hamstrings, hip and spine muscles in three scenarios. The results demonstrated that center of gravity and electromyographic activity were comparable; with low latency at translation only, longer latency at combination with virtual reality and long latency when only virtual reality was applied. Soleus and semimembranousis demonstrated lower latency at back-right horizontal translations when virtual reality was present. The outcomes suggests that the postural strategy changes from ankle to ankle-hip strategy with availability of additional sensory systems which may be an important issue for objective balance evaluation in the clinical environment and remote telerehabilitation.";2014;2
Current diagnosis and treatment of movement impairment post-stroke is based on the subjective assessment of select movements by a trained clinical specialist. However, modern low-cost motion capture technology allows for the development of automated quantitative assessment of motor impairment. Such outcome measures are crucial for advancing post-stroke treatment methods. We sought to develop an automated method of measuring the quality of movement in clinically-relevant terms from low-cost motion capture. Unconstrained movements of upper extremity were performed by people with chronic hemiparesis and recorded by standard and low-cost motion capture systems. Quantitative scores derived from motion capture were compared to qualitative clinical scores produced by trained human raters. A strong linear relationship was found between qualitative scores and quantitative scores derived from both standard and low-cost motion capture. Performance of the automated scoring algorithm was matched by averaged qualitative scores of three human raters. We conclude that low-cost motion capture combined with an automated scoring algorithm is a feasible method to assess objectively upper-arm impairment post stroke. The application of this technology may not only reduce the cost of assessment of post stroke movement impairment, but also promote the acceptance of objective impairment measures into routine medical practice.;2014;2
During the last decade, different robotic devices have been developed for motor rehabilitation of stroke survivors. These devices have been shown to improve motor impairment and contribute to the understanding of mechanisms underlying motor recovery after a stroke. The assessment of the robotic technology for rehabilitation assumes great importance. The aim of this study is to present preliminary results on the assessment of the acceptability of the robotic technology for rehabilitation on a group of thirty-four chronic stroke patients. The results from questionnaires on the patients' acceptability of two different robot-assisted rehabilitation scenarios show that the robotic approach was well accepted and tolerated by the patients.

Early intervention in Taiwan is facing the problems of restricted early intervention budget, rural-urban resource divide and unequal utilization, time and energy consuming for the caregivers and pupils making round trips for intervention services, and short treatment period, which are likely to affect the promotion and development of early intervention. As a consequence, this study coordinates with early intervention Center of National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), with the example of developmental movement disordered children, establishing Home-Based Rehabilitation Management System for early intervention and moving the rehabilitation treatment in hospitals to homes so that the time and medical cost for children making round trips to hospitals could be reduced and the rehabilitation effect on patients could be achieved through motion-sensing games. Being a Telecare-based caring platform with the combination of Cloud services and Kinect motion-sensing games, this system provides Cloud services of medical service (Early Intervention Center of the NTUH), Medical Information System of the NTUH, and homecare service at the user-end. In consideration of the scalability of the system, modular design is applied to the provided Cloud services for making adjustments according to the number of patients.;2014;2
Emerging mobile technologies enable new forms of interaction in the context of our everyday life - this has profound implications for delivering brain injury rehabilitation at a distance through technology, or cognitive telerehabilitation. However, a challenge lies in designing these technologies, as they require both clinical and technical expertise. This research aims to address this challenge through a co-design approach that brings together mobile technology experts and rehabilitation practitioners.;2014;2
Exercise based rehabilitation plays a vital role in the recovery of various conditions, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD), chronic pain, and so on. Recently, tele-rehabilitation has become increasingly popular quantitative nature in assessments particularly for systematic monitoring of progress as well as cost saving for the patients as well as for the health care sector at large. However, challenges do exist in implementing a distributed bio-feedback in a cost-effective and efficient way. In this paper, we present the associated conceptual framework of cloud-based tele-rehabilitation system employing affordable non-invasive Microsoft Kinect (R) allowing patients to perform rehabilitation exercises in non-clinical setting such as home environments without loosing the quality of patients care. More importantly, different from existing tele-rehabilitation systems, our system not only measures whether patients can perform rehabilitation tasks, but also how well they can finish the tasks. Preliminary experiments validate its potential in training healthy subject to perform exercise motions emulating the physical rehabilitation process.;2014;2
Falls are prominent among the causes of unintentional injury, particularly for the elderly, bringing serious socioeconomic impact to ageing societies. To address these challenges, ICT have recently demonstrated their potential in providing fall prevention solutions to the elderly. KINOPTIM project contributes towards this direction by developing a home-care solution that addresses falls in a preventive manner through training of seniors with the support of an interactive gaming platform. On top of the home care solution, KINOPTIM will implement a telemonitoring system that will follow the person's mobility status over time, and a Medical Business Intelligence (MBI) system will assist medical experts to diagnose impairments and related fall risks, to decide for proactive or active interventions. This paper presents the high level architecture of the KINOPTIM platform, comprising the game technologies as well as the sensing and decision support functionalities provided by the platform.;2014;2
In recent years, emergence of telerehabilitation systems for home-based therapy has altered healthcare systems. Telerehabilitation enables therapists to observe patients status via Internet, thus a patient does not have to visit rehabilitation facilities for every rehabilitation session. Despite the fact that telerehabilitation provides great opportunities, there are two major issues that affect effectiveness of telerehabilitation: relegation of the patient at home, and loss of direct supervision of the therapist. Since patients have no actual interaction with other persons during the rehabilitation period, they will become isolated and gradually lose their social skills. Moreover, without direct supervision of therapists, rehabilitation exercises can be performed with bad compensation strategies that lead to a poor quality recovery. To resolve these issues, we propose telelife, a new concept for future rehabilitation systems. The idea is to use media technology to create a totally new immersive media experience for rehabilitation. In telerehabilitation patients locally execute exercises, and therapists remotely monitor patients' status. In telelife patients, however, remotely perform exercises and therapists locally monitor. Thus, not only telelife enables rehabilitation at distance, but also improves the patients' social competences, and provides direct supervision of therapists. In this paper we introduce telelife to enhance telerehabilitation, and investigate technical challenges and possible methods to achieve telelife.;2014;2
In this paper, human viscosity perception in haptic teleoperation systems is thoroughly analyzed. An accurate perception of viscoelastic environmental properties such as viscosity is a critical ability in several contexts, such as telesurgery, telerehabilitation, telemedicine, and soft-tissue interaction. We study and compare the ability to perceive viscosity from the standpoint of detection and discrimination using several relevant control methods for the teleoperator. The perception-based method, which was proposed by the authors to enhance the operator's kinesthetic perception, is compared with the conventional transparency-based control method for the teleoperation system. The fidelity-based method, which is a primary method among perception-centered control schemes in teleoperation, is also studied. We also examine the necessity and impact of the remote-site force information for each of the methods. The comparison is based on a series of psychophysical experiments measuring absolute threshold and just noticeable difference for all conditions. The results clearly show that the perception-based method enhances both detection and discrimination abilities compare with other control methods. The results further show that the fidelity-based method confers a better discrimination ability than the transparency-based method, although this is not true with respect to detection ability. In addition, we show that force information improves viscosity detection for all control methods, as predicted from previous theoretical analysis, but improves the discrimination threshold only for the perception-based method.;2014;2

"Introduction: Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of executive functions (EFs) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) may be a crucial marker to detect patients at risk for developing dementia. The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control group (CG) using a traditional assessment of EFs and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality (VR)-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of EFs are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups. Materials and methods: The study included three groups of 15 individuals each (for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD-NC; 15 PD-MCI, and 15 cognitively healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning and the EFs, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the participants. The VMET was used for a more ecologically valid neuropsychological evaluation of EFs. Results: Findings revealed significant differences in the VMET scores between the PD-NC patients vs. the controls. In particular, patients made more errors in the tasks of the VMET, and showed a poorer ability to use effective strategies to complete the tasks. This VMET result seems to be more sensitive in the early detection of executive deficits because these two groups did not differ in the traditional assessment of EFs (neuropsychological battery). Conclusion: This study offers initial evidence that a more ecologically valid evaluation of EFs is more likely to lead to detection of subtle executive deficits.";2014;2
Introduction: Speech-language pathologists are anxious to adopt telehealth technologies but have encountered barriers such as limited reimbursement, state licensure laws, and medical information privacy laws. Moreover, speech-language pathologists are confronted with the hurdle of evolving face-to-face clinical practices into effective telehealth practice adapted to the current national infrastructure. Factors such as costs, availability of resources, and diagnostic/intervention and patient needs should be considered when selecting the telehealth infrastructure for service delivery. Understanding the new role of technology in the diagnosis and treatment of communication disorders is vital for the expansion of telehealth as a standard of care. The purpose of this article is to overview the current technologic infrastructure and procedures for telehealth applications in speech-language pathology (SLP) and the innate challenges and opportunities. Materials and Methods: A literature search was conducted for telehealth publications in the field of SLP. Given the rapid rate at which technology advances, only peer-reviewed articles published over the past 5 years (2008-2013) were included. Results: The majority of articles reviewed used hybrid methodologies to maintain traditional SLP service standards. General technological components for telehealth activities included computers, Web cameras, headsets with an embedded microphone, and Internet connectivity. Conclusions: Advanced technology has limitations in the application of telehealth. Technological adversities were not reported as the cause of discontinuation of telehealth services by the practitioner or the individual. Audio and visual disturbances were primarily associated with videoconferencing. Supplemental asynchronous technology was widely reported as a solution to real-time instabilities.;2014;2
Introduction: The limitations in performing functional activities in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy are important. The use of virtual reality systems is a new treatment approach that reinforces task-oriented motor learning. The purpose of this guide is to study the impact of the use of virtual reality systems in the improvement and acquisition of functional skills, and to evaluate the scientific evidence to determine the strength of recommendation of such interventions. Development: All available full-text articles, regardless of their methodology, were included. The following data bases were consulted: PubMed (Medline), PEDro, EMBASE (OVID-Elsevier), Cochrane Library, Medline (OVID), CINAHL, ISI Web Knowledge. An assessment was made of methodological quality, the level of scientific evidence, and the strength of recommendations using the tools: Critical Review Form - Quantitative Studies and the Guidelines for Critical Review Form - Quantitative Studies and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Finally, we included 13 articles and 97 participants were recruited. We obtained significant improvements in outcome measures that assessed postural control and balance, upper limb function, the selective joint control, and gait. Conclusions: The guide has some limitations: the limited number of patients enrolled, clinical diversity and age range, as well as the methodological quality of existing trials. Virtual reality is a promising tool in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy. There is strong scientific evidence of an acceptable recommendation for the use of virtual reality systems in the treatment of cerebral palsy. (C) 2011 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia.

"Introduction:Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety, although efficacious, typically requires 16-20 weekly sessions with a therapist. Brief CBT (BCBT; eight sessions) for child anxiety is promising but may have less favorable outcomes owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential to improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage youth in learning and practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo).Materials and Methods:We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cues youth to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to engage youth in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal. A pilot study with nine youth (9-14 years old) examined the platform's feasibility as an adjunct to BCBT.Results:SmartCAT was found to be capable of supporting BCBT for child anxiety and received positive feedback from both therapists and youth patients. Patients rated the app as highly usable (mean=1.7 on a 1-7 scale, with 1=easy). Patients completed 5.36 skills coach entries per session (standard deviation=1.95) and took an average of 3.14min (standard deviation=0.98min) to complete the entries.Conclusions:A smartphone app is feasible within CBT for child anxiety. Users found SmartCAT both acceptable and easy to use. Integrating an m-health platform within BCBT for anxious children may facilitate involvement in treatment and dissemination of effective procedures.";2014;2
"Lymphedema is a lifetime complication of breast cancer survivors that can limit their participation in recreational or strenuous daily activities. Follow-up of lymphedema using an Internet application could help patients to determine the influence on their condition of these activities and adapt them accordingly. We aimed to determine the level of agreement between lymphedema assessment by telerehabilitation and by the traditional face-to-face method. Thirty breast cancer survivors participated in a descriptive study of repeated measures using a crossover design. Patients attended a session for clinical face-to-face and real-time online telerehabilitation assessments of lymphedema. There was a 120-min interval between these two sessions. The order of sessions was randomly selected for each patient. A caregiver (relative or friend) conducted the telerehabilitation assessment using a system that includes a specific tool based on an arm diagram for measuring the participant's arm circumferences via a telehealth application. All outcome measures showed reliability estimates (alpha) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.90; the lowest reliability was obtained for the total volume on the non-affected side (alpha = 0.90). The diagnosis of lymphedema by the two methods also showed good inter-rater reliability (Rho = 0.89). These preliminary findings support the use of an Internet-based system to assess lymphedema in breast cancer survivors, offering carers a useful role in helping patients to follow up this lifetime health problem.";2014;2
"Objective. This study examines how telerehabilitation becomes part of existing and new clinical routines and identifies factors that enable or constrain its routine use. Methods. An in-depth case study of a telemedicine program in rehabilitation implemented between an urban specialized rehabilitation center and a rural regional rehabilitation center was conducted. Using a conceptual framework based on Giddens' theory of structuration, a qualitative analysis was carried out using four data sources: focus groups and phone interviews (with health professionals, managers, and patients and their family members); telerehabilitation video recordings; and project documents (e.g., proposals, requests for funding, summaries, agendas of meetings, operating procedures, patient handouts, and tools for clinicians). Results. In two rehabilitation programs for 1) patients who sustained a traumatic brain injury and 2) those who sustained a spinal cord injury, telerehabilitation was successfully incorporated into routine clinical practices for activities such as interdisciplinary care plans. However, for specialized clinical consultations or long-term patient follow-up, telerehabilitation was not successfully incorporated. Factors that facilitated or prevented the integration of telerehabilitation in routine practices stemmed from both the structure (norms, rules, resources, and values) and the agent (e.g., users of telerehabilitation, including clinicians, managers, and patients and their families) and include 1) shared beliefs and assumptions held by patient care team members regarding the nature of the clinical activities, and the perceptions of patients and their family members; 2) clinical and organizational leadership; 3) extent and type of telerehabilitation use; 4) available resources; and 5) collaborations already in place or needing to be developed. Conclusions. This study provides empirical evidence of how telerehabilitation activities may become integrated into routine day-to-day clinical activities.";2014;2
Objective: First, to investigate the effects of a telerehabilitation intervention on health status and activity level of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), compared to usual care. Second, to investigate how patients comply with the intervention and whether compliance is related to treatment outcomes. Design: a randomized controlled pilot trial Subjects: Thirty-four patients diagnosed with COPD. Intervention: The telerehabilitation application consists of an activity coach (3D-accelerometer with smartphone) for ambulant activity registration and real-time feedback, complemented by a web portal with a symptom diary for self-treatment of exacerbations. The intervention group used the application for 4 weeks. The control group received usual care. Main measures: Activity level measured by a pedometer (in steps/day), health status by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire at baseline and after intervention. Compliance was expressed as the time the activity coach was worn. Results: Fourteen intervention and 16 control patients completed the study. Activity level (steps/day) was not significantly affected by the intervention over time. There was a non-significant difference in improvement in health status between the intervention (-0.34 +/- 0.55) and control group (0.02 +/- 0.57, p=0.10). Health status significantly improved within the intervention group (p=0.05). The activity coach was used more than prescribed (108%) and compliance was related to the increase in activity level for the first two feedback weeks (r=0.62, p=0.03). Conclusions: This pilot study shows the potential of the telerehabilitation intervention: compliance with the activity coach was high, which directly related to an improvement in activity levels.;2014;2
Objective: For motor handicapped persons, the use of computer interface devices could be a challenging task. Two research venues have been explored to address the usability problem for handicapped users of computer systems. In the first, the focus is on development of new peripheral devices to accommodate the needs of such users. The second venue, which is the focus of this article, addresses the development of efficient rehabilitation algorithms that can adapt existing interface devices to commands from handicapped users. The main goal of this article is to analyze the existing software adaptation platform PLatform to Evaluate ICT for Assistance with a focus on evaluating and enhancing the use of pointing devices for increased adaptation to interface commands. Subjects and Methods: In the first part of this article, a new quantitative analysis approach is presented, which is useful to occupational therapists in choosing among existing information and communication technologies. We define quantification indicators to be used in the analysis of a person's movements. The proposed indicators would be classified in two categories: Task indicators and adaption indicators. In the second part of the article, we present a fuzzy rehabilitation complementary module that adapts the user command without the need to adjust the interface device. The subject is a quadriplegic 12-year-old boy. The test was conducted using five attempts after a brief description and a small demonstration of the experiment. The test was rerun the second day for another five attempts. Results: The subject could not command the joystick in the left direction without a customized device. With a customized device, he was able to control properly the mouse cursor on the screen. Conclusions: The adaptation technique used in this work helped the subject to properly control the computer pointing device. The evaluation technique helped assess the subject and give the proper parameters to the adaptation algorithm.;2014;2
Objective: Recent research supports the proposal that valid and reliable clinical swallow examinations (CSEs) can be conducted via telerehabilitation. However, no studies have explored whether dysphagia severity has an impact on the success of the session or its outcomes. The current study examined how dysphagia severity impacted on either (a) clinical decision making for safety of oral intake or (b) clinician perceptions of CSEs conducted via telerehabilitation. Subjects and Methods: One hundred patients (25 nondysphagics and 25 mild, 25 moderate, and 25 severe dysphagics) were assessed using a telehealth system and methodology reported in prior research. For each assessment, the online and face-to-face (FTF) clinicians simultaneously completed a structured CSE. On session completion, the online clinician indicated level of agreement with two statements regarding the level of rapport and ability to competently assess the patient. Results: In each of the four groups, acceptable levels of agreement were observed between raters for the three primary outcomes (decisions regarding oral/nonoral intake and safe food and fluids) as well as over 90% of the CSE items. Clinicians agreed they could develop good rapport with the majority of patients in all groups. However, for a small but significant (p<0.5) proportion of patents in the severe dysphagic group, clinicians disagreed they were able to satisfactorily and competently assess to the best of their abilities using the telerehabilitation system. Conclusions: Clinical decisions made during and as an outcome of the total CSE were found to be comparable to those made in the FTF environment regardless of dysphagia severity. Clinicians noted some difficulty assessing patients with greater complexity, which occurred in greater numbers in the group with severe dysphagia.;2014;2
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine proprioceptive performance in adults with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and the possibility that a home-based sensorimotor training program could improve proprioceptive performance. Design: This study is a preintervention/postintervention assessment of 12 adults participating in a home-based program consisting of targeted unilateral and bilateral reaching movements, hand manipulation tasks, tactile discrimination, and stereognosis. It did not specifically include proprioceptive tasks. Training sessions were 45 mins, 5 days per week, for 8 wks. Limb position sense was assessed using three conditions: ipsilateral remembered (same arm used for reference and matching targets), contralateral concurrent (reference arm moved and held at target position while opposite arm matched reference position), and contralateral remembered (reference arm moved to target position and then returned to start position before opposite arm matching position). Results: The participants demonstrated greater absolute and constant error when the more affected arm served as the reference arm, and matching was performed by the less affected arm, particularly in the contralateral remembered condition. After training, the participants demonstrated less absolute error across matching tasks and no change in constant error. Conclusions: The results suggest an important role for the reference arm in bilateral position matching tasks and the potential for improved proprioceptive performance after training in movement and unrelated sensory tasks.;2014;2
"Objective: The purpose of the study is to determine if an updated online evidence-based educational programme delivered through Facebook is effective in improving the knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy of patients with arthritis in relation to evidence-based self-management rehabilitation interventions for osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Adult patients (>18 years old) with self-reported OA or RA were eligible for the study. One-hundred-and-ten participants were recruited from the general public and different arthritis patient organizations throughout Canada. Eleven participants were selected to participate in focus groups to select effective self-management strategies for OA and RA according to level of implementation burden. Ninety-nine participants were then selected to participate in the online Facebook intervention which included a group' web page providing case-based video clips on how to apply the selected self-management interventions. Over a three-month period participants were asked to complete three online questionnaires regarding their previous knowledge, intention to use/actual use of the self-management strategies, self-efficacy and confidence in managing their condition. Results: Knowledge acquisition scores improved among OA and RA participants with a mean difference of 1.8 (p < 0.01) when compared from baseline to immediate post-intervention. At three months post-intervention, almost all self-management strategies were successful with participants following through on their intention to use the self-management strategies; however, statistically significant results were only demonstrated for aquatic jogging' (p < 0.05) and yoga' (p < 0.05) among OA participants, and aquatic therapy' (p < 0.01) among RA participants. Self-efficacy was maintained from immediate post-intervention to three months follow-up, and confidence improved as the study progressed. Conclusions: This online programme can provide patient organization representatives with the opportunity to learn about and integrate evidence-based self-management strategies for OA and RA in their daily lives, to increase their awareness of useful community resources, and support their efforts to disseminate the information to others with arthritis.";2014;2
"Objective: To explore the effectiveness and participant experience of web-based physiotherapy for people moderately affected with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and to provide data to establish the sample size required for a fully powered, definitive randomized controlled study. Design: A randomized controlled pilot study. Setting: Rehabilitation centre and participants' homes. Subjects: Thirty community dwelling adults moderately affected by MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale 5-6.5). Interventions: Twelve weeks of individualised web-based physiotherapy completed twice per week or usual care (control). Online exercise diaries were monitored; participants were telephoned weekly by the physiotherapist and exercise programmes altered remotely by the physiotherapist as required. Main measures: The following outcomes were completed at baseline and after 12 weeks; 25 Foot Walk, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, Leeds MS Quality of Life Scale, MS-Related Symptom Checklist and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The intervention group also completed a website evaluation questionnaire and interviews. Results: Participants reported that website was easy to use, convenient, and motivating and would be happy to use in the future. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome measure, the timed 25ft walk in the intervention group (P=0.170), or other secondary outcome measures, except the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (P=0.048). Effect sizes were generally small to moderate. Conclusion: People with MS were very positive about web-based physiotherapy. The results suggested that 80 participants, 40 in each group, would be sufficient for a fully powered, definitive randomized controlled trial.";2014;2
"Objective: To test the effectiveness of a high-dose home exercise/telerehabilitation program for manual wheelchair users who have a spinal cord injury (SCI) by determining whether the intervention would reduce pain and increase function, as we hypothesized. Design: A pre-post trial with outcomes measured at 3 time points: baseline, postintervention (12wk), and follow-up (>24 wk). Setting: Subjects performed an exercise program at their homes using telerehabilitation for therapist monitoring of technique and exercise advancement. Baseline and postintervention data were collected at a motion analysis laboratory in a tertiary medical center. Participants: A convenience sample of manual wheelchair users (N=16, 3 women; average age, 41y; average time in a wheelchair, 16y) with shoulder pain (average pain duration, 9y) and mechanical impingement signs on physical examination. Interventions: A 12-week home exercise program of rotator cuff and scapular stabilization exercises was given to each participant. The program included a high dose of 3 sets of 30 repetitions, 3 times weekly, and regular physical therapist supervision via videoconferencing. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes of pain and function were measured with the Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI), Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) Index, and Shoulder Rating Questionnaire (SRQ). Secondary outcomes of strength were measured with isometric strength tests of scapulothoracic and glenohumeral muscles, and a static fatigue test of the lower trapezius. Results: Pain was reduced and function improved after the intervention. There was a significant main effect for pain and function between the 3 time points based on the Friedman signed-ranked test, WUSPI (chi(2)(2)=5.10, P=.014), DASH Index (chi(2)(2)=5.41, P=.012), and SRQ (chi(2)(2)=23.71, P<.001). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests demonstrated that isometric strength measurements of the serratus anterior and scapular retractors increased after the exercise intervention [t=2.42, P=.04] and [t=4.67, P=.003], respectively). Muscle impulse produced by the lower trapezius during a fatigue task also improved (t=2.2, P=.02). No differences were measured in isometric strength for the lower trapezius, glenohumeral rotators, and abductors between the baseline and 12-week time points. Conclusions: A high-dose scapular stabilizer and rotator cuff strengthening program using telerehabilitation for supervision holds promise for shoulder pain treatment in manual wheelchair users with SCI. Additional work is needed to determine the effectiveness compared with other interventions, as well as the potential for earlier intervention to prevent development of shoulder pain.

Patients suffering from COPD benefit from the performance of any kind of physical activity. The 3D layer context (3DLC) model characterizes data from smart home environments in relation to their relevance for the clinical decision making process. We have used this model to show how data from an ambient activity system in the domestic environment can be used to provide a more informed and thereby better treatment management for COPD patients. We set up an experiment to calculate an individual intensity relation between household activities and telerehabilitation training on a bicycle ergometer. We have extracted features from the power data of devices, which are used during the performance of two example every day activities to calculate the energy expenditure for the performance of these activities.;2014;2
People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) need regular physical activities along with medical treatment despite their ability or disability level. However, poorly performed exercises could aggravate muscle imbalances and worsen their health. The goal of our work is to create a comprehensive system, encompassing a face-to-face sessions performed by MS patients one day a week at the medical center with exercises at home the rest of the week through a web platform in combination with a tracking tool to analyze the position of patients during exercise and correct them in real-time. The whole system is currently testing during six months with ten participants, five persons with MS and 5 professionals related with MS. Two tests, the Functional Independence Measure and the Berg Balance Scale will be act as a barometer for measuring the degree of independence obtained by the people with MS and also the validity of the whole system as a rehabilitation tool. Preliminary results about the usability of the system using SUS scale, 72 and 76 points over 100 (patients and professionals respectively), demonstrate that our system is usable for both patients and professionals.;2014;2
Primary objective: The study objective was to test the efficacy of game-based virtual reality (VR) therapy as a mean of correcting postural and co-ordination abnormalities in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therapy was done with interactive customized VR games and scenarios, utilizing an Xbox Kinect sensor. Research design: The study was a pilot project using the structure of a phase II clinical trial. Methods and procedures: Fifteen participants with mild-to-moderate chronic TBI-related balance and motor co-ordination impairments participated in 15 sessions, each lasting similar to 50-55 minutes, scheduled 2-3 times a week over 5-6 consecutive weeks. Participants were evaluated at baseline, immediately after the final session and in a 1-month follow-up with a battery of clinical tests (measuring postural stability, gait and co-ordination) and movement performance parameters. Movement parameters included arm-leg co-ordination, dynamic stability and arm precision, calculated from kinematic data recorded with Xbox Kinect sensor. Results: Following therapy, most participants improved their static and dynamic postural stability, gait and arm movements. These effects persisted over the retention interval. Conclusions: Results will be used to improve the VR program, with the goal of producing a cost-effective, accessible and easy to individualize therapeutic approach. The pilot data will be used for designing a larger scale clinical trial.;2014;2
Purpose of review Stroke is the leading cause of permanent motor disability in the United States, and the rapidly aging population makes finding large-scale treatment solutions to this problem a national priority. Telerehabilitation is an emerging approach that is being used for the effective treatment of multiple diseases, and is beginning to show promise for stroke. The purpose of this review is to identify and highlight the areas of telerehabilitation that require the most research attention. Recent findings Although there are many different forms of telerehabilitation approaches being attempted for stroke, the only approach that is currently showing moderate-strong evidence for efficacy is videogame-driven telerehabilitation (VGDT). However, targeted research is still required to determine the feasibility of VGDT: metrics regarding system usability, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy concerns still require major attention. Summary VGDT is an emerging approach that shows enormous promise for stroke rehabilitation. Future studies should focus less on developing custom task controllers and therapy games and more on developing innovative, online data acquisition and analytics pipelines, as well as understanding the patient population so that the rehabilitation experience can be better customized.;2014;2
Purpose: To systematically examine the effect of virtual reality (VR) on upper extremity (UE) function in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and assess the association among VR effects and children's characteristics and an intervention protocol. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, and PsycINFO up to June 2013. Research studies involving children with CP that used VR as the intervention method and UE outcome measures were included. Results: The search yielded 14 research articles, including 3 randomized controlled trials and 11 case series. Overall, VR provided a strong effect size (d = 1.00) when comparing pre- and postintervention. In subgroup analyses, younger children receiving home-based or laboratory-based VR and using an engineer-built VR system showed better improvement. Conclusions and Implications: Virtual reality is a viable tool to improve UE function in children with CP. However, a more vigorous research design is needed to make a conclusive recommendation.;2014;2
"Recently, there have been considerable advances in the research on innovative information communication technology (ICT) for the education of people with autism. This review focuses on two aims: (1) to provide an overview of the recent ICT applications used in the treatment of autism and (2) to focus on the early development of imitation and joint attention in the context of children with autism as well as robotics. There have been a variety of recent ICT applications in autism, which include the use of interactive environments implemented in computers and special input devices, virtual environments, avatars and serious games as well as telerehabilitation. Despite exciting preliminary results, the use of ICT remains limited. Many of the existing ICTs have limited capabilities and performance in actual interactive conditions. Clinically, most ICT proposals have not been validated beyond proof of concept studies. Robotics systems, developed as interactive devices for children with autism, have been used to assess the child's response to robot behaviors; to elicit behaviors that are promoted in the child; to model, teach and practice a skill; and to provide feedback on performance in specific environments (e.g., therapeutic sessions). Based on their importance for both early development and for building autonomous robots that have humanlike abilities, imitation, joint attention and interactive engagement are key issues in the development of assistive robotics for autism and must be the focus of further research.";2014;2
Remote rehabilitation applications still have limited deployment. The path to achieve greater user acceptance and adherence lies in the provision of solutions in their real-life context. Such acceptance is gained through flexibility provided in terms of location, client device, interaction means, and content. This article presents a universal remote rehabilitation delivery approach supporting the introduced flexibility needs. Furthermore, an implementation of the approach in joint rehabilitation for the elderly is described. The approach has been evaluated in a real scenario within Donostia Hospital. The usability evaluation results show the validity of the approach and the acceptance of the developed human -computer interaction paradigm.;2014;2
Sensor based motion capture system enables motion analysis with applications ranging from entertainment, healthcare and robotics. It can provide an intuitive interface for human to provide motion training and control a humanoid robot. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the imitation of human motion for a humanoid robot. In the proposed framework, human motion data is directly captured from a wireless, wearable motion capture platform (Biomotion+). The reconstructed posture is then converted into joint angle trajectories. Due to the structural differences between the joints of the robot and those of the human, the trajectories are then optimized to satisfy the mechanical constraints of the robot and to maintain appropriate balance. To validate the proposed framework, different motion trajectories were verified. The results demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the proposed framework to reproduce realistic human motion for a humanoid robot and the potential for a telerehabilitation application. The proposed framework offers a new way of imitating human motion for a humanoid robot.;2014;2
Spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been widely used to investigate activity of autonomous nervous system. Previous studies demonstrated potential of analysis of short-term sequences of heart rate data in a time domain for continuous monitoring of levels of physiological stress however the value of HRV parameters in frequency domain for monitoring cycling exercise has not been established. The goal of this study was to assess whether HRV parameters in frequency domain differ depending on a stage of cycling exercise. We compared major HRV parameters in high, low and very low frequency ranges during rest, height of exercise, and recovery during cycling exercise. Our results indicated responsiveness of frequency-domain indices to different phases of cycling exercise program and their potential in monitoring autonomic balance and stress levels as a part of a tailored home-based telerehabilitation program.;2014;2
Telehealth success relies on the ability of information and communication technologies (ICT) to maximize the quality of care provided remotely, i.e., providing diagnostics and treatments of the same quality compared to face-to-face or conventional means, and maximize the benefits for the patients, the clinicians and the system of care. Because of the specific nature of health-related processes, successful development of telehealth technologies must be driven by clinical and application needs that are not addressed by currently available ICT. In this paper, we present two telehealth systems developed in two different contexts, one for teletraining of surgical procedures, and one for telerehabilitation, and from which common requirements can be identified for the development of a more generic platform. This paper also situates where these systems are in relation to their stage of development and their assessment as telehealth technologies.;2014;2
Telemedicine applications, based on two-dimensional (2D) video conferencing technology, have been around for the past 15 to 20 yr. They have been demonstrated to be acceptable for face-to-face consultations and useful for visual examination of wounds and abrasions. However, certain telerehabilitation assessments need the use of spatial information in order to accurately assess the patient's condition and sending three-dimensional video data over low-bandwidth networks is extremely challenging. This article proposes an innovative way of extracting the key spatial information from the patient's movement during telerehabilitation assessment based on 2D video and then presenting the extracted data by using graph plots alongside the video to help physicians in assessments with minimum burden on existing video data transfer. Some common rehabilitation scenarios are chosen for illustrations, and experiments are conducted based on skeletal tracking and color detection algorithms using the Microsoft Kinect sensor. Extracted data are analyzed in detail and their usability discussed.;2014;2
Telerehabilitation (TR) is getting ever more popular because it is effective in bringing rehabilitation services to rural populations by means of audiovisual systems and its initial implementation studies presented encouraging results. TR is proven to be helpful, with benefits in terms of reduced travel time, cost, and availability of specialists' support in local communities. However, TR systems that are usable under low-bandwidth network environments are rare. This article introduces the development of a FR system with customized consultation categories for users to choose from, depending on requirements. Each category, with its preset parameter values, is discussed in detail by demonstrating relevant rehabilitation exercises. A novel bandwidth adaptation algorithm is also presented for optimal utilization of the dynamic network conditions, which ensures the system functionality even under narrow-bandwidth environments. Experiment results show that the system is able to perform effectively in each consultation category while the rehabilitation exercises are being performed. The proposed algorithm is also verified for its ability to adapt the content quality and effectively utilize the network under constrained conditions. A survey conducted on the video quality of the system under low-bandwidth conditions shows encouraging results for a large-scale deployment of the application.;2014;2
The aim of the present study is the exploration of the compensation mechanisms in healthy adults elicited by superimposing a horizontal perturbation, through a rotation of the support base, during a whole body active rotation around the participant's own vertical body axis. Eight healthy participants stood on a rotating platform while executing 90 degrees whole body rotations under three conditions: no concurrent platform rotation (NP), support surface rotation of +/- 45 degrees in the same (45-S) and opposite (45-O) directions. Participants' kinematics and CoP displacements were analyzed with an optoelectronic system and a force platform. In both 45-S and 45-O conditions, there was a tendency for the head to be affected by the external perturbation and to be the last and least perturbed segment while the pelvis was the most perturbed. The observed reduced head perturbation in 45-S and 45-O trials is consistent with a goal-oriented strategy mediated by vision and vestibular information, whereas the tuning of lumbar rotation is consistent with control mechanisms mediated by somato-sensory information.

The aim of the present study is to analyse changes in the diaphragmatic electromyography integral, as a direct expression of the patients inspiratory effort and index of neural respiratory drive, and parameters associated with ventilatory function in patients with prolonged weaning under Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) and Neurally Adjusted Ventilatoy Assist (NAVA). Five patients affected by neuromuscular diseases were recruited. Each patient underwent a sequence of decreasing inspiratory support levels under NAVA and PSV, randomly assigned, from a baseline to a final level. At baseline, the value of diaphragmatic electromyography integral was higher under NAVA compared to PSV and increased in both ventilation modes progressing to final level. Higher values of inspiratory time and neural inspiratory time were observed in PSV at final level compared to baseline level. Conversely, a significant decrease of neural inspiratory time from baseline level to final level was observed in NAVA. Tidal volume at final level was significantly lower than at baseline level in both ventilation modes. These preliminary results show that in prolonged weaning patients affected by neuromuscular disease NAVA ventilation is associated to a higher diaphragmatic electromyography activity compared to PSV with same level of ventilation and subjective comfort.;2014;2
"The aim of this article is to propose a methodology for analyzing different recovery mechanisms in subacute and chronic patients through evaluation of biomechanical parameters. Twenty-five post-stroke subjects, eight subacute and seventeen chronic, participated in the study. A 2-DoF robotic system was used for upper limb training. Two clinical scales were used for assessment. Forces and velocities at the robot's end-effector during the execution of upper limb planar reaching movements were measured. Clinical outcome measures show a significant decrease in motor impairment after the treatment both in chronic and subacute patients (MSS-SE, p < 0.001; FM, p < 0.05). Movement velocity increases after the robot-aided treatment in both groups. Mean values of forces exerted by subacute patients are lower than those observed in chronic patients, both at the beginning and at the end of robotic treatment, as in the latter the pathological pattern is already structured. Our results demonstrate that the monitoring of the forces exerted on the end-effector during robot-aided treatment can identify the specific motor recovery mechanisms at different stages. If the pathological pattern is not yet structured, rehabilitative interventions should be addressed toward the use of motor re-learning procedures; on the other hand, if the force analysis shows a strong pathological pattern, mechanisms of compensation should be encouraged.";2014;2
The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of robot-assisted upper limb therapy in subacute and chronic stroke patients using a set of kinematic parameters evaluated during each of the first 15 rehabilitation sessions. Twenty-four post-stroke subjects, twelve subacute and twelve chronic, participated in the study. A 2 DOFs robotic system was used for upper limb training. Kinematic parameters related to the speed and smoothness measured at the robot's end-effector were computed. Outcome clinical measures show a decrease in motor impairment at half-treatment both in chronic and subacute patients. Significant improvements in kinematic parameters within the first 15 sessions were observed only in subacute patients.;2014;2
The growing demand for physical rehabilitation processes can result in the rising of costs and waiting lists, becoming a threat to healthcare services' sustainability. Telerehabilitation solutions can help in this issue by discharging patients from points of care while improving their adherence to treatment. Sensing devices are used to collect data so that the physiotherapists can monitor and evaluate the patients' activity in the scheduled sessions. This paper presents a software platform that aims to meet the needs of the rehabilitation experts and the patients along a physical rehabilitation plan, allowing its use in outpatient scenarios. It is meant to be low-cost and easy-to-use, improving patients and experts experience. We show the satisfactory results already obtained from its use, in terms of the accuracy evaluating the exercises, and the degree of users' acceptance. We conclude that this platform is suitable and technically feasible to carry out rehabilitation plans outside the point of care.;2014;2
The number of virtual reality applications in rehabilitation and telerehabilitation medicine is increasing. Unfortunately, without telediagnostics, telerehabilitation requires frequent outpatient clinical testing. This study thus proposes a diagnostic tool for virtual-reality-supported balance training for estimating functional balance progress during telerehabilitation using objective parameters. Four weeks of physiotherapy with assessment before and after the therapy and a follow up 2 weeks after therapy were carried out with 10 sub-acute stroke subjects. Goal-based tasks for standing-frame-supported balance training were designed in a virtual environment. An accelerometer-based tilt sensor not mounted on the subjects was used. The telediagnostics apply the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to movement data and the task time and number of errors committed are analyzed. Additionally the functional progress was estimated with clinical tests (Berg Balance Scale, 10-m walk test, Timed Up & Go test) and correlations with objective data were examined. The area under the FFT curve demonstrated balance improvement and had a moderate correlation with clinical tests, considering that all parameters showed improvement for each individual patient. The proposed tool enables the remote evaluation of the effects of virtual-reality-supported balance training. The tool may decrease the number of outpatient visits and enable the continuation of the rehabilitation process at home. However, to confirm the clinical reliability and practical value of the proposed tool, a further study with a large stroke population and healthcare business models are needed.;2014;2
The objective was to assess the feasibility of delivering a group treatment to improve emotional regulation via videoconferencing to individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). A pre-post feasibility study was undertaken. Seven individuals with TBI were recruited at a brain injury research centre in an urban medical centre. The main measures were therapist assessment of session-by-session progress and feasibility, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust Regulation of Emotions Questionnaire (BREQ), Satisfaction with Therapy and Therapist Scale (STTS), and exit interview. Attendance across sessions and participants was over 90%. Adequate skill acquisition and ease of use of the technology were demonstrated. Self-reported satisfaction with treatment was high. Participants noted several benefits in terms of the treatment delivery modality. There was no change is self-reported emotional dysregulation. This is the first study to report the use of videoconferencing for the delivery of group treatment to individuals with TBI. The exceptional compliance and self-reported satisfaction suggest that this treatment delivery option could be a viable alternative for increasing access to healthcare in this population. The findings of the study supported the development of a large clinical trial to assess treatment effectiveness.;2014;2
"Therapeutic neuroscience education (TNE) aims to alter a patient's thoughts and beliefs about pain and has shown efficacy in treating chronic pain. To date, TNE sessions mainly consist of one-on-one verbal communication. This approach limits availability of TNE to pain patients in remote areas. A 32-year-old patient with chronic low back pain (CLBP) who underwent surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) attended a single clinic one-on-one TNE session followed by TNE via electronic mail (e-mail), pacing and graded exposure over a 4-month period. A physical examination, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), and Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) were assessed during her initial physical therapy visit as well as 1 and 4 months later. Pre-TNE, the patient reported: NPRS (arm) = 7/10; NPRS (leg) = 4/10; ODI = 10.0%; DASH = 36.7%; FABQ-W = 24; and FABQ-PA = 17. After 5 e-mail sessions all outcome measures improved, most noticeably NRS (arm) = 2/10; NRS (leg) = 0/10; DASH = 16.7%; FABQ-W = 8; and FABQ-PA = 7. TNE can potentially be delivered to suffering pain patients in remote areas or to individuals who have time and financial constraints, and likely at a significant reduced cost via e-mail.";2014;2
There are several ways to instruct rehabilitation poses to patients in a remote area, such as phone calls using voice and video messaging using images. However, current methods do not allow the therapists to correct the patient's poses intuitively. Moreover, the patients have no way to know whether the pose they are making is correct or not. In this study, we propose a method for instructing rehabilitation poses to a person in a remote area using a human-shaped input device called QUMARION. The therapist uses QUMARION to instruct a pose, while Kinect tracks the patient's motion. By comparing the data acquired by both devices, the system evaluates the patient's pose and checks whether the patient is making the pose as instructed by the therapist. The result is processed and shown on both the therapist's and the patient's displays in real time. We conducted an experiment that measured how precisely poses can be instructed through our system. The results showed that our system enables easy and effective instructions.;2014;2
There is increasing interest in the use of telemedicine to assist in the management of chronic diseases. Telemedicine possibilities for patients with COPD include medical consultations, in-home patient monitoring, and remote rehabilitation. Teleconsultations have been used successfully, saving time and travel costs for patients with only a few subsequently requiring face-to-face visits. Despite many reports, the impact of telemonitoring on the detection of exacerbations, reductions in health-care utilization, and cost savings is equivocal. Given the health-care costs and commitment involved in telemonitoring, well-designed longer-term multicenter studies with appropriate follow-up are required prior to its more widespread application. Emerging evidence from preliminary trials of telerehabilitation for the pulmonary patient is encouraging. It may represent a useful tool for increasing access and building capacity, especially in remote areas.;2014;2
This article is the first part of a systematic review of studies on occupational therapy related intervention for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). The objective of this systematic review was to critically appraise and synthesize the applicable findings to address the following focused question: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice for people with multiple sclerosis? This article focuses on occupational therapy interventions aimed at activity and participation, including programs (e.g., inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation) in which an occupational therapy practitioner was one member of the team. Part 2 (Yu & Mathiowetz, 2014) focuses on interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to remediate impairment (e.g., exercise, cognition, emotional regulation).;2014;2
This paper describes a pilot study using a prototype telerehabilitation system (Ghostman). Ghostman is a visual augmentation system designed to allow a physical therapist and patient to inhabit each other's viewpoint in an augmented real-world environment. This allows the therapist to deliver instruction remotely and observe performance of a motor skill through the patient's point of view. In a pilot study, we investigated the efficacy of Ghostman by using it to teach participants to use chopsticks. Participants were randomized to a single training session, receiving either Ghostman or face-to-face instructions by the same skilled instructor. Learning was assessed by measuring retention of skills at 24-hour and 7-day post instruction. As hypothesised, there were no differences in reduction of error or time to completion between participants using Ghostman compared to those receiving face-to-face instruction. These initial results in a healthy population are promising and demonstrate the potential application of this technology to patients requiring learning or relearning of motor skills as may be required following a stroke or brain injury.;2014;2
This paper describes an experience of developing a computer system for continuous medical rehabilitation involving patients with post-stroke and spinal cord injury motor disorders. Particular focus is made on the concept of telerehabilitation for this specific group of patients. Telerehabilitation has to be continuous and regular. It is also necessary to provide the possibility of conducting treatment/communication sessions asynchronously. The empirical results of five year implementation of this system in Russia showed high efficiency and revealed some limitations of a distant network rehabilitation program based on electromyographic biofeedback.;2014;2
This paper embarks on the initial development of a telerehabilitation system in assistive therapy for children with disabilities. The goal is specifically for children with autism and cerebral palsy at various locations to gain access to robotic intervention. Ten learning modules targeting at specific therapy outcomes have been developed for this system. Here, this research proposes to link various stakeholders including engineers, parents, clinicians and therapists in a network that promotes robotic and telecommunication technology as a rehabilitation platform for children with disabilities. Field trials involving real users will be executed in the next phase of study.;2014;2
This paper proposes a computational framework for movement quality assessment using a decision tree model that can potentially assist a physical therapist in a telerehabilitation context. Using a dataset of key kinematic attributes collected from eight stroke survivors, we demonstrate that the framework can be reliably used for movement quality assessment of a reach-to-grasp cone task, an activity commonly used in upper extremity stroke rehabilitation therapy. The proposed framework is capable of providing movement quality scores that are highly correlated to the ratings provided by therapists, who used a custom rating rubric created by rehabilitation experts. Our hypothesis is that a decision tree model could be easily utilized by therapists as a potential assistive tool, especially in evaluating movement quality on a large-scale dataset collected during unsupervised rehabilitation (e.g., training at the home), thereby reducing the time and cost of rehabilitation treatment.;2014;2
"This paper reports a structured literature survey of research in wearable technology for upper-extremity rehabilitation, e.g., after stroke, spinal cord injury, for multiple sclerosis patients or even children with cerebral palsy. A keyword based search returned 61 papers relating to this topic. Examination of the abstracts of these papers identified 19 articles describing distinct wearable systems aimed at upper extremity rehabilitation. These are classified in three categories depending on their functionality: movement and posture monitoring; monitoring and feedback systems that support rehabilitation exercises, serious games for rehabilitation training. We characterize the state of the art considering respectively the reported performance of these technologies, availability of clinical evidence, or known clinical applications.";2014;2
This paper represents a controller design for non-linear bilateral teleoperation systems. The proposed controller is used when both terminals of teleoperation system are considered to be non-passive. Moreover, the communication channel is subjected to unsymmetrical time varying delays. A good example of such systems is robotic telerehabilitation therapy in both assistive and resistive mode. The controller is comprised delayed position-position architecture and nonlinear adaptive controller to deal with parameters uncertainty in environment dynamic. On the other hand, a new Impedance reflection term is considered in the master controller for improving transparency. The stability of closed-loop teleopration system is established by a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Finally, the proposed scheme is utilized on a pair of planner 2-DOF robots to show performance and accuracy of the proposed controller.;2014;2
This work's purpose is to investigate the use of Augmented Reality techniques on telerehabilitation, applied to wheelchair users training. In this scenario, using a computer with unconventional devices, the user will be connected to a remote training space and will be able to issue commands, in order to accomplish the execution of training exercises. The telerehabilitation environment should reproduce the main challenges faced by wheelchair users in their daily activities.;2014;2
Usability is an important topic in the field of telerehabilitation research. Older users with disabilities in particular, present age-related and disability-related challenges that should be accommodated for in the design of a user interface for a telerehabilitation system. This paper describes the design, implementation, and assessment of a telerehabilitation system user interface that tries to maximize usability for an elderly user who has experienced a stroke. An Internet-connected Nintendo (R) Wii (TM) gaming system is selected as a hardware platform, and a server and website are implemented to process and display the feedback information. The usability of the interface is assessed with a trial consisting of 18 subjects: 10 healthy Doctor of Physical Therapy students and 8 people with a stroke. Results show similar levels of usability and high satisfaction with the gaming system interface from both groups of subjects.;2014;2
Virtual reality platforms capable of assisting rehabilitation must provide support for rehabilitation principles: promote repetition, task oriented training, appropriate feedback, and a motivating environment. As such, development of these platforms is a complex process which has not yet reached maturity. This paper presents our efforts to contribute to this field, presenting Gesture Therapy, a virtual reality-based platform for rehabilitation of the upper limb. We describe the system architecture and main features of the platform and provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility of the platform in its current status.;2014;2
"We determined the effect of a multifaceted stroke telerehabilitation (STeleR) intervention on falls-related selfefficacy and satisfaction with care in stroke patients. We conducted a prospective, randomized, multisite, single-blinded trial in 52 veterans with stroke from 3 Veterans Affairs medical centers. Individuals who experienced a stroke in the past 24 months were randomized to the STeleR intervention or usual care. In addition, participants in the intervention arm were administered an exit interview three months after their final outcome measure was administered that included more in-depth questions related to their satisfaction. This interview was performed via the telephone by the Coordinating Center. The STeleR intervention consisted of 3 home visits, 5 telephone calls, and an in-home messaging device provided over 3 months to instruct patients in functionally based exercises and adaptive strategies. The outcome measures included Falls Efficacy Scale to measure fall-related self-efficacy and Reker et al.' s StrokeSpecific Patient Satisfaction with Care (SSPSC) scale, a measure separated into two subscales (satisfaction with home care and satisfaction with hospital care) was employed to measure the participants' satisfaction. At six months, compared with the usual care group, the STeleR group showed statistically significant improvements in one of the two SSPSC scales (satisfaction with hospital care, p = .029) and approached significance in the second SSPSC scale (satisfaction with home care, p = .077)). There were no improvements in fall-related selfefficacy. Core concepts identified were: (a) expansion of homebased instruction of exercises; and b) technology. The STeleR intervention improved satisfaction with care, especially as it relates to care following their experience from the hospital. With the limited resources available for in-home rehabilitation for stroke survivors, STeleR (and especially its exercise components) can be a useful complement to traditional poststroke rehabilitation.";2014;2
We investigated the feasibility of providing telerehabilitation in the home as an alternative to conventional ambulatory rehabilitation. Two groups of patients were accepted for telerehabilitation. The first group were community patients who needed rehabilitation, e.g. following a stroke, a fracture or prolonged hospital admission. The second group was from two rural nursing homes where residents were identified with a recent injury, fall or hospitalisation. Telerehabilitation employed a coaching model, with fewer therapist home visits, more feedback and homework'' for the patient. Patients had a tablet computer loaded with a videoconferencing app to connect with therapists and relevant therapeutic apps. Multidisciplinary care was provided for up to 8 weeks. The majority (86%) of eligible patients consented to receive telerehabilitation in their own home (n=61) or in the country nursing home where they lived (n=17). Most services were delivered using the 3G and 4G wireless networks with few technical problems. On average participants felt that they had achieved 75% of the goals set at the beginning of the programme. High levels of satisfaction were recorded. There was a 50% reduction in home visits by staff, or 10 visits per patient. Speech therapists were able to double occasions of service and direct patient contact time, whilst halving their travel time. Previous experience with technology and age were not barriers to this method of delivery but did affect recruitment. Telerehabilitation using off-the-shelf technology is feasible for post-acute treatment.;2014;2
"We reviewed the literature relating to the use of telehealth for paediatric speech and language assessment. Four databases, and relevant reference lists, were searched for articles published between January 2004 and July 2014. A total of 180 articles were identified, of which only five were relevant. All studies assessed efficacy using method comparison techniques; no studies assessed effectiveness. The method comparison studies investigated the validity and/or reliability of speech and language assessment via telehealth, when compared with face-to-face assessment. Studies varied in terms of participant group, assessment tools, statistical analysis and telehealth equipment. The papers reviewed presented some evidence that telehealth can be used to make valid assessments of oromotor function, speech intelligibility and language. Articulation screening via telehealth was found to be valid, but there was conflicting evidence about full articulation assessment. Intra-and inter-rater reliability was good for all speech and language tasks, with the exception of oromotor assessment, which also had reduced reliability when assessed face-to-face. There were discrepancies between the two modalities for individual oromotor tasks, judgement of individual speech sounds, detection of pluralisation, and discriminating between similar sounding words; these have the potential to be clinically important. Evidence regarding satisfaction was extremely limited, with only one study reporting parental satisfaction, and no studies reporting child or clinician satisfaction. Although there is limited evidence to support the validity and reliability of speech and language assessment via telehealth, it is probably not yet sufficient to influence clinical practice or policy development.";2014;2
[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to develop a new telerehabilitation system based on VR technology for training of paralyzed upper and lower extremities and poor balance in patients with stroke. Moreover, the effectiveness of the system was verified by analysis of the recovery of these patients. [Subjects] Five healthy persons and five people with motor paralysis, caused by cerebrovascular disease, participated. [Methods] The features of our system are as follows: (1) Our system can train upper and lower limbs and balancing with 3D images. (2) A Kinect (R) is used for user posture detection. (3) A vibrator is used for feedback to a sensory receptor in order to promote the learning effect of motion. Upper limb and balance training were conducted in this study. [Results] The time necessary for the upper limb and balance training tasks was shortened for the participants with disabilities. The joint angle for the participants with disabilities tended to equate to that of the healthy participants over time. Moreover, our system had no side effects. [Conclusion] These points suggest that our system is effective and safe. The user interface and assessment of the conditions of patients from a distance should be studied in the future.;2015;3
"A wide range of telerehabilitation interventions are trialled in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). However, the evidence for their effectiveness is unclear. Aim of the review was to systematically assess the effectiveness and safety of telerehabilitation intervention in pwMS, the types of approaches that are effective (setting, type, intensity) and the outcomes (impairment, activity limitation and participation) that are affected. The search strategy comprised: Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Review Group Specialised Register (up to 9 July, 2014). Relevant journals and reference lists of identified studies were screened for additional data. Selected studies included randomized and controlled clinical trials that compared telerehabilitation intervention/s in pwMS with a control intervention (such as lower level or different types of intervention, minimal intervention; waiting-list controls, no treatment or usual care; interventions given in different settings). Best evidence synthesis was based on methodological quality using the GRADEpro software. Nine RCTs (N.=531 participants, 469 included in analyses) investigated a variety of telerehabilitation interventions in adults with MS. The interventions evaluated were complex, with more than one rehabilitation component and included physical activity, educational, behavioural and symptom management programmes. All studies scored low on the methodological quality assessment. Evidence from included studies provides 'low-level' evidence for reduction in short-term disability (and symptoms) such as fatigue. There was also low-level evidence supporting telerehabilitation in the longer term for improved functional activities, impairments (such as fatigue, pain, insomnia); and participation. There were limited data on process evaluation (participants'/therapists' satisfaction) and no data available for cost effectiveness. There were no adverse events reported as a result of telerehabilitation intervention. There is limited evidence to date, on the efficacy of telerehabilitation in improving functional activities, fatigue and quality of life in adults with MS. There is also insufficient evidence to support what types of telerehabilitation interventions are effective, and in which setting. More robust trials are needed to build evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of these interventions.";2015;3
After experiencing a stroke in the right hemisphere, almost 50% of patients showed Unilateral Spatial Neglect (USN). In recent decades, Virtual Reality (VR) has been used as an effective tool both for the assessment and rehabilitation of USN. Indeed, this advanced technology allows post-stroke patients to interact with ecological and engaging environments similar to real ones, but in a safe and controlled way. To provide an overview of the most recent VR applications for the assessment and rehabilitation of USN, a systematic review has been carried out. Since 2010, 13 studies have proposed and tested innovative VR tools for USN. After a wide description of the selected studies, we discuss the main features of these VR tools in order to provide crucial indications for future studies, neurorehabilitation interventions, and clinical practice.;2015;3
"Aims. To evaluate the quality of systematic reviews on telerehabilitation. Methods. The AMSTAR - Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews - checklist was used to appraise the evidence related to the systematic reviews. Results. Among the 477 records initially identified, 10 systematic reviews matched the inclusion criteria. Fifty percent were of high quality; anyway the majority of them did not report the following aspects: i) analysis of the grey literature; ii) a list of the excluded studies and their characteristics; iii) the identification of possible source of bias and the assessment of its likehood; iv) an appropriate method to combine the findings of the included studies addressing the heterogeneity as well. From the main findings of the high-scored systematic reviews telerehabilitation resulted at least as effective as usual care: 1) in the short term treatment of mental health related to people affected by spinal cord injury; 2) in rural communities for treating patients affected by chronic conditions; 3) in treating common pathologies (mainly asthma) affecting children and adolescents. As for stroke, evidence is currently insufficient to reach conclusions about its effectiveness. As for costs, there is insufficient evidence to confirm that telerehabilitation is a cost-saving or cost-effective solution. Conclusions. In the authors' knowledge this is the first attempt to evaluate the quality of systematic reviews on telerehabilitation. This work also identified the main findings related to the high-scored systematic reviews; the analysis confirms that there is a mounting evidence concerning the effectiveness of telerehabilitation, at least for some pathologies.";2015;3
"AimThis study aims at describing an intervention based on informal caregivers' skills when taking care of older people after a stroke (InCARE). BackgroundMost informal caregivers feel unprepared to deliver assistance in activities of daily living at home. This lack of preparedness can lead to misconceptions, burden and affect their health, which, consequently, may imply hospital readmissions or early institutionalization of the older adults. DesignA single blinded randomised trial. MethodsThis study will recruit 198 dyads, comprising old stroke survivors and their caregivers, who will be divided into two groups: intervention and control (protocol approved in May 2013). Inclusion criteria: (informal caregivers) absence of cognitive impairment; resident in the Cavado Region; to return the informed consent (older people) are over 65years of age; have had a first stroke and; be dependent on at least one of the self-care activities post hospital discharge. Primary outcome: informal caregivers' skills. Secondary outcomes: include burden and Health Quality of Life in informal caregivers; functionality, hospital readmission and institutionalization of older people stroke survivors, measured 1 and 3months after InCARE programme. DiscussionThe InCARE programme will highlight new ways to understand the feasibility of a large trial, which supports caregivers who take care of older people after a stroke. It will be expected that the level of burden decreases, thus helping informal caregivers enhance their quality of life. Also, it is expected that older people's functionality will be improved and that hospital readmission or institutionalization may be avoided.";2015;3
Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a very active topic of research that is gaining more and more attention because of its characteristics, transparency and intelligence. Older people is one of the collectives that can take advantage of the use of AmI systems because, thanks to these characteristics, AmI systems can focus on older adults' real needs so that they satisfy one of their main motivations to adapt technological innovations: perceived benefits. And, perhaps, everything related to healthcare and home care is perceived by them as both valuable and beneficial. In this paper, it is presented the Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) of a healthcare AmI system to treat older people' motor impairment problems by using specific devices to control the patient's movements. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is being widely exploited. AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly. Agents provide an effective way to develop such systems since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. One of the main differences of our system is that it provides therapist with support to design new therapies, to adapt them to each specific person and to control their execution instead of using a fixed set of exercises.;2015;3
Augmented Reality is a new technological system that allows introducing virtual contents in the real world in order to run in the same representation and, in real time, enhancing the user's sensory perception of reality. From another point of view, Augmented Reality can be defined as a set of techniques and tools that add information to the physical reality. To date, Augmented Reality has been used in many fields, such as medicine, entertainment, maintenance, architecture, education, and cognitive and motor rehabilitation but very few studies and applications of AR exist in clinical psychology. In the treatment of psychological disorders, Augmented Reality has given preliminary evidence to be a useful tool due to its adaptability to the patient needs and therapeutic purposes and interactivity. Another relevant factor is the quality of the user's experience in the Augmented Reality system determined from emotional engagement and sense of presence. This experience could increase the AR ecological validity in the treatment of psychological disorders. This paper reviews the recent studies on the use of Augmented Reality in the evaluation and treatment of psychological disorders, focusing on current uses of this technology and on the specific features that delineate Augmented Reality a new technique useful for psychology.;2015;3
"Background and objective: We aimed to test a new telerehabilitation device for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in order to make an initial assessment of its effectiveness. Patients and method: Randomized, controlled pilot study. Intervention: experimental group (10 patients): pelvic floor muscle training, device training and home treatment with it; control group (9 patients): conventional rehabilitation treatment. Outcome measures (baseline and 3 months) overall and specific quality of life: International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire and King's Health Questionnaire, bladder diary, perineometry, satisfaction with the program and degree of compliance. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference for any outcome measures between groups at the end of the follow-up. The change in perineometry values at baseline and after the intervention was significant in the experimental group (23.06 to 32.00, P = .011). No group in this study had any serious adverse effects. Conclusions: The tested device is safe and well accepted. Although there is some evidence of its efficacy in the rehabilitation treatment of SUI, larger trials are needed to appropriately evaluate the potential advantages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

"Background Low vision affects over 300 million people worldwide and can compromise both activities of daily living and quality of life. Rehabilitative training and vision assistive equipment (VAE) may help, but some visually impaired people have limited resources to attend in-person visits at rehabilitation clinics. These people may be able to overcome barriers to care through remote, Internet-based consultation (i.e., telerehabilitation). Objectives To compare the effects of telerehabilitation with face-to-face (e.g., in-office or inpatient) vision rehabilitation services for improving vision-related quality of life and reading speed in people with visual function loss due to any ocular condition. Secondary objectives are to evaluate compliance with scheduled rehabilitation sessions, abandonment rates for visual assistive equipment devices, and patient satisfaction ratings. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015 Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1980 to June 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2015), PubMed (1980 to June 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any language restriction or study design filter in the electronic searches; however, we restricted the searches from 1980 onwards because the Internet was not introduced to the public until 1982. We last searched the electronic databases on 15 June 2015. Selection criteria We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which participants were diagnosed with low vision and were undergoing low vision rehabilitation using an Internet, web-based technology compared with an approach based on in-person consultations. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and then full-text articles against the eligibility criteria. We planned to have two authors independently abstract data from included studies. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. Main results We did not find any study that met the inclusion criteria for this review and, hence, we did not conduct a quantitative analysis. As a part of the background, we discussed review articles on telemedicine for facilitating communication with elderly individuals or for providing remote ophthalmological care. Authors' conclusions We did not find any evidence on whether the use of telerehabilitation is feasible or a potentially viable means to remotely deliver rehabilitation services to individuals with low vision. Given the disease burden and the growing interest in telemedicine, there is a need for future pilot studies and subsequent clinical trials to explore the potential for telerehabilitation as a platform for providing services to people with low vision.";2015;3
"Background Telerehabilitation, an emerging method, extends rehabilitative care beyond the hospital, and facilitates multifaceted, often psychotherapeutic approaches to modern management of patients using telecommunication technology at home or in the community. Although a wide range of telerehabilitation interventions are trialed in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), evidence for their effectiveness is unclear. Objectives To investigate the effectiveness and safety of telerehabilitation intervention in pwMS for improved patient outcomes. Specifically, this review addresses the following questions: does telerehabilitation achieve better outcomes compared with traditional face-to-face intervention; and what types of telerehabilitation interventions are effective, in which setting and influence which specific outcomes (impairment, activity limitation and participation)? Search methods We performed a literature search using the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Review Group Specialised Register(9 July, 2014.) We handsearched the relevant journals and screened the reference lists of identified studies, and contacted authors for additional data. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that reported telerehabilitation intervention/s in pwMS and compared them with some form of control intervention (such as lower level or different types of intervention, minimal intervention, waiting-list controls or no treatment (or usual care); interventions given in different settings) in adults with MS. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. Three review authors assessed the methodological quality of studies using the GRADEpro software (GRADEpro 2008) for best-evidence synthesis. A meta-analysis was not possible due to marked methodological, clinical and statistical heterogeneity between included trials and between measurement tools used. Hence, we performed a best-evidence synthesis using a qualitative analysis. Main results Nine RCTs, one with two reports, (N = 531 participants, 469 included in analyses) investigated a variety of telerehabilitation interventions in adults with MS. The mean age of participants varied from 41 to 52 years (mean 46.5 years) and mean years since diagnosis from 7.7 to 19.0 years (mean 12.3 years). The majority of the participants were women (proportion ranging from 56% to 87%, mean 74%) and with a relapsing-remitting course of MS. These interventions were complex, with more than one rehabilitation component and included physical activity, educational, behavioural and symptom management programmes. All studies scored 'low' on the methodological quality assessment. Overall, the review found 'low-level' evidence for telerehabilitation interventions in reducing short-term disability and symptoms such as fatigue. There was also 'low-level' evidence supporting telerehabilitation in the longer term for improved functional activities, impairments (such as fatigue, pain, insomnia); and participation measured by quality of life and psychological outcomes. There were limited data on process evaluation (participants'/therapists' satisfaction) and no data available for cost effectiveness. There were no adverse events reported as a result of telerehabilitation interventions. Authors' conclusions There is currently limited evidence on the efficacy of telerehabilitation in improving functional activities, fatigue and quality of life in adults with MS. A range of telerehabilitation interventions might be an alternative method of delivering services in MS populations. There is insufficient evidence to support on what types of telerehabilitation interventions are effective, and in which setting. More robust trials are needed to build evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of these interventions.";2015;3
"Background The benefits of rehabilitation in heart failure (HF) patients are well established. Little is known about Nordic walking (NW)training in HF patients especially in those with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess safety, effectiveness, adherence to and acceptance of home-based telemonitored NW in HF patients, including those with CIEDs (i.e. cardiac resynchronisation therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator). Methods The study design was a single-centre, prospective, parallel-group, randomised (2:1), controlled trial among 111 HF patients, New York Heart Association (NYHA) II-III; left ventricular ejection fraction (EF)40%. The intervention was a home-based telemonitored eight-week NW (training group (TG) n=77) five times weekly vs usual care alone (control group (CG) n=34). Outcome measures included a primary end point of functional capacity assessed by peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)peak). Secondary end points included: workload duration (t) in cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), six-minute walking test (6-MWT) distance and quality of life (QoL), Medical Outcome Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36); safety; adherence to and acceptance of NW. Measurements were made before and after intervention. Results NW resulted in significant improvement in: VO(2)peak (16.14.0 vs 18.4 +/- 4.1(ml/kg/min), p=0.0001), t (471 +/- 141 vs 577 +/- 158 (s), p=0.0001), 6-MWT(428 +/- 93 vs 480 +/- 87 (m), p=0.0001) and QoL (79.0 +/- 31.3 vs 70.8 +/- 30.3 (score), p=0.0001). We did not observe favourable results in the CG. The differences between the TG and CG were significant in: VO(2)peak (2.0 +/- 2.4 vs -0.2 +/- 2.1, p=0.0004); t (108 +/- 108 vs 0.94 +/- 109, p=0.0031); 6-MWT (53.8 +/- 63.9 vs 22.0 +/- 68.7, p=0.0483). In neither group were there deaths nor necessity for hospitalisation. We did not observe any intervention from CIEDs during NW. All patients in the TG completed rehabilitation and accepted it well. Conclusion In HF patients, including those with CIEDs, home-based telemonitored NW is safe and effective. NW was well accepted by patients and adherence was high and promising.";2015;3
Background. Geographical location, socioeconomic status, and logistics surrounding transportation impede access of poststroke individuals to comprehensive rehabilitative services. Robotic therapy may enhance telerehabilitation by delivering consistent and state-of-the art therapy while allowing remote monitoring and adjusting therapy for underserved populations. The Hand Mentor Pro (HMP) was incorporated within a home exercise program (HEP) to improve upper-extremity (UE) functional capabilities poststroke. Objective. To determine the efficacy of a home-based telemonitored robotic-assisted therapy as part of a HEP compared with a dose-matched HEP-only intervention among individuals less than 6 months poststroke and characterized as underserved. Methods. In this prospective, single-blinded, multisite, randomized controlled trial, 99 hemiparetic participants with limited access to UE rehabilitation were randomized to either (1) the experimental group, which received combined HEP and HMP for 3 h/d x5 days x8 weeks, or (2) the control group, which received HEP only at an identical dosage. Weekly communication between the supervising therapist and participant promoted compliance and progression of the HEP and HMP prescription. The Action Research Arm Test and Wolf Motor Function Test along with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE) were primary and secondary outcome measures, respectively, undertaken before and after the interventions. Results. Both groups demonstrated improvement across all UE outcomes. Conclusions. Robotic + HEP and HEP only were both effectively delivered remotely. There was no difference between groups in change in motor function over time. Additional research is necessary to determine the appropriate dosage of HMP and HEP.;2015;3
Background: An aging population and people's higher survival to diseases and traumas that leave physical consequences are challenging aspects in the context of an efficient health management. This is why telerehabilitation systems are being developed, to allow monitoring and support of physiotherapy sessions at home, which could reduce healthcare costs while also improving the quality of life of the users. Objectives: Our goal is the development of a Kinect-based algorithm that provides a very accurate real-time monitoring of physical rehabilitation exercises and that also provides a friendly interface oriented both to users and physiotherapists. Methods: The two main constituents of our algorithm are the posture classification method and the exercises recognition method. The exercises consist of series of movements. Each movement is composed of an initial posture, a final posture and the angular trajectories of the limbs involved in the movement. The algorithm was designed and tested with datasets of real movements performed by volunteers. We also explain in the paper how we obtained the optimal values for the trade-off values for posture and trajectory recognition. Results: Two relevant aspects of the algorithm were evaluated in our tests, classification accuracy and real-time data processing. We achieved 91.9% accuracy in posture classification and 93.75% accuracy in trajectory recognition. We also checked whether the algorithm was able to process the data in real-time. We found that our algorithm could process more than 20,000 postures per second and all the required trajectory dataseries in real-time, which in practice guarantees no perceptible delays. Later on, we carried out two clinical trials with real patients that suffered shoulder disorders. We obtained an exercise monitoring accuracy of 95.16%. Conclusions: We present an exercise recognition algorithm that handles the data provided by Kinect efficiently. The algorithm has been validated in a real scenario where we have verified its suitability. Moreover, we have received a positive feedback from both users and the physiotherapists who took part in the tests.;2015;3
Background: Assistive and robotic training devices are increasingly used for rehabilitation of the hemiparetic arm after stroke, although applications for the wrist and hand are trailing behind. Furthermore, applying a training device in domestic settings may enable an increased training dose of functional arm and hand training. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and potential clinical changes associated with a technology-supported arm and hand training system at home for patients with chronic stroke. Methods: A dynamic wrist and hand orthosis was combined with a remotely monitored user interface with motivational gaming environment for self-administered training at home. Twenty-four chronic stroke patients with impaired arm/hand function were recruited to use the training system at home for six weeks. Evaluation of feasibility involved training duration, usability and motivation. Clinical outcomes on arm/hand function, activity and participation were assessed before and after six weeks of training and at two-month follow-up. Results: Mean System Usability Scale score was 69 % (SD 17 %), mean Intrinsic Motivation Inventory score was 5.2 (SD 0.9) points, and mean training duration per week was 105 (SD 66) minutes. Median Fugl-Meyer score improved from 37 (IQR 30) pre-training to 41 (IQR 32) post-training and was sustained at two-month follow-up (40 (IQR 32)). The Stroke Impact Scale improved from 56.3 (SD 13.2) pre-training to 60.0 (SD 13.9) post-training, with a trend at follow-up (59.8 (SD 15.2)). No significant improvements were found on the Action Research Arm Test and Motor Activity Log. Conclusions: Remotely monitored post-stroke training at home applying gaming exercises while physically supporting the wrist and hand showed to be feasible: participants were able and motivated to use the training system independently at home. Usability shows potential, although several usability issues need further attention. Upper extremity function and quality of life improved after training, although dexterity did not. These findings indicate that home-based arm and hand training with physical support from a dynamic orthosis is a feasible tool to enable self-administered practice at home. Such an approach enables practice without dependence on therapist availability, allowing an increase in training dose with respect to treatment in supervised settings.;2015;3
"Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to reduce the cardiovascular mortality of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and help people to return to professional work. Unfortunately, limited accessibility and low participation levels present persistent challenges in almost all countries where CR is available. Applying telerehabilitation provides an opportunity to improve the implementation of and adherence to CR, and it seems that the hybrid form of training may be the optimal approach due to its cost-effectiveness and feasibility for patients referred by a social insurance institution. Aim: To present the clinical characteristics and evaluate the effects of hybrid: outpatient followed by home-based cardiac telerehabilitation in patients with CAD in terms of exercise tolerance, safety, and adherence to the programme. Methods: A total of 125 patients (112 men, 13 women) with CAD, aged 58.3 +/- 4.5 years, underwent a five-week training programme (TP) consisting of 19-22 exercise training sessions. The first stage of TP was performed in the ambulatory form of CR in hospital; then, patients continued to be telemonitored TP at home (hybrid model of cardiac rehabilitation - HCR). Before and after completing CR, all patients underwent a symptom-limited treadmill exercise stress test. Adherence was reported by the number of dropouts from the TP. Results: The number of days of absence in the HCR programme was 1.50 +/- 4.07 days. There were significant improvements (p < 0.05) in some measured variables after HCR in the exercise test: max. workload: 7.86 +/- 2.59 METs vs. 8.88 +/- 2.67 METs; heart rate (HR) at rest: 77.59 +/- 12.53 bpm vs. 73.01 +/- 11.57 bpm; systolic blood pressure at rest: 136.69 +/- 17.19 mm Hg vs. 130.92 +/- 18.95 mm Hg; double product at rest: 10623.33 +/- 2262.97 vs. 9567.50 +/- 2116.81; HRR1: 97.46 +/- 18.27 bpm vs. 91.07 +/- 19.19 bpm; and, NYHA class: 1.18 +/- 0.48 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.35. Conclusions: In patients with documented CAD, HCR is feasible and safe, and adherence is good. Most patients were on social rehabilitation benefit, had a smoking history, and suffered from hypertension, obesity, or were overweight. A hybrid model of CR improved exercise tolerance.";2015;3
"Background: Cardiac telerehabilitation has been introduced as an adjunct or alternative to conventional center-based cardiac rehabilitation to increase its long-term effectiveness. However, before large-scale implementation and reimbursement in current health care systems is possible, well-designed studies on the effectiveness of this new additional treatment strategy are needed. Objective: The aim of this trial was to assess the medium-term effectiveness of an Internet-based, comprehensive, and patient-tailored telerehabilitation program with short message service (SMS) texting support for cardiac patients. Methods: This multicenter randomized controlled trial consisted of 140 cardiac rehabilitation patients randomized (1: 1) to a 24-week telerehabilitation program in combination with conventional cardiac rehabilitation (intervention group; n=70) or to conventional cardiac rehabilitation alone (control group; n=70). In the telerehabilitation program, initiated 6 weeks after the start of ambulatory rehabilitation, patients were stimulated to increase physical activity levels. Based on registered activity data, they received semiautomatic telecoaching via email and SMS text message encouraging them to gradually achieve predefined exercise training goals. Patient-specific dietary and/or smoking cessation advice was also provided as part of the telecoaching. The primary endpoint was peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak). Secondary endpoints included accelerometer-recorded daily step counts, self-assessed physical activities by International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and health-related quality of life (HRQL) assessed by the HeartQol questionnaire at baseline and at 6 and 24 weeks. Results: Mean VO2 peak increased significantly in intervention group patients (n=69) from baseline (mean 22.46, SD 0.78 mL/[min*kg]) to 24 weeks (mean 24.46, SD 1.00 mL/[min*kg], P<.01) versus control group patients (n=70), who did not change significantly (baseline: mean 22.72, SD 0.74 mL/[min*kg]; 24 weeks: mean 22.15, SD 0.77 mL/[min*kg], P=.09). Between-group analysis of aerobic capacity confirmed a significant difference between the intervention group and control group in favor of the intervention group (P<.001). At 24 weeks, self-reported physical activity improved more in the intervention group compared to the control group (P=.01) as did the global HRQL score (P=.01). Conclusions: This study showed that an additional 6-month patient-specific, comprehensive telerehabilitation program can lead to a bigger improvement in both physical fitness (VO2 peak) and associated HRQL compared to center-based cardiac rehabilitation alone. These results are supportive in view of possible future implementation in standard cardiac care.";2015;3
Background: Digital media and gaming have received considerable interest from researchers and clinicians as a model for learning a broad range of complex tasks and facilitating the transfer of skills to daily life. These emerging rehabilitation technologies have the potential to improve clinical outcomes and patient participation because they are engaging, motivating, and accessible. Our research goal is to develop preventative and therapeutic point-of-care eHealth applications that will lead to equivalent or better long-term health outcomes and health care costs than existing programs. We have produced a novel computer-aided tele-rehabilitation platform that combines computer game-based exercises with tele-monitoring. Objective: Compare the therapeutic effectiveness of an in-home, game-based rehabilitation program (GRP) to standard care delivered in an outpatient physical therapy clinic on measures of balance, gaze control, dizziness, and health-related quality of life. Methods: A randomized, controlled, single-blind pilot trial will be conducted. Fifty-six participants with a diagnosis of peripheral vestibular disorder will be randomly assigned to either usual physical therapy (comparator group) or to a game-based intervention (experimental group). Measures to be assessed will include gaze control, dynamic balance, and self-reported measures of dizziness. Results: The project was funded and enrollment was started in August 2014. To date, 36 participants have been enrolled. There have been 6 drop-outs. It is expected that the study will be completed January 2016 and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in Spring of 2016. Conclusions: A successful application of this rehabilitation program would help streamline rehabilitation services, leverage therapist time spent with clients, and permit regular practice times at the client's convenience.;2015;3
"Background: Exercise training is an established, guideline-recommended treatment approach in cardiovascular disease. Designing novel methods of exercise training that would be accepted by the patients seems to be a way to increase patient attendance at cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The 6-min walking test (6-MWT) is a simple, safe and objective method to assess exercise capacity. In patients without heart failure, oxygen consumption after 6 min of walking reaches the ventilatory threshold (VT) level. Training up to the VT level is recommended in CR. Theoretical grounds exist for designing a novel model of CR based on diagnostic 6-MWT. Aim: Pilot implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of a new form of walking training based on 6-MWT in low-risk patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods: The study included 119 men after CABG undergoing phase II CR. Depending on whether patients granted a consent to undergo home-based electrocardiography (ECG) telemonitored CR or not, they were divided into two groups: group A (60 patients) - standard CR combined with the new model (walking 6 times for 6 min with 3-min intervals) for 5 days a week; and group B (59 controls) - standard CR. At baseline and after 3 and 12 months, the patients underwent the following tests: 6-MWT, 24-h Holter ECG monitoring (including evaluation of heart rate variability), and biochemical laboratory tests. Results: No significant differences in 6-MWT distance were found between the groups at baseline and at 3 and 12 months. At 3 months, 6-MWT distance increased significantly in both groups (group A: 419 +/- 73 vs. 515 +/- 70 m, p < 0.02; group B: 422 +/- 86 vs. 519 +/- 73 m, p < 0.02). At 3 and 12 months, body mass was higher in group B controls (p < 0.05). At 3 months, glycaemia and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were significantly lower in group A patients (p < 0.05). At 12 months, triglyceride levels were higher in group B (p < 0.05). At 3 months, SDNN was higher in group A. After 12 months, LF was lower in group A. At baseline, the LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in group A (p < 0.05) but during further follow-up, favourable changes in the LF/HF ratio were noted only in group A. Conclusions: The novel model of exercise walking training had a favourable effect on body mass, glycaemia and hsCRP level reduction, and induced favourable changes of the sympathovagal balance.";2015;3
BACKGROUND: Individuals with mobility impairment may benefit from passive exercise mode which can be subsequently enhanced by an active exercise program. However, it is unclear which exercise mode promotes higher adherence to prescribed exercise intensity. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this project was to compare adherence to prescribed speed during passive and active cycling exercise. METHODS: We used cross-over study design in which subjects followed the same cycling intensity prescription for passive and active exercise modes in a random sequence. Coefficient of variation (CV) and speed differences were used to estimate extent of deviation from the prescribed trajectory. RESULTS: CV varied from 5.2% to 20.4% for the active mode and from 2.8% to 4.5% for the passive mode respectively. Though the CV differences did not reach statistical significance, analysis of cycling speed adherence of 120-second periods showed significantly higher cycling adherence during passive mode for each target cycling speed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the passive mode may promote exercise safety and efficacy by helping patients who have safety concerns such as the frail elderly, patients with cardiovascular conditions or people with other contraindications for excessive exertion during exercise, in following the optimal intensity trajectory prescribed by their provider.;2015;3
Background: Many persons post-stroke continue to have difficulty using their more involved upper extremity and home programs may be poorly adhered to limiting the amount of practice an individual receives. More information on the experience of traditional home program and the acceptability of a novel home intervention was sought. Objective: To qualitatively describe 1) upper extremity use at home, 2) previous home exercise or activity programs, and 3) the acceptability of a novel upper extremity home program, NeuroGame Therapy (NGT), that combines surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback and a commercial computer game. Methods: A purposeful sample of ten persons with moderate to severe upper extremity motor impairment used the NGT intervention in their home for four weeks and completed nested (pre and post) one-on-one interviews. Written transcripts from the interviews were coded and themes were identified to address stated objectives. Results: Participants reported that while use of their upper extremity in daily activities was recommended it occurred infrequently. Most participants described previous home programs as being non-specific, were often not carried out as recommended or were self-modified. Participants found NGT to be engaging and motivating, but reported minimal changes in the functional uses of their upper extremity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that after stroke upper extremity use may be infrequent and home program approaches could be re-examined. NGT was reported to be an acceptable home intervention, but it will require further development and study to understand its value and role in post-stroke rehabilitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Rehabilitation provided through home visits is part of the continuum of care after discharge from hospital following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). As demands for rehabilitation at home are growing and becoming more difficult to meet, in-home telerehabilitation has been proposed as an alternate service delivery method. However, there is a need for robust data concerning both the effectiveness and the cost of dispensing in-home telerehabilitation. Objective: The objective of this study was to document, analyze, and compare real costs of two service delivery methods: in-home telerehabilitation and conventional home visits. Methods: The economic analysis was conducted as part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on telerehabilitation for TKA, and involved data from 197 patients, post-TKA. Twice a week for 8 weeks, participants received supervised physiotherapy via two delivery methods, depending on their study group allocation: in-home telerehabilitation (TELE) and home-visit rehabilitation (VISIT). Patients were recruited from eight hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada. The TELE group intervention was delivered by videoconferencing over high-speed Internet. The VISIT group received the same intervention at home. Costs related to the delivery of the two services (TELE and VISIT) were calculated. Student's t tests were used to compare costs per treatment between the two groups. To take distance into account, the two treatment groups were compared within distance strata using two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Results: The mean cost of a single session was Can $93.08 for the VISIT group (SD $35.70) and $80.99 for the TELE group (SD $26.60). When comparing both groups, real total cost analysis showed a cost differential in favor of the TELE group (TELE minus VISIT: -$263, 95% CI -$382 to -$143). However, when the patient's home was located less than 30 km round-trip from the health care center, the difference in costs between TELE and VISIT treatments was not significant (P=.25, .26, and .11 for the <10, 10-19, and 20-29 km strata, respectively). The cost of TELE treatments was lower than VISIT treatments when the distance was 30 km or more (30-49 km: $81<$103, P=.002; >= 50 km: $90<$152, P<.001). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study of the actual costs of in-home telerehabilitation covering all subcosts of telerehabilitation and distance between the health care center and the patient's home. The cost for a single session of in-home telerehabilitation compared to conventional home-visit rehabilitation was lower or about the same, depending on the distance between the patient's home and health care center. Under the controlled conditions of an RCT, a favorable cost differential was observed when the patient was more than 30 km from the provider. Stakeholders and program planners can use these data to guide decisions regarding introducing telerehabilitation as a new service in their clinic.";2015;3
"Background: Rehabilitation, with an emphasis on physiotherapy and exercise, is widely promoted after total knee replacement. However, provision of services varies in content and duration. The aim of this study is to update the review of Minns Lowe and colleagues 2007 using systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of post-discharge physiotherapy exercise in patients with primary total knee replacement. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL and Cochrane CENTRAL to October 4th 2013 for randomised evaluations of physiotherapy exercise in adults with recent primary knee replacement. Outcomes were: patient-reported pain and function, knee range of motion, and functional performance. Authors were contacted for missing data and outcomes. Risk of bias and heterogeneity were assessed. Data was combined using random effects meta-analysis and reported as standardised mean differences (SMD) or mean differences (MD). Results: Searches identified 18 randomised trials including 1,739 patients with total knee replacement. Interventions compared: physiotherapy exercise and no provision; home and outpatient provision; pool and gym-based provision; walking skills and more general physiotherapy; and general physiotherapy exercise with and without additional balance exercises or ergometer cycling. Compared with controls receiving minimal physiotherapy, patients receiving physiotherapy exercise had improved physical function at 3-4 months, SMD -0.37 (95% CI -0.62, -0.12), and pain, SMD -0.45 (95% CI -0.85, -0.06). Benefit up to 6 months was apparent when considering only higher quality studies. There were no differences for outpatient physiotherapy exercise compared with home-based provision in physical function or pain outcomes. There was a short-term benefit favouring home-based physiotherapy exercise for range of motion flexion. There were no differences in outcomes when the comparator was hydrotherapy, or when additional balancing or cycling components were included. In one study, a walking skills intervention was associated with a long-term improvement in walking performance. However, for all these evaluations studies were under-powered individually and in combination. Conclusion: After recent primary total knee replacement, interventions including physiotherapy and exercise show short-term improvements in physical function. However this conclusion is based on meta-analysis of a few small studies and no long-term benefits of physiotherapy exercise interventions were identified. Future research should target improvements to long-term function, pain and performance outcomes in appropriately powered trials.";2015;3
"Background: Stroke remains one of the most common causes of adult disability in the world. In recent years, diverse telerehabilitation programs have been conceived and studied to improve the abilities of the activities of daily living and increased independence of stroke patients living at home. The systematic review was conducted to determine whether telerehabilitation leads to an improvement in abilities of activities of daily living for stroke patients. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of telerehabilitation in stroke survivors living at home were identified by searching 7 electronic databases from inception to March 2015, and by hand searching for conference literatures between 2000 and 2015. Assessments of risk bias and data extraction were conducted independently by 2 reviews. Results: The search strategy identified 2587 records, of which 11 studies were thought to be eligible. Pooled results from 7 studies showed no significant differences in abilities of activities of daily living (Barthel Index scale: standardized mean difference [SMD] -. 05, 95% confidence interval [CI] -. 24 to.13; Berg Balance Scale: SMD -. 05, 95% CI -. 7 to.37) and motor function (Fugl-Meyer Extremity: SMD.05, 95% CI -. 09 to 1.09) between groups. Conclusions: This review provides limited, moderate evidence that telerehabilitation of all approaches has equal effects with conventional rehabilitation in improving abilities of activities of daily living and motor function for stroke survivors. Further research of RCTs in this area (rehabilitation field of telemedicine) is ungently required to extend the evidence base.";2015;3
Background: Telerehabilitation has been proposed as an adjunct/alternative to standard center-based cardiac rehabilitation. Two recent systematic reviews showed non-inferiority and/or superiority of this remote approach for cardiac rehabilitation. However, these trials focused only on one core component of cardiac rehabilitation and telemonitoring, rather than implementing a more comprehensive approach. The aim of Telerehab III is to investigate the long-term effectiveness of the addition of a patient-tailored, internet-based telerehabilitation program implementing multiple cardiac rehabilitation core components and using both telemonitoring and telecoaching strategies to standard cardiac rehabilitation. Methods/Design: In this prospective, multi-center randomized, controlled trial 140 patients with coronary artery disease and/or chronic heart failure patients will be recruited between February 2013 and February 2015. Patients will be randomized 1: 1 to an intervention group (receiving an internet-based telerehabilitation program in addition to standard cardiac rehabilitation) or to standard cardiac rehabilitation alone. The mean follow-up is at least 6 months. The primary endpoint is peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak). Secondary endpoints include measured and self-reported daily physical activity, cardiovascular risk factor control, health-related quality of life, days lost due to (non) cardiovascular rehospitalizations and time to first (non) cardiovascular rehospitalization. A clinical event committee blinded to treatment allocation assesses causes of rehospitalizations. Discussion: Telerehab III will be one of the first studies to examine the added value of a more comprehensive cardiac telerehabilitation program, focusing on multiple cardiac rehabilitation core components. It has the potential to augment current standard center-based cardiac rehabilitation practices and to be used as a model for other disease prevention programs.;2015;3
"Background: Telerehabilitation, a service delivery model using telecommunications technology to provide therapy at a distance, is used in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), but evidence for their effectiveness is yet to be determined. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of telerehabilitation intervention pwMS. Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using medical and health science electronic databases. Three reviewers selected potential studies and independently assessed the methodological quality. A meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity amongst included trials, and a qualitative analysis was performed for best evidence synthesis. Results: Ten RCTs and 2 observational studies (n=564 participants) investigated a wide variety of telerehabilitation intervention in pwMS, which included: physical activity; educational, behavioural and symptom management programmes. All studies scored low to moderate on the methodological quality assessment implying high risk of bias. Overall, the review found low level evidence for the effectiveness of telerehabilitation on reducing short-term disability and reducing and/or improving symptoms, such as fatigue. There was low level evidence suggesting some benefit of telerehabilitation in improving functional activities; improving symptoms in the longer-term; and psychological outcomes and quality of life. There is limited data on safety, process evaluation and no data on cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation. Conclusions: A wide range of telerehabilitation is used in pwMS, however, the quality of evidence on these interventions was low. More robust trials are needed to build evidence about these interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.";2015;3
Background: The availability of less resource-intensive alternatives to home visits for rehabilitation following orthopaedic surgeries is important, given the increasing need for home care services and the shortage of health resources. The goal of this trial was to determine whether an in-home telerehabilitation program is not clinically inferior to a face-to-face home visit approach (standard care) after hospital discharge of patients following a total knee arthroplasty. Methods: Two hundred and five patients who had a total knee arthroplasty were randomized before hospital discharge to the telerehabilitation group or the face-to-face home visit group. Both groups received the same rehabilitation intervention for two months after hospital discharge. Patients were evaluated at baseline (before total knee arthroplasty), immediately after the rehabilitation intervention (two months after discharge), and two months later (four months after discharge). The primary outcome measure was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire at the last follow-up evaluation. Secondary outcome measures included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire, functional and strength tests, and knee range of motion. The noninferiority margin was set at 9% for the WOMAC. Results: The demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups of patients were similar at baseline. At the last follow-up evaluation, the mean differences between the groups with regard to the WOMAC gains, adjusted for baseline values, were near zero (for 182 patients in the per-protocol analysis): -1.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.6%, 2.3%) for the total score, -1.6% (95% CI: -5.9%, 2.8%) for pain, -0.7% (95% CI: -6.8%, 5.4%) for stiffness, and -1.8% (95% CI: -5.9%, 2.3%) for function. The confidence intervals were all within the predetermined zone of noninferiority. The secondary outcomes had similar results, as did the intention-to-treat analysis, which was conducted afterward for 198 patients. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the noninferiority of in-home telerehabilitation and support its use as an effective alternative to face-to-face service delivery after hospital discharge of patients following a total knee arthroplasty.;2015;3
"Background: The effectiveness of stationary and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes has been proven by some authors, but data concerning the effects of hybrid forms of cardiac rehabilitation (HCR) in this population are lacking. A home-based telerehabilitation is a promising form of secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in this group of patients. Aim: The objective of the study was to compare the effects of HCR in CAD patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). The secondary endpoint was the assessment of CAD risk factors like low exercise capacity and obesity, in both groups of patients. Methods: This was a retrospective study, which comprised 125 patients with CAD aged 57.31 +/- 5.61 years referred for HCR. They were assigned to Group D (with diabetes; n = 37) or Group C (without diabetes; n = 88). HCR was carried out as a comprehensive procedure that included all core components of cardiac rehabilitation according to guidelines. Before and after HCR all patients underwent a symptom-limited exercise test performed according to the Bruce protocol on a treadmill. Results: Before HCR the maximal workload was higher in Group C than in Group D (8.13 +/- 2.82 METs vs. 6.77 +/- 1.88 METs; p = 0.023), but after HCR the difference was not significant. In both groups an increase in the maximal workload after HCR was observed (Group D: before HCR 6.81 +/- 1.91 METs, after HCR 8.30 +/- 2.04 METs; p < 0.001; Group C: before HCR 8.31 +/- 2.71 METs, after HCR 9.13 +/- 2.87 METs; p = 0.001). Resting heart rate, double product, and heart rate recovery 1 (HRR1) declined in both groups. No significant differences in changes in exercise test parameters between both groups' parameters were found. Conclusions: HCR was effective in patients with DM. The adherence was high. Patients with DM had higher rates of obesity and significantly lower exercise tolerance than patients without DM. Patients from both groups gained similar benefit from HCR in terms of physical capacity, resting heart rate, and heart rate recovery.";2015;3
"Background: The most common manifestation of heart failure is physical capacity impairment resulting in dyspnoea and fatigue. The disease deteriorates the quality of life (QoL). Its consequences restrict not only functioning in the physical aspect of QoL but also patients' emotional condition. Objective: The study is aimed to assess QoL changes in HF patients after home-based telemonitored cardiac rehabilitation (HTCR Group) versus outpatient-based standard cardiac rehabilitation (SCR Group). Methods: The study comprised 131 heart failure patients (aged 56.410.9 years; II/III NYHA) rehabilitated for eight weeks in two random groups: HTCR Group (n=75), participating in home-based rehabilitation supervised telemedically based on walking training; SCR Group (n=56), participating in traditional outpatient-based rehabilitation (cycloergometer training). QoL parameters were assessed with a Polish version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). Results: After rehabilitation, both groups achieved a significant QoL improvement, both physically and mentally. HTCR Group patients improved in QoL physical categories in one subscale (physical function), and in two subscales in the mental categories (mental health, vitality). In SCR Group, three physical subscales improved (physical function, role limitation caused by physical problems, bodily pain). In the mental categories, also three subscales improved (social function, mental health, vitality). Conclusions: The study demonstrated that in heart failure patients HTCR provided a similar improvement in total QoL index as SCR. Yet it differed in QoL subscales. Patients who underwent home-based telerehabilitation observed an improvement mainly in the mental categories. Patients in SCR Group improved their general physical well-being.";2015;3
BACKGROUND: Unilateral Spatial Neglect, or neglect, is a common behavioral syndrome in patients following unilateral brain damage, such as stroke. In recent years, new technologies, such as computer-based tools and virtual reality have been used in order to solve some limitations of the traditional neglect evaluation. Within this perspective, also mobile devices such as tablets seems to be promising tools, being able to support interactive virtual environments and, at the same time, allowing to easily reproduce traditional paper-and-pencil test. OBJECTIVE: In this context, the aim of our study was to investigate the potentiality of a new mobile application (Neglect App) designed and developed for tablet (iPad) for screening neglect symptoms. METHODS: To address this objective, we divided a sample of 16 right-damaged patients according to the presence or absence of neglect and we administered assessment test in their traditional and Neglect App version. RESULTS: Results showed that the cancellation tests developed within Neglect App were equally effective to traditional paper-and-pencil tests (Line cancellation test and Star Cancellation test) in detecting neglect symptoms. Secondly, according to our results, the Neglect App Card Dealing task was more sensitive in detecting neglect symptoms than traditional functional task. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, results gives preliminary evidences supporting the feasibility of Neglect App for the screening of USN symptoms.;2015;3
"Background: With high morbidity, mortality and disability rate, brain infarction brings a huge economic and health burden to the whole society in China. Although some previous studies suggested that telerehabilitation may facilitate rehabilitation for stroke survivors at home, the evidence is insufficient for clinical application; additionally, as yet no trial evaluates efficacy of telerehabilitation for brain infarction patients. Therefore, more high quality trials are needed to provide practice evidence for this novel rehabilitation strategy. Methods/Design: Based on recruitment criteria, this assessor blinded, paralleled randomized controlled trial will recruit 210 brain infarction patients. After being randomly allocated into two groups, participants will receive home-based tele-supervising rehabilitation or conventional rehabilitation. Outcome measurement will be conducted at the end of intervention and 90-day follow-up. Among which, Barthel index assessment will be considered as primary outcome measurement, secondary outcome measurements include NIHSS score, mRS score, 3-oz water swallow test and surface electromyography. Adverse events will also be recorded during the whole process of the trial for safety assessment. Discussion: The HTRBIP trial will evaluate efficacy and safety of home-based tele-supervising rehabilitation for brain infarction patients. It is expected to provide new evidence for telerehabilitation application.";2015;3
"Background:Different kinds of telemedicine services have made their entry into healthcare. In this article we focus on a telerehabilitation service for physical exercise, designed and implemented as partial replacement of a 3-day outpatient rehabilitation program for chronic disease patients. The aim of this article is to examine the use pattern of this telerehabilitation service by chronic disease patients and to examine the association between actual use and clinical benefit experienced by these patients.Materials and Methods:Chronic lower back pain (CLBP) patients and pulmonary disease (PD) patients referred to the physical outpatient rehabilitation programs were asked to participate in and to use the telerehabilitation service. The actual use was expressed as frequency and duration of use, and the measurement of clinical benefit focused on complaints and physical functioning.Results:Sixty-two patients finished the outpatient rehabilitation using the telerehabilitation service. During the weeks of home rehabilitation the majority of the patients used the service. On average the service was used one or two times a week for a total of 35-38min for both pathologies, with this value being lower than the time that was replaced. Frequency of use was significantly associated with the change in physical functioning outcome for both pathologies (CLBP, r=0.41, p=0.02; PD, r=0.55, p=0.003).Conclusions:Chronic disease patients used a telerehabilitation service as partial replacement of their face-to-face rehabilitation program, and more frequent use was positively related to higher clinical benefit.";2015;3
"Background:Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has proven effective in improving exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In Canada, however, there are insufficient rehabilitation services. New strategies such as telerehabilitation must be deployed to increase accessibility. This study aims to investigate the effect of telerehabilitation on exercise tolerance and quality of life and to document patient satisfaction and adherence.Materials and Methods:Twenty-six patients with moderate to very severe COPD participated in this pre-/postintervention study. They received 15 in-home teletreatment sessions over 8 weeks via videoconference from a service center to their home. Education was provided via self-learning health capsules. Assessments were carried out twice before (T0 and T1; 8 weeks apart) and immediately after the intervention (T2). Primary outcome measures were changes in exercise tolerance (6-min walk test [6MWT] and cycle endurance test [CET]) and quality of life (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire [CRQ]).Results:There were significant improvements between pre- and postintervention (T2-T1) on the 6MWT (32m; p<0.001), CET (41s; p=0.005), and three of four CRQ domains (dyspnea [p<0.001], fatigue [p=0.002], and emotion [p=0.002]). Improvements in the CET and fatigue during the 8-week intervention period were greater than changes over 8 weeks of maturation (T1-T0) (p=0.004 and 0.02, respectively). Participants' satisfaction and adherence rate with telerehabilitation were very high.Conclusions:Using telehealth technology to deliver in-home PR is a feasible and practical solution for patients with moderate to very severe COPD. The telerehabilitation program was associated with beneficial effects on exercise tolerance and quality of life and was well received by users.";2015;3
Children with developmental disabilities such as childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) require repeated intervention sessions with a speech therapist, sometimes extending over several years. Technology-based therapy tools offer the potential to reduce the demanding workload of speech therapists as well as time and cost for families. In response to this need, we have developed Tabby Talks, a multi-tier system for remote administration of speech therapy. This paper describes the speech processing pipeline to automatically detect common errors associated with CAS. The pipeline contains modules for voice activity detection, pronunciation verification, and lexical stress verification. The voice activity detector evaluates the intensity contour of an utterance and compares it against an adaptive threshold to detect silence segments and measure voicing delays and total production time. The pronunciation verification module uses a generic search lattice structure with multiple internal paths that covers all possible pronunciation errors (substitutions, insertions and deletions) in the child's production. Finally, the lexical stress verification module classifies the lexical stress across consecutive syllables into strong weak or weak-strong patterns using a combination of prosodic and spectral measures. These error measures can be provided to the therapist through a web interface, to enable them to adapt the child's therapy program remotely: When evaluated on a dataset of typically developing and disordered speech from children ages 4-16 years, the system achieves a pronunciation verification accuracy of 88.2% at the phoneme level and 80.7% at the utterance level, and lexical stress classification rate of 83.3%.

Chronic diseases are an international concern, for their increasing incidence and the strain on individuals and on healthcare systems. In order to enable the healthcare system to cope with increasing demands and to avoid strong decrements in subject's functionality and well-being, a variety of changes for the management of chronic disease care have been advocated by the World Health Organization. The objective of the research is to verify the feasibility and acceptability of a technological solution that allows to transfer a tailored rehabilitation program for patients with disabilities in the home environment. The first step of the study is to identify the correct technological solution on the basis of the International Standard of Organization (ISO) definition of usability and acceptability. The second step is to verify the capacity of the system to perform correctly what is requested. The third step will be to verify the system efficacy in the patients' training.;2015;3
Classification is a data processing technique of a great significance both for native eHealth systems and web telemedicine solutions. In this sense, artificial neural networks have been widely applied in telerehabilitation as powerful tools to process information and acquire a new medical knowledge. But effective analysis of multidimensional heterogeneous medical data, still poses considerable difficulties. It was shown that processing too many data features simultaneously is costly and has some adverse effects on the resulting models classification properties. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop new techniques for selecting features from the very large data sets that include many irrelevant, or redundant features. This work addresses the context-related feature selection problem from medical data by proposing utility of Sigma-if neural network being an effective model of neurology patients's low-level distributed selective attention mechanisms. Our experiments indicate that a context-aware technique can reduce the average cost of medical data acquisition and data processing as well as it can decrease classification error probability resulting in increasing the overall eHealth systems reliability.;2015;3
Cognitive rehabilitation aims to remediate or alleviate the cognitive deficits appearing after an episode of acquired brain injury (ABI). The purpose of this work is to describe the telerehabilitation platform called Guttmann Neuropersonal Trainer (GNPT) which provides new strategies for cognitive rehabilitation, improving efficiency and access to treatments, and to increase knowledge generation from the process. A cognitive rehabilitation process has been modeled to design and develop the system, which allows neuropsychologists to configure and schedule rehabilitation sessions, consisting of set of personalized computerized cognitive exercises grounded on neuroscience and plasticity principles. It provides remote continuous monitoring of patient's performance, by an asynchronous communication strategy. An automatic knowledge extraction method has been used to implement a decision support system, improving treatment customization. GNPT has been implemented in 27 rehabilitation centers and in 83 patients' homes, facilitating the access to the treatment. In total, 1660 patients have been treated. Usability and cost analysis methodologies have been applied to measure the efficiency in real clinical environments. The usability evaluation reveals a system usability score higher than 70 for all target users. The cost efficiency study results show a relation of 1-20 compared to face-to-face rehabilitation. GNPT enables brain-damaged patients to continue and further extend rehabilitation beyond the hospital, improving the efficiency of the rehabilitation process. It allows customized therapeutic plans, providing information to further development of clinical practice guidelines.;2015;3
Computer operators spend long periods of time sitting in a static posture at computer workstations and therefore have an increased exposure to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSD). The present study is aimed at investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of a tele-biofeedback ergonomic intervention programme among computer operators suffering from WRMSD. Twelve subjects with WRMSD were assigned an ergonomic intervention accompanied by remote tele-biofeedback training, which was practised at their workstations. Evaluations of pain symptoms and locations, body posture and psychosocial characteristics were carried out before and after the intervention in the workplace. The hypothesis was partially verified as it showed improved body position at the workstation and decreased pain in some body parts. Tele-biofeedback, as part of an intervention, appears to be feasible and efficient for computer operators who suffer from WRMSD. This study encourages further research on tele-health within the scope of occupational therapy practice. Practitioner Summary: Research concerning tele-health using biofeedback is scarce. The present study analyses the feasibility and partial effectiveness of a tele-biofeedback ergonomic intervention programme for computer operators suffering from WRMSD. The uniqueness and singularity of this study is the usage of remote communication between participants and practitioners through the Internet.;2015;3
Effective telerehabilitation technologies enable patients with certain physiological disabilities to engage in rehabilitative exercises for performing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Therefore, training and assessment scenarios for the performance of ADLs are vital for the promotion for telerehabilitation. In this paper we investigate quantitatively and automatically assessing patient's kinematic ability to performfunctional upper extremity reaching tasks. The shape of the movement trajectory and the instantaneous acceleration of kinematically crucial body parts, such as wrists, are used to compute the approximate entropy of the motions to represent stability (smoothness) in addition to the duration of the activity. Computer simulations were conducted to illustrate the consistency, sensitivity and robustness of the proposed method. A preliminary experiment with kinematic data captured from healthy subjects mimicking a reaching task with dyskinesia showed a high degree of correlation (Cohen's kappa 0.85 with p < 0.05) between a human observer and the proposed automatic classification tool in terms of assigning the datasets to various levels to represent the subjects' kinematic abilities to perform reaching tasks. This study supported the use of Microsoft Kinect to quantitatively evaluate the ability of individuals with involuntary movements to perform an upper extremity reaching task.;2015;3
Except the network latency which limits the development of telerehabilitation systems for home-based rehabilitation, the loss of real contact feeling should also be addressed. In this paper, a novel telerehabilitation system is developed to recover the lost contact feeling. The system incorporates a human upper limb-like device (master device) for therapists' use and an exoskeleton device (slave device) for patients' use. The training process of passive training with the proposed system is introduced in this paper. On the patients' side, a force sensor was used to detect the interaction force between the forearm and exoskeleton device. The interaction force can be reflected to therapists with master device which was designed with the SEA-based structure. The closed-loop interaction control method was used, thus the force feedback can be controlled by adjusting the deflection of elastic elements. The performance that the master device can generate variable impedances is evaluated. Moreover, motion tracking performance during passive trainings was tested under local network environment. The passive training is suitable for patients with severe impairments and poor motor function.;2015;3
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a common corneal endotheliopathy with a complex and heterogeneous genetic background. Different variants in the TCF4 gene have been strongly associated with the development of FECD. TCF4 encodes the E2-2 transcription factor but the link between the strong susceptibility locus and disease mechanism remains elusive. Here, we confirm a strong positive association between TCF4 single nucleotide polymorphism rs613872 and FECD in Polish patients (OR = 12.95, 95% CI: 8.63-19.42, chi(2) = 189.5, P < 0.0001). We show that TCF4 expression at the mRNA level in corneal endothelium (n = 63) does not differ significantly between individuals with a particular TCF4 genotype. It is also not altered in FECD patients as compared to control samples. The data suggest that changes in the transcript level containing constitutive TCF4 exon encoding the amino-terminal part of the protein seem not to contribute to disease pathogenesis. However, considering the strong association of TCF4 allelic variants with FECD, genotyping of TCF4 risk alleles may be important in the clinical practice.;2015;3
Healthcare professionals engaged in telehealth are faced with complex US federal regulations (e.g., HIPAA/HITECH) and could benefit from the guidance provided by best practices in Privacy and Security (P&S). This article describes a systematic review protocol to address this need. The protocol described herein uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The PRISMA-P contains 17 items that are considered essential, as well as minimum components to include in systematic reviews. PICOS (participants, interventions, comparisons, outcome(s) and study design of the systematic review) are also relevant to the development of best practices in P&S in telehealth systems. A systematic process can best determine what information should be included and how this information should be retrieved, condensed, analyzed, organized, and disseminated.;2015;3
Heart failure is a chronic and progressive condition that is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Even though cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to be beneficial to heart failure patients, only a very small proportion of them will actually be referred and eventually participate. The low participation rate is due in part to accessibility and travel difficulties. Telerehabilitation is a new approach in the rehabilitation field that allows patients to receive a complete rehabilitation program at home in a safe manner and under adequate supervision. We believe that by increasing accessibility to CR, telerehabilitation programs will significantly improve heart failure patients' functional capacity and quality of life. However, it is crucial to provide policy makers with evidence-based data on cardiac telerehabilitation if we want to see its successful implementation in heart failure patients.;2015;3
Heart rate monitoring is being used to estimate activity of autonomous nervous system by analysing heart rate variability (HRV). HRV has been recently shown to be effective means to monitor efficacy of exercise in patients with cardiovascular conditions and older adults. Whether HRV can be used to identify exercise exertion levels is unknown. There are multiple approaches to analyse HRV however it is not clear which approach is optimal in assessing cycling exercise. Previous studies demonstrated potential of analysis of short-term sequences of beat-by-beat heart rate data in a time domain for continuous monitoring of levels of physiological stress. The goal of this study was to assess the potential value of short-term HRV analysis during cycling exercise for automated identification of exercise exertion level. HRV indices were compared during rest, height of exercise exertion, and exercise recovery. Comparative analysis of HRV during cycling exercise demonstrated responsiveness of time-domain indices to different phases of an exercise program. Using discriminant analysis, canonical discriminant functions were built which correctly identified 100% of 'highest level of exertion' and 80.0% of 'rest' episodes. HRV demonstrated high potential in monitoring autonomic balance and exercise exertion during cycling exercise program.;2015;3
"In patients with COPD non-naive to rehabilitation we tested the feasibility, adherence and satisfaction of a home-based reinforcement telerehabilitation program (TRP). Outcomes were compared with a standard outpatient rehabilitation program (ORP). Then 18 TRP patients underwent 28 sessions of strength exercises (60 min) and cycle training (40 min) using a satellite platform provided telemonitoring, tele-prescription, video-assistance and phone-calls, patients were equipped with an oximeter, steps-counter, bicycle, remote control and interactive TV software. 18 matched ORP, retrospectively identified from our hospital ORP database, were used as controls. At baseline and end of program, the 6-min walking test (6MWT), Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were administered. In TRP only, we assessed platform use, incremental exercise, steps walked/day and patient satisfaction. TRP patients completed all sessions without side effects, used the remote control 1,394 +/- 2,329 times being in the 84% of the cases satisfied with the service. In 22% of the cases patients found the technology unfriendly. Each health-professional performed 46 +/- 65 actions, 14.6 +/- 2.12 phone calls and 1 +/- 1.67 videoconference sessions per patient. TRP patients increased physical activity (3,412 vs. 1,863 steps/day, p = 0.0002). Both programs produced significant (all, p < 0.01) gains in 6MWT [meters, TRP + 34.22 +/- 50.79; ORP + 33.61 +/- 39.25], dyspnea [TRP -0.72 +/- 0.89; ORP -0.94 +/- 0.53] and SGRQ [TRP -6.9 +/- 9.96, ORP -9.9 +/- 12.92] without between-group differences. In conclusion, TRP is feasible and well accepted by patients, although sometimes technology was perceived as difficult. It seems to improve walking capacity, dyspnea, quality of life and daily physical activity. Future RCTs will demonstrate cost-effectiveness.";2015;3
In this paper we describe the main features of an innovative home telerehabilitation system that offers, for both users and physiotherapists, actionable information to gain new insight in the telerehabilitation processes. From the point of view of users, it offers a friendly and immersive exercise interface that shows in two 3D avatars how an exercise must be executed and how the user is executing it respectively. Moreover, during a therapy session, informative elements show up-to-date information to guide and encourage the user. From the point of view of the physiotherapists, the system suggests them appropriate exercises that can be used to define customizable telerehabilitation therapies. Furthermore, another novel contribution of the system is its capacity to transform the raw data collected from a user into information that can help the physiotherapist to improve therapy decision making or the redefinition of existing therapies.;2015;3
In this time of an aging population in the Western world and a concomitant need for cost reduction, there is an obvious need for innovative health care delivery. One of the consequences is that a growing number of telemedicine applications are emerging in different health care domains. Also in the area of speech-language (SL) disorders, particularly neurogenic disorders, telemedicine is rapidly gaining interest. In this paper, we place applications for neurogenic SL disorders in a telemedicine taxonomy in order to establish common features along the dimensions of functionality, application, and technology, and their components. Thus, we aim at identifying common features in a wide variety of telemedicine applications and to establish common interests of stakeholders in health care for classified groups of telemedicine applications. This may facilitate decision-making with regard to expansion of innovative products, and give directions to measures needed for upscaling and structural embedding of feasible and effective SL telemedicine applications in health care. Common interests of stakeholders in health care, established using telemedicine taxonomy, is a key factor in decision-making with regard to which telemedicine applications should be given priority for genuine utilization. Priorities of health care institutions, patients, and reimbursement companies are also leading for researchers aiming at solid scientific evidence for the beneficial effects of target applications. That is, although research results tend to indicate the potential of telemedicine in the area of SL pathology, the alleged benefits of most applications have not been confirmed according to the accepted standards for clinical outcome testing as yet. Methodologic obstacles and the lack of adequate speech materials and suitable outcome measures for efficacy and effectiveness testing partially account for this. From the perspective of scientific evidence, the benefits of asynchronous SL telemedicine applications concern data storage and data analyses. To facilitate implementation of telemedicine, there is a call for development of information and communication technology infrastructures that allow feasible applications which meet requirements with regard to licensure and medical privacy laws. For applications with evidence for beneficial effects, we are challenged to develop new business models that apply to a new health care environment.;2015;3
In this work we show that haptic feedback in upper limb motor therapy improves performance and generates a lower mental workload. To demonstrate this, two groups of participants (healthy adults and elders with hand motor problems) used a low-cost haptic device (Novint Falcon) and a non-robotic device (Leap Motion Controller). Participants conducted the same rehabilitation task by using a non-immersive virtual environment. Results show significant differences for all participants regarding precision on the use of the haptic feedback device. Additionally, participants in the older adult group demonstrated a lower mental workload while using the haptic device (Novint Falcon). Finally, qualitative results show that participants preferred to conduct their therapy exercises by using the haptic device, as they found it more useful, easier to use and easier to learn.;2015;3
Interactive neurorehabilitation (INR) systems provide therapy that can evaluate and deliver feedback on a patient's movement computationally There are currently many approaches to INR design and implementation, without a clear indication of which methods to utilize best. This article presents key interactive computing, motor learning, and media arts concepts utilized by an interdisciplinary group to develop adaptive, mixed reality INR systems for upper extremity therapy of patients with stroke. Two INR systems are used as examples to show how the concepts can be applied within: (1) a small-scale INR clinical study that achieved integrated improvement of movement quality and functionality through continuously supervised therapy and (2) a pilot study that achieved improvement of clinical scores with minimal supervision. The notion is proposed that some of the successful approaches developed and tested within these systems can form the basis of a scalable design methodology for other INR systems A coherent approach to INR design is needed to facilitate the use of the systems by physical therapists, increase the number of successful INR studies, and generate rich clinical data that can inform the development of best practices for use of INR in physical therapy.;2015;3
"Introduction We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the domain of speech-language and hearing sciences (SLHS) in telehealth. Methods The databases used for the literature search were Web of Knowledge, Pubmed, Scopus, Embase and Scielo. The inclusion criteria consisted of papers published up to August 2014. Papers without peer-review evaluation, and those without abstracts or available full texts were excluded. Results A total of 103 papers were selected. The selected studies have focused primarily on hearing (32.1%), followed by speech (19.4%), language (16.5%), voice (8.7%), swallowing (5.8%), multiple areas (13.6%) and others (3.9%). The majority of the studies focused on assessment (36.9%) or intervention (36.9%). The use of telehealth in SLHS has been increasing in many countries, especially in the last 5 years. The country with the largest number of published studies was the United States of America (32.03%), followed by Australia (29.12%). The remaining studies were distributed in lower numbers among other countries. Discussion The advancement of information and communication technologies provides more favourable conditions for providing distance care in several areas. Most of studies concluded that the telehealth procedure had advantages over the non-telehealth alternative approach (85.5%); however, 13.6% reported that it was unclear whether the telehealth procedure had advantages. Some barriers still need to be overcome, such as technology, training, regulation, acceptance and recognition of the benefits of this practice by the public and professionals. The need for speech-language pathologists and audiologists to adapt to this new health care modality is evident.";2015;3
Introduction. This study aimed to assess rehabilitation professionals' attitude toward implementation and application of telerehabilitation technology as a novel study in rehabilitation academic centers and affiliated clinics in Tehran. Methods. It was a descriptive cross-sectional study. To collect data, a researcher-designed questionnaire was developed. 141 rehabilitation experts participated in the study. Results. A majority of faculty members (78%) and clinicians (89.7%) either were in definite agreement or somewhat agreed with implementation and application of this technology, which demonstrates an overall positive attitude. Discussion. Based on the positive attitudes of the majority of participants toward implementation and application of this technology and their preferences in offering different telerehabilitation services, it seems that there is an appropriate and desirable acceptance and administrative culture to implement this technology among rehabilitation experts in Tehran. It is thus expected that implementation and application of this technology will be a promising experience in rehabilitation academic centers and affiliate clinics in Tehran.;2015;3
Introduction: The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Module 4 is an autism assessment designed for verbally fluent adolescents and adults. Because of a shortage of available clinical expertise, it can be difficult for adults to receive a proper autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment. A potential option to address this shortage is remote assessment. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility, usability, and reliability of administering the ADOS Module 4 remotely using the Versatile and Integrated System for Telerehabilitation (VISYTER). Materials and Methods: VISYTER consists of computer stations at the client site and clinician site for video communication and a Web portal for managing and coordinating the assessment process. Twenty-three adults with an ASD diagnosis participated in a within-subject crossover design study in which both a remote ADOS and a face-to-face ADOS were administered. After completing the remote ADOS, participants completed a satisfaction survey. Results: Participant satisfaction with the remote ADOS delivery system was high. The kappa value was greater than 0.61 on 21 of 31 ADOS items. There was substantial agreement on ADOS classification (i.e., diagnosis) between assessments delivered face-to-face versus assessments delivered remotely (interclass coefficient=0.92). Non-agreement may have been due to outside factors or practice effect despite a washout period. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that an autism assessment designed to be delivered face to face can be administered remotely using an integrated Web-based system with high levels of usability and reliability.;2015;3
Introduction: This research explored the experience of receiving medical and rehabilitation intervention for rural and remote residents in North Queensland, Australia who had experienced a traumatic hand injury. This study contributes to larger project that seeks to propose a model of service delivery to rural and remote residents who have sustained a traumatic injury. Methods: Utilising an interpretive phenomenological research design, data was gathered through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Fifteen participants were recruited into this study and questions were designed to explore the experience of receiving medical and rehabilitation intervention following a traumatic hand injury for residents in rural and remote areas of North Queensland. Results: The major themes that emerged were experience of medical intervention, experience of rehabilitation, travel, and technology. Participants felt that medical practitioners had a lack of local knowledge and were concerned that delays in medical intervention resulted in ongoing impairment. They reported following the exercise program they were given, often modifying it to fit with their daily routine. Metropolitan therapists appeared to have limited understanding of issues relevant to rural and remote lifestyles. There was, quite often, no occupational therapist or physiotherapist at their local facility due to staff turnover, and, when available, they had limited experience in hand injuries. The distance and cost of travel to appointments were of significant concern. The use of telehealth or telerehabilitation received a mixed response. Conclusion: Findings highlight the concerns regarding the provision of healthcare to rural and remote residents following a traumatic hand injury. These results provide the basis for recommendations surrounding the development of programs and service delivery models to address diverse needs in rural and remote areas.;2015;3
Many stroke patients are expected to rehabilitate at home, which limits their access to proper rehabilitation equipment, treatment, or assessment by therapists. We have developed a novel telerehabilitation system that incorporates a human-upper-limb-like device and an exoskeleton device. The system is designed to provide the feeling of real therapist-patient contact via telerehabilitation. We applied the principle of a series elastic actuator to both the master and slave devices. On the master side, the therapist can operate the device in a rehabilitation center. When performing passive training, the master device can detect the therapist's motion while controlling the deflection of elastic elements to near-zero, and the patient can receive the motion via the exoskeleton device. When performing active training, the design of the force-sensing mechanism in the master device can detect the assisting force added by the therapist. The force-sensing mechanism also allows force detection with an angle sensor. Patients' safety is guaranteed by monitoring the motor's current from the exoskeleton device. To compensate for any possible time delay or data loss, a torque-limiter mechanism was also designed in the exoskeleton device for patients' safety. Finally, we successfully performed a system performance test for passive training with transmission control protocol/internet protocol communication.;2015;3
Measurement of hand functionality is vital for the rehabilitation process as a result of hand injuries. However, patients in remote areas are experiencing difficulties with frequent visits to clinics and hospitals for therapy. This research proposes a novel framework involving a cloud-based implementation based on finger function measurement and tele-assessment employing an affordable optical sensor. Creative Senz3D allows patients to measure and monitor their hand function in non-clinical settings without affecting the quality of treatment. The underlying system includes a subsystem of non-contact ROM measurement of the hand and a cloud-based application which provides web interface for authorised users and a web API for hospital and healthcare professionals. Phalangeal measurement data is regularly sent to data centres that it is conveniently accessible for clinicians to monitor the progress and advise patients the suitable time to visit the hospital. The proposed system is aimed at addressing and providing an e-health solution to a crucial short coming in phalangeal rehabilitation.;2015;3
OBJECTIVE. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of home-based robot-assisted rehabilitation coupled with a home exercise program compared with a home exercise program alone on depression and quality of life in people after stroke. METHOD. A multisite randomized controlled clinical trial was completed with 99 people <6 mo after stroke who had limited access to formal therapy. Participants were randomized into one of two groups, (1) a home exercise program or (2) a robot-assisted therapy + home exercise program, and participated in an 8-wk home intervention. RESULTS. We observed statistically significant changes in all but one domain on the Stroke Impact Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for both groups. CONCLUSION. A robot-assisted intervention coupled with a home exercise program and a home exercise program alone administered using a telerehabilitation model may be valuable approaches to improving quality of life and depression in people after stroke.;2015;3
Objective: This study was a proof of concept for virtual exertions, a novel method that involves the use of body tracking and electromyography for grasping and moving projections of objects in virtual reality (VR). The user views objects in his or her hands during rehearsed co-contractions of the same agonist-antagonist muscles normally used for the desired activities to suggest exerting forces. Background: Unlike physical objects, virtual objects are images and lack mass. There is currently no practical physically demanding way to interact with virtual objects to simulate strenuous activities. Method: Eleven participants grasped and lifted similar physical and virtual objects of various weights in an immersive 3-D Cave Automatic Virtual Environment. Muscle activity, localized muscle fatigue, ratings of perceived exertions, and NASA Task Load Index were measured. Additionally, the relationship between levels of immersion (2-D vs. 3-D) was studied. Results: Although the overall magnitude of biceps activity and workload were greater in VR, muscle activity trends and fatigue patterns for varying weights within VR and physical conditions were the same. Perceived exertions for varying weights were not significantly different between VR and physical conditions. Conclusions: Perceived exertion levels and muscle activity patterns corresponded to the assigned virtual loads, which supported the hypothesis that the method evoked the perception of physical exertions and showed that the method was promising. Application: Ultimately this approach may offer opportunities for research and training individuals to perform strenuous activities under potentially safer conditions that mimic situations while seeing their own body and hands relative to the scene.;2015;3
"Objective: To determine whether total knee arthroplasty recipients demonstrating comparatively poor mobility at entry to rehabilitation and who received supervised therapy, had better rehabilitation outcomes than those who received less supervision. Design: Retrospective analysis of randomized trial data. Patients: Total knee arthroplasty participants randomized to supervised (n=159) or home-based therapy (n=74). Methods: Participants were dichotomized based on mean target 6-min walk test (6MWT) pre-therapy (second post-surgical week). Absolute and change in 6MWT and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain and Function subscales amongst low performers in the supervised (n=89) and unsupervised (n=36) groups were compared, as were high performers in the supervised (n=70) and unsupervised (n =38) groups. Results: Low performers in the unsupervised compared with the supervised group demonstrated significantly poorer 6MWT scores (absolute 8 =8.5%,p=0.003; change =8.1%, p= 0.007) when therapy ceased (10 weeks post-surgery). No differences in 6MWT were observed between the high performing subgroups or in the recovery of WOMAC subscales between any subgroups. Conclusion: Individuals manifesting comparatively poor mobility at the commencement of physiotherapy may recover their mobility, but not perceived function, more quickly if streamed to supervised therapy.";2015;3
Objective:Sustained exercise training could significantly improve patient rehabilitation and management of noncommunicable diseases in the community. This study aimed to develop a universal telecare system for delivery of exercise rehabilitation and cardiovascular training services at home.Materials and Methods:An innovative bilateral leg training device was equipped with an electronic system for the ongoing measurement of training activities with the device. A single-item parameter reflecting the intensity of training was monitored using several modern telecommunication technologies. According to the application protocol, eight volunteers first tried the device for 30-60min to determine their personal training capacity. Then, they were provided with equipment to use at home for 4 weeks. Adherence to daily training was assessed by the number of training days per week, training intensity, and duration of training sessions.Results:The system provided reliable recording of training activities with the device using (1) long-term data logging without an ongoing connection to the computer, (2) wireless monitoring and recording of training activities on a stand-alone computer, and (3) a secure cloud-based monitoring over the Internet connection using electronic devices, including smartphones. Overall analysis of recordings and phone feedbacks to participants took only approximately 5h for the duration of study.Conclusions:This study, although of a pilot nature, described the comprehensive exercise telerehabilitation system integrating mobile training equipment with personalized training protocols and remote monitoring. A single-item electronic parameter of the system usage facilitated time-effective data management. Wireless connection allowed various locations of device application and several monitoring arrangements ranging from real-time monitoring to long-term recording of exercise activities. A cloud-based software platform enabled management of multiple users at distance. Implementation of this model may facilitate both accessibility and availability of personalized exercise telerehabilitation services. Further studies would validate it in the clinical and healthcare environment.;2015;3
Objectives. This pilot study examined voice outcomes and patient perceptions after intensive voice therapy for vocal fold nodules via telepractice. Study Design.. Pilot, within-subjects experimental trial. Methods. Participants included 10 women diagnosed with bilateral vocal fold nodules who received intensive voice treatment via a free videoconferencing platform Skype, (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). All participants completed one vocal hygiene session in person, followed by eight sessions of therapy via telepractice over 3 weeks. Before and immediately after treatment, patients attended a clinic in person to complete perceptual, stroboscopic, acoustic, and physiological assessments of vocal function. Analyses were performed by a speech-language pathologist and an otolaryngologist independent to and blinded to the study. Participants also completed the Voice Handicap Index and a telepractice satisfaction questionnaire, or an anticipated satisfaction questionnaire, before and after the treatment. Results. Significant improvements were found in perceptual, vocal fold function, acoustic, and physiological parameters as well as nodule sizes and patient perceptions of voice-related quality of life post-treatment. Participants were highly positive about their first experience with telepractice. Results were similar to those from a separate study investigating the effects of an intensive voice therapy delivered in conventional face-to-face (FTF) format. Conclusions. This study is consistent with possible benefits of telepractice in the delivery of intensive treatment for vocal fold nodules. Pending final verification with a FTF comparison group, telepractice could be recommended as an alternate treatment modality for patients with vocal fold nodules.;2015;3
"Objectives: First, to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR) based telerehabilitation program in the balance recovery of individuals with hemiparesis after stroke in comparison with an in-clinic program; second, to compare the subjective experiences; and third, to contrast the costs of both programs. Design: Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Neurorehabilitation unit. Participants: Chronic outpatients with stroke (N=30) with residual hemiparesis. Interventions: Twenty 45-minute training sessions with the telerehabilitation system, conducted 3 times a week, in the clinic or in the home. Main Outcome Measures: First, Berg Balance Scale for balance assessment. The Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment balance and gait sub-scales, and the Brunel Balance Assessment were secondary outcome measures. Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline, 8 weeks (posttreatment), and 12 weeks (follow-up). Second, the System Usability Scale and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for subjective experiences. Third, cost (in dollars). Results: Significant improvement in both groups (in-clinic group [control] and a home-based telerehabilitation group) from the initial to the final assessment in the Berg Balance Scale (eta(2)(p) = .68; P=.001), in the balance (eta(2)(p) = .24; P=.006) and gait (eta(2)(p) =.57, P=.001) subscales of the Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment, and in the Brunel Balance Assessment (control: chi(2)=15.0; P=.002; experimental: chi(2)=21.9; P=.001). No significant differences were found between the groups in any balance scale or in the feedback questionnaires. With regard to subjective experiences, both groups considered the VR system similarly usable and motivating. The in-clinic intervention resulted in more expenses than did the telerehabilitation intervention ($654.72 per person). Conclusions: First, VR-based telerehabilitation interventions can promote the reacquisition of locomotor skills associated with balance in the same way as do in-clinic interventions, both complemented with a conventional therapy program; second, the usability of and motivation to use the 2 interventions can be similar; and third, telerehabilitation interventions can involve savings that vary depending on each scenario.

"Objectives: Legislators and policymakers have expressed strong interest in intervention programs to reduce dependence on social disability benefits. Hybrid: ambulatory followed by home-based cardiac telerehabilitation - hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (HCR) seems to be a novel alternative for standard cardiac rehabilitation for patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as a form of pension prevention paid by the Social Insurance Institution (SII). The kind of professional status may bias the motivation to return to work after HCR. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the professional status can affect the effects of HCR. Material and Methods: One hundred fifty-two patients with CVD referred by the SII for a 5-week HCR were qualified for the study. Patients (87.7% males), aged 57.31+/-5.61 years, were divided into 2 subgroups: W) white-collar employees (N = 22) and B) blue-collar employees (N = 130). To evaluate functional capacity, an exercise test on a treadmill was used. Results: The number of days of absence in the cardiac rehabilitation program did not differ between the groups (mean +/- standard deviation - B: 1.09+/-3.10 days, W: 1.95+/-3.64 days). There were significant improvements (p < 0.05) in measured variables after HCR in both (W and B) groups (max workload: 8.21+/-2.88 METs (measured in metabolic equivalents) vs. 9.6+/-2.49 METs, 7.76+/-2.51 METs vs. 8.73+/-2.7 METs, resting heart rate (RHR): 77+/-16.22 bpm vs. 69.94+/-12.93 bpm, 79.59+/-14 bpm vs. 75.24+/-11.87 bpm; double product, i.e., product of heart rate and systolic BP (DP rest) 10 815.22+/-2968.24 vs. 9242.94+/-1923.08, 10 927.62+/-2508.47 vs. 9929.7+/-2304.94). In group B, a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP syst. -137.03+/-17.14 mm Hg vs. 131.82+/-21.13 mm Hg), heart rate recovery in the 1st minute after the end of peak exercise (HRR1) (99.38+/-19.25 vs. 93.9+/-19.48) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (1.22+/-0.53 vs. 1.11+/-0.36) was observed. In group W, a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (BP diast.) at rest was observed (88.28+/-9.79 mm Hg vs. 83.39+/-8.95 mm Hg). The decrease in resting HR was significantly greater in group W (69.94+/-12.93 vs. 75.24+/-11.87, p = 0.034). Conclusions: Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation is feasible and safe with high adherence to the program regardless of the patient's professional status. Professional status did not influence the beneficial effect of HCR on exercise tolerance.";2015;3
Ongoing communication and care coordination are essential among patients, their family, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation team members to address the complex and changing rehabilitation needs of traumatic brain injuries. Family members of patients with traumatic brain injury commonly assume a caregiver role following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. The Department of Veterans Affairs has adopted clinical video telehealth to promote access to care, and use of clinical video telehealth for rehabilitation is expanding. Recent implementation of home clinical video telehealth can assist with the ongoing management and treatment of patients in their home setting. This report demonstrates enhanced education and care coordination by using clinical video telehealth with a Veterans Affairs-eligible beneficiary receiving treatment for traumatic brain injury.;2015;3
Physical exercising is an essential part of any rehabilitation plan. The subject must be committed to a daily exercising routine, as well as to a frequent contact with the therapist. Rehabilitation plans can be quite expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, tele-rehabilitation systems can be really helpful and efficient for both subjects and therapists. In this paper, we present ReAdapt, an adaptive module for a tele-rehabilitation system that takes into consideration the progress and performance of the exercising utilizing multisensing data and adjusts the session difficulty resulting to a personalized session. Multimodal data such as speech, facial expressions and body motion are being collected during the exercising and feed the system to decide on the exercise and session difficulty. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and apply a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to train and evaluate the system on simulated data.;2015;3
Play for Health (P4H) is a telemedicine service consisting of a telerehabilitation platform to improve cognitive and physical deficits through the use of serious games and various videogames controllers. This paper states that there are issues that could benefit the rehabilitation process using serious games. We present the P4H platform as an example of success in telerehabilitation based on serious games.;2015;3
Privacy in image and video data has become an important subject since cameras are being installed in an increasing number of public and private spaces. Specifically, in assisted living, intelligent monitoring based on computer vision can allow one to provide risk detection and support services that increase people's autonomy at home. In the present work, a level-based visualisation scheme is proposed to provide visual privacy when human intervention is necessary, such as at telerehabilitation and safety assessment applications. Visualisation levels are dynamically selected based on the previously modelled context. In this way, different levels of protection can be provided, maintaining the necessary intelligibility required for the applications. Furthermore, a case study of a living room, where a top-view camera is installed, is presented. Finally, the performed survey-based evaluation indicates the degree of protection provided by the different visualisation models, as well as the personal privacy preferences and valuations of the users.;2015;3
Programs and concepts included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 are expected to transform health care in the United States from a volume-based health system to a value-based health system with increased emphasis on prevention and health promotion. The Triple Aim, a framework set forth by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, focuses on improving the health care experience, the health of populations, and the affordability of care. This article describes telehealth as an integral component in achieving the Triple Aim of health care and discusses implications for occupational therapy practitioners.;2015;3
Purpose - Telecare promises to deliver healthcare services more efficiently while, at the same time, improving the quality of care. The purpose of this paper is to challenge these promises by analysing the implications of introducing telecare in the rehabilitation of patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Design/methodology/approach - Empirically, the paper is based on interviews with and observations of rehabilitation therapists and patients taking part in a Danish telerehabilitation programme. Theoretically, the paper draws on Science and Technology Studies. Findings - The introduction of telecare alters rehabilitation practices in multiple ways. First, several new time-consuming work routines, carried out in collaboration between therapists, patients and technical professions, emerge. Although crucial in establishing and maintaining telerehabilitation infrastructures, this work remains invisible in evaluations of the programme. Second, rather than simply increasing patient agency, responsibilities are redistributed and negotiated in subtle and non-uniform ways. These negotiations make it less transparent where one responsibility begins and where another potentially conflicting one ends. Practical implications - Evaluations of telecare technologies should pay more attention to work- and responsibility-related effects of introducing telecare in order better to account for predicted and unpredicted as well as desirable and undesirable socio-technical changes. Originality/value - Using an ethnographic approach, the paper points to the discrepancy between simplistic political promises that telecare technologies can serve as tools for improvement, on the one hand, and the substantial changes in the organisation and management of healthcare observed in practice, on the other. Rather than regarding telecare as technologies of improvement, it is more productive to regard them as technologies of change.;2015;3
Purpose : Research has revealed limitations in the provision of in-person services to families with a new speech generating device (SGD), both in Australia and overseas. Alternative service models such as parent training, peer support and telepractice may offer a solution, but their use with this population has not been researched to date. Method : Using interviews and focus groups, this study explored the experiences and opinions of 13 speech-language pathologists and seven parents regarding alternatives to in-person support and training for families with a new SGD. Data were analysed using grounded theory. Themes explored in this paper include the benefits and drawbacks of alternative service models as well as participants' suggestions for the optimal implementation of these approaches. Result : Participants confirmed the utility of alternative service models, particularly for rural/remote and underserviced clients. Benefits of these models included reduced travel time for families and therapists, as well as enhanced information access, support and advocacy for parents. Conclusion : Participants viewed the provision of ongoing professional support to families as critical, regardless of service modality. Additional issues arising from this study include the need for development of organizational policies, resources and training infrastructure to support the implementation of these alternative service models.;2015;3
Purpose: The purpose of this article is to discuss the upsurge of technology-enhanced rehabilitation education programs and telerehabilitation services, to provide examples of these advancements, and to discuss the implications of this technology for education and the field including the unique advantage to developing technological skills through participation in effective online coursework allowing rehabilitation graduates the requisite transferable skills for competent online service delivery. Method: The authors completed a thorough review of the available literature on online technology-enhanced education programs and online telerehabilitation services. Results: Rehabilitation counselor education and the delivery of rehabilitation services have capitalized on recent technological advancements and provide opportunities to reach students and consumers via the Internet. Conclusion: It is clear that technology-enhanced education and clinical services will have an expanding role in the future of rehabilitation counselor education and practice. There is a unique advantage for students to develop technological skills through participation in effective online coursework. The skills learned from completing online courses are transferable skills for competent online service delivery.;2015;3
"Purpose: This is a systematic review of assessment and treatment of cognitive and communicative abilities of individuals with acquired brain injury via telepractice versus in person. The a priori clinical questions were informed by previous research that highlights the importance of considering any functional implications of outcomes, determining disorder- and setting-specific concerns, and measuring the potential impact of diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy data on interpretation of findings. Method: A literature search of multiple databases (e.g., PubMed) was conducted using key words and study inclusion criteria associated with the clinical questions. Results: Ten group studies were accepted that addressed assessment of motor speech, language, and cognitive impairments; assessment of motor speech and language activity limitations/participation restrictions; and treatment of cognitive impairments and activity limitations/participation restrictions. In most cases, equivalence of outcomes was noted across service delivery methods. Conclusions: Limited findings, lack of diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy data, and heterogeneity of assessments and interventions precluded robust evaluation of clinical implications for telepractice equivalence and the broader area of telepractice efficacy. Future research is needed that will build upon current knowledge through replication. In addition, further evaluation at the impairment and activity limitation/participation restriction levels is needed.";2015;3
"PURPOSE: To examine the effects of telerehabilitation compared with other delivery models for improving physical or functional outcomes in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases. METHODS: A search was completed for English language publications from 1990 to August 2013 across 4 electronic databases and gray literature. Inclusion criteria were: (1) home-based telerehabilitation as a core component; (2) at least 2 exercise sessions; (3) randomized controlled trials; and (4) reporting of physical or functional outcome measures in adult patients with coronary heart disease, chronic heart failure, and chronic respiratory disease. Studies were independently screened by 2 reviewers and graded by a reviewer according to the Downs and Black checklist. A narrative synthesis of the included studies was undertaken. RESULTS: Eleven studies were analyzed. It appears that telerehabilitation is no different to other delivery models for patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, in terms of exercise capacity expressed as distance on the 6-minute walk test and peak oxygen consumption and quality of life. Telerehabilitation appears to have higher adherence rates compared with center-based exercise. There has been similar or no adverse events reported in telerehabilitation compared with center-based exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Although telerehabilitation shows promise in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, compelling evidence is still limited. There is a need for more detailed, high-quality studies and for studies on the use of video-based telerehabilitation.";2015;3
Recent advances in telecommunication technologies have boosted the possibility to deliver rehabilitation via the internet (i.e. telerehabilitation). Several studies have shown that telerehabilitation is effective to improve clinical outcomes in disabling conditions. The aim of this review was to determine whether telerehabilitation was more effective than other modes of delivering rehabilitation to regain motor function, in different populations of patients. We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library retrieving 2360 records. Twelve studies were included involving different populations (i.e. neurological, total knee arthroplasty (TKA), cardiac) of patients. Inconclusive finding were found on the effect of telerehabilitation for neurological patients (SMD = 0.08, CI 95% = -0.13, 0.29), while both for cardiac (SMD = 0.24, CI 95% = 0.04, 0.43) and TKA patients (Timed Up and Go test: MD = -5.17, CI 95% = -9.79, -0.55) the results were in favour of telerehabilitation. Conclusive evidence on the efficacy of telerehabilitation for treatment of motor function, regardless of pathology, was not reached. Nevertheless, a strong positive effect was found for patients following orthopaedic surgery, suggesting that the increased intensity provided by telerehabilitation is a promising option to be offered to patients. More and higher quality research is needed in this field especially with neurological patients.;2015;3
"Recent studies demonstrated potential of home-based telerehabilitation in older adults and individuals with mobility impairment. However limited evidence exists on feasibility of home-based telerehabilitation in older adults after hip fracture. The aims of this study were: (1) to assess impact of home-based telerehabilitation of community dwelling older adults in post-acute phase of recovery after hip fracture on mobility, psycho-behavioral factors, quality of life, and satisfaction with care; (2) to estimate acceptance of the telerehabilitation system and adherence to the exercise program. We found statistically significant improvements in exercise self-efficacy, mobility, quality of life, and patient satisfaction after 30-day hip fracture telerehabilitation. Home-based telerehabilitation may be a viable model for post-acute hip fracture recovery and it is warranted for further evaluation in clinical trials.";2015;3
"Recent studies demonstrated that exercise interventions in significantly disabled patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) resulted in endurance and strength improvement and reduction of fatigue and spasticity. However engagement in long-term exercise training is limited in these patients due to multiple barriers including mobility, access to an exercise facility, and cost. It is unclear if PwMS with significant mobility disability are willing and able to engage in home-based telerehabilitation. The goal of this study was to assess level of acceptance and ability of these patients to carry out exercises using the telerehabilitation system without supervision. Ten PwMS with significant mobility disability were instructed how to use the telerehabilitation system and were then asked to use it independently according to predefined set of tasks. Feasibility was assessed by ability of study participants to successfully follow exercise tasks provided by a touch screen tablet. Telerehabilitation acceptance was measured by an attitudinal survey. Participant characteristics were: age= 53 +/- 11, PDDS= 5.3 +/- 2.4, years with MS=16 +/- 9. Average time required to train the patients to use the telerehabilitation system at home for flexibility and resistance exercises was 11 +/- 3 minutes and for active arm/leg biking: 3 +/- 1 minutes. All patients were able to successfully complete flexibility and resistance exercises and navigate the interface for arm biking exercise. Heart rate readings were affected by noise in some subjects. Active leg cycling was completed by 50% of patients; another half was unable to use it due to severe lower limb mobility impairment. Passive leg cycling supported by a splinting device was successfully operated by 100%. Overall, high acceptance and usability of the system in PwMS with severe mobility disability was demonstrated. This approach has a potential in supporting a comprehensive exercise delivery model in PwMS with significant mobility disability which will support individualized prescription of tailored endurance, strength, and therapeutic physiotherapy exercises.";2015;3
Recent years have witnessed a surge in telerehabilitation and remote healthcare systems blessed by the emerging low-cost wearable devices to monitor biological and biokinematic aspects of human beings. Although such telerehabilitation systems utilise cloud computing features and provide automatic biofeedback and performance evaluation, there are demands for overall optimisation to enable these systems to operate with low battery consumption and low computational power and even with weak or no network connections. This paper proposes a novel multilevel data encoding scheme satisfying these requirements in mobile cloud computing applications, particularly in the field of telerehabilitation. We introduce architecture for telerehabilitation platform utilising the proposed encoding scheme integrated with various types of sensors. The platform is usable not only for patients to experience telerehabilitation services but also for therapists to acquire essential support from analysis oriented decision support system (AODSS) for more thorough analysis and making further decisions on treatment.;2015;3
Regaining the ability to walk is a major rehabilitation goal after a stroke. Recent research suggests that, in people with stroke, task-oriented and intensive rehabilitation strategies can drive cortical reorganization and increase activity levels. This paper describes development and pilot testing of a novel wearable device for Real-Time Gait and Activity Improving Telerehabilitation (RT-GAIT), designed for use with such rehabilitation strategies. The RT-GAIT provides auditory or tactile feedback to the individual wearing the platform. The feedback is based on the amount of time spent in stance phase on each foot, as measured by the pressure sensors embedded into the insoles. The system was initially bench-validated using sensor signals collected in a previous study. Next, a clinical case study was conducted with one post-stroke individual. The results of the case study suggest that the RT-GAIT device can potentially improve the gait parameters. Mean difference in stance times between the healthy limb and paretic limb was improved by 48% and the standard deviation for the same was improved by 87.5%, between baseline measurements and the measurements taken after the treatment with the RT-GAIT.;2015;3
Robotic therapy devices have been an important part of clinical neurological rehabilitation for several years. Until now such devices are only available for patients receiving therapy inside rehabilitation hospitals. Since patients should continue rehabilitation training after hospital discharge at home, intelligent robotic rehab devices could help to achieve this goal. This paper proposes a novel multimodal home therapy concept and robot based system for motor telerehabilitation which is currently being further developed. The system is based on two haptic rehabilitation devices i) the Bi-Manu-Track (BMT) 2x1 DOF robotic haptic rehabilitation device with assist-as-needed control algorithms and ii) an enhanced version of the 3 DOF passive Reha-Slide system. The paper describes the technical system setup as well as user centered design aspects.;2015;3
Several studies have pointed out that egocentric and allocentric spatial impairments are one of the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It is less clear how a break in the continuous interaction between these two representations may be a crucial marker to detect patients who are at risk to develop dementia. The main objective of this study is to compare the performances of participants suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI group), patients with AD (AD group) and a control group (CG), using a virtual reality (VR)-based procedure for assessing the abilities in encoding, storing and syncing different spatial representations. In the first task, participants were required to indicate on a real map the position of the object they had memorized, while in the second task they were invited to retrieve its position from an empty version of the same virtual room, starting from a different position. The entire procedure was repeated across three different trials, depending on the object location in the encoding phase. Our finding showed that aMCI patients performed significantly more poorly in the third trial of the first task, showing a deficit in the ability to encode and store an allocentric viewpoint independent representation. On the other hand, AD patients performed significantly more poorly when compared to the CG in the second task, indicating a specific impairment in storing an allocentric viewpoint independent representation and then syncing it with the allocentric viewpoint dependent representation. Furthermore, data suggested that these impairments are not a product of generalized cognitive decline or of general decay in spatial abilities, but instead may reflect a selective deficit in the spatial organization Overall, these findings provide an initial insight into the cognitive underpinnings of amnestic impairment in aMCI and AD patient exploiting the potentiality of VR.;2015;3
Telepractice to deliver remote Part C early intervention (EI) services to families in their home is a rapidly-growing strategy under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to meet the needs of infants and toddlers who are deaf or hard of hearing. A survey was completed within a learning community comprised of staff from EI programs that were implementing telepractice to learn about their specific implementation strategies and challenges they faced. Twenty-seven individuals representing 11 programs responded. The results showed great variability in hardware and software, with many raising concerns regarding security. Primary challenges reported were internet connectivity and training in skills required to deliver telepractice services. The findings from this survey were valuable in guiding future areas of investigation for the learning community and ultimately improving telepractice in the field.;2015;3
Telerehabilitation (TR) services for assistive technology evaluation and training have the potential to reduce travel demands for consumers and assistive technology professionals while allowing evaluation in more familiar, salient environments for the consumer. Sixty-five consumers received TR services for augmentative and alternative communication or alternative computer access, and consumer satisfaction was compared with twenty-eight consumers who received exclusively in-person services. TR recipients rated their TR services at a median of 6 on a 6-point Likert scale TR satisfaction questionnaire, although individual responses did indicate room for improvement in the technology. Overall satisfaction with AT services was rated highly by both in-person (100% satisfaction) and TR (99% satisfaction) service recipients.;2015;3
Telerehabilitation aims to solve problems like equitable access to the rehabilitation and cost reduction by providing rehabilitation services at a distance. The largest part of telerehabilitation systems implement a real-time one-to-one process involving patient and therapist. Even though they can be successfully exploited in conditions such as post-traumatic recovery, in complex scenarios, this simple model should be replaced by a more structured collaborative one envisioning a multidisciplinary team. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a patient-centric collaborative telerehabilitation framework aimed at supporting a multidisciplinary team in the follow-up of domiciliary patients. The proposed framework follows the experience of a clinical trial that exploited a novel telerehabilitation device not conceived to support collaborative scenarios. Compared with the original system, the proposed extension allows the hierarchical division of the responsibility within the medical team, promoting a collaborative management of the rehabilitation. Proactive and decisional behaviors, as well as consulting practices on shared data within the medical team, are fostered by the system. Semi-structured interviews have been administered to a panel of experts to evaluate the proposed approach. The collected feedback can be exploited to finely tune the system in view of a new clinical trial including new functionalities. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;2015;3
Tele-rehabilitation has been widely studied in recent year, although a number of crucial issues has not been addressed. Quantitatively assessing exercise performance is vital in monitoring the progress in exercise based rehabilitation. This allows physiotherapists not only to refine rehabilitation plans, but also provides instant feedback to patients and facilitate the exercise performance in non-clinical setting. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the performance of upper extremity reaching tasks with in a kinematic perspective by assessing the smoothness of motion trajectories with the entropy of shape model, including curvature and torsion. The simulation result confirms that approximate entropy of shape model is consistent with the change of the smoothness in motion trajectory while it is capable of classifying six levels of the ability to perform upper extremity reaching tasks with higher accuracy.;2015;3
"Telerehabilitation is an emerging method of delivering rehabilitation services, which uses information and communication technologies to minimize distance and time barriers. Telerehabilitation is often considered a specialization of the wide field of tele-medicine; most of telerehabilitation services fall into three categories: clinical assessment (patient's functional abilities in his or her environment), diagnosis and clinical therapy. Researches have recently underlined the potential of social media, mobile phones, and the Internet in general for improving mental health, supporting positive outcomes on addiction issues, sexual health, and homelessness. This paper analyses the issues and implications tied to the development of social telerehabilitation services in Latvia, and reports on the first step of National science program VPP INOSOCTEREHI, a new three years multidisciplinary project on social rehabilitation, which is conducted by four Latvian Universities, and focuses on the use of mobile technologies in rehabilitation scope.";2015;3
Tele-rehabilitation refers to the use of information and communication technologies to provide rehabilitation services to people remotely in their homes or other environments. The goal is to improve patient access to care by receiving therapy beyond the physical walls of a traditional healthcare facility, thus expanding continuity of rehabilitation care. The objectives of this paper are (1) to provide data that document the service delivery implemented by ReAbility Online for the past 18 months and (2) to report on the results of a focus group of clients who took part in the service during its initial implementation. We conclude with a short discussion based on the lessons learned during the development, evaluation and service implementation process.;2015;3
The aim of this study was to identify barriers to the utilisation of videoconferencing within a multidisciplinary rehabilitation medicine healthcare team, as the first step towards creating a telerehabilitation service. A survey was developed on videoconference use and barriers to use, and distributed to healthcare providers including rehabilitation medicine societies and allied health societies through an anonymous link to SurveyMonkey (R). There were 254 respondents, practicing primarily in Australia (n=245), in various healthcare roles. One-hundred and fifty-nine (66%) of respondents used videoconferencing regularly, primarily for their own education. Respondents not currently utilising videoconferencing (n=82, 34%) ranked the reasons for this and provided free-text responses to explain why this modality was not being utilised in practice. Respondents were reluctant to use videoconferencing because of perceived increase in time needed for video consultations compared to face-to-face consultations, concerns with lack of privacy and confidentiality, and a lack of clinical practice guidelines for video consultation. We believe many barriers to videoconferencing by healthcare providers can be managed with appropriate education and targeted training. Future research studies, which focus on standards and clinical practice guidelines for videoconferencing by healthcare providers, may result in increased utilisation of this modality for healthcare delivery in rehabilitation medicine.;2015;3
The analysis of human movement is a widely studied field of health applications, such as telerehabilitation, analysis of daily activities, and emergency detection. In this paper, the comparison of different classifiers is presented for a new movement recognition system, which can be used for the detection of emergency situations. The system uses 9-degree-of-freedom (9DOF) sensor boards that are attached to wrist-mounted Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) motes. The 9DOF sensor boards are built up from a tri-axial accelerometer, a tri-axial gyroscope, and a tri-axial magnetometer. Measurement data for classification were collected from multiple subjects. Eleven movement classes were constructed in order to recognize specific arm movements in stationary positions and also during the movement of the body. Various time-domain features (TDF) were calculated in different processing window widths. Depending on the used window size, sensors and TDFs, 48 different data sets were constructed, which were used for training and for validating of the system. Different classifiers were tested and compared using the original and the dimensionally reduced data sets. The dimension reduction is performed using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method. The tested classifiers were the minimum distance classifier, the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) network, the naive Bayes classifier and the Support Vector Machine (SVM).;2015;3
"The ArmAssist is a low-cost robotic system for post-stroke upper-limb telerehabilitation based on serious games. The system incorporates a set of games for the assessment of arm function, the ArmAssist Assessment (AAA), which allows a remote monitoring of the progress of the patient and an automatic adaptation of the therapy. In this study, different components of the AAA are compared against three widely-used clinical tests, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) [1], the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) [2] and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) [3] in order to select the most clinically meaningful ones for the final score provided to patients and therapist, and evaluate their capability to predict or even improve some aspects of these standard scales. All four tests were performed in 38 separate sessions in 19 post-stroke individuals in their sub-acute phase, as part of a broader study. Statistically significant correlation could be shown with the three clinical tests. These preliminary results are promising for the validation of AAA as a fast, automatic and clinically meaningful tool for remote progress assessment and therapy adaptation; however, more data and further analysis is needed to confirm this.";2015;3
The evaluation of applications or systems within dynamic environments is complex. The existence of multiple hardware and software items which share the same space can provoke concurrency issues and result in erratic interactions. A sudden change within the environment can result is dramatic changes both to the user and application itself which can pass unnoticed in traditional evaluation methodologies. To verify if a component is compatible with a given environment is of paramount importance for areas like pervasive computing, ambient intelligence or ambient assisted living (AAL). In this paper, a semi-automatic platform for evaluation is presented and integrated with a TeleRehabilitation system in an AAL scenario to enhance evaluation. Preliminary results show the advantages of the platform in comparison with typical observation solutions mainly in terms of achieved data and overall ease of use.;2015;3

"The objective of the study was to draw on the insights of people with stroke to assist in the development of a telerehabilitation program, using easily accessible technology to deliver an intervention. A qualitative study was conducted with four focus groups of people who were at least 12 months post-stroke and who had completed their rehabilitation. All focus groups were conducted in community facilities and used a semi-structured approach. Fifteen people took part in the focus groups. Three main themes emerged from the data in response to questions about use of technology and important aspects of physiotherapy. The first theme expressed the participants' perspective that the technology really helped with keeping connected''. The second theme indicated what we need from therapists'' in order to gain the most from therapy; and the third theme highlighted aspects of a physiotherapy program they considered important, what we would like from therapy''. The themes helped us gain insight into how participants viewed the use of technology to augment rehabilitation and also what they needed from therapists to make the gains they viewed as important. These themes informed the development of a telerehabilitation program using readily accessible technology.";2015;3
The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of a 6-week, game-based, in-home telerehabilitation exercise program using the Microsoft Kinect (R) for individuals with chronic stroke. Four participants with chronic stroke completed the intervention based on games designed with the customized Mystic Isle software. The games were tailored to each participant's specific rehabilitation needs to facilitate the attainment of individualized goals determined through the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Likert scale questionnaires assessed the feasibility and utility of the game-based intervention. Supplementary clinical outcome data were collected. All participants played the games with moderately high enjoyment. Participant feedback helped identify barriers to use (especially, limited free time) and possible improvements. An in-home, customized, virtual reality game intervention to provide rehabilitative exercises for persons with chronic stroke is practicable. However, future studies are necessary to determine the intervention's impact on participant function, activity, and involvement.;2015;3

The use of a modified Facial Affect Recognition (FAR) training to identify emotions was investigated with two case studies of adults with moderate to severe chronic (> five years) traumatic brain injury (TBI). The modified FAR training was administered via telepractice to target social communication skills. Therapy consisted of identifying emotions through static facial expressions, personally reflecting on those emotions, and identifying sarcasm and emotions within social stories and role-play. Pre-and post-therapy measures included static facial photos to identify emotion and the Prutting and Kirchner Pragmatic Protocol for social communication. Both participants with chronic TBI showed gains on identifying facial emotions on the static photos.;2015;3
The use of serious games, those not intended for leisure, out of their intended context may have consequences for evoked engagement and for the facilitation of transversal reutilization of developed games. However, the effectiveness and usability of serious games out of their intended context must be questioned. Here, we present two case studies in virtual rehabilitation. In a first experiment, a classical leisure game (i.e. pong) is compared in its ability to propose a valid alternative to games specifically developed for virtual rehabilitation use in terms of compliance with principles required in motor rehabilitation such as movement repetition, feedback, task significance and motivation. The second experiment explores the complementary situation in which a virtual rehabilitation game set is exported as a plausible tool for the cognitive stimulation of elders. Not unexpectedly, our results suggest that transfer of games across realms is, in some cases, a feasible enterprise but their effectiveness and usability may be compromised. In particular, we found that importing pong to a virtual rehabilitation environment is not a valid alternative in the sense that it does not obey rehabilitation principles. However, exporting serious games across related domains, i.e. from virtual rehabilitation to cognitive stimulation, has encountered a high degree of acceptance by the receiving community of users, being perceived as useful and easy to use, and we further establish that this acceptance cannot be explained by expertise in using technology. Qualitative assessment of usersO responses points to the interaction interface as a co-responsible factor for this acceptance of the serious virtual environment. These findings may have consequences for the future development of serious games both in terms of reusing ideas and alerting about possible difficulties during the migration process.;2015;3
The World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT) consists of 84 member organizations representing over 420,000 occupational therapists internationally (WFOT, 2014). In 2014, WFOT published the WFOT Telehealth Position Statement on the use of telehealth in occupational therapy. The process for the formulation of the official document involved reviewing WFOT member organizations' telehealth position statements and data collected from a survey sent to member organizations' delegates in April 2014. Qualitative data from 39 countries yielded factors to consider in five key areas: licensure/registration requirements, the cost of technology, privacy and security, reimbursement/payment models, and other issues (e.g., need for collaboration/transfer of knowledge, client selection, provider competencies, standard of care). The WFOT Telehealth Position Statement addressed each of these areas. The collaborative effort resulting in the development of the WFOT Telehealth Position Statement serves as a model for other international organizations.;2015;3
"This article proposes a system for Telerehabilitation of people with motor disorders of the upper limb, by making a literature review about works related with the provision of the physical therapy service with ICT's use. Likewise, there is a brief description of the modules integrating the system: motion capture system based on inertial sensors and motion capture with camera; joint angle estimator was implemented through Kalman filter; IT app which registers the electronic medical record and finally, the active videogames module.";2015;3
This chapter describes the use of interactive videoconferencing as a strategy for oral hygiene training which may lead to a change in oral hygiene service delivery methods, an improvement in access to quality oral health care, and a reduction in oral disease burden on underserved populations. Clients who may benefit most from the oral home telecare are those who demonstrate cognitive impairment and/or physical disabilities, especially upper extremity dysfunction with manual dexterity impairment, and/or orofacial dysfunction. Preventive oral homecare via videoconferencing has been shown to build long-term habits for maintaining oral hygiene among people with chronic medical conditions or disabilities, thereby maintaining the continuity of care with conventional dental care services. Oral home telecare educational and training services provided by occupational therapists can be integrated into a broader, interdisciplinary, comprehensive telerehabilitation delivery program to enhance the patient's general health and overall quality of life.;2015;3
This chapter reviews Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) in the context of movement-based rehabilitation. The authors analyse the need for AAL solutions and how they can overcome many of the drawbacks associated with traditional rehabilitation. They discuss the benefits and challenges of rehabilitation within the AAL paradigm and the well-known benefits that the telerehabilitation and telemedicine models have already established. The authors review the top ambient technologies in use today, detailing their advantages and shortcomings. The review focuses primarily on areas such as motion capture, serious games, and robotic rehabilitation. The authors carry out a structured search of two well-known databases to find the most recent advances and present the most interesting lines of research and development. Finally, the authors discuss the review findings and draw conclusions on the future of personalised rehabilitation within an AAL paradigm.;2015;3
This exploratory study evaluated the effectiveness of Apple (Cupertino, CA) iPad((R)) (second generation) to deliver telepractice speech and/or language services. Five children and their parents/guardians, as well as four adult participants, received services for communication disorders in a university clinic setting over two academic semesters. The children met some of their speech goals and all of their language goals. All adult clients met some of their communication goals. Personal opinions about telepractice did not change statistically before and after therapy. The major problem identified during the study was skipping and/or freezing of images on the iPads during interactions with FaceTime((R)) (Apple). Further studies are needed to investigate the feasibility of using Apple iPads in telepractice.;2015;3
This longitudinal pilot study aims to describe the components and functionalities of the eChez-Soi home-based telerehabilitation platform, and present preliminary results on its technological reliability and usability. Four patients receiving chemotherapy treatments for lung cancer followed an 8 week home-based telerehabilitation program using the new eChez-Soi platform. All 60 planned sessions supervised by a clinician occurred with few technological problems. Only one session had to be rescheduled because of unresolved audiovisual communication problems. In 20 sessions, temporary problems were experienced, mostly related to the audiovisual signal (n=16), while few technical problems were associated with the sensors (n=1) and the interactive exercise software (n=1). The usability of the platform was very good, with an overall satisfaction rating of 4.63 +/- 0.43 (max. score=5) for all aspects evaluated, namely its dimension, safety, effectiveness, ease of use and game environment. These preliminary results support the reliability and usability of our new platform as a whole but highlight the challenges encountered in ensuring a stable audiovisual signal when delivering services via a standard home-based Internet connection.;2015;3
This longitudinal preliminary study aims to describe the components and features of the eChez-Soi home-based telerehabilitation platform, and present preliminary results on practitioners' readiness for and perception of its usability. Four patients receiving chemotherapy treatments for lung cancer followed an 8-week home-based telerehabilitation program with the new eChez-Soi platform and four healthy adults used it for 2 weeks. The users' perception was very good, with an overall satisfaction rate of 4.6 +/- 0.4 (max. score=5) for the patients, 4.8 +/- 0.2 for the healthy adults and 4.4 +/- 0.3 for the practitioners. Total practitioner telehealth readiness was 73.5 +/- 9.1 (max score=85), suggesting that certain items, for at least one practitioner, may adversely impact the use of telehealth. These preliminary results support the usability of this new platform and suggest that practitioner telehealth readiness is reinforced with experience.;2015;3
This paper focuses on the use of ICT in social rehabilitation, reporting on the research activity of the Latvian national science program VPP INOSOCTEREHI, a new three year multidisciplinary project on social telerehabilitation, conducted by four Latvian Universities (Rezekne University, Latvia University, Riga Technical University, and Liepaja University). The general project objective is presented, and the activities aimed at the creation of a portable, inexpensive balance disorder assessment system are illustrated.

This paper presents a novel mechatronics master-slave setup for hand telerehabilitation. The system consists of a sensorized glove acting as a remote master and a powered hand exoskeleton acting as a slave. The proposed architecture presents three main innovative solutions. First, it provides the therapist with an intuitive interface (a sensorized wearable glove) for conducting the rehabilitation exercises. Second, the patient can benefit from a robot-aided physical rehabilitation in which the slave hand robotic exoskeleton can provide an effective treatment outside the clinical environment without the physical presence of the therapist. Third, the mechatronics setup is integrated with a sensorized object, which allows for the execution of manipulation exercises and the recording of patient's improvements. In this paper, we also present the results of the experimental characterization carried out to verify the system usability of the proposed architecture with healthy volunteers.;2015;3
This paper presents a teleoperation system for two six-degree-of-freedom ARMin arm rehabilitation skeletons. Two control strategies are presented: unilateral teleoperation, which is realized with proportional-derivative controllers, and bilateral teleoperation, which is realized with compliance control and torque feedback. An empirical procedure for identifying the best control gains of the unilateral teleoperation system is presented, and the stability of the bilateral teleoperation system is demonstrated theoretically. Evaluations with healthy subjects showed that trajectories can be learned through the teleoperation system and that the torque feedback allows one human user to determine whether the other human is participating in the movement, resisting it, or remaining passive. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential applications of the system, including telerehabilitation and group rehabilitation.;2015;3
This paper presents a virtual reality system for assisted exercise using Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). Sensor nodes with integrated accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer are used for orientation-driven visualization of human body motion. A virtual scene is created using Unity 3D game-engine. The scene involves virtual trainer for providing the visual guidance during exercise, and user's avatar for real-time tracking of the user's motion. The user is given direct feedback while exercising in form of textual and audio messages. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the performance of each exercise is retrieved through the network. The application is deployed for use on mobile devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets) and PCs.;2015;3
This paper proposes the development of an innovative measurement system for telerehabilitation with the aim to provide objective evaluation of functional capacity of patients subject to lower limb rehabilitation. In particular the system has based on the set of wearable MEMs sensors which detect the 3D orientation of the limbs and communicate with a Central Remote Unit for storing and elaborating all measurement data. The proposed study has been performed under the research project PRO-DOMO SUD funded by Apulia Region within the Project Apulian ICT Living Labs.;2015;3
This perspective article will discuss the potential role of body-worn movement monitors for balance and gait assessment and treatment in rehabilitation. Recent advances in inexpensive, wireless sensor technology and smart devices are resulting in an explosion of miniature, portable sensors that can quickly and accurately quantify body motion. Practical and useful movement monitoring systems are now becoming available. It is critical that therapists understand the potential advantages and limitations of such emerging technology. One important advantage of obtaining objective measures of balance and gait from body-worn sensors is impairment-level metrics characterizing how and why functional performance of balance and gait activities are impaired. Therapy can then be focused on the specific physiological reasons for difficulty in walking or balancing during specific tasks. A second advantage of using technology to measure balance and gait behavior is the increased sensitivity of the balance and gait measures to document mild disability and change with rehabilitation. A third advantage of measuring movement, such as postural sway and gait characteristics, with body-worn sensors is the opportunity for immediate biofeedback provided to patients that can focus attention and enhance performance. In the future, body-worn sensors may allow therapists to perform telerehabilitation to monitor compliance with home exercise programs and the quality of their natural mobility in the community. Therapists need technological systems that are quick to use and provide actionable information and useful reports for their patients and referring physicians. Therapists should look for systems that provide measures that have been validated with respect to gold standard accuracy and to clinically relevant outcomes such as fall risk and severity of disability.;2015;3
"This study examined functional outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and satisfaction in a group of Veterans who received physical therapy via an in-home video telerehabilitation program, the Rural Veterans TeleRehabilitation Initiative (RVTRI). A retrospective, pre-post study design was used. Measures obtained from 26 Veterans who received physical therapy in the RVTRI program between February 22, 2010, and April 1, 2011, were analyzed. Outcomes were the Functional Independence Measure (FIM); Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand measure; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); and the 2-minute walk test (2MWT). HRQoL was assessed using the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), and program satisfaction was evaluated using a telehealth satisfaction scale. Average length of participation was 99.2 +/- 43.3 d and Veterans, on average, received 15.2 +/- 6.0 therapeutic sessions. Significant improvement was shown in the participants' FIM (p < 0.001, r = 0.63), MoCA (p = 0.01, r = 0.44), 2MWT (p = 0.006, r = 0.73), and VR-12 (p = 0.02, r = 0.42). All Veterans reported satisfaction with their telerehabilitation experiences. Those enrolled in the RVTRI program avoided an average of 2,774.7 +/- 3,197.4 travel miles, 46.3 +/- 53.3 hr of driving time, and $1,151.50 +/- $1,326.90 in travel reimbursement. RVTRI provided an effective real-time, home-based, physical therapy.";2015;3
Though studies on robot-mediated intervention for children with autism have gained momentum in recent years, not much work has been done to help therapists to have on-line access to robot programs. Telerehabilitation is an efficient solution to overcome barriers of access, remote locations, lack of autism therapists and cost in the delivery of rehabilitation services. In this study, a telerehabilitation system is developed to help therapists to concentrate fully on the intervention and not in robot programming. Robot scenarios are created based on consultation with clinicians and therapists and are available in the system via a website, with user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). A survey with 15 therapists was carried out to get feedback on the system's usability. 80% of therapists agree that their overall first-time experience in using the telerehabilitation website was good.

"To date Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is one of the most performed procedures in Italy; likewise, rehabilitation after TKR accounts for 182 million of euro each year. The deployment of ICT was able to increase the efficiency in several areas, but in healthcare sector still fails to be widely adopted. According to management literature, business modelling is crucial for a product success and the stakeholder engagement is valuable as well. In this direction, we designed 4 telerehabilitation business/governance models through brainstorming session and developed them interviewing a large sample of the stakeholders involved into the telehealth arena. Whereas the decision makers highlighted the need of gradual changes in healthcare, the preliminary results showed the interest in exploring innovative governance pathways able to directly involve the patients in the healing process and reduce waiting lists over the regional healthcare service. Future research aims to capture the others stakeholders perspectives.";2015;3
Virtual Reality technologies are slated to transform the practice of physical rehabilitation and the potential benefits have only started to be explored. We present in this paper a direct motion demonstration approach for allowing therapists to intuitively create and edit customized exercises and therapy programs that are responsive to the needs of their patients. We propose adaptive exercise models, motion processing algorithms, and delivery techniques designed to achieve exercises that effectively respond to physical limitations and recovery rates of individual patients. Remote networked solutions are also presented for allowing therapists and patients to intuitively share their motions during real-time collaborative therapy sessions. Our solutions have been implemented as a low-cost portable system based on a Kinect sensor, and as a high-end virtual reality system providing full-scale immersion. We analyze and discuss our methods and systems in light of feedback received from therapists.;2015;3
We conducted a literature review of telerehabilitation interventions on cardiac patients. We searched for studies evaluating some form of telerehabilitation in cardiac patients. A total of 116 publications were screened initially, of which 37 publications were eligible for further review. We assessed study strength, based on the level of evidence and the quality of the intervention. The majority of the articles (70%) represented the highest level of evidence. Most interventions were of good (46%) or fair (51%) quality. Most studies evaluated the efficacy of the telerehabilitation interventions (84%), while 38% reported on feasibility and acceptance. Most studies did not include safety and/or cost-benefit analyses. Most telerehabilitation interventions (90%) employed only one or two core components of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Of the CR core components, physical activity was most frequently evaluated. Telerehabilitation appears to be a feasible and effective additional and/or alternative form of rehabilitation, compared to conventional in-hospital CR. Evaluations of telerehabilitation programmes taking into account patient safety and health economics are now required.;2015;3
"We determined the effect of a multifaceted stroke telerehabilitation (STeleR) intervention on falls-related self-efficacy and satisfaction with care. We conducted a prospective, randomized, multisite, single-blinded trial in 52 veterans from three Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Participants who experienced a stroke in the past 24 months were randomized to the STeleR intervention or usual care. Participants in the intervention arm were administered an exit interview to gather specific patient satisfaction data three months after their final outcome measure. The STeleR intervention consisted of three home visits, five telephone calls, and an in-home messaging device provided over three months to instruct patients in functionally based exercises and adaptive strategies. The outcome measures included Falls Efficacy Scale to measure fall-related self-efficacy and a Stroke-Specific Patient Satisfaction with Care (SSPSC) scale, a measure separated into two subscales (satisfaction with home care and satisfaction with hospital care) was employed to measure the participants' satisfaction. At six months, compared with the usual care group, the STeleR group showed statistically significant improvements in one of the two SSPSC scales (satisfaction with hospital care, p = .029) and approached significance in the second SSPSC scale (satisfaction with home care, p = .077). There were no improvements in fall-related self-efficacy. Core concepts identified were: (a) beneficial impact of the trained assistant; (b) exercises helpful; (c) home use of technology. The STeleR intervention improved satisfaction with care, especially as it relates to care following their experience from the hospital. With the limited resources available for in-home rehabilitation for stroke survivors, STeleR (and especially its exercise components) can be a useful complement to traditional post-stroke rehabilitation.";2015;3
We developed a strengthening exercise support system which can be remotely managed and clinically supervised via internet. Older adults may potentially benefit from such an exercise system however functionality of this system requires validation before commencement of field studies in older adults. The aim of this study was to introduce and assess validity of a prototype telerehabilitation system supporting computer-assisted home-based strengthening exercise. The system included a resistance chair with a set of movement and physiologic sensors. Real-time feedback on exercise performance was displayed on a touch screen dashboard. Personalized exercise parameters were managed by a rehabilitation team via a designated telerehabilitation site. Assessment of the system demonstrated sufficient validity in real-time identification of exercise performance and cardiovascular parameters. We concluded that the interactive resistance chair has a potential in promoting strengthening exercise and it is warranted for further evaluation in community dwelling older adults.;2015;3
"We explored how changes in vision and perturbation frequency impacted upright postural control in healthy adults exposed to continuous multiaxial support-surface perturbation. Ten subjects were asked to maintain equilibrium in standing stance with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) during sinusoidal 3D rotations at 0.25 (L) and 0.50 Hz (H). We measured upper-body kinematics - head, trunk, and pelvis and analyzed differences in horizontal displacements and roll, pitch, and yaw sways. The presence of vision significantly decreased upper-body displacements in the horizontal plane, especially at the head level, while in EC the head was the most unstable segment. H trials produced a greater segment stabilization compared to L ones in EO and EC. Analysis of sways showed that in EO participants stabilized their posture by reducing the variability of trunk angles; in H trials a sway decrease for the examined segments was observed in the yaw plane and, for the pelvis only, in the pitch plane. Our results suggest that, during continuous multiaxial perturbations, visual information induced: (i) in L condition, a continuous reconfiguration of multi-body-segments orientation to follow the perturbation; (ii) in H condition, a compensation for the ongoing perturbation. These findings were not confirmed in EC where the same strategy - that is, the use of the pelvis as a reference frame for the body balance was adopted both in L and H. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We present the outcomes of a study on stroke patients in a 3-week intervention of bimanual self-telerehabilitation. This training is similar to an upper-extremity treadmill in that patients can make use of their healthy arm to provide a cue for the more impaired arm. We further inspected a cohort that covertly received error augmentation training while they practiced. Finally, we focused here on the many quantitative measures available from the robotic device, testing if these measures collectively can predict outcome on the final day. We found in a cross-validation study that predictions are possible, yielding median r-squared values over 99%. Several particular measures were found to dominate their contribution to the prediction of recoverability. These results show that interactive self-rehabilitation may be a viable method for motor restoration, and the quantitative metrics available can be used to predict the eventual state of recovery.;2015;3
A bilateral nonlinear adaptive impedance controller is proposed for the control of multi-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) teleoperation systems. In this controller, instead of conventional position and/or force tracking, the impedance of the nonlinear teleoperation system is controlled. The controller provides asymptotic tracking of two impedance models in Cartesian coordinates for the master and slave robots. The proposed bilateral controller can be used in different medical applications, such as telesurgery and telerehabilitation, where the impedance of the robot in interaction with human subject is of great importance. The parameters of the two impedance models can be adjusted according to the application and corresponding objectives and requirements. The dynamic uncertainties are considered in the model of the master and slave robots. The stability and the tracking performance of the system are proved via a Lyapunov analysis. Moreover, the adaptation laws are proposed in the joint space for reducing the computational complexity, however, the controller and the stability proof are all presented in Cartesian coordinates. Using simulations on a 2DOF robot, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is investigated in telesurgery and telerehabilitation operations.;2016;3
"A growing body of literature supports the effectiveness of the remote delivery of rehabilitation services, i.e., telerehab. Aphasia treatment is particularly well suited for telerehab because of the verbal and visual nature of speech-language therapy, but scientific research investigating aphasia telerehab is in its infancy. No studies to date have evaluated whether treatment of acquired reading disorders by a live clinician can be feasibly, effectively, or efficiently conducted via telerehab. Here we address this gap in the literature by reporting our success remotely remediating the reading deficits of two participants with phonological alexia. We adapted for the telerehab setting a previously validated treatment for phonological alexia (Friedman, Sample, & Lott, 2002), which uses a paired-associate design to train reading of problematic words. Both telerehab participants significantly improved their reading of trained words in similar time frames as previous participants (Friedman et al., 2002; Kurland et al., 2008; Lott, Sample, Oliver, Lacey, & Friedman, 2008); furthermore, both participants reported high satisfaction with the telerehab setting. Although telerehab with alexic patients poses unique challenges, we conclude that treatment for alexia via telerehab is nevertheless feasible, may be equally effective as in-person treatment, and saves substantial resources for participants as well as clinicians.";2016;3
A novel mobile health platform, Interactive Mobile Health and Rehabilitation (iMHere), is being developed to support wellness and self-management among people with chronic disabilities. The iMHere system currently includes a smartphone app with six modules for use by persons with disabilities and a web portal for use by medical and rehabilitation professionals or other support personnel. Our initial clinical research applying use of this system provides insight into the feasibility of employing iMHere in the development of self-management skills in young adults (ages 18-40 years) with spina bifida (SB) (Dicianno, Fairman, et al., 2015). This article describes the iterative design of the iMHere system including usability testing of both the app modules and clinician portal. Our pilot population of persons with SB fostered the creation of a system appropriate for people with a wide variety of functional abilities and needs. As a result, the system is appropriate for use by persons with various disabilities and chronic conditions, not only SB. In addition, the diversity of professionals and support personnel involved in the care of persons with SB also enabled the design and implementation of the iMHere system to meet the needs of an interdisciplinary team of providers who treat various conditions. The iMHere system has the potential to foster communication and collaboration among members of an interdisciplinary healthcare team, including individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities, for a client-centered approach to support self-management skills.;2016;3
A novel service oriented platform has been developed under the framework of the Telerehabilitation Service funded by the Cross Border Cooperation Programme Greece Cyprus 2007 - 2013 to support tele-supervised exercise rehabilitation for patients after hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU). The platform enables multiparty, interregional bidirectional audio/visual communication between clinical practitioners and post-ICU patients. It also enables patient group-based vital sign real time monitoring, patients' clinical record bookkeeping, and individualized and group-based patient online exercise programs. The exercise programs intended for the service are based on successful cardiorespiratory rehabilitation programs, individualized and monitored by a multidisciplinary team. The eligibility study of former ICU patients to participate in such a service as well as a cost benefit analysis are presented to support the cost effectiveness of the telerehabilitation program in addition to the expected health benefits to a large proportion of former ICU patients.;2016;3
Accessibility to the available traditional forms of cardiac rehabilitation programs in heart failure patients is not adequate and adherence to the programs remains unsatisfactory. The home-based telerehabilitation model has been proposed as a promising new option to improve this situation. This paper's aims are to discuss the tools available for telemonitoring, and describing their characteristics, applicability, and effectiveness in providing optimal long termmanagement for heart failure patients who are unable to attend traditional cardiac rehabilitation programs. The critical issues of psychological support and adherence to the telerehabilitation programs are outlined. The advantages and limitations of this long term management modality are presented and compared with alternatives. Finally, the importance of further research, multicenter studies of telerehabilitation for heart failure patients and the technological development needs are outlined, in particular interactive remotely controlled intelligent telemedicine systems with increased inter-device compatibility.

Advances in technology show promise as tools to optimize functional mobility, independence, and participation in infants and children with motor disability due to brain injury. Although technologies are often used in adult rehabilitation, these have not been widely applied to rehabilitation of infants and children. In October 2015, the Academy of Pediatric Physical Therapy sponsored Research Summit IV, Innovations in Technology for Children With Brain Insults: Maximizing Outcomes. The summit included pediatric physical therapist researchers, experts from other scientific fields, funding agencies, and consumers. Participants identified challenges in implementing technology in pediatric rehabilitation including accessibility, affordability, managing large data sets, and identifying relevant data elements. Participants identified 4 key areas for technology development: to determine (1) thresholds for learning, (2) appropriate transfer to independence, (3) optimal measurement of subtle changes, and (4) how to adapt to growth and changing abilities.;2016;3
Aim of this study was to provide a proof-of-principle for a neurofeedback-based cognitive telerehabilitation system. Here we describe the implementation of the system and its application and evaluation in two neurological patients with multiple sclerosis suffering from cognitive deficits. The portable telerehabilitation system consists of a small EEG amplifier, an easy-to-use semi-dry EEG headset and a laptop enabling home-based neurofeedback training. The patients performed ten home-based neurofeedback training sessions, which were supervised remotely by an EEG expert. During neurofeedback training, participants tried to voluntarily increase the amplitude of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR, 12-15 Hz) in the EEG. Before and after neurofeedback training, cognitive functions were assessed using standardized neuropsychological tests. Results demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the neurofeedback-based cognitive telerehabilitation system on different levels. On the technical level, we could show that the system works flawlessly and can be easily used by neurological patients on their own at the patients' home. On the behavioral level, our results indicate that the effects of the home-based neurofeedback training are comparable to effects of conventional neurofeedback training performed in a standard lab or clinical environment. The patients were able to voluntarily modulate their own brain activity in the desired direction and they showed cognitive improvements after neurofeedback training compared to a pre-measurement. Hence, our study demonstrates the great potential value of such a neurofeedback-based telerehabilitation system for future cognitive rehabilitation.;2016;3
Asynchronous telerehabilitation in which computer-based interventions are remotely monitored and adapted offline is an emerging service delivery model in the rehabilitation of communication disorders. The asynchronous nature of this model may hold a benefit over its synchronous counterpart by eliminating scheduling issues and thus improving efficiency in a healthcare landscape of constrained resource allocation. The design of asynchronous telerehabilitation platforms should therefore ensure efficiency and flexibility. The authors have been engaged in a program of research to develop and evaluate an asynchronous telerehabilitation platform for use in speech-language pathology. eSALT is a novel asynchronous telerehabilitation platform in which clinicians design and individualize therapy tasks for transfer to a client's mobile device. An inbuilt telerehabilitation module allows for remote monitoring and updating of tasks. This paper introduces eSALT and reports outcomes from an usability study that considered the needs of two end-user groups, people with aphasia and clinicians, in the on-going refinement of eSALT. In the study participants with aphasia were paired with clinicians who used eSALT to design and customize therapy tasks. After training on the mobile device the participants engaged in therapy at home fora period of 3 weeks, while clinicians remotely monitored and updated tasks. Following the home trial, participants, and clinicians engaged in semi-structured interviews and completed surveys on the usability of eSALT and their satisfaction with the platform. Content analysis of data involving five participants and three clinicians revealed a number of usability themes including ease of use, user support, satisfaction, limitations, and potential improvements. These findings were translated into a number of refinements of the eSALT platform including the development of a client interface for use on the Apple iPad (R) greater variety in feedback options to both the participant and clinician, automatic transfer of results to the clinician, and expansion of the task template list. This research highlights the importance of including end-users in the process of technology refinement, in order to ensure effective and efficient use of the technology. Future directions for research are discussed including clinical trials in which the effectiveness of and adherence to intervention protocols using asynchronous telerehabilitation are examined.;2016;3
"Background and Purpose. Telehealth is defined as the delivery of health-related services and information via telecommunication technologies. The purposes of this case report are: (1) to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a telehealth approach for meeting physical therapist supervision requirements in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) in Washington and (2) to explore clinical and human factors of physical therapist practice in an SNF delivered via telehealth. Case Description. In 2009, Infinity Rehab conducted a pilot program to determine whether telehealth could be used to meet physical therapist supervision requirements in an SNF. In 2011, language allowing telehealth physical therapy was approved by the Washington Board of Physical Therapy (Board). In 2014-2015, telehealth outcomes were evaluated in a 51-person sample at an Infinity Rehab SNF. Cost savings of telehealth implementation from 2011 to 2015 were estimated. Outcomes. The Board deemed the telehealth pilot program a success and subsequently established telehealth practice language for physical therapy. Both human factors and clinical outcomes were required to implement a successful telehealth practice. Clinical outcomes and user satisfaction in telehealth and nontelehealth groups were equivalent. Cost savings were identified. Discussion. Human factors; such as the need for provider education in appropriate bedside manner with a telehealth session, were identified. Since 2011, more than 1,000 telehealth physical therapy sessions were conducted at Infinity Rehab SNFs in Washington State. In the future, alternative payment models focused on valued-based clinical outcomes may facilitate wider telehealth adoption in physical therapy. Future research on efficacy and cost-effectiveness is needed to promote broader adoption of telehealth physical therapy in SNFs. This experience demonstrates that telehealth implementation in an SNF for the purpose of physical therapy re-evaluation is a feasible alternative to in-person encounters.";2016;3
Background Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based intervention to increase survival and quality of life. Yet studies consistently show that elderly patients are less frequently referred to CR, show less uptake and more often drop out of CR programmes. Design The European study on effectiveness and sustainability of current cardiac rehabilitation programmes in the elderly (EU-CaRE) project consists of an observational study and an open prospective, investigator-initiated multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving mobile telemonitoring guided CR (mCR). Objective The aim of EU-CaRE is to map the efficiency of current CR of the elderly in Europe, and to investigate whether mCR is an effective alternative in terms of efficacy, adherence and sustainability. Methods and results The EU-CaRE study includes patients aged 65 years or older with ischaemic heart disease or who have undergone heart valve surgery. A total of 1760 patients participating in existing CR programmes in eight regions of Europe will be included. Of patients declining regular CR, 238 will be included in the RCT and randomised in two study arms. The experimental group (mCR) will receive a personalised home-based programme while the control group will receive no advice or coaching throughout the study period. Outcomes will be assessed after the end of CR and at 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome is VO2peak and secondary outcomes include variables describing CR uptake, adherence, efficacy and sustainability. Conclusion The study will provide important information to improve CR in the elderly. The EU-CaRE RCT is the first European multicentre study of mCR as an alternative for elderly patients not attending usual CR.;2016;3
Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) poses major challenges for health care systems. Previous studies suggest that telemonitoring could be effective in preventing hospitalisations and hence reduce costs. Objective The aim was to evaluate whether telemonitoring interventions for COPD are cost-effective from the perspective of German statutory sickness funds. Methods A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a combination of a Markov model and a decision tree. Telemonitoring as add-on to standard treatment was compared with standard treatment alone. The model consisted of four transition stages to account for COPD severity, and a terminal stage for death. Within each cycle, the frequency of exacerbations as well as outcomes for 2015 costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for each stage were calculated. Values for input parameters were taken from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results In the base case, telemonitoring led to an increase in incremental costs ((sic)866 per patient) but also in incremental QALYs (0.05 per patient). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was thus (sic)17,410 per QALY gained. A deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that hospitalisation rate and costs for telemonitoring equipment greatly affected results. The probabilistic ICER averaged (sic)34,432 per QALY (95 % confidence interval 12,161-56,703). Conclusion We provide evidence that telemonitoring may be cost-effective in Germany from a payer's point of view. This holds even after deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.;2016;3
"Background E-health interventions have become increasingly popular, including in perioperative care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of perioperative e-health interventions on the postoperative course. Methods We conducted a systematic review and searched for relevant articles in the PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL and COCHRANE databases. Controlled trials written in English, with participants of 18 years and older who underwent any type of surgery and which evaluated any type of e-health intervention by reporting patient-related outcome measures focusing on the period after surgery, were included. Data of all included studies were extracted and study quality was assessed by using the Downs and Black scoring system. Findings A total of 33 articles were included, reporting on 27 unique studies. Most studies were judged as having a medium risk of bias (n = 13), 11 as a low risk of bias, and three as high risk of bias studies. Most studies included patients undergoing cardiac (n = 9) or orthopedic surgery (n = 7). All studies focused on replacing (n = 11) or complementing (n = 15) perioperative usual care with some form of care via ICT; one study evaluated both type of interventions. Interventions consisted of an educational or supportive website, telemonitoring, telerehabilitation or teleconsultation. All studies measured patient-related outcomes focusing on the physical, the mental or the general component of recovery. 11 studies (40.7%) reported outcome measures related to the effectiveness of the intervention in terms of health care usage and costs. 25 studies (92.6%) reported at least an equal (n = 8) or positive (n = 17) effect of the e-health intervention compared to usual care. In two studies (7.4%) a positive effect on any outcome was found in favour of the control group. Conclusion Based on this systematic review we conclude that in the majority of the studies e-health leads to similar or improved clinical patient-related outcomes compared to only face to face perioperative care for patients who have undergone various forms of surgery. However, due to the low ormoderate quality of many studies, the results should be interpreted with caution.";2016;3
Background Notwithstanding the cardiovascular disease epidemic, current budgetary constraints do not allow for budget expansion of conventional cardiac rehabilitation programmes. Consequently, there is an increasing need for cost-effectiveness studies of alternative strategies such as telerehabilitation. The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive cardiac telerehabilitation programme. Design and methods This multi-centre randomized controlled trial comprised 140 cardiac rehabilitation patients, randomized (1:1) to a 24-week telerehabilitation programme in addition to conventional cardiac rehabilitation (intervention group) or to conventional cardiac rehabilitation alone (control group). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated based on intervention and health care costs (incremental cost), and the differential incremental quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Results The total average cost per patient was significantly lower in the intervention group (Euro2156Euro126) than in the control group (Euro2720 +/- Euro276) (p=0.01) with an overall incremental cost of Euro-564.40. Dividing this incremental cost by the baseline adjusted differential incremental QALYs (0.026 QALYs) yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Euro-21,707/QALY. The number of days lost due to cardiovascular rehospitalizations in the intervention group (0.33 +/- 0.15) was significantly lower than in the control group (0.79 +/- 0.20) (p=0.037). Conclusions This paper shows the addition of cardiac telerehabilitation to conventional centre-based cardiac rehabilitation to be more effective and efficient than centre-based cardiac rehabilitation alone. These results are useful for policy makers charged with deciding how limited health care resources should best be allocated in the era of exploding need.;2016;3
Background. The rise in cases of motor impairing illnesses demands the research for improvements in rehabilitation therapy. The study of robotics for enhancing motor recovery has been gaining momentum, but there is still little standardization of tools. Objectives. This paper shows the current development state of a proposed new robotic treatment platform, primarily geared towards post-stroke cases, but intended to be reusable for other kinds of motor disabilities. Methods. This project differs from current solutions because of its modular design, distributed processing, remote interaction capabilities, and by dealing with patients motivation while treated with multiplayer video-games. Custom and commercial robotic orthoses could be used by individuals, while they are being treated, to join each other in a competitive or cooperative activity in a virtual reality environment. As network-connected participants could be separated by large distances, communication delays are minimized or compensated. For a viability test, two healthy subjects played a customized Pong game together using the system. Results. The preliminary testing provides evidence that the designed infrastructure could become a viable platform for rehabilitation systems, as data can be synchronized across users within a tolerable deviation margin. Conclusion. The system proves itself feasible, but improvements on handling bad communication conditions and definition of performance evaluation protocols are needed.;2016;3
Background: A minicomputer (tablet) with instructions and a training diary has the potential of facilitating adherence to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Objective: To evaluate the effect of adding a tablet to a classic outpatient PR programme for COPD patients. Methods: A total of 115 patients participated in a 7- to 10- week outpatient PR programme in groups of 10-12 individuals. Half of the groups were assigned to PR plus a tablet (tablet group) and the other groups were assigned to PR only (controls). Primary effect parameters were endurance shuttle walk time (ESWT) and disease-specific health status (COPD Assessment Test=CAT). Results: The change in ESWT was significantly better in the control group (mean 167 sec) compared with the tablet group (mean 51 sec) (p<0.01), whereas the change in CAT score did not differ significantly between the two groups (-0.6 vs. -2.3) (p = 0.17). Conclusions: Compared with usual PR, no significant improvements were seen in the group equipped with the tablet after 7-10 weeks of rehabilitation. Future studies should focus on long-term effects.;2016;3
Background: According to the World Alzheimer Report (Prince, The Global Impact of Dementia: an Analysis of Prevalence, Incidence, Cost and Trends, 2015), 46.8 million people worldwide are nowadays living with dementia. And this number is estimated to approximate 131.5 million by 2050, with an increasing burden on society and families. The lack of medical treatments able to stop or slow down the course of the disease has moved the focus of interest toward the nonpharmacological approach and psychosocial therapies for people with/at risk of dementia, as in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) condition. The purpose of the present study is to test an individualized home-based multidimensional program aimed at enhancing the continuum of care for MCI and outpatients with dementia in early stage using technology. Methods: The proposed study is a single blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 30 subjects with MCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD) randomly assigned to the intervention group (Ability group), who will receive the Ability Program, or to the active control group (ACG), who will receive Treatment As Usual (TAU). The protocol provides for three steps of assessment: at the baseline (T_0), after treatment, (T_1) and at follow-up (T_2) with a multidimensional evaluation battery including cognitive functioning, behavioral, functional, and quality of life measures. The Ability Program lasts 6 weeks, comprises tablet-delivered cognitive (5 days/week) and physical activities (7 days/week) combined with a set of devices for the measurement and monitoring from remote of vital and physical health parameters. The TAU equally lasts 6 weeks and includes paper and pencil cognitive activities (5 days/week), with clinician's prescription to perform physical exercise every day and to monitor selected vital parameters. Discussion: Results of this study will inform on the efficacy of a technology-enhanced home care service to preserve cognitive and motor levels of functioning in MCI and AD, in order to slow down their loss of autonomy in daily life. The expected outcome is to ensure the continuity of care from clinical practice to the patient's home, enabling also cost effectiveness and the empowerment of patient and caregiver in the care process, positively impacting on their quality of life.;2016;3
"Background: After discharge from in-hospital rehabilitation, post-stroke patients should have the opportunity to continue the rehabilitation through structured programs to maintain the benefits acquired during intensive rehabilitation treatment. Objective: The primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing an home-based telesurveillance and rehabilitation (HBTR) program to optimize the patient's recovery by reducing dependency degree. Method: Post-stroke patients were consecutively screened. Data were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD). 26 patients enrolled: 15 were sub-acute (time since stroke: 112 +/- 39 days) and 11 were chronic (time since stroke: 470 +/- 145 days). For 3 months patients were followed at home by a nurse-tutor, who provided structured phone support and vital signs telemonitoring, and by a physiotherapist (PT) who monitored rehabilitation sessions by videoconferencing. Results: 23 patients completed the program; 16.7 +/- 5.2 phone contacts/patient were initiated by the nurse and 0.9 +/- 1.8 by the patients. Eight episodes of atrial fibrillation that required a change in therapy were recorded in two patients. Physiotherapists performed 1.2 +/- 0.4 home visits, 1.6 +/- 0.9 phone calls and 4.5 +/- 2.8 video-conferencesessions per patient. At least three sessions/week of home exercises were performed by 31% of patients, two sessions by 54%. At the end of the program, global functional capacity improved significantly (P< 0.001), in particular, static (P< 0.001) and dynamic (P= 0.0004) postural balance, upper limb dexterity of the paretic side (P= 0.01), and physical performance (P= 0.002). Symptoms of depression and caregiver strain also improved. Conclusion: The home-based program was feasible and effective in both sub-acute and chronic post-stroke patients, improving their recovery, and maintaining the benefits reached during inpatient rehabilitation";2016;3
Background: Audio/video-mediated communication between patients and clinicians using videoconferencing over telecommunication networks is a key component of providing teletreatments in rehabilitation. Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) document the conditions of use, performance, and reliability of videoconferencing-based communication in the context of in-home teletreatment (TELE) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and (2) assess from the perspective of the providers, the quality attributes of the technology used and its impact on clinical objectives. Materials and Methods: Descriptive embedded study in a randomized controlled trial using a sample of 97 post-TKA patients, who received a total of 1,431 TELE sessions. Technical support use, service delivery reliability, performance, and use of network connection were assessed using self-report data from a costing grid and automated logs captured from videoconferencing systems. Physical therapists assessed the quality and impact of video-mediated communications after each TELE session on seven attributes. Results: Installation of a new Internet connection was required in 75% of the participants and average technician's time to install test and uninstall technology (including travel time) was 308.4 min. The reliability of service delivery was 96.5% of planned sessions with 21% of TELE session requiring a reconnection during the session. Remote technical support was solicited in 43% of the sessions (interventions were less than 3-min duration). Perceived technological impacts on video-mediated communications were minimal with quality of the overall technical environment evaluated as good or acceptable in 96% of the sessions and clinical objectives reached almost completely or completely in 99% of the sessions. Conclusions: In-home rehabilitation teletreatments can be delivered reliably but requires access to technical support for the initial setup and maintenance. Optimization of the processes of reliably connecting patients to the Internet, getting the telerehabilitation platform in the patient's home, installing, configuring, and testing will be needed to generalize this approach of service delivery.;2016;3
"Background: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction appears in the course of both chronic heart failure (CHF) and depression. Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR), apart from improving physical capacity, can reduce depressive symptoms and leads to the restoration of ANS function among CHF patients. The purpose was to evaluate the influence of the reversion of depression (measured by Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] score, cut point <10) and the physical capacity improvement (measured by peak oxygen consumption [peak VO2; ml/kg per minute]) on the sympathovagal balance (measured by low/high frequency ratio [LF/HF]) after CCR in CHF patients. Methods: The study group comprised 111 CHF patients (New York Heart Association II-III; left ventricular ejection fraction <= 40%). Patients were randomized (2:1) to 8-week CCR based on Nordic walking training (five times weekly) at 40-70% of maximal heart rate, training group (TG) n = 77, or to control group (CG) n = 34. The effectiveness of CCR was assessed by changes-delta (Delta) in LF/HF, BDI score, and peak VO2, as a result of comparing these parameters from the beginning and the end of the program. Results: Eventually, 46 patients in TG and 23 patients in CG were eligible for simultaneous ANS and psychological status analysis. Only in TG the LF/HF decreased 2.06 +/- 1.14 versus 1.19 +/- 0.80 (P < 0.0001) and peak VO2 increased 16.83 +/- 3.72 versus 19.14 +/- 4.20 ml/kg per minute (P < 0.0001). Favorable results in CG were not observed. The differences between TG and CG were significant: Delta peak VO2 (P < 0.0001); Delta LF/HF (P = 0.0001). Depressive symptoms were substantially reduced in both groups (TG, P = 0.0006; CG, P = 0.0490). Nevertheless, the greatest improvement of sympathovagal balance was observed in patients whose depression was reversed, thanks to the CCR in comparison to other patients from TG and the entire CG. Conclusion: Positive effect of the sympatho-parasympathetic balance obtained during the home CCR based on Nordic walking training results from the additive effects of the reversion of depression and physical capacity improvement in CHF patients.";2016;3
Background: Cardiac rehabilitation can reduce mortality of patients with cardiovascular disease, but a frequently low participation rate in rehabilitation programs has been found globally. The objective of the Teledialog study was to assess the cost-utility (CU) of a cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) program. The aim of the intervention was to increase the patients' participation in the CTR program. At discharge, an individualized 3-month rehabilitation plan was formulated for each patient. At home, the patients measured their own blood pressure, pulse, weight, and steps taken for 3 months. Materials and Methods: The analysis was carried out together with a randomized controlled trial with 151 patients during 2012-2014. Costs of the intervention were estimated with a health sector perspective following international guidelines for CU. Quality of life was assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Results: The rehabilitation activities were approximately the same in the two groups, but the number of contacts with the physiotherapist was higher among the intervention group. The mean total cost per patient was (sic)1,700 higher in the intervention group. The quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gain was higher in the intervention group, but the difference was not statistically significant. The incremental CU ratio was more than (sic)400,000 per QALY gained. Conclusions: Even though the rehabilitation activities increased, the program does not appear to be cost-effective. The intervention itself was not costly (less than (sic)500), and increasing the number of patients may show reduced costs of the devices and make the CTR more cost-effective. Telerehabilitation can increase participation, but the intervention, in its current form, does not appear to be cost-effective.;2016;3
Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) frequently coexist, significantly reducing patients' quality of life and increasing morbidity and mortality. For either single disease, a multidisciplinary disease-management approach supported by telecommunication technologies offers the best outcome in terms of prolonged survival and reduced hospital readmissions. However, no data exist in patients with combined COPD/CHF. We planned a randomized controlled trial to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of an integrated, home-based, medical/nursing intervention plus a rehabilitation program versus conventional care in patients with coexisting COPD/CHF. The purpose of the paper is to describe the rationale and design of the trial. Methods/designs: Patients, after inpatient rehabilitation, were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group, followed for 4 months at home, then assessed at 4 and 6 months. The intervention group followed a telesurveillance (telephone contacts by nurse and remote monitoring of cardiorespiratory parameters) and home-based rehabilitation program (at least three sessions/week of mini-ergometer exercises, callisthenic exercises and twice weekly pedometer-driven walking, plus telephone contacts by a physiotherapist). Telephone follow-up served to verify compliance to therapy, maintain exercise motivation, educate for early recognition of signs/symptoms, and verify the skills acquired. At baseline and 4 and 6 months, the 6-min Walk Test, dyspnea and fatigue at rest, oxygenation (PaO2/FiO(2)), physical activity profile (PASE questionnaire), and QoL (Minnesota and CAT questionnaires) were assessed. During the study, serious clinical events (hospitalizations or deaths) were recorded. Discussion: Currently, no studies have assessed the impact of a telehealth program in patients with combined COPD and CHF. Our study will show whether this approach is effective in the management of such complex, frail patients who are at very high risk of exacerbations.;2016;3
Background: Despite exercise capacity and quality-of-life benefits, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programmes are not easily accessed because of several barriers. A solution may be telerehabilitation (TR), in which patients exercise in their communities while they are monitored via teletechnology. However, the benefits of TR for the purposes of PR and CR have not been systematically reviewed. Objective: To determine whether the benefits of the exercise component of PR and CR using TR are comparable to usual-care (UC) programmes. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed of the Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases up to July 13, 2015. Meta-analyses were performed for peak oxygen consumption, peak workload, exercise test duration, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance using the I-2 statistic and forest plots displaying standardized mean difference (SMD). Results: Of 1,431 citations found, 8 CR studies met the inclusion criteria. No differences were found in exercise outcomes between UC and TR groups for CR studies, except in exercise test duration, which slightly favoured UC (SMD 0.268, 95% CI: 0.002, 0.534, p < 0.05). Only 1 PR study was included, and it showed similar improvements on the 6MWT between the UC and TR groups. Conclusion: TR for patients with cardiac conditions provided benefits similar to UC with no adverse effects reported. Similar studies of TR for patients with pulmonary conditions need to be conducted.;2016;3
Background: Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation reduces morbidity and mortality. Walking is a convenient activity suitable for people with cardiac disease. Pedometers count steps, measure walking activity and motivate people to increase physical activity. In this study, patients participating in cardiac telerehabilitation were provided with a pedometer to support motivation for physical activity with the purpose of exploring pedometer use and self-determined motivation for walking experienced by patients and health professionals during a cardiac telerehabilitation program. Methods: A qualitative research design consisting of observations, individual interviews and patient documents made the basis for a content analysis. Data was analysed deductively using Self Determination Theory as a frame for analysis and discussion, focusing on the psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness. Twelve cardiac patients, 11 health professionals, 6 physiotherapists and 5 registered nurses were included. Results: The pedometer offered independence from standardised rehabilitation since the pedometer supported tailoring, individualised walking activity based on the patient's choice. This led to an increased autonomy. The patients felt consciously aware of health benefits of walking, and the pedometer provided feedback on walking activity leading to an increased competence to achieve goals for steps. Finally, the pedometer supported relatedness with others. The health professionals' surveillance of patients' steps, made the patients feel observed, yet supported, furthermore, their next of kin appeared to be supportive as walking partners. Conclusion: Cardiac patients' motivation for walking was evident due to pedometer use. Even though not all aspects of motivation were autonomous and self determined, the patients felt motivated for walking. The visible steps and continuous monitoring of own walking activity made it possible for each individual patient to choose their desired kind of activity and perform ongoing adjustments of walking activity. The immediate feedback on step activity and the expectations of health benefits resulted in motivation for walking. Finally, pedometer supported walking made surveillance possible, giving the patients a feeling of being looked after and supported.;2016;3
"Background: Home-based, computer-enhanced therapy of hand and arm function can complement conventional interventions and increase the amount and intensity of training, without interfering too much with family routines. The objective of the present study was to investigate the feasibility and usability of the new portable version of the YouGrabber (R) system (YouRehab AG, Zurich, Switzerland) in the home setting. Methods: Fifteen families of children (7 girls, mean age: 11.3y) with neuromotor disorders and affected upper limbs participated. They received instructions and took the system home to train for 2 weeks. After returning it, they answered questions about usability, motivation, and their general opinion of the system (Visual Analogue Scale; 0 indicating worst score, 100 indicating best score; <= 30 not satisfied, 31-69 average, >= 70 satisfied). Furthermore, total pure playtime and number of training sessions were quantified. To prove the usability of the system, number and sort of support requests were logged. Results: The usability of the system was considered average to satisfying (mean 60.1-93.1). The lowest score was given for the occurrence of technical errors. Parents had to motivate their children to start (mean 66.5) and continue (mean 68.5) with the training. But in general, parents estimated the therapeutic benefit as high (mean 73.1) and the whole system as very good (mean 87.4). Children played on average 7 times during the 2 weeks; total pure playtime was 185 +/- 45 min. Especially at the beginning of the trial, systems were very error-prone. Fortunately, we, or the company, solved most problems before the patients took the systems home. Nevertheless, 10 of 15 families contacted us at least once because of technical problems. Conclusions: Despite that the YouGrabber (R) is a promising and highly accepted training tool for home-use, currently, it is still error-prone, and the requested support exceeds the support that can be provided by clinical therapists. A technically more robust system, combined with additional attractive games, likely results in higher patient motivation and better compliance. This would reduce the need for parents to motivate their children extrinsically and allow for clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of the system.";2016;3
Background: Intensive speech therapy improves language function in patients with chronic aphasia, although treatment in the acute phase is more effective than in the chronic phase. Unfortunately, most patients with stroke go untreated due to socioeconomic problems. This study was performed to develop and test a speech therapy-based telerehabilitation program (iAphasia), suitable for use on a mobile device platform, which would expand access to therapy to patients who frequently go untreated. Subjects and Methods: We enrolled 8 patients with chronic poststroke aphasia to receive therapy via our iPad (R) (Apple, Cupertino, CA)-based telespeech therapy program, iAphasia. Participants received 4 weeks of telespeech therapy using iAphasia, which generates six domains with six levels of difficulty. We compared pre- and posttreatment scores on the Korean version of the Western Aphasia Battery (K-WAB) to evaluate effectiveness. Additionally, a 1-month follow-up assessment was performed. Results: We investigated user satisfaction using a questionnaire to assess the feasibility of iAphasia. After the 4-week treatment, language function as measured by the K-WAB improved significantly. The improvement was persistent at the 1-month follow-up visit. The degree of improvement was strongly associated with usage time, regardless of participants' age and severity of aphasia. Overall, satisfaction with iAphasia was rated high. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest it to be an effective and feasible treatment method for chronic aphasia, although follow-up studies with more subjects and a control group are needed for a more thorough assessment.;2016;3
Background: Measuring range of movement is important in clinical shoulder assessment. Over the years, different techniques have been used to analyze upper limbs mobility. Smartphone image-based goniometer offers a noninvasive easy-to-use method of measuring arm abduction angle. However, the validity of this method has not been previously established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity and reliability of an Internet and image-based app (mROM) regarding arm abduction angle in both healthy subjects and patients suffering from shoulder damage. Methods: Twenty three subjects with shoulder pathology (14 female, 9 male) and 14 healthy subjects (8 female, 6 male) were examined (37 shoulders). mROM app was used to measure arm abduction angle. Two examiners measured 37 shoulders on 3 separate occasions over 2 days: 2 measurements on the first day and a third one the following day. Descriptive statistics were calculated for descriptive and anthropometric variables, as well as for the first measure of arm abduction angle by photographs and inertial sensors. Reliability was investigated by intraclass correlation coefficients and p values, and validity by Pearson correlation and P. Results: Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were high (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.998 and 0.984 respectively) for the total sample, although, for the healthy group, intrareliability was lower and interreliability was no reliable. Measurements from photographs and intertial sensors were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.964) for the total sample. However, it was no significant for the healthy group. Conclusion: Smartphone photographs are a reliable and valid method to measure arm abduction angle, supporting the use of photography obtained through app for measuring joint ROM. This method provides a convenient and precise tool in assessment of arm motion.;2016;3
"BACKGROUND: Neurorehabilitation programs are among the most popular therapies aimed at reducing the disabilities that result from multiple sclerosis. Video games have recently gained importance in the rehabilitation of patients with motor neurological dysfunctions. Currently, the studies describing the perspective of patients with multiple sclerosis who have participated in rehabilitation programmes via home-based video games are almost inexistent. AIM: The aim of this paper was to explore the experiences of multiple sclerosis patients who performed a virtual home-exercise programme using Kinect. DESIGN: A qualitative research enquiry was conducted as part of a study that examined postural control and balance after a 10-week Kinect home-exercise programme in adults with multiple sclerosis. SETTING: Patients were recruited from a Neurology Unit of a University Hospital. POPULATION: The inclusion criteria were: subjects aged between 20 and 60 years, diagnosed with multiple sclerosis for over 2 years based on the McDonald Criteria; with an EDSS score ranging from 3 to 5. METHODS: Purposeful sampling method was implemented. The data collection consisted of unstructured interviews, using open questions, and thematic analysis was conducted. Guidelines for conducting qualitative studies established by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research were followed. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with a mean age of 36.69 were included. Four main themes emerged from the data: 1) regaining previous capacity and abilities. The patients described how, after the treatment with Kinect they felt more independent; 2) sharing the disease. The patients sharing the experience of living with MS with their family, thanks to the use of Kinect; 3) adapting to the new treatment. This refers to how the use of the videogame console incorporated novelties to their rehabilitation programme; and 4) comparing oneself. This refers to the appearance of factors that motivate the patient during KVHEP. CONCLUSIONS: The patients' experiences gathered in this study highlight perceptions of unexpected improvement, an eagerness to improve, and the positive opportunity of sharing treatment with their social entourage thanks to the games. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: These results can be applied to future research using video consoles, by individualizing and adapting the games to the patient's abilities, and by developing a new field in rehabilitation.";2016;3
Background: Participation in traditional center-based cardiac rehabilitation exercise programs ( exCR) is limited by accessibility barriers. Mobile health ( mHealth) technologies can overcome these barriers while preserving critical attributes of center-based exCR monitoring and coaching, but these opportunities have not yet been capitalized on. Objective: We aimed to design and develop an evidence-and theory-based mHealth platform for remote delivery of exCR to any geographical location. Methods: An iterative process was used to design and develop an evidence-and theory-based mHealth platform ( REMOTE-CR) that provides real-time remote exercise monitoring and coaching, behavior change education, and social support. Results: The REMOTE-CR platform comprises a commercially available smartphone and wearable sensor, custom smartphone and Web-based applications ( apps), and a custom middleware. The platform allows exCR specialists to monitor patients' exercise and provide individualized coaching in real-time, from almost any location, and provide behavior change education and social support. Intervention content incorporates Social Cognitive Theory, Self-determination Theory, and a taxonomy of behavior change techniques. Exercise components are based on guidelines for clinical exercise prescription. Conclusions: The REMOTE-CR platform extends the capabilities of previous telehealth exCR platforms and narrows the gap between existing center-and home-based exCR services. REMOTE-CR can complement center-based exCR by providing an alternative option for patients whose needs are not being met. Remotely monitored exCR may be more cost-effective than establishing additional center-based programs. The effectiveness and acceptability of REMOTE-CR are now being evaluated in a noninferiority randomized controlled trial.;2016;3
"Background: Pathologies that alter the impedance of the middle ear may consequently modify the DPOAE amplitude. The aim of this study was to correlate information from 2 different clinical procedures assessing middle ear status. Data from DPOAE responses (both DP-Gram and DP I/O functions) were correlated with data from multi-component tympanometry at 1000 Hz. Material/Methods: The subjects were divided into a double-peak group (DPG) and a single-peak group (SPG) depending on 1000 Hz tympanogram pattern. Exclusion criteria (described in the Methods section) were applied to both groups and finally only 31 ears were assigned to each group. The subjects were also assessed with traditional tympanometry and behavioral audiometry. Results: Compared to the single-peak group, in terms of the 226 Hz tympanometry data, subjects in the DPG group presented: (i) higher values of ear canal volume; (ii) higher peak pressure, and (iii) significantly higher values of acoustic admittance. DPOAE amplitudes were lower in the DPG group only at 6006 Hz, but the difference in amplitude between the DPG and SPG groups decreased as the frequency increased. Statistical differences were observed only at 1001 Hz and a borderline difference at 1501 Hz. In terms of DPOAE I/O functions, significant differences were observed only in 4 of the 50 tested points. Conclusions: The 1000-Hz tympanometric pattern significantly affects the structure of DPOAE responses only at 1001 Hz. In this context, changes in the properties of the middle ear (as detected by the 1000 Hz tympanometry) can be considered as prime candidates for the observed variability in the DP-grams and the DP I/O functions.";2016;3
"Background: Proximal humerus fractures can be treated surgically (eg: pinning, plate and screws) or conservatively by wearing a splint or a cast. Following both of these approaches, rehabilitation has proven effective to prevent functional limitations and to re-establish normal shoulder function. However, access to these rehabilitation services and compliance tends to be limited in elderly patients due to travelling difficulties caused by their precarious health status and, in some cases, social and marital status. Since the majority of patients with a proximal humerus fracture are elderly, it becomes relevant to find a new way to offer quick, simple and suitable rehabilitation service. Thus, the use of promising alternative approaches, as in-home telerehabilitation, can enhance access to rehabilitation services for such population. The main objective of the study is to compare the clinical effects of the innovative telerehabilitation approach (TELE group) compared to face-to-face visits to a clinic (CLINIC group) for patients treated for a proximal humerus fracture. Methods/Design: In this randomized controlled trial, individuals who have had a proximal humerus fracture treated conservatively at the Centre integre universitaire de sante et de services sociaux de l'Estrie - Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (CIUSSS de l'Estrie CHUS), and who are returning home will be included. Participants will be recruited during their visit to the emergency ward or outpatient clinic by the medical or research team and will then sign the informed consent form if they are interested to participate in the study. We expect to recruit 52 participants (26 per group). Randomization will be done by a random number generator with sealed envelopes. Each patient will be evaluated before the beginning of the rehabilitation (T1), and immediately after the 2-month intervention (T2). The following outcomes will be measured: 1) upper extremity function (Constant Shoulder Score and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire [DASH]); 2) range of motion (conventional goniometer); 3) user satisfaction (Health Care Satisfaction questionnaire); and 4) cost of services to the public healthcare system. The difference between the two groups will be compared using a t-test or a chi-squared test, and through a cost-effectiveness economic analysis. Discussion: We hypothesize that in-home telerehabilitation will provide a good alternative to conventional rehabilitation, in terms of its efficacy, simplicity, patient satisfaction, and low associated costs.";2016;3
Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective intervention for the management of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, available resources are often limited, and many patients bear with poor availability of programmes. Sustaining PR benefits and regular exercise over the long term is difficult without any exercise maintenance strategy. In contrast to traditional centre-based PR programmes, telerehabilitation may promote more effective integration of exercise routines into daily life over the longer term and broaden its applicability and availability. A few studies showed promising results for telerehabilitation, but mostly with short-term interventions. The aim of this study is to compare long-term telerehabilitation with unsupervised exercise training at home and with standard care. Methods/Design: An international multicentre randomised controlled trial conducted across sites in three countries will recruit 120 patients with COPD. Participants will be randomly assigned to telerehabilitation, treadmill and control, and followed up for 2 years. The telerehabilitation intervention consists of individualised exercise training at home on a treadmill, telemonitoring by a physiotherapist via videoconferencing using a tablet computer, and self-management via a customised website. Patients in the treadmill arm are provided with a treadmill only to perform unsupervised exercise training at home. Patients in the control arm are offered standard care. The primary outcome is the combined number of hospitalisations and emergency department presentations. Secondary outcomes include changes in health status, quality of life, anxiety and depression, self-efficacy, subjective impression of change, physical performance, level of physical activity, and personal experiences in telerehabilitation. Discussion: This trial will provide evidence on whether long-term telerehabilitation represents a cost-effective strategy for the follow-up of patients with COPD. The delivery of telerehabilitation services will also broaden the availability of PR and maintenance strategies, especially to those living in remote areas and with no access to centre-based exercise programmes.;2016;3
Background: Systems for range of motion (ROM) measurement such as OptoTrak, Motion Capture, Motion Analysis, Vicon, and Visual 3D are so expensive that they become impracticable in public health systems and even in private rehabilitation clinics. Telerehabilitation is a branch within telemedicine intended to offer ways to increase motor and/or cognitive stimuli, aimed at faster and more effective recovery of given disabilities, and to measure kinematic data such as the improvement in ROM. Materials and Methods: In the development of the RehabGesture tool, we used the gesture recognition sensor Kinect (R) (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and the concepts of Natural User Interface and Open Natural Interaction. Results: RehabGesture can measure and record the ROM during rehabilitation sessions while the user interacts with the virtual reality environment. The software allows the measurement of the ROM (in the coronal plane) from 0 degrees extension to 145 degrees flexion of the elbow joint, as well as from 0 degrees adduction to 180 degrees abduction of the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint, leaving the standing position. The proposed tool has application in the fields of training and physical evaluation of professional and amateur athletes in clubs and gyms and may have application in rehabilitation and physiotherapy clinics for patients with compromised motor abilities. Conclusions: RehabGesture represents a low-cost solution to measure the movement of the upper limbs, as well as to stimulate the process of teaching and learning in disciplines related to the study of human movement, such as kinesiology.;2016;3
"Background: Telemedicine may increase accessibility to pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), thus enhancing long-term exercise maintenance. We aimed to explore COPD patients' adherence and experiences in long-term telerehabilitation to understand factors affecting satisfaction and potential for service improvements. Methods: A two-year pilot study with 10 patients with COPD was conducted. The intervention included treadmill exercise training at home and a webpage for telemonitoring and self-management combined with weekly videoconferencing sessions with a physiotherapist. We conducted four separate series of data collection. Adherence was measured in terms of frequency of registrations on the webpage. Factors affecting satisfaction and adherence, together with potential for service improvements, were explored through two semi-structured focus groups and an individual open-ended questionnaire. Qualitative data were analysed by systematic text condensation. User friendliness was measured by the means of a usability questionnaire. Results: On average, participants registered 3.0 symptom reports/week in a web-based diary and 1.7 training sessions/week. Adherence rate decreased during the second year. Four major themes regarding factors affecting satisfaction, adherence and potential improvements of the intervention emerged: (i) experienced health benefits; (ii) increased self-efficacy and independence; and (iii) emotional safety due to regular meetings and access to special competence; (iv) maintenance of motivation. Participants were generally highly satisfied with the technical components of the telerehabilitation intervention. Conclusions: Long-term adherence to telerehabilitation in COPD was maintained for a two-year period. Satisfaction was supported by experienced health benefits, self-efficacy, and emotional safety. Maintenance of motivation was a challenge and might have affected long-term adherence. Four key factors of potential improvements in long-term telerehabilitation were identified: (i) adherence to different components of the telerehabilitation intervention is dependent on the level of focus provided by the health personnel involved; (ii) the potential for regularity that lies within the technology should be exploited to avoid relapses after vacation; (iii) motivation might be increased by tailoring individual consultations to support experiences of good health and meet individual goals and motivational strategies; (iv) interactive functionalities or gaming tools might provide peer-support, peer-modelling and enhance motivation.";2016;3
Background: Telerehabilitation (TR), or the provision of rehabilitation services from a distance using telecommunication tools such as the Internet, can contribute to ensure that patients receive the best care at the right time. This study aims to assess the effect of an interactive virtual reality (VR) system that allows ongoing rehabilitation of the upper extremity (UE) following a stroke, while the person is in their own home, with offline monitoring and feedback from a therapist at a distance. Methods/design: A single-blind (evaluator is blind to group assignment) two-arm randomized controlled trial is proposed, with participants who have had a stroke and are no longer receiving rehabilitation services randomly allocated to: (1) 4-week written home exercise program, i.e. usual care discharge home program or (2) a 4-week home-based TR exercise program using VR in addition to usual care i.e. treatment group. Motor recovery of the UE will be assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-LIE and the Box and Block tests. To determine the efficacy of the system in terms of functional recovery, the Motor Activity Log, a self-reported measure of UE use will be used. Impact on quality of life will be determined using the Stroke Impact Scale-16. Lastly, a preliminary costeffectiveness analysis will be conducted using costs and outcomes for all groups. Discussion: Findings will contribute to evidence regarding the use of TR and VR to provide stroke rehabilitation services from a distance. This approach can enhance continuity of care once patients are discharged from rehabilitation, in order to maximize their recovery beyond the current available services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Background: The accessibility for total joint arthroplasty often comes up against long wait lists, and may lead to deleterious effects for the awaiting patients. This pilot single blind randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the impact of a telerehabilitation prehabilitation program before a hip or knee arthroplasty compared to in-person prehabilitation or to usual wait for surgery. Methods/design: Thirty-six patients on a wait list for a total hip or knee arthroplasty will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups. The in-person prehabilitation group (n = 12) will receive a 12week rehabilitation program (2 sessions/week) including education, exercises of the lower limb and cardiovascular training. Patients in the tele-prehabilitation group (n = 12) will receive the same intervention using a telecommunication software. The control group (n = 12) will be provided with the hospital's usual documentation before surgery. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) will be the primary outcome measure taken at baseline and at 12 weeks. Secondary measures will include selfreported function and quality of life as well as performance tests. A mixed-model, 2-way repeatedmeasure ANOVA will be used to analyse the effects of the rehabilitation programs. Discussion: This pilot study is the first to evaluate the feasibility and the impact of a telerehabilitation prehabilitation program for patients awaiting a total joint arthroplasty. The results of this pilot-RCT will set the foundations for further research in the fields of rehabilitation and tele-medicine for patients suffering from lower limb osteoarthritis.

BACKGROUND: The chronicity status of breast cancer survivors suggests a growing need for cancer rehabilitation. Currently, the use of technology is a promising strategy for providing support, as reflected in the emergence of research interest in Web-based interventions in cancer survivorship. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted that included a total of 81 participants who had completed adjuvant therapy (except hormone treatment) for stage I to IIIA breast cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to an 8-week Internet-based, tailored exercise program (n = 40) or to a control group (n = 41). The instruments used at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6-month follow-up were the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 and its breast cancer module, the Brief Pain Inventory, the handgrip dynamometer, the isometric abdominal test, the back dynamometer, the multiple sit-to-stand test, and the Piper Fatigue Scale. RESULTS: After the intervention, the telerehabilitation group had significantly improved scores for global health status, physical, role, cognitive functioning, and arm symptoms (all P<.01) as well as pain severity (P=.001) and pain interference (P=.045) compared with the control group. Significant improvements also were observed favoring the telerehabilitation group for affected and nonaffected side handgrip (both P=.006), abdominal, back and lower body strength (all P<.01), and total fatigue (P<.001). These findings were maintained after 6 months of follow-up, except for role functioning, pain severity, and nonaffected side handgrip. Analysis was based on an intention-to-treat principle. CONCLUSIONS: This program may improve adverse effects and maintain benefits in breast cancer survivors. The results of this study have encouraging implications for cancer care.

Background: The efficacy of telerehabilitation-based treatment for anomia has been demonstrated in post-stroke aphasia, but the efficacy of this method of anomia treatment delivery has not been established within the context of degenerative illness.Aims: The current study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of a telerehabilitation-based approach to anomia treatment within the three subtypes of primary progressive aphasia (PPA).Methods & Procedures: Each of the three telerehabilitation participants represented a distinct subtype of PPA. Following a baseline evaluation of language and cognition, a phonological treatment and an orthographic treatment were administered to all participants over the course of 6 months. One month after the end of treatment, a post-treatment evaluation began. All treatment sessions and the majority of the evaluation sessions were administered via telerehabilitation. Treatment effects were examined within each subject, and treatment effects were also compared between each telerehabilitation participant and a group of in-person participants who had the same subtype of PPA.Outcomes & Results: All three telerehabilitation participants exhibited positive treatment effects. CGR (nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA) and WCH (logopenic variant PPA) showed maintenance of naming for prophylaxis items under both treatment conditions, while ACR (semantic variant PPA) demonstrated increased naming of remediation items under the phonological treatment condition. Compared to in-person participants with the same subtype of PPA, each of the telerehabilitation participants typically showed effects that were either within the expected range or larger than expected.Conclusions: Telerehabilitation-based anomia treatment is feasible and effective in all three subtypes of PPA.;2016;3
Background: The rehabilitation after wrist surgery is extremely important. An instructed therapy in hospital is widely practiced. However, a dependent aging society and rush life style in younger generation have precluded patients to access to the frequent formal therapy. With the advancement in telecommunication technology, we have invented an application for smartphone for home-based wrist motion rehabilitation. Methods: Twenty participants were included in four-week wrist motion rehabilitation programme after wrist surgery. Participants were instructed to use the application by physical therapist and informed details of home-based wrist rehabilitation. The feasibility of application was evaluated by satisfaction level in various aspects and the adherence to the therapy was monitored by function provided in the application. The degrees of motion were compared at the end of prescribed programme. Results: Patient satisfaction was consistently high in every aspects. Also, the adherence to the therapy was high (90.42%). Ranges of motion significantly gained in every plane of wrist motion (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This novel smartphone application seems to be a promising and convenient alternative for patients who need to gain wrist motion without formal rehabilitation in the hospital. Adherence to the therapy is also easily traced with this application.;2016;3
"Background: Uptake of e-health, the use of information communication technologies (ICT) for health service delivery, in allied health appears to be lagging behind other health care areas, despite offering the potential to address problems with service access by rural and remote Australians. The aim of the study was to conduct a scoping review of studies into the application of or attitudes towards ehealth amongst allied health professionals conducted in Australia. Methods: Studies meeting inclusion criteria published from January 2004 to June 2015 were reviewed. Professions included were audiology, dietetics, exercise physiology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, podiatry, social work, and speech pathology. Terms for these professions and forms of ehealth were combined in databases of CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO (1806 - Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid) and AMED (Ovid). Results: Forty-four studies meeting inclusion criteria were summarised. They were either trials of aspects of ehealth service delivery, or clinician and/or client use of and attitudes towards ehealth. Trials of ehealth were largely from two research groups located at the Universities of Sydney and Queensland; most involved speech pathology and physiotherapy. Assessments through ehealth and intervention outcomes through ehealth were comparable with face-to-face delivery. Clinicians used ICT mostly for managing their work and for professional development, but were reticent about its use in service delivery, which contrasted with the more positive attitudes and experiences of clients. Conclusion: The potential of ehealth to address allied health needs of Australians living in rural and remote Australia appears unrealised. Clinicians may need to embrace ehealth as a means to radicalise practice, rather than replicate existing practices through a different mode of delivery.";2016;3
"Background: Virtual reality (VR) based applications play an increasing role in motor rehabilitation. They provide an interactive and individualized environment in addition to increased motivation during motor tasks as well as facilitating motor learning through multimodal sensory information. Several previous studies have shown positive effect of VR-based treatments for lower extremity motor rehabilitation in neurological conditions, but the characteristics of these VR applications have not been systematically investigated. The visual information on the user's movement in the virtual environment, also called movement visualisation (MV), is a key element of VR-based rehabilitation interventions. The present review proposes categorization of Movement Visualisations of VR-based rehabilitation therapy for neurological conditions and also summarises current research in lower limb application. Methods: A systematic search of literature on VR-based intervention for gait and balance rehabilitation in neurological conditions was performed in the databases namely; MEDLINE (Ovid), AMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycInfo. Studies using non-virtual environments or applications to improve cognitive function, activities of daily living, or psychotherapy were excluded. The VR interventions of the included studies were analysed on their MV. Results: In total 43 publications were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Seven distinct MV groups could be differentiated: indirect MV (N = 13), abstract MV (N = 11), augmented reality MV (N = 9), avatar MV (N = 5), tracking MV (N = 4), combined MV (N = 1), and no MV (N = 2). In two included articles the visualisation conditions included different MV groups within the same study. Additionally, differences in motor performance could not be analysed because of the differences in the study design. Three studies investigated different visualisations within the same MV group and hence limited information can be extracted from one study. Conclusions: The review demonstrates that individuals' movements during VR-based motor training can be displayed in different ways. Future studies are necessary to fundamentally explore the nature of this VR information and its effect on motor outcome.";2016;3
Background: Visuo-spatial neglect predicts longer hospitalization, poorer recovery of motor skills and greater functional limitation. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether the combined administration of computerized cognitive rehabilitation with right hemifield eye-patching in patients with left spatial neglect following a right hemisphere stroke is more effective than computerized cognitive rehabilitation applied in isolation. Method: Randomized clinical trial conducted in 28 patients. These were grouped into two experimental groups: single treatment group (ST) (n = 15) and combined treatment group (CT) (n = 13). All received an average of 15 one-hour sessions of computerized cognitive rehabilitation using the Guttmann, NeuroPersonalTrainer((R)) telerehabilitation platform. Those patients in the TC group performed the sessions wearing a visual device with which the right hemifield of each eye was occluded. Results: Following treatment, both the ST and the TC group showed improvements in neuropsychological examination protocol although there were no differences pre- and post-treatment on the functional scale in either group. Likewise, no statistically significant differences were observed in intergroup comparison. Conclusions: The results from this study indicate that combination treatment is not more effective than rehabilitation applied in isolation.;2016;3
Background: Walking represents a large part of daily physical activity. It reduces both overall and cardiovascular diseases and mortality and is suitable for cardiac patients. A step counter measures walking activity and might be a motivational tool to increase and maintain physical activity. There is a lack of knowledge about both cardiac patients' adherence to step counter use in a cardiac telerehabilitation program and how many steps cardiac patients walk up to 1 year after a cardiac event. Objective: The purpose of this substudy was to explore cardiac patients' walking activity. The walking activity was analyzed in relation to duration of pedometer use to determine correlations between walking activity, demographics, and medical and rehabilitation data. Methods: A total of 64 patients from a randomized controlled telerehabilitation trial (Teledi@log) from Aalborg University Hospital and Hjoerring Hospital, Denmark, from December 2012 to March 2014 were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery. In Teledi@log, the patients received telerehabilitation technology and selected one of three telerehabilitation settings: a call center, a community health care center, or a hospital. Monitoring of steps continued for 12 months and a step counter (Fitbit Zip) was used to monitor daily steps. Results: Cardiac patients walked a mean 5899 (SD 3274) steps per day, increasing from mean 5191 (SD 3198) steps per day in the first week to mean 7890 (SD 2629) steps per day after 1 year. Adherence to step counter use lasted for a mean 160 (SD 100) days. The patients who walked significantly more were younger (P=. 01) and continued to use the pedometer for a longer period (P=. 04). Furthermore, less physically active patients weighed more. There were no significant differences in mean steps per day for patients in the three rehabilitation settings or in the disease groups. Conclusions: This study indicates that cardiac telerehabilitation at a call center can support walking activity just as effectively as telerehabilitation at either a hospital or a health care center. In this study, the patients tended to walk fewer steps per day than cardiac patients in comparable studies, but our study may represent a more realistic picture of walking activity due to the continuation of step counter use. Qualitative studies on patients' behavior and motivation regarding step counter use are needed to shed light on adherence to and motivation to use step counters.;2016;3
Background:Neuropsychological testing is a central aspect of stroke research because it provides critical information about the cognitive-behavioral status of stroke survivors, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of stroke-related disorders. Standard neuropsychological methods rely upon face-to-face interactions between a patient and researcher, which creates geographic and logistical barriers that impede research progress and treatment advances.Introduction:To overcome these barriers, we created a flexible and integrated system for the remote acquisition of neuropsychological data (RAND). The system we developed has a secure architecture that permits collaborative videoconferencing. The system supports shared audiovisual feeds that can provide continuous virtual interaction between a participant and researcher throughout a testing session. Shared presentation and computing controls can be used to deliver auditory and visual test items adapted from standard face-to-face materials or execute computer-based assessments. Spoken and manual responses can be acquired, and the components of the session can be recorded for offline data analysis.Materials and Methods:To evaluate its feasibility, our RAND system was used to administer a speech-language test battery to 16 stroke survivors with a variety of communication, sensory, and motor impairments. The sessions were initiated virtually without prior face-to-face instruction in the RAND technology or test battery.Results:Neuropsychological data were successfully acquired from all participants, including those with limited technology experience, and those with a communication, sensory, or motor impairment. Furthermore, participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the RAND system and the remote assessment that it permits.Conclusions:The results indicate the feasibility of using the RAND system for virtual home-based neuropsychological assessment without prior face-to-face contact between a participant and researcher. Because our RAND system architecture uses off-the-shelf technology and software, it can be duplicated without specialized expertise or equipment. In sum, our RAND system offers a readily available and promising alternative to face-to-face neuropsychological assessment in stroke research.;2016;3
Cerebral palsy is a severe condition usually caused by decreased brain oxygenation during pregnancy, at birth or soon after birth. Conventional treatments for cerebral palsy are often tiresome and expensive, leading patients to quit treatment. In this paper, we describe a virtual environment for patients to engage in a playful therapeutic game for neuropsychomotor rehabilitation, based on the experience of the occupational therapy program of the Nucleus for Integrated Medical Assistance (NAMI) at the University of Fortaleza, Brazil. Integration between patient and virtual environment occurs through the hand motion sensor Leap Motion, plus the electroencephalographic sensor MindWave, responsible for measuring attention levels during task execution. To evaluate the virtual environment, eight clinical experts on cerebral palsy were subjected to a questionnaire regarding the potential of the experimental virtual environment to promote cognitive and motor rehabilitation, as well as the potential of the treatment to enhance risks and/or negatively influence the patient's development. Based on the very positive appraisal of the experts, we propose that the experimental virtual environment is a promising alternative tool for the rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy.;2016;3
Conventional center-based cardiac rehabilitation adherence is poor, adversely affecting long-term efficacy. Innovative strategies such as telerehabilitation are perceived as promising alternatives to improve care delivery. This paper presents the results of prior and ongoing work on the design and development of MobileHeart, a telemedical smartphone-based application to be used in secondary prevention for ischemic heart disease patients. Its constituent components are discussed separately, the minimal necessary cardiovascular monitoring requirements are elaborated in more detail. The results are offered starting from a clinical perspective to stress its relevance in the establishment of scientifically/medically sound programs.;2016;3
Current gait analysis systems are expensive and require large space with well controlled environments, which limits the measurement to laboratory settings such as ViCON motion analysis system. An economical alternative method of gait analysis system is proposed, in which MATLAB Kinect Skeletal Tracking System (MKSTS) is developed using MATLAB programming software and Microsoft Kinect Sensor to accumulate the important gait parameters based on the pixel coordinates of the body joints which requires no markers. The validity of MKSTS as an alternative method in determining the gait parameters is investigated and compared to ViCON motion analysis system. A healthy participant walked along the Kistler force plate with her lower limb kinematics data are measured by ViCON motion analysis system and MKSTS concurrently. Gait parameters of right hip and right knee joint angles were extracted from both devices and compared graphically in a period of one complete gait cycle. The results indicated that the correlation coefficients of MKSTS were 0.996 for right hip angles and 0.987 for right knee angles compared to ViCON motion analysis system as reference measurement. Therefore, MKSTS is able to measure the gait parameters, though there was a substantial error in accuracy. As a conclusion, the result of the research suggests that MKSTS is valid to be used as an alternative method in determining the gait parameters, depending on the required accuracy level. MKSTS will then further developed to be implemented into telerehabilitation system.;2016;3
Current telehealth usability questionnaires are designed primarily for older technologies, where telehealth interaction is conducted over dedicated videoconferencing applications. However, telehealth services are increasingly conducted over computer-based systems that rely on commercial software and a user supplied computer interface. Therefore, a usability questionnaire that addresses the changes in telehealth service delivery and technology is needed. The Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) was developed to evaluate the usability of telehealth implementation and services. This paper addresses: (1) the need for a new measure of telehealth usability, (2) the development of the TUQ, (3) intended uses for the TUQ, and (4) the reliability of the TUQ. Analyses indicate that the TUQ is a solid, robust, and versatile measure that can be used to measure the quality of the computer-based user interface and the quality of the telehealth interaction and services.;2016;3
Delivering aphasia therapy via telecommunication may provide a means to deliver intensive therapy in a cost-effective way. Teletherapy, remotely-administered (language) treatment, may support the repetitive drill practices that people with chronic aphasia need to perform when learning to compensate for their lasting language difficulties. The use of teletherapy may allow speech and language pathologists (SLPs) to focus in-person sessions more strongly on the generalisation of therapy effects to daily life. This single subject study is an investigation whether a teletherapy application called e-REST meets the criteria of accessibility, user-friendliness, as well as effectiveness. e-REST, the teletherapy version of the Dutch and adapted Reduced Syntax Therapy, teaches chronically aphasic speakers of Dutch who experience difficulties in sentence production to convey their messages in a kind of telegraphic style. The results obtained suggest that it is reasonable to conduct a larger study into the user-friendliness, accessibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of e-REST.;2016;3
"Demographic changes, progress in medicine technology and regional problems in providing healthcare to low density populations are posing great challenges to our healthcare systems. Rapid progress in computer sciences and information technologies have a great impact on the way healthcare will be delivered in the near future. This article describes opportunities and challenges of eHealth and telemedicine in the framework of our health systems and, in particular, in the context of today's cardiology services. The most promising applications of eHealth and telemedicine include: (a) prevention and lifestyle interventions; (b) chronic disease management including hypertension, diabetes and heart failure; (c) arrhythmia detection including early detection of atrial fibrillation and telemonitoring of devices such as pacemaker, internal cardioverter defibrillators and implantable rhythm monitoring devices; (d) telerehabilitation. Major obstacles to the integration of eHealth and telemedicine into daily clinical practice include limited large-scale evidence, in particular, for cost-effectiveness, as well as lack of interoperability, inadequate or fragmented legal frameworks and lack of reimbursement. An important challenge for those involved in these new technologies will be to keep the main focus on patient's individual needs and to carefully evaluate the evidence behind the practice.";2016;3
Disabled community spending a miserable life and having no or very less access to basic health and rehabilitation care across Pakistan. WHO developed objectives for the provision of standard health and rehabilitation care to disables and emphasizes to achieve them till 2021. The Purpose of this study was to assess the future of tele-rehabilitation services in Pakistan. It was quantitative study with Sample size of 100 rehabilitation professionals across the country. Result showed that Telerehabilitation Services are strongly needed in Pakistan and professionals rated it as a best alternate of facility based rehabilitation services. We can provide a wide range of services through Telerehabilitation Services ranging from simple consultation to delivery of different therapeutic sessions and online monitoring.;2016;3
Due to their relative ease of handling and low-cost, inertial measurement unit (IMU) based joint angle measurements are used for a widespread range of applications. These include sports performance, gait analysis and rehabilitation (e.g. Parkinson's disease monitoring or post-stroke assessment). However, a major downside of current algorithms recomposing human kinematics from IMU data is that they require calibration motions and/or the careful alignment of the IMUs respective to their body segment. In this article, we propose a new method, which is alignment free and self-calibrated using the arbitrary movements of the user and an initial zero reference arm pose. The proposed method utilizes real time optimization to identify the two dominant axes of rotation of the elbow joint. Using a two degree of freedom joint mimicking the human elbow, the performance of the algorithm was assessed by comparing the angles obtained from two IMUs to the ones obtained from a marker-based optical tracking system. The self-calibration proved to converge within seconds and the RMS errors with respect to the optical reference system were below 5 degrees. Our method can be particularly useful in the field of telerehabilitation, where precise manual sensor to segment alignment as well as precise, predefined calibration movements are impractical.;2016;3
Electrolytic disorders of the inner ear represent a model that could be implicated in partially explaining the pathogenesis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). Different types of electrolytes and different inner-ear loci are involved in cochlear homeostasis physiologically, to ensure the maintenance of an ion-balanced cochlear environment allowing a normal hair cell function. It has been hypothesized that a sudden loss of endocochlear potential, due to a rapid disruption of the inner ear fluid osmolality, could be responsible for a deterioration of the hearing function caused by damaged hair cells. The aim of this paper was to review the current literature and identify sources which might validate/fortify the hypothesis that inner ear electrolytic disorders have a role in the etiopathogenesis of SSNHL. The data in the literature underline the importance of ionic homeostasis in the inner ear, but they do not support a direct link between SSNHL and electrolyte disorders/imbalances. There is marginal evidence from otoacoustic emissions research that an indirect link might be present.;2016;3
Exercise training (ET) is suggested to improve exercise capacity, prognosis, quality of life (QOL) and functional modifications of the heart in patients with heart failure (HF). However, it is not clear which modality is best. In order to assess the effectiveness of different ET modalities on prognostic cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) parameters, QOL and left ventricular remodeling, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were selected in three databases. The primary outcome data were peak oxygen uptake, ventilation over carbon dioxide slope, oxygen uptake efficiency slope, exercise oscillatory ventilation, rest and peak pulmonary end-tidal CO2. Secondary variables were QOL, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD). Twenty RCTs (n = 811) met the a priori stated inclusion criteria. Studies were categorized into four different groups: interval training (IT1) versus combined interval and strength training (IT1S) (n = 156), continuous training (CT1) versus combined continuous and strength training (CT1S) (n = 130), interval training (IT2) versus continuous training (CT2) (n = 501) and  continuous training (CT3) versus strength training (S-3) (n = 24). No significant random effects of exercise modality were revealed assessing the CPET parameters. There was a significant improvement in QOL applying CT1S (P < 0.001). Comparing IT2 with CT2, LVEDD and LVEF were significantly improved favoring IT2 (P < 0.001). There is some evidence to support that interval training is more effective to improve LVEF and LVEDD. The fact that patients with HF are actively involved in any kind of ET program seems sufficient to improve the prognosis, QOL and anatomic function. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the last few years, telerehabilitation and telecare have become important topics in healthcare since they enable people to remain independent in their own homes by providing person-centered technologies to support the individual. These technologies allows elderly people to be assisted in their home, instead of traveling to a clinic, providing them wellbeing and personalized health care. The literature shows a great number of interesting proposals to address telerehabilitation and telecare scenarios, which may be mainly categorized into two broad groups, namely wearable devices and context-aware systems. However, we believe that these apparently different scenarios may be addressed by a single context-aware approach, concretely a vision-based system that can operate automatically in a non-intrusive way for the elderly, and this is the goal of this paper. We present a general approach based on 3D cameras and neural network algorithms that offers an efficient solution for two different scenarios of telerehabilitation and telecare for elderly people. Our empirical analysis reveals the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithms presented in our approach and provides more than promising results when the neural network parameters are properly adjusted.;2016;3
In this paper, a novel one-therapist to three-patient telerehabilitation robot system is developed, which consists of a web-based server computer for therapist at hospital, three telerehabilitation robots for patients at home or in nursing home, three client computers for robot control, and computer networks connect the client computers to the server computer. A kind of light, back-drivable and safe one degree-of-freedom rehabilitation robot with low cost is designed, and a safe control strategy which is combination of PI control and damping control is proposed for the robot control. Through this telerehabilitation robot system, a therapist can dialogue with post-stroke patients in video communication via the networks, and then he can remotely set or modify the training mode and control parameters of the rehabilitation robots for post-stroke patient training. Haptic based therapy game is also programmed to improve the activity of the patients during training process. Integrated with database management, the history and current performance data of patients acquired by all sensors of the telerehabilitation robot system during the training process are stored and managed. Three volunteer individual patients with upper limb disabilities participated in this study. After four weeks of periodic rehabilitation training with the telerehabilitation robot system, the muscle strength and movement coordination of the three patients had been obviously improved. Our study shows that the one-therapist to three-patient telerehabilitation robot system has good reliability and is able to greatly improve efficiency of the rehabilitation training, which can solve the problem of lack of therapist to a certain extent.;2016;3
In this paper, we conduct analysis on the current condition of virtual reality and the computer graphics and the applications on the digital media interaction. We proposed the systematic review of the digital media interaction modes with the theoretical analysis of the virtual reality and computer graphics. Multimedia gateway is a separate control of the entire media interaction center core components, has the media docking and adaptation, multimedia intelligent routing, configuration and management, and other functions and at the center of the centralized control of all media interaction, the configuration and management of multimedia intelligent routing. With this basis, we integrate the 3D reconstruction methodology to propose the new perspective of the digital media interaction paradigm. The man-machine interface design principles should include the basic principles of general interface design, analysis and man-machine interface specification and the type of interface requirements. Our review summarizes the characteristics of the method well and in the future, the VR integration with the multimedia system and optimized re-construction method and image representation algorithms will be considered.;2016;3
Increased demand for in-home rehabilitation services for older adults may be met through telerehabilitation information and communication technologies. The current article reports the results of an integrative literature review summarizing current in-home telerehabilitation research with older adults. Nine studies from 2006-2015 are included. Six studies employed a remote therapist using real-time video. Three studies used text-or web-based messaging and electronic surveys. Six studies relied on dial-up Internet service and the remaining three studies used broadband Internet connections. Future research should address (a) in-home and wearable sensing technologies to monitor health and (b) mobile devices, such as tablet computers, to collect patient self-reports. Interoperable platforms are needed to integrate disparate devices and support continuity of care across post-acute care settings.;2016;3
Information and communication technology, particularly multimedia technology and the Internet, are commonly employed in the assessment, treatment and education of speech-language and communication disorders. Considering that video artefacts supplement or replace the speech therapist and can be used in both synchronous and asynchronous settings, they represent an important part of an online therapy. This paper presents a part of an ongoing research regarding the use of video in speech-language online therapy. The aim of the paper is threefold. First, we describe how video artefacts have been designed in accordance with the principles of multimedia learning and subsequently employed in telerehabilitation of pediatric speech disorder (dyslalia). Second, we introduce a set of quality attributes which significantly affect the success of the implementation of educational video artefacts in speech-language pathology (SLP) online therapies. Finally, we present and discuss the results of a pilot study carried out with an objective to examine the perceived quality of educational video artefacts applied in SLP telerehabilitation.;2016;3
Internet of Things (IoT) applied in healthcare system has a huge potential to improve patients' quality of life. Representing network of devices embedded with electronics and sensors, IoT enables constant monitoring of vital body functions, tracking of physical activities of a person and aids rehab physical therapy. Such an IoT-based system would allow standalone recovery process, minimizing the need for dedicated medical personnel and could be used in both hospital and home conditions. In this paper, we present a telerehabilitation system that uses wearable muscle sensor and Microsoft Kinect to create interactive personalized physical therapy that can be carried out at home. Early experiments and results of pilot implementation validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed IoT-enabled telerehabilitation system.;2016;3
Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease in which the insulating cover of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. The methods used for motor rehabilitation of patients with neurological problems require the performance of several rehabilitation exercises. Recently, studies related to the use of video game consoles have proliferated in the field of motor rehabilitation. Virtual reality (VR) has been proposed as a potentially useful tool for motoring assessment and rehabilitation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the results shown in previous studies on Multiple Sclerosis and Virtual Reality. Method: A bibliographic review was performed without time limitations. The research was carried out using PubMed and BVS databases. Considering keywords, we included articles that showed the terms Multiple Sclerosis and Virtual Reality. The review was according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines Results: The initial search yielded 41 articles. After the duplicates were removed, two authors independently evaluated the title and abstract of each of the articles with the study inclusion criteria. From these, 31 articles were excluded based on the title and abstract. Finally, 10 articles were isolated that met the inclusion criteria. Conclusion: VR represents a motivational and effective alternative to traditional motor rehabilitation for MS patients. The results showed that VR programs could be an effective method of patients with MS rehabilitation in multiple cognitive and / or motor deficits. Additional research is needed to support the rehabilitation protocols with VR and increase the effects of treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2016;3
Introduction: The rapid development of sensors and communication technologies enable the growth of new innovative services in healthcare, such as Telemedicine. An essential ingredient in the development of a telemedicine system and its final acceptance by end users are usability studies. The principles of usability engineering, evaluations and telemedicine are well established, and it may contribute to the adoption and eventually deployment of such systems and services. An in-depth usability analysis, including performance and attitude measures, requires knowledge about available usability techniques, and is depending on the amount of resources. Therefore it is worth investigating how usability methods are applied in developing telemedicine systems. Our hypothesis is: with increasing research and development of telemedicine systems, we expect that various usability methods are more equally employed for different end-user groups and applications. Method: A literature survey was conducted to find telemedicine systems that have been evaluated for usability or ease of use. The elements of the PICO framework were used as a basis for the selection criteria in the literature search. The search was not limited by year. Two independent reviewers screened all search results first by title, and then by abstract for inclusion. Articles were included up to May 2015. Results: In total, 127 publications were included in this survey. The number of publications on telemedicine systems significantly increased after 2008. Older adults and end-users with cardiovascular conditions were among largest target end-user groups. Remote monitoring systems were found the most, in 90 publications. Questionnaires are the most common means for evaluating telemedicine systems, and were found in 88 publications. Questionnaires are used frequently in studies focusing on cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease and older adult conditions. Interviews are found the most in publications related to stroke. In total 71% of the publications were trial-orientated and the remaining process orientated. An increase in telemedicine research, development and applications is found worldwide, with the majority of publications conducted in America. Discussion and conclusion: Monitoring patients in their homes can lead to better healthcare at lower costs which implies an increased demand of new healthcare strategies like telemedicine. We expected that with the increase in telemedicine research and development, a greater range of usability methods would also be employed in the included publications. This is not the case. Researchers employed questionnaires as a preferred usability method for each type of telemedicine system and most end-users. However, in process-orientated studies a greater range of usability evaluations were applied, with fewer differences found in the amount of publications for each evaluation method. Questionnaires enable researchers to evaluate a system quickly on end users, as it requires less expertise on the evaluation method compared to the other methods. They are easily distributed and are customizable. The use of questionnaires is therefore an evaluation method of choice for a variety of telemedicine systems and end-users.

Laboratory-based nonwearable motion analysis systems have significantly advanced with robust objective measurement of the limb motion, resulting in quantified, standardized, and reliable outcome measures compared with traditional, semisubjective, observational gait analysis. However, the requirement for large laboratory space and operational expertise makes these systems impractical for gait analysis at local clinics and homes. In this paper, we focus on autonomous gait event detection with our bespoke, relatively inexpensive, and portable, single-camera gait kinematics analysis system. Our proposed system includes video acquisition with camera calibration, Kalman filter + Structural-Similarity-based marker tracking, autonomous knee angle calculation, video-frame-identification-based autonomous gait event detection, and result visualization. The only operational effort required is the marker-template selection for tracking initialization, aided by an easy-to-use graphic user interface. The knee angle validation on 10 stroke patients and 5 healthy volunteers against a gold standard optical motion analysis system indicates very good agreement. The autonomous gait event detection shows high detection rates for all gait events. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can automatically measure the knee angle and detect gait events with good accuracy and thus offer an alternative, cost-effective, and convenient solution for clinical gait kinematics analysis.;2016;3
Objective To propose and evaluate the effectiveness of a telerehabilitation platform designed for patients with rotator cuff (RC) tears. Methods During the first study phase, a virtual service platform that included information on RC tear pathology, joint care, and a series of instructions regarding therapeutic exercise was designed and created. Subsequently, in the clinical phase, a quasi-experimental study was performed. The platform was tested on patients and evaluated at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months with respect to their pain levels and functionality on the Constant-Murley (CM) scale. Results Eleven patients were included, 5 women and 6 men, with a median age of 55 years (range, 42-68 years). Pain diminished from a baseline value of 64 mm (range, 40-80 mm) to 16 mm (range, 0-30 mm) at 6 months (p<0.001). Points on the CM scale rose from a baseline value of 54 points (range, 51-66 points) to 85 points (range, 70-100 points) at 6 months (p=0.001). Functionality in daily living and work activities, movement, and strength exhibited significant changes at 6 months (p<0.05). Conclusion Significant changes were observed in pain and functionality in this group of participants who used a telerehabilitation platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that included a specific program for RC tears.;2016;3
"Objective. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a high-speed telemonitoring project for older people with chronic disease in a regional Australian town. Participants' vital signs were monitored and triaged daily by a telehealth nurse. Methods. A prospective, uncontrolled study design evaluated the effect of home-based telemonitoring on older people with chronic disease. Evaluation included surveys (including the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy tool and the Self-Rated Health Questionnaire), self-reported health service use and interviews and focus groups exploring client experiences. Results. Participants reported an improved understanding of their vital signs monitoring (48%) and consequently better self-management of health (48%) and that they were better informed (44%) and more confident (25%) to discuss health with their doctor. Patients also reported making medication changes (17%), positive dietary changes (34%) and increasing their physical activity (33%). Overall, patients' self-rated general health improved (mean (+/- s.d.) improvement 0.30 +/- 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.45; 118 d.f.; P < 0.001), with more participants reporting that their health is 'excellent' or 'very good' at the end of the trial. Patients also reported fewer doctor visits (P < 0.001), fewer visits to the local hospital emergency department (P = 0.021) and fewer non-local hospital admissions (P < 0.001) compared with the preceding year. There was no significant reduction in local hospital admissions (P = 0.171). Conclusions. The findings of the present study suggest that telemonitoring with videoconferencing empowers older people to better understand and manage their own health, and is associated with improved health outcomes and reduced service use. Having regular, daily access to a Telehealth nurse reassured participants, and triggered changes to services and behaviour that are likely to have positively affected patient outcomes.";2016;3
Objective: The aim of this article is to describe the development and testing of a prototype application (The Heart Game) using gamification principles to assist heart patients in their telerehabilitation process in the Teledialog project. Materials and Methods: A prototype game was developed via user-driven innovation and tested on 10 patients 48-89 years of age and their relatives for a period of 2 weeks. The application consisted of a series of daily challenges given to the patients and relatives and was based on several gamification principles. A triangulation of data collection techniques (interviews, participant observations, focus group interviews, and workshop) was used. Interviews with three healthcare professionals and 10 patients were carried out over a period of 2 weeks in order to evaluate the use of the prototype. Results: The heart patients reported the application to be a useful tool as a part of their telerehabilitation process in everyday life. Gamification and gameful design principles such as leaderboards, relationships, and achievements engaged the patients and relatives. The inclusion of a close relative in the game motivated the patients to perform rehabilitation activities. Conclusions: The Heart Game concept presents a new way to motivate heart patients by using technology as a social and active approach to telerehabilitation. The findings show the potential of using gamification for heart patients as part of a telerehabilitation program. The evaluation indicated that the inclusion of the patient's spouse in the rehabilitation activities could be an effective strategy. A major challenge in using gamification for heart patients is avoiding a sense of defeat while still adjusting the level of difficulty to the individual patient.;2016;3
Objective: To determine feasibility of using the interactive Mobile Health and Rehabilitation (iMHere) system in spina bifida and its effects on psychosocial and medical outcomes. Design: In a randomized controlled trial, 13 intervention participants using the iMHere system and receiving usual care and 10 control participants receiving usual care were followed for 1 year. Results: Feasibility of use of the system was demonstrated by participants using a customized smartphone system for reminders to conduct various self-care tasks, upload photos of wounds, manage medications, complete mood surveys, and for secure messaging. High usage of the system was associated with positive changes in the subscales of the Adolescent Self-Management and Independence Scale II. Conclusion: Use of the iMHere system in spina bifida is feasible and was associated with short-term self-reported improvements in self-management skill. This system holds promise for use in many diverse chronic care models to support and increase self-management skills.;2016;3
"Objective: To test the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial comparing face to face and remotely delivered word finding therapy for people with aphasia. Design: A quasi-randomised controlled feasibility study comparing remote therapy delivered from a University lab, remote therapy delivered from a clinical site, face to face therapy and an attention control condition. Setting: A University lab and NHS outpatient service. Participants: Twenty-one people with aphasia following left hemisphere stroke. Interventions: Eight sessions of word finding therapy, delivered either face to face or remotely, were compared to an attention control condition comprising eight sessions of remotely delivered supported conversation. The remote conditions used mainstream video conferencing technology. Outcome measures: Feasibility was assessed by recruitment and attrition rates, participant observations and interviews, and treatment fidelity checking. Effects of therapy on word retrieval were assessed by tests of picture naming and naming in conversation. Results: Twenty-one participants were recruited over 17 months, with one lost at baseline. Compliance and satisfaction with the intervention was good. Treatment fidelity was high for both remote and face to face delivery (1251/1421 therapist behaviours were compliant with the protocol). Participants who received therapy improved on picture naming significantly more than controls (mean numerical gains: 20.2 (remote from University); 41 (remote from clinical site); 30.8 (face to face); 5.8 (attention control); P <.001). There were no significant differences between groups in the assessment of conversation. Conclusions: Word finding therapy can be delivered via mainstream internet video conferencing. Therapy improved picture naming, but not naming in conversation.";2016;3
"Objectives To assess cost-effectiveness and cost utility of telerehabilitation (TR) versus standard rehabilitation (SR) after total knee replacement (TKR). Design Markov decision modelling of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis based on patient-level and secondary data sources employing Italian National Health Service (NHS; Ita-NHS) and Society perspectives. Setting Primary care units (PCUs) in Italy. Participants Patients discharged after TKR. Interventions Mixed SR-TR service (10 face-to-face sessions and 10 telesessions) versus SR (20 face-to-face sessions) Primary and secondary outcome measures The incremental cost per additional knee flexion range of motion (ROM) and per QALY gained by SR-TR compared with SR. Second, we considered the probability of being cost-effective and the probability of being more effective and less expensive. Results TR appears to be the cost-effective in the base case and in all of the considered scenarios, but is no longer more effective and less expensive if transportation costs are excluded. Comparing SR-TR with SR, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) adopting the Ita-NHS perspective for the base case was -Euro117/ROM gained. The cost-effectiveness probability for SR-TR was 0.98 (ceiling ratio: Euro50/ROM), while the joint probability of being more effective and less expensive was 0.87. Assuming that TR would increase health-related quality of life (HRQOL) utilities by 2.5%, the ICER adopting Ita-NHS perspective is -Euro960/QALY (cost-effectiveness probability: 1; ceiling ratio: Euro30000/QALY). All the performed sensitivity analyses did not change the conclusions, but if transportation costs were excluded, the probability for SR-TR of being more clinically effective and less expensive reduced to 0.56. Conclusions The analysis suggested SR-TR to be cost-effective, even less expensive and more effective if the PCUs provide ambulance transportations. However, the uncertainty related to TR costs, HRQOL and long-term clinical outcomes raises important topics for future research, which should be addressed to confirm our estimates.

One typical remote consultation envisioned for inhome telerehabilitation involves having the patient exercise on a stationary bike. Making sure that the patient is breathing well while pedaling is of primary concern for the remote clinician. One key requirement for in-home telerehabilitation is to make the system as simple as possible for the patients, avoiding, for instance, to have them wear sensors and devices. This paper presents a contact-free respiration rate monitoring system measuring temperature variations between inspired and expired air in the mouth-nose region using thermal imaging. The thermal camera is installed on a pan-tilt unit and coupled to a tracking algorithm, allowing the system to keep track of the mouth-nose region as the patient exercises. Results demonstrate that the system works in real time even when the patient moves or rotates its head while exercising. Recommendations are also made to minimize limitations of the system, such as the presence of people in the background or when the patient is talking, for its eventual use in in-home telerehabilitation sessions.;2016;3
Over the last few years, the number of remote patient monitoring (RPM) products and of videoconferencing systems has exploded. There is also a significant number of research initiatives addressing the use of service robots for assistance in daily living activities. From a technological standpoint, providing telehomecare services is certainly feasible. However, one technological barrier is to have access to a telecommunication platform that can be adapted to address the broad range of specifications and requirements of clinical and telehealth applications. Handling the full spectrum of possibilities requires a telecommunication framework that can transmit vital sign data from patients to clinicians, bidirectional audio-video from a standard computing device, and also multiple video streams and bidirectional transmission of control data. This paper presents a framework that integrates such capabilities. It also illustrates the versatility of the framework by presenting custom-designed devices allowing integration of capabilities ranging from RPM to video visits and robot telepresence.;2016;3
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition associated with motor, neuropsychological, sensorial, and vocal symptoms. It has been suggested that eventual obstacles faced by many patients to reach speech therapy rehabilitation centers could be overcome with the use of synchronous telerehabilitation (real time) approach employing communication technologies. Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of vocal telerehabilitation in PD patients. Methods: Twenty patients diagnosed with PD and with vocal complaints participated in this study. Patients were evaluated by videoconference (Adobe Connect 8) before and after treatment. Evaluation method consisted of perceptual analysis of vocal quality measured by the GRBASI scale. Treatment was conducted following the extended version of Lee Silverman method (LSVT-X). At the end of treatment all patients were requested to fill a questionnaire to assess their experience with telerehabilitation. Results: Analysis revealed decrease in magnitude of voice quality changes after the intervention, indicating improvement of vocal pattern. All patients reported satisfaction and preference for telerehabilitation compared to face-to-face rehabilitation, as well as positive perception of audio and video. Some technological adversities have been identified but did not prevent the approaches to assessment and treatment. Conclusion: Present results suggest that telerehabilitation methods can be considered as an effective treatment for speech symptoms associated with PD and can be indicated to patients presenting limited access to speech therapy centers and technological readiness.;2016;3
Patients with knee injuries may not return to their pre-injury level if rehabilitation is not effectively conducted. Ineffective rehabilitation can be largely attributed to the fact that few approaches are available to assist patients in achieving goals of home-based rehabilitation, which plays an increasingly important role in modern rehabilitation protocols. In this study, we propose a novel mobile-computing based approach to assist patients in carrying out the home-based rehabilitation. Specifically, the proposed mobile application can control the inertial sensors in a smartphone to collect rehabilitation activity data. By integrating the knee rehabilitation protocol into the mobile application, it can effectively guide and remind a patient to carry out the protocol in a quality manner. We have conducted experiments by using the mobile application to capture and analyze leg extension data. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed approach could accurately recognize the leg extension activities and identify the ones completed with poor quality that may result in harmful results. In addition, we have taken the initial step to expand the mobile application to a novel mobile cloud computing (MCC) based telerehabilitation system, in which the mobile subsystem periodically transmits data to the cloud subsystem for storage and analysis. This MCC system will provide a promising solution to assist patients in achieving effective rehabilitation while allowing healthcare providers to provide effective interventions by monitoring the recovery progress.;2016;3
Persons that suffered from a cardiac disease are often recommended to integrate a sufficient level of physical exercise in their daily life. Initially, cardiac rehabilitation takes place in a closely monitored setting in a hospital or a rehabilitation center. Sustaining the effort once the patient has left the ambulatory, supervised environment is a challenge, and drop-out rates are high. Emerging approaches such as telemonitoring and telerehabilitation have been proven to show the potential to support the cardiac patient in adhering to the advised physical exercise. However, most telerehabilitation solutions only support a limited range of physical exercise, such as step-counting during walking. We propose BoB (Back on Bike), a mobile application that guides cardiac patients while cycling. Design choices are explained according to three pillars: ease of use, reduce fear, and direct and indirect motivation. In this paper, we report the results from a field study with cardiac patients.;2016;3
"Photography can be an effective addition for education-based telehealth services delivered by an occupational therapist. In this study, photography was used as antecedent to telehealth sessions delivered by an occupational therapist focused on narrative learning about home safety. After taking photographs of past home safety challenges, six participants experienced three web-based occupational therapy sessions. Sessions were recorded and transcribed. Data were examined using content analysis. The content analysis identified the following themes: the value of photos to support learning; the value of narrative learning related to home safety education; and abstract versus concrete learners. Procedural findings are included to support future endeavors. Findings indicate that within a wellness context, home safety education for older adults can be delivered effectively via telehealth when using photography as a part of an occupational therapy intervention.";2016;3
Physical exercise is effective in improving functional outcomes in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of internet-based exercise training (e-training) for pwMS on health-related quality of life (HrQoL). Secondary outcomes were muscle strength, aerobic capacity, lung function, physical activity, and fatigue. This is a randomised, controlled trial with a wait-list control group. Data were collected at baseline, after three and six months, and analysed using a hybrid linear model. One-hundred twenty-six pwMS participated in the home-based aerobic (1x/week) and strength training (2x/week) intervention that was supervised and documented via an internet-platform. The intervention group received e-training for six months, and the control group received e-training after a three months waiting period. Significant differences between the groups were only observed for muscle strength (knee flexion (effect size ES = 0.3, p = 0.003), knee extension (ES = 0.24, p = 0.015)), peak expiratory flow (ES = 0.2, p = 0.039), and sports activity (ES = 0.33, p = 0.001) after three months. E-training had no effect on HrQoL but did on muscle strength, lung function, and physical activity. It is a promising and feasible approach to facilitate large-scale, yet individual, training support.;2016;3
POU3F4 mutations (DFNX2) are the most prevalent among non-syndromic X-linked hearing loss (HL) identified to date. Clinical manifestations of DFNX2 usually comprise congenital HL either sensorineural or mixed, a tendency towards perilymphatic gusher during otologic surgery and temporal bone malformations. The aim of the present study was to screen for POU3F4 mutations in a group of 30 subjects with a suggestive clinical phenotype as well as a group (N = 1671-2018) of unselected hearing loss patients. We also planned to analyze audiological and radiological features in patients with HL caused by POU3F4 defects. The molecular techniques used to detect POU3F4 mutations included whole exome sequencing (WES), Sanger sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Hearing status was assessed with pure-tone audiometry and auditory brainstem response. Computer tomography scans were evaluated to define the pattern of structural changes in the temporal bones. Six novel (p.Gln27*, p.Glu187*, p.Leu217*, p.Gln275*, p.Gln306*, p.Val324Asp) and two known (p.Ala116fs141*, p.Leu208*) POU3F4 mutations were detected in the studied cohort. All probands with POU3F4 defects suffered from bilateral, prelingual, severe to profound HL. Morphological changes of the temporal bone in these patients presented a similar pattern, including malformations of the internal auditory canal, vestibular aqueduct, modiolus and vestibule. Despite different localization in the POU3F4 gene all mutations severely impair the protein structure affecting at least one functional POU3F4 domain, and results in similar and severe clinical manifestations. Sequencing of the entire POU3F4 gene is recommended in patients with characteristic temporal bone malformations. Results of POU3F4 mutation testing are important not only for a proper genetic counseling, but also for adequate preparation and conduction of a surgical procedure.;2016;3
Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended to restore chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients' abilities to the highest level of independency and functionality. Telehealth has the potential to improve rehabilitation programs and to enhance patients' participation. However, little is known about the potential benefits of using telehealth in providing rehabilitation for COPD patients at home. The purpose of this review was to provide a narrative synthesis of literature of studies, which use telehealth with video components to provide real-time pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD patients. An electronic database search was performed in the Ovid Medline, CINAHL, and PubMed databases. Seven eligible studies were included based on the inclusion criteria. Based on the included studies, using telehealth to provide real-time interactive pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD patients at home is feasible and acceptable, and can provide clinical and social positive benefits. A knowledge gap regarding feasibility, acceptance, and benefits of using telehealth to provide real-time pulmonary rehabilitation services still exists.;2016;3
Purpose of review Rehabilitation trials and postacute care to lessen impairments and disability after stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury almost never include training to promote long-term self-management of skills practice, strengthening and fitness. Without behavioral training to develop self-efficacy, clinical trials, and home-based therapy may fail to show robust results. Recent findings Behavioral theories about self-management and self-efficacy for physical activity have been successfully incorporated into interventions for chronic diseases, but rarely for neurologic rehabilitation. The elements of behavioral training include education about the effects of practice and exercise that are relevant to the person, goal setting, identification of possible barriers, problem solving, feedback about performance, tailored instruction, decision making, and ongoing personal or social support. Mobile health and telerehabilitation technologies offer new ways to remotely enable such training by monitoring activity from wearable wireless sensors and instrumented exercise devices to allow real-world feedback, goal setting, and instruction. Summary Motivation, sense of responsibility, and confidence to practice and exercise in the home can be trained to increase adherence to skills practice and exercise both during and after formal rehabilitation. To optimize motor learning and improve long-term outcomes, self-management training should be an explicit component of rehabilitation care and clinical trials.;2016;3
"Purpose: High-intensity language therapy has been shown to provide greater outcomes for people with aphasia (PWA). Unfortunately, a number of issues including the ageing population and a lack of rurally-based clinicians prevent high-intensity interventions. Computer-based therapies are a potential solution to the issues of intensity and accessibility; however, this service delivery model is not commonly used. A possible reason behind the poor uptake is that current computer-based aphasia therapy (CBAT) programs may not meet the needs of speech-language pathologists (SLPs). This study investigated the preferences of SLPs with regard to the features desired in their ideal CBAT program. Method: Phenomenological research methodology was used to explore the preferences of 10 SLPs. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. Result: Desired features were grouped into five themes: therapy activities, stimuli, cues, access and progress data. A range of sub-themes were also identified. Conclusion: The wide range of desirable features found in this study may reflect the extent to which current CBAT programs are considered to be useful, but perhaps do not meet the needs of users. The study's findings provide useful information for future CBAT developers to create programs with high clinician usability.";2016;3
Purpose: Telerehabilitation is one of the newest branches of telemedicine which has been developed because patients need regular trainings outside the medical institution but still under specialist supervision. It helps maintain regularity of exercises and reduces costs. The professional and advanced systems for telerehabilitation are presented in papers, however, there is still lack of development of minor systems which provide therapeutic values and are more accessible to people. Therefore we focus on a solution for hand telerehabilitation of post-stroke patients, based solely on a personal computer and camera. Methods: We focused on the manipulative hand (fingers, metacarpus, wrist) movements trainings for patients with cerebral palsy. The contact between patient and physiotherapist is provided by using web cameras and web service. Additionally, the camera can be used to monitor the effectiveness of performed exercises. Computer vision system keeps track of the patient's hand movement. The digital image processing is used to detect if the patient performs exercises correctly. Results: We created web service and software application TeleReh that provides therapeutic values for the hand impaired people. The system created was evaluated by three physiotherapists, one doctor and a cerebral palsy patient. Conclusions: Our solution applies to all patients who have undergone basic rehabilitation in hospital and need to continue hand rehabilitation at home. The main advantages are: easy adaptation to the individual needs and abilities, monitoring the progress by using automatically generated reports after each training session. It is worth noticing that discussion between IT specialists, rehabilitants and patients was necessary to achieve good results.;2016;3
Purpose: The objectives of this study were to investigate the efficacy of a speech-language pathology teletherapy program for children attending schools and early childcare settings in rural New South Wales, Australia, and their parents' views on the program's feasibility and acceptability. Method: Nineteen children received speech-language pathology sessions delivered via Adobe Connect (R), Facetime(C) or Skype(C) web-conferencing software. During semi-structured interviews, parents (n = 5) described factors that promoted or threatened the program's feasibility and acceptability. Result: Participation in a speech-language pathology teletherapy program using low-bandwidth videoconferencing improved the speech and language skills of children in both early childhood settings and primary school. Emergent themes related to (a) practicality and convenience, (b) learning, (c) difficulties and (d) communication. Conclusion: Treatment outcome data and parental reports verified that the teletherapy service delivery was feasible and acceptable. However, it was also evident that regular discussion and communication between the various stakeholders involved in teletherapy programs may promote increased parental engagement and acceptability.;2016;3
Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the usability of delivering the Phonological Components Analysis treatment for anomia (Leonard, Rochon, & Laird, 2008) remotely via the Internet to individuals with chronic poststroke aphasia. A secondary aim was to probe the experiences and satisfaction of clinicians in administering treatment at a distance. Method: Six individuals with mild-moderate aphasia and 2 trained clinicians participated in this usability study. Participants and clinicians underwent approximately 6 hr of treatment under observation by an independent observer. The usability characteristics of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction were assessed. Results: Individuals with aphasia used the Internet-based Phonological Components Analysis therapy successfully, demonstrating independence and very few errors in completing online tasks. Overall, participant satisfaction was high, despite occasional difficulties with technical aspects of the system. Clinicians found the application easy to use but raised concerns about the participant-clinician interaction, perceiving rapport-building and communicating to be more difficult online than face-to-face. Conclusions: It is important to consider usability and the clinician's perspective in developing telepractice applications in speech-language pathology. Future directions include assessing the efficacy of remote treatment and collecting a larger sample of clinician data.;2016;3
Purpose: This study investigated the noninferiority and validity of an intensive speech treatment for people with Parkinson's disease (PD) delivered via telerehabilitation to the home. The effect of location on online delivery was also investigated. Method: In this single-blinded, randomized controlled noninferiority trial, 31 participants with dysarthria associated with PD from a metropolitan area were randomly assigned to either face-to-face or online Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD). A cohort of 21 participants from nonmetropolitan areas was also recruited and treated online. Outcomes were assessed using acoustic, perceptual, and quality of life measures. Results: Noninferiority of online treatment was confirmed through comparable clinical and quality of life outcomes for the metropolitan online and face-to-face treatment groups. Significant improvements posttreatment were achieved for several acoustic, perceptual, and quality of life measures across the groups. No significant effect of online treatment location was identified. Conclusions: Clinical and quality of life outcomes supported the noninferiority and validity of online delivery of intensive speech treatment to people with PD in the home. Future research should address the implementation of online treatment in a clinical service, cost analyses, and potentially technology-enabled clinical pathways for people with PD in order to maintain optimal communication and quality of life.;2016;3
Rehabilitation exercises are an important means for gaining mobility and strength after injuries or surgery. Self-exercising in between physio-therapy sessions is vital for effective rehabilitation. Yet, many people do not follow exercise regimes, which can hamper their recovery. This study proposes GEAR - a mobile GamE Assisted Rehabilitation system - to engage users in self-exercising and to improve adherence to their exercise regime. The system consists of a wearable wristband to monitor users' movements, a mobile game that incorporates the exercises, and a dashboard to monitor and visualize users' exercise performance. GEAR has advantages of portability and lower cost as compared to PC or Kinect-based rehabilitation systems. This study describes GEAR and reports on a pilot assessment of its interface and system. The pilot test demonstrates the feasibility of GEAR and provides feedback that is being used to enhance the system prior to full-scale evaluation.;2016;3
Rehabilitation is important for patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) to improve health outcomes and quality of life. However, adherence to current exercise programmes in cardiac rehabilitation is limited. We present the design and development of a Decision Support System (DSS) for telerehabilitation, aiming to enhance exercise programmes for CVD patients through ensuring their safety, personalising the programme according to their needs and performance, and motivating them toward meeting their physical activity goals. The DSS processes data originated from a Microsoft Kinect camera, a blood pressure monitor, a heart rate sensor and questionnaires, in order to generate a highly individualised exercise programme and improve patient adherence. Initial results within the EU-funded PATHway project show the potential of our approach.;2016;3
Research findings indicate that intensive therapy is essential for achieving better outcome in post-stroke rehabilitation. However, with the increasing number of stroke patients and limited healthcare resources, it is difficult to provide the needed amount of therapy. Robot-assisted rehabilitation based on serious games may offer the solution for providing a more autonomous and scalable training that can be transferred out of the clinic and into home environments. Robots offer precision and repeatability of movements that can be used to provide safe and intensive rehabilitation exercises, both at home and in the clinic. Serious games can provide an enjoyable and effective way to motivate patients to increase both the quality and quantity of therapy. In addition, these technologies can also be used to remotely assess the motor performance of patients and the therapy progress. The ArmAssist is a recent example of a low-cost robotic system designed specifically for post-stroke upper-limb telerehabilitation. The system incorporates a set of serious games for assessment and training, further described in this paper. Preliminary results from the ongoing clinical study reveal very positive responses from 10 patients and 2 therapists about the usability and integration of the system in the clinical setting. Training with this system is shown to be beneficial and enjoyable, and highly motivates patients to continue and endure longer durations of training. More data and analysis is required to extract further conclusions.;2016;3
Stroke is a worldwide healthcare problem, which often causes long-term motor impairment, handicap, and disability. Optical motion analysis systems are commonly used for impairment assessment due to high accuracy. However, the requirement of equipment-heavy and large laboratory space together with operational expertise makes these systems impractical for local clinic and home use. We propose an alternative, cost-effective and portable, decision support system for optical motion analysis, using a single camera. The system relies on detecting and tracking markers attached to subject's joints, data analytics for calculating relevant rehabilitation parameters, visualization, and robust classification based on graph-based signal processing. Experimental results show that the proposed decision support system has the potential to offer stroke survivors and clinicians an alternative, affordable, accurate, and convenient impairment assessment option suitable for home healthcare and telerehabilitation.;2016;3
Study Design. A systematic review. Objective. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of motor control exercise (MCE) in patients with nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Summary of Background Data. MCE is a common form of exercise used for managing LBP. MCE focuses on the activation of the deep trunk muscles and targets the restoration of control and coordination of these muscles, progressing to more complex and functional tasks integrating the activation of deep and global trunk muscles. Methods. We conducted electronic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases, and two trials registers from their inception up to April 2015. Two independent review authors screened the search results, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data. A third reviewer resolved any disagreement. We included randomized controlled trials comparing MCE with no treatment, another treatment, or as a supplement to other interventions in patients with nonspecific LBP. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Back and Neck (CBN) Review Group 12-item criteria. We combined results in a meta-analysis expressed as mean difference and 95% confidence interval. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Results. We included 32 trials (n = 2628). Most included trials had a low risk of bias. For acute LBP, low to moderate quality evidence indicates no clinically important differences between MCE and spinal manipulative therapy or other forms of exercise. There is very low-quality evidence that the addition of MCE to medical management does not provide clinically important improvements. For recurrence at one year, there is very low-quality evidence that MCE and medical management decrease the risk of recurrence. For chronic LBP, there is low to moderate quality evidence that MCE is effective for reducing pain compared with minimal intervention. There is low to high-quality evidence that MCE is not clinically more effective than other exercises or manual therapy. There is very low to low quality evidence that MCE is clinically more effective than exercise and electrophysical agents (EPAs) or telerehabilitation for pain and disability. Conclusion. MCE is probably more effective than a minimal intervention for reducing pain, but probably does not have an important effect on disability, in patients with chronic LBP. There was no clinically important difference between MCE and other forms of exercises or manual therapy for acute and chronic LBP.;2016;3
Study Design: Repeated measures. Introduction: The Kinect (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) is widely used for telerehabilitation applications including rehabilitation games and assessment. Purpose of the Study: To determine effects of the Kinect location relative to a person on measurement accuracy of upper limb joint angles. Methods: Kinect error was computed as difference in the upper limb joint range of motion (ROM) during target reaching motion, from the Kinect vs 3D Investigator Motion Capture System (NDI, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada), and compared across 9 Kinect locations. Results: The ROM error was the least when the Kinect was elevated 45 in front of the subject, tilted toward the subject. This error was 54% less than the conventional location in front of a person without elevation and tilting. The ROM error was the largest when the Kinect was located 60 contralateral to the moving arm, at the shoulder height, facing the subject. The. ROM error was the least for the shoulder elevation and largest for the wrist angle. Discussion: Accuracy of the Kinect sensor for detecting upper limb joint ROM depends on its location relative to a person. Conclusion: This information facilitates implementation of Kinect-based upper limb rehabilitation applications with adequate accuracy. (C) 2016 Hanley & Belfus, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

Tele-assessment systems are crucial for home-based rehabilitation, as they allow therapists to assess the status of patients and adjust the parameters of various home-based training devices. Traditional force/torque sensors are commonly used in tele-assessment systems to detect muscle strength because such sensors are convenient. However, muscle activity can be measured using surface electromyography (sEMG), which records the activation level of skeleton muscles and is a more accurate method for determining the amount of force exerted. Thus, in this paper, a method for predicting muscle strength using only sEMG signals is proposed. The sEMG signals measure the isometric downward touch motions and are recorded from four muscles of the forearm. The prediction function is derived from a musculoskeletal model. The parameters involved are calibrated using the Bayesian linear regression algorithm. To avoid the complex modeling of the entire movement, a neural network classifier is trained to recognize the force-exerting motion. Experimental results show that the mean root-mean-square error of the proposed method is below 2.5 N. In addition, the effects of the high-pass cutoff frequency and the co-activation of flexors and extensors for EMG force prediction are discussed in this paper. The performance of the proposed method is validated further in real-time by a remote predicted-force evaluation experiment. A haptic device (Phantom Premium) is used to represent the predicted force at the therapist's remote site. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide acceptable prediction results for tele-assessment systems.;2016;3
Telemedicine is a medical application of advanced technology to disease management. This modality may provide benefits also to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Different devices and systems are used. The legal problems associated with telemedicine are still controversial. Economic advantages for healthcare systems, though potentially high, are still poorly investigated. A European Respiratory Society Task Force has defined indications, follow-up, equipment, facilities, legal and economic issues of tele-monitoring of COPD patients including those undergoing home mechanical ventilation.;2016;3
Telepractice is the application of telecommunications technology to the delivery of telehealth services via the online connection of clinicians, clients, and patients for assessment, intervention, or consultation. This article describes a pilot project in which speech-language pathology students in a university training program gained experience in working with culturally diverse preschool students using telepractice technology. The preschool students benefited by making gains in communication skills, while the university students acquired competency in the use of telepractice and in working with children whose cultural and linguistic backgrounds were outside of their experience. To assess the training experience, a Likert-scale survey administered to student clinicians revealed a high degree of satisfaction and improved familiarity with the use of telepractice, and an increased comfort level working with multi-cultural populations.;2016;3
Telerehabilitation is an emerging field of rehabilitation. Combining medicine and engineering, telerehabilitation provides an alternative method of rehabilitation therapy in areas lacking medical resources, and an easy way to resolve the inconvenience for the disabled patients to seek rehabilitation services. This study developed a device that integrates inertial measurement units (IMU) and an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) named AFO-IMU module. We further demonstrate the AFO-IMU module on telerehabilitation diagnostic including patients with muscle weakness due to brain injuries and patients who will receive total knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis of knee joints to determine the feasibility in clinical usage. The results from this study indicate that AFO-IMU module is a simple and effective telerehabilitation system to correctly assess knee joint activity and track knee joint rehabilitation diagnosis.;2016;3
"Telerehabilitation, consisting of supervised home-based exercise training via real-time videoconferencing, is an alternative method to deliver pulmonary rehabilitation with potential to improve access. The aims were to determine the level of satisfaction and experience of an eight-week supervised home-based telerehabilitation exercise program using real-time videoconferencing in people with COPD. Quantitative measures were the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and a purpose-designed satisfaction survey. A qualitative component was conducted using semi-structured interviews. Nineteen participants (mean (SD) age 73 (8) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 60 (23) % predicted) showed a high level of satisfaction in the CSQ-8 score and 100% of participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the quality of exercise sessions delivered using real-time videoconferencing in participant satisfaction survey. Eleven participants undertook semi-structured interviews. Key themes in four areas relating to the telerehabilitation service emerged: positive virtual interaction through technology; health benefits; and satisfaction with the convenience and use of equipment. Participants were highly satisfied with the telerehabilitation exercise program delivered via videoconferencing.";2016;3
"Textiles able to perform electronic functions are known as e-textiles, and are poised to revolutionise the manner in which rehabilitation and assistive technology is provided. With numerous reports in mainstream media of the possibilities and promise of e-textiles it is timely to review research work in this area related to neurological rehabilitation. This paper provides a review based on a systematic search conducted using EBSCO-Health, Scopus, AMED, PEDro and ProQuest databases, complemented by articles sourced from reference lists. Articles were included if the e-textile technology described had the potential for use in neurological rehabilitation and had been trialled on human participants. A total of 108 records were identified and screened, with 20 meeting the broad review inclusion criteria. Nineteen user trials of healthy people and one pilot study with stroke participants have been reported. The review identifies two areas of research focus; motion sensing, and the measurement of, or stimulation of, muscle activity. In terms of motion sensing, E-textiles appear able to reliably measure gross movement and whether an individual has achieved a predetermined movement pattern. However, the technology still remains somewhat cumbersome and lacking in resolution at present. The measurement of muscle activity and the provision of functional electrical stimulation via e-textiles is in the initial stages of development but shows potential for e-textile expansion into assistive technologies. The review identified a lack of high quality clinical evidence and, in some cases, a lack of practicality for clinical application. These issues may be overcome by engagement of clinicians in e-textile research and using their expertise to develop products that augment and enhance neurological rehabilitation practice.";2016;3
The diagnosis of dysphagia, defined as swallowing dysfunction or difficulty, is estimated to affect 40-60% of the institutionalized geriatric population, and is the leading cause of aspiration pneumonia, one of the primary contributors of geriatric mortality. In the United States, statistics suggest that at least 50% of these individuals have limited access to treatment due to mobility, distance, and socioeconomic constraints. While tele-dysphagia intervention - the delivery of dysphagia therapy services via telecommunications technology - may provide a solution, there is limited research investigating its validity or reliability. The following three case reports of individuals successfully participating in trial tele-dysphagia therapy sessions lend credibility to this service delivery approach, and highlight the need for future research.;2016;3
The evolving telecommunications industry combined with medical information technology has been proposed as a solution to reduce health care cost and provide remote medical services. This paper aims to validate and show the feasibility and user acceptance of using a telerehabilitation system called Kinect Rehabilitation System (KiReS) in a real scenario, with patients attending repeated rehabilitation sessions after they had a Total Hip Replacement (THR). We present the main features of KiReS, how it was set up in the considered scenario and the experimental results obtained in relation to two different perspectives: patients' subjective perceptions (gathered through questionnaires) and the accuracy of the performed exercises (by analysing the data captured using KiReS). We made a full deployment of KiReS, defining step by step all the elements of a therapy: postures, movements, exercises and the therapy itself. Seven patients participated in this trial in a total of 19 sessions, and the system recorded 3865 exercise executions. The group showed general support for telerehabilitation and the possibilities that systems such as KiReS bring to physiotherapy treatment.;2016;3
The progressive aging of the population in developed countries is becoming a problem for healthcare systems, which must invest ever higher sums in caring for their older citizens. One of the most important issues in this area involves the physical and cognitive problems associated with growing old. In order to reduce the effect of these problems, gerontechnology has emerged as one of the most promising alternatives, especially in the field of the telerehabilitation systems developed to date. However, most of these systems do not offer therapists the facilities to design therapies adapted to individual patients. This paper proposes a novel system that supplies this need and enables therapists to create bespoke motor therapies as state diagrams and manage them efficiently in a collaborative setting. The proposed system is equipped with a fuzzy-based decision-making component that therapists can use to control transitioning between states according to variables such as fatigue and performance. Therefore, the system makes it feasible to provide older patients with the treatment they need in their own homes while its effectiveness is controlled by a Fuzzy Inference System.;2016;3
The share of the population aged 65 years and over is increasing in every EU Member State, candidate country, and EFTA Member State. WHO/Europe has established a Subnetwork on Healthy Ageing within the European Healthy Cities Network and provides guidance to Member States in developing profiles of healthy ageing, since, given the increasing number of older adults, maintaining their health status is a crucial issue. This article, which is part of the Latvian national scientific program VPP INOSOCTEREHI, focuses on the issues related to the design, implementation, and assessment of user interfaces that can maximize usability in social telerehabilitation systems for older adult users. This is a very real challenge, since older adults don't form a homogeneous class. Investigating older adults' skills and their attitudes towards the perceived usefulness of computer applications could be helpful in identifying some sub-sets of older adult users and their typical behaviours.;2016;3
The Spring 2016 issue of the International Journal of Telerehabilitation (IJT) presents original and innovative work in three diverse sections: usability, intervention, and pedagogy, followed by a book review on teleaudiology. The contributors to this issue are notably multi-disciplinary and include an audiologist, computer scientists, engineers, an epidemiologist, occupational therapists, a rehabilitation counselor, a physician (physical medicine and rehabilitation), and speechlanguage pathologists. The common thread linking the Journal's authors and their manuscripts, is excellence in telerehabilitation related innovation.;2016;3
"The use of haptic devices in the rehabilitation of impaired limbs has become rather popular, given the proven effectiveness in promoting recovery. In a standard framework, such devices are used in rehabilitation centers, where patients interact with virtual tasks, presented on a screen. To track their sessions, kinematic/dynamic parameters or performance scores are recorded. However, as Internet access is now available at almost every home and in order to reduce the hospitalization time of the patient, the idea of doing rehabilitation at home is gaining wide consent. Medical care programs can be synchronized with the home rehabilitation device; patient data can be sent to the central server that could redirect to the therapist laptop (tele-healthcare). The controversial issue is that the recorded data do not actually represent the clinical conditions of the patients according to the medical assessment scales, forcing them to frequently undergo clinical tests at the hospital. To respond to this demand, we propose the use of a bilateral master/slave haptic system that could allow the clinician, who interacts with the master, to assess remotely and in real time the clinical conditions of the patient that uses the home rehabilitation device as the slave. In this paper, we describe a proof of concept to highlight the main issues of such an application, limited to one degree of freedom, and to the measure of the stiffness and range of motion of the hand.";2016;3
The use of telehealth has been discussed nationally as an option to address provider shortages for children, birth through two, enrolled in Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Early Intervention (EI) programs. Telehealth is an evidence-based service delivery model which can be used to remove barriers in providing EI services to children and their families. In 2016, Colorado's Part C Early Intervention (EI) program began allowing the use of telehealth as an option for providers to conduct sessions with children and their caregivers. This article outlines the process taken to develop the necessary requirements and supports for telehealth to be incorporated into EI current practice.;2016;3
The World Wide Web is increasingly used in therapeutic settings. In this regard, internet-based interventions have proven effective in ameliorating several health behaviors, amongst them physical activity behavior. Internet-delivered interventions have shown positive effects on physical activity and physical function in persons with MS (pwMS). In this review we give an overview on several online exercise programs for pwMS and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of web-based interventions. Although participants of online exercise programs reported a high acceptance and satisfaction with the intervention, decreasing compliance was a major issue. A possible remedy might be the implementation of game-design elements to increase compliance and long-term adherence to internet-delivered interventions. In addition we believe that the integration of social networks seems to be a promising strategy.;2016;3
This article presents a review of the book Telepractice in Audiology, authored by Emma Rushbrooke MPhil(AUD), BA, DipAud., MAudSA., LSLS. Cert. AVT, RNC, and K. Todd Houston, PhD, CCC-SLP, LSLS Cert. AVT, and 13 contributing authors. This is the first book entirely devoted to tele-audiology. It provides practical information for working with clients across the lifespan and for multiple practice settings. Reviewer Dr. Barbara Vento endorses this work as a comprehensive resource on the topic of teleaudiology for both students and aspiring teleaudiologists.;2016;3
This article reflects on the future of intervention for language and communication disorders that follow unilateral damage to the right cerebral hemisphere. The author first introduces some of the challenges inherent in this task: a very small and preliminary evidence base and a limited number of investigators conducting treatment research for most of the consequences of these disorders, more general difficulties of translating evidence to practice, and limited graduate training in the area. The article then addresses some predictions and hopes for the future. The author foresees progress in defining the disorders and in clinicians' knowledge of the heterogeneity of the population, the multifaceted nature of complex impairments, and the expanding range of well-justified treatment options. The article next discusses the potential of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, virtual reality-based approaches to intervention, and the promise of telerehabilitation. Finally, the author voices a concern that undeniably important new trends in health care, such as emphases on patient-reported outcomes and patient satisfaction measures, could penalize the subset of the client population that lacks awareness of or minimizes their deficits, and calls for vigilant clinician advocates in such cases.;2016;3
This paper presents an approach for position coordination problem of nonlinear teleoperators in the presence of time delay. Unlike previous studies no assumption is made concerning the passivity of the environment and/or human operators. The assumption which are not satisfied in many applications such as beating hurt surgery and telerehabilitation. The input to state stability of the overall system is ensured under the condition that the interaction forces are bounded. It is assumed that the operator is non-passive and the environment is active. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.;2016;3
This paper presents an improved wave-based bilateral teleoperation scheme for rehabilitation therapies assisted by robot manipulators. The main feature of this bilateral teleoperator is that both robot manipulators, master and slave, are controlled by impedance. Thus, a pair of mo don-based adaptive impedance controllers are integrated into a wave-based configuration, in order to guarantee a stable human-robot interaction and to compensate the position drift, characteristic of the available schemes of bilateral teleoperation. Moreover, the teleoperator stability, in the presence of time delays in the communication channel, is guaranteed because the wave-variable approach is included to encode the force and velocity signals. It should be noted that the proposed structure enables the implementation of several teleoperator schemes, from passive therapies, without the intervention of a human operator on the master side, to fully active therapies where both manipulators interact with humans in a stable manner. The suitable performance of the proposed teleoperator is verified through some results obtained from the simulation of the passive and active-constrained modes, by considering typical tasks in motor-therapy rehabilitation, where an improved behavior is observed when compared to implementations of the classical wave-based approach.

This paper proposed a VR-based self-rehabilitation system which utilizes the virtual training model rendered by OpenGL and collects electromyography (EMG) signals from the subjects to perform hand motion recognition. EMG signals are biomedical signals generated in muscles and can be applied in many fields such as clinical diagnosis and biomedical applications. The subjects were asked to manipulate a haptic device (Phantom Premium) to operate a virtual hand to catch a ball in the virtual environment which displayed on the computer's screen. A dry electrode was attached on the subject's skin to collect sEMG signals and recognize the action of grasping. Once caught by subjects, the virtual ball will appear in another location at random on the computer's screen. Therefore, the subject needs to manipulate the Phantom to the new destination and catch the ball once again. Combining sEMG with VR Technology, the proposed self-rehabilitation system could provide enhanced visual feedback about movement trajectory, which is beneficial to improve motor function task learning and execution compared with traditional therapy. By this method, stroke patients can realize self-rehabilitation exercise of upper limb at home. The effectiveness of the proposed rehabilitation system has been verified by experiments.;2016;3
This paper seeks to determine how the overlap of several infrared beams affects the tracked position of the user, depending on the angle of incidence of light, distance to the target, distance between sensors, and the number of capture devices used. We also try to show that under ideal conditions using several Kinect sensors increases the precision of the data collected. The results obtained can be used in the design of telerehabilitation environments in which several RGB-D cameras are needed to improve precision or increase the tracking range. A numerical analysis of the results is included and comparisons are made with the results of other studies. Finally, we describe a system that implements intelligent methods for the rehabilitation of patients based on the results of the tests carried out.;2016;3
This study assessed the within-subject variability of voice measures captured using different recording devices (i.e., smartphones and head mounted microphone) and software programs (i.e., Analysis of Dysphonia in Speech and Voice (ADSV), Multi-dimensional Voice Program (MDVP), and Praat). Correlations between the software programs that calculated the voice measures were also analyzed. Results demonstrated no significant within-subject variability across devices and software and that some of the measures were highly correlated across software programs. The study suggests that certain smartphones may be appropriate to record daily voice measures representing the effects of vocal loading within individuals. In addition, even though different algorithms are used to compute voice measures across software programs, some of the programs and measures share a similar relationship.;2016;3
"This study investigated whether physical activity levels and other outcomes were maintained at 1-year from completion of a 2-year telerehabilitation intervention in COPD. During the post-intervention year, nine patients with COPD (FEV1 % of pred. 42.4 +/- 19.8%; age 58.1 +/- 6 years) were encouraged to exercise on a treadmill at home and monitor daily symptoms and training sessions on a webpage as during the intervention. Participants were not provided supervision or motivational support. Physical activity levels decreased from 3,806 steps/day to 2,817 steps/day (p=0.039). There was a decline in time spent on light physical activity (p=0.009), but not on moderate-to-vigorous activity (p=0.053). Adherence to registration of symptoms and training sessions decreased significantly. Other outcomes including health status, quality of life, anxiety and depression, self-efficacy, and healthcare utilization did not change significantly. In conclusion, provision of equipment for self-management and unsupervised home exercise might not be enough to maintain physical activity levels.";2016;3
"To date, research investigating the use of remote technologies to extend face-to-face early intervention services for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is limited. This study explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of a follow-up early intervention service delivered via remote technology, as compared to previous face-to-face services. The remote technology service focused on parent coaching rather than direct intervention with the child. A generic method of qualitative enquiry involving semi structured interviews was used to explore the experiences of four rurally-based parents of children with ASD, eight rurally-based service providers, and a metropolitan-based ASD-specialist in regards to their participation in remote technology and face-to-face services. Qualitative content analysis revealed that the parents, service providers and the ASD-specialist perceived remote technologies to be beneficial in: (a) upskilling of parents and local service provider; (b) reducing cost, time and travel; (c) flexible, regular, ongoing support; (d) enabling families to access support from home, and (e) enhancing connections between team members. However, the participants were often frustrated by technical difficulties, and all agreed that remote technology should augment rather than replace face-to-face contact. This study provides preliminary support for the use of remote technologies to extend early intervention services for children with ASD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";2016;3
Today, the technological development of rehabilitation robots increases very quickly and provides a positive impact to healthcare. The development of the tele-rehabilitation techniques offers more efficiency and high performances for physiotherapy and rehabilitation. In this paper, design and development of a 2DOF wrist rehabilitation robot are proposed. The conceived robot ensures the two sets of wrist movement: flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation. Distinguished by its compact mechanism design, the developed wrist rehabilitation robot offers high stiffness with a total absence of any friction and backlash. Using web-based control, this robot can be tele-operated by the therapist and used in clinical or at-home cases. Parameters and results of each exercise can be stored and operated later in analysis and evolution of patient progress.;2016;3
Understanding end-user populations is required in designing telepractice applications. This study explored computer literacy and health locus of control in head/neck cancer (HNC) patients to inform suitability for telerehabilitation. Sixty individuals with oropharygneal cancer were recruited. Computer literacy was examined using a 10-question survey. The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale Form C (MHLC-C) examined perceptions of health control. Participants were mostly middle-aged males, from high socioeconomic backgrounds. Only 10% were non-computer users. Of the computers users, 91% reported daily use, 66% used multiple devices and over 75% rated themselves as confident users. More than half were open to using technology for health-related activities. High internal scores (MHLC-C) signified a belief that own behaviour influenced health status. HNC patients have high computer literacy and an internal health locus of control, both are positive factors to support telepractice models of care. This may include asynchronous models requiring heightened capacity for self-management.;2016;3
Video has been recognized as an important mean for delivery of speech-language therapies, particularly when used in telepractice settings. It can be used in video conferencing setup for synchronous communication of the speech-language therapist and the patients, or employed as educational video artefacts which contain speech therapies that can be remotely accessed by patients at their convenient time. This paper discusses the design of educational videos for telerehabilitation of pediatric speech disorder (dyslalia) and presents results of a qualitative part of the pilot study. First, it presents how principles of multimedia learning were applied in the design of instructional videos aimed at the treatment of dyslalia. Second, it describes research results from empirical pilot study conducted with five children with dyslalia and their parents who used the videos. Quantitative data about the quality of the video design were collected from the parents by means of the post-use questionnaire and in this paper are briefly reported. The main emphasis of the paper is on presenting qualitative data about parents' experiences, impressions and observation of interactions while employing videos with their children. Feedback gained from the interviews provides important insights into the interactions of children with video artefacts and suggests additional guidelines for designing online instructional videos aimed at preschool children who need speech-language treatments.;2016;3
Vision-based Pose Estimation (VPE) represents a non-invasive solution to allow a smooth and natural interaction between a human user and a robotic system, without requiring complex calibration procedures. Moreover, VPE interfaces are gaining momentum as they are highly intuitive, such that they can be used from untrained personnel (e.g., a generic caregiver) even in delicate tasks as rehabilitation exercises. In this paper, we present a novel master-slave setup for hand telerehabilitation with an intuitive and simple interface for remote control of a wearable hand exoskeleton, named HX. While performing rehabilitative exercises, the master unit evaluates the 3D position of a human operator's hand joints in real-time using only a RGB-D camera, and commands remotely the slave exoskeleton. Within the slave unit, the exoskeleton replicates hand movements and an external grip sensor records interaction forces, that are fed back to the operator-therapist, allowing a direct real-time assessment of the rehabilitative task. Experimental data collected with an operator and six volunteers are provided to show the feasibility of the proposed system and its performances. The results demonstrate that, leveraging on our system, the operator was able to directly control volunteers' hands movements.;2016;3
We developed a tele-rehabilitation system to improve community rehabilitation for patients who are discharged early from hospital. The developed tele-rehabilitation system consists of devices designed to reduce the physical and economic burden on users while promoting optimum user movement. A Backend-as-a-Service cloud computing service was used for the communication between terminals. A non-contact sensor, Kinect, was used to measure movement. In addition, we used a three-dimensional (3D) display to present 3D images using binocular parallax, to encourage smooth movement of patients. We used this system for stroke patients and found improvements in task-performance time, smoothness of movements, and range of motion in all patients. No major issues occurred during the tele-rehabilitation. These results demonstrated the high operability and efficacy of our cloud service-based 3D virtual reality tele-rehabilitation system.;2016;3
We evaluated the feasibility, safety, system usability, and intervention acceptability of Lung Transplant Go (LTGO), an 8-week in-home exercise intervention for lung transplant recipients using a telerehabilitation platform, and described changes in physical function and physical activity from baseline to post-intervention. The intervention was delivered to lung transplant recipients in their home via the Versatile and Integrated System for TeleRehabilitation (VISYTER). The intervention focused on aerobic and strengthening exercises tailored to baseline physical function. Participants improved walk distance (6-minute walk distance), balance (Berg Balance Scale), lower body strength (30-second chair stand test) and steps walked (SenseWear Armband (R)). No adverse events were reported. Participants rated the program highly positively in regard to the technology and intervention. The telerehabilitation exercise program was feasible, safe, and acceptable. Our findings provide preliminary support for the LTGO intervention to improve physical function and promote physical activity in lung transplant recipients.;2016;3
When collaborating remotely, being aware of other participants (their actions, locations, status, etc.) is paramount to achieve a proper collaboration. This issue is magnified when talking about rehabilitation systems, whose users may require additional specific awareness information, due to their cognitive or physical disabilities. Moreover, because of these disabilities, this awareness may be provided by using specific feedback stimuli. This constituted the main motivation of this work: the development of an awareness interpretation for collaborative cognitive and physical therapies. With this aim, an awareness interpretation already applied to the collaborative games field has been modified and extended to make it suitable for these systems. Furthermore, in order to put this interpretation into practice, a case study based on an association image-writing rehabilitation pattern is presented illustrating how this cognitive rehabilitation task has been extended with collaborative features and enriched with awareness information.;2016;3
While the literature supports the potential to provide occupational therapy through telemedicine, there are several design challenges embedded in creating an at-home telemonitoring system that can visualize the complex biomechanical data required for clinical decision making. The challenge highlighted here is the development of measures that align with current decision making methods, which will support the integration and translation of the technology. A modified cognitive task analysis methodology is presented that is composed of three segments: characterizing the subject matter, defining relevant information, and formalizing requirements. This method was implemented through observations of eight therapists over 21 patient sessions. There were nine unique modes of interaction observed between the clinician and patient. Embedded within these interactions were 14 different features monitored. Relevant performance measures were defined from these interactions to provide perception and comprehension situation awareness (SA) to the clinician about the patients task performance. Using specific activities observed during therapy sessions, sample metrics and a visualization are presented that followed from the SA requirements. Finally, the technological challenges associated with making these measurements were identified.;2016;3
A 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) study reported that almost 27 million people with disability live in Pakistan with fewer than one allied rehabilitation professional per 10,000 people. The current study sought to determine the attitudes toward telerehabilitation via a survey administered to 329 Pakistani rehabilitation professionals. Study results indicate that rehabilitation professionals in Pakistan are knowledgeable about telerehabilitation and Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and are receptive to employing telerehabilitation programs and applications. Therefore, we can infer that the future of telerehabilitation can be bright in Pakistan but requires the attention of policy makers and non-government organizations to launch an appropriate program nationwide. The authors suggest that a range of telerehabilitation services (e.g., consultation, assessment, and therapy) could alleviate the shortage of rehabilitation personnel in Pakistan.;2017;3
A nonlinear model reference adaptive bilateral impedance controller is proposed that can accommodate various cooperative tele-rehabilitation modes for patient therapist interaction using a multi-DOF tele-robotic system. In this controller, two reference impedance models are implemented for the master and slave robots using new model reference adaptive control laws for the nonlinear bilateral teleoperation system. Hand-over-hand and adjustable-flexibility are two modes of patient therapist cooperation that are realized using the proposed strategy. The Lyapunov-based stability proof guarantees the patient's and the therapist's safety during the cooperation and interaction with robots, even in the presence of modeling uncertainties of the multi-DOF teleoperation system. The performance of the proposed bilateral impedance controller is experimentally investigated for upper-limb tele-rehabilitation in the two mentioned cooperation modes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"A number of electrophysiological tests have been proposed for the initial diagnostic assessment or for the follow- up phase of patients affected by Meniere disease. The most common are: (i) vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs); (ii) electrocochleography (ECochG); and (iii) otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). This paper presents the latest clinical developments with these 3 testing modalities. The PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl databases were searched from 2006 to December 2016. Full-text articles were obtained in cases where the title, abstract, or key words suggested that the study may be eligible for this review. The medical subject heading (MeSH) terms included the following: Meniere, hearing threshold, vestibule, otoacoustic emissions, inner ear, ECochG, VEMPs. There were 368 identified papers, out of which 87 were eligible for inclusion. Overall the data in the literature are still limited and the recommended procedures have not reached an international consensus. From the available data, one can conclude that none of the electrophysiological tests could be considered as pathognomonic, for the diagnosis of Meniere disease: presently, the tests could be mostly used in a supportive role to the clinical diagnosis. Hopefully, in the future, improved technology in electrophysiological testing could contribute to the development of better strategies for the diagnosis of Meniere disease.";2017;3
A telepractice survey was administered to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association Special Interest Group 18 Telepractice affiliates and attendees of the Waldo County General Hospital Speech- Language Pathology Telepractice Training program in Maine, USA over the summer of 2016. Sixty-seven respondents completed the survey. The survey explored demographics of clients and clinicians, costs and equipment, learning opportunities, use of the client's environment and caregivers/e-helpers, and method adaptations in telepractice. The results of the survey provide information on the current state of telepractice methods in speech-language pathology from experienced practitioners. This information may be used to develop telepractice models and to prepare speech-language pathology graduate students in the delivery of telepractice methods.;2017;3
A telepresence mobile robot is a remote-controlled, wheeled device with wireless internet connectivity for bidirectional audio, video and data transmission. In health care, a telepresence robot could be used to have a clinician or a caregiver assist seniors in their homes without having to travel to these locations. Many mobile telepresence robotic platforms have recently been introduced on the market, bringing mobility to telecommunication and vital sign monitoring at reasonable costs. What is missing for making them effective remote telepresence systems for home care assistance are capabilities specifically needed to assist the remote operator in controlling the robot and perceiving the environment through the robot's sensors or, in other words, minimizing cognitive load and maximizing situation awareness. This paper describes our approach adding navigation, artificial audition and vital sign monitoring capabilities to a commercially available telepresence mobile robot. This requires the use of a robot control architecture to integrate the autonomous and teleoperation capabilities of the platform.;2017;3
"A telerehabilitation system for physiotherapy of upper extremities has been developed for patients with Parkinson disease. The gamification system (with Kinect (TM) sensor) has been applied in a daily clinical practice; 28 patients with Parkinson's disease were included in the pilot study, 26 patients finished the Fruit picking game. The preliminary patients' feedback (objective measurements, games score) and the results of the clinical tests (MDS-UPDRS part III (27 vs 29), Jebsen hand test, 9 Hole Peg Test, Box & Blocks Test -48 vs 52) were encouraging (faster daily activities for up to 10%).";2017;3
Aim: Although cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness. Methods and results: We randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge (p < 0.01) and at one-year follow-up (p < 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87). Physical activity levels did not change during the one-year study period (centre-based p = 0.38, home-based p = 0.80). Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based group ((sic)437 per patient, 95% confidence interval -562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of (sic)3160 per patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95% confidence interval -460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective varied between 97% and 75% (willingness-to-pay of (sic)0 and (sic)100,000 per quality-adjusted life-years, respectively). Conclusion: We found no differences between home-based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre-based training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health-related quality of life. However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.;2017;3
"AimTo examine the efficacy of caregiver-directed, home-based intensive bimanual training in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP) using a randomized control trial. MethodTwenty-four children (ages 2y 6mo-10y 1mo; 10 males, 14 females) performed home-based activities directed by a caregiver for 2 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 9 weeks (total=90h). Cohorts of children were age-matched into groups and randomized to receive home-based hand-arm bimanual intensive therapy (H-HABIT; n=12) or lower-limb functional intensive training (LIFT-control; n=12). Caregivers were trained before the intervention and supervised remotely via telerehabilitation. Dexterity and bimanual hand function were assessed using the Box and Blocks test (BBT) and the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) respectively. Caregiver perception of functional goals was measured using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). ResultsH-HABIT showed greater improvement on the BBT compared to LIFT-control and no improvement on the AHA. H-HABIT demonstrated significant improvement in COPM-Performance compared to LIFT-control and both groups showed equal improvement in COPM-Satisfaction. InterpretationH-HABIT improved dexterity and performance of functional goals, but not bimanual performance, in children with USCP compared to a control group receiving intervention of equal intensity/duration that also controlled for increased caregiver attention. Home-based models provide a valuable, family-centered approach to achieve increased treatment intensity.";2017;3
"Although motor learning theory has led to evidence-based practices, few trials have revealed the superiority of one theory-based therapy over another after stroke. Nor have improvements in skills been as clinically robust as one might hope. We review some possible explanations, then potential technology-enabled solutions. Over the Internet, the type, quantity, and quality of practice and exercise in the home and community can be monitored remotely and feedback provided to optimize training frequency, intensity, and progression at home. A theory-driven foundation of synergistic interventions for walking, reaching and grasping, strengthening, and fitness could be provided by a bundle of home-based Rehabilitation Internet-of-Things (RIoT) devices. A RIoT might include wearable, activity-recognition sensors and instrumented rehabilitation devices with radio transmission to a smartphone or tablet to continuously measure repetitions, speed, accuracy, forces, and temporal spatial features of movement. Using telerehabilitation resources, a therapist would interpret the data and provide behavioral training for self-management via goal setting and instruction to increase compliance and long-term carryover. On top of this user-friendly, safe, and conceptually sound foundation to support more opportunity for practice, experimental interventions could be tested or additions and replacements made, perhaps drawing from virtual reality and gaming programs or robots. RIoT devices continuously measure the actual amount of quality practice; improvements and plateaus over time in strength, fitness, and skills; and activity and participation in home and community settings. Investigators may gain more control over some of the confounders of their trials and patients will have access to inexpensive therapies.";2017;3
"ArmAssist is a low-cost robotic system for post-stroke upper-limb rehabilitation based on serious games. The system incorporates a set of games for assessment, the ArmAssist Assessment (AAA). AAA provides a fast, quantitative and automatic evaluation of the arm function and allows a remote monitoring of the progress of the patient and an automatic adaptation of the therapy; all of them essential elements for partially unsupervised or remote rehabilitation. Apart from usability and motivational components, demonstrating the clinical meaningfulness of this assessment is crucial in order to be considered useful. Current study shows a statistically significant correlation of the AAA with three widely-used clinical tests, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). These results look promising and are expected to be improved with currently ongoing improvements in the system.";2017;3
As chronic diseases and demographic changes alter the trends in world population, more pressure is put on health management to deal efficiently with a new scenario of longer life expectancy and chronic disabilities. Advances in telecommunication technology and miniaturization of sensors in combination with medical information technology provide a viable solution to reduce healthcare costs and deliver remote medical services through connected devices. Although remote consultation via video-conferencing has been well established, many of the chronic or long-term musculoskeletal conditions require proactive management and therapy. There is a need to develop more advanced interactive telerehabilitation systems that support real-time remote delivery of physical therapy sessions into patients' homes. In this paper, we introduce KinectRTC, an innovative framework that can be used for Kinect-based telerehabilitation with efficient real-time transmission of video, audio, depth, and skeletal data. By taking advantage of the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) technology, the proposed framework is able to manage video and audio streams based on the state of the network and the available bandwidth to guarantee the real-time performance of the communication.

Back pain is a common musculoskeletal problem for farmers. Tele-rehabilitation for back pain could be useful for people living in rural area distant from hospital. Each session composed of self-assessment of back pain, education, stretching, core exercise, cool down exercise and homework using videoconferencing and Kinect-guided exercise. The outcome measure was visual analogue scale, Oswestry Disability Index, isometric back extensor strength, and pain pressure threshold of paraspainl muscles at baseline, after completion of 3 sessions, and after completion of 7 sessions. A total of 4 men (mean age, 64.8 +/- 8.8) and 12 women (mean age, 67.4 +/- 9.1) were participated in tele-rehabilitation program. After 7 consecutive sessions of telerehabilitation, participants had significant improvement on outcome measures including Oswestry Disability Index, isometric back extensor strength and pain pressure threshold on right L2 and left L4 paraspinal muscles. We showed tele-rehabilitation for back pain could be effective.;2017;3
"Background and Introduction: Telerehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is supported by strong evidence on the effectiveness of such intervention and from a cost-benefit point of view. Satisfaction of patients toward in-home telerehabilitation after TKA has not yet been examined thoroughly in large-scale clinical trials. This study aims to compare satisfaction level of patients following in-home telerehabilitation (TELE) after TKA to one of the patients following a usual face-to-face home visit (STD) rehabilitation. Secondarily, to determine if any clinical or personal variables were associated to the level of satisfaction. Materials and Methods: This study was embedded in a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 205 patients randomized into two groups. Rehabilitation intervention was the same for both groups; only approach for service delivery differed (telerehabilitation or home visits). Participants were assessed at baseline (before TKA), at hospital discharge, and at 2 and 4 months postdischarge (E4) using functional outcomes. Patient satisfaction was measured using the validated Health Care Satisfaction Questionnaire (HCSQ) at E4. Results: Characteristics of all participants were similar at baseline. Satisfaction level of both groups did not differ and was very high (over 85%). It was neither correlated to personal characteristics nor to improvements of functional level from preoperative to E4. Satisfaction was rather found associated to walking and stair-climbing performances. Conclusions: These results, in conjunction with evidences of clinical effectiveness and cost benefits demonstrated in the same sample of patients, strongly support the use of telerehabilitation to improve access to rehabilitation services and efficiency of service delivery after TKA.";2017;3
"Background and objective Although trials continue to emerge supporting the role of telerehabilitation, implementation has been slow. Key users include older people living with disabilities who are frequent users of hospital rehabilitation services but whose voices are rarely heard. It is unclear whether the use of technologies and reduced face-to-face contact is acceptable to these people. We report on a qualitative study of community dwelling participants who had received a home telerehabilitation programme as an alternative to conventional rehabilitation. Design Thirteen older participants, three spouses and one carer were interviewed. All had participated in an individualized therapy programme, using a combination of face-to-face and video consults with therapists. The programme used 'off-the-shelf' technologies including iPads for videoconferencing and electronic FitBit(R) devices. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo software. Results Thematic analysis resulted in five emergent themes: (i) telerehabilitation is convenient; (ii) telerehabilitation promotes motivation and self-awareness; (iii) telerehabilitation fosters positive therapeutic relationships; (iv) mastering technologies used by younger relatives is a valued aspect of telerehabilitation; and (v) Telerehabilitation does not replace traditional face-to-face rehabilitation therapies. Conclusions Participants found telerehabilitation convenient and motivating, coped well with the technology and developed positive therapeutic relationships. The learning and practice aspects sat well in the context of a rehabilitation programme. The use of commercially available technologies may have contributed to respondents' high levels of acceptability. The perception of telerehabilitation as complementary to in-person care and the expectation of technological support have implications for the implementation and delivery of telerehabilitation services to older people.";2017;3
Background and objectiveTelerehabilitation has the potential to increase access to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for patients with COPD who have difficulty accessing centre-based PR due to poor mobility, lack of transport and cost of travel. We aimed to determine the effect of supervised, home-based, real-time videoconferencing telerehabilitation on exercise capacity, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and physical activity in patients with COPD compared with usual care without exercise training. MethodsPatients with COPD were randomized to either a supervised home-based telerehabilitation group (TG) that received exercise training three times a week for 8weeks or a control group (CG) that received usual care without exercise training. Outcomes were measured at baseline and following the intervention. ResultsThirty-six out of 37 participants (meanSD age=74 +/- 8years, forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1 )=64 +/- 21% predicted) completed the study. Compared with the CG, the TG showed a statistically significant increase in endurance shuttle walk test time (mean difference=340s (95% CI: 153-526, P<0.001)), an increase in self-efficacy (mean difference=8 points (95% CI: 2-14, P<0.007)), a trend towards a statistically significant increase in the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire total score (mean difference=8 points (95% CI: -1 to 16, P=0.07)) and no difference in physical activity (mean difference=475 steps per day (95% CI: -200 to 1151, P=0.16)). ConclusionThis study showed that telerehabilitation improved endurance exercise capacity and self-efficacy in patients with COPD when compared with usual care.;2017;3
Background and Purpose: Stroke, predominantly a condition of older age, is a major cause of acquired disability in the global population and puts an increasing burden on health care resources. Clear evidence for the importance of intensity of therapy in optimizing functional outcomes is found in animal models, supported by neuroimaging and behavioral research, and strengthened by recent meta-analyses from multiple clinical trials. However, providing intensive therapy using conventional treatment paradigms is expensive and sometimes not feasible because of social and environmental factors. This article addresses the need for cost-effective increased intensity of practice and suggests potential benefits of telehealth (TH) as an innovative model of care in physical therapy. Summary of Key Points: We provide an overview of TH and present evidence that a web-supported program, used in conjunction with constraint-induced therapy (CIT), can increase intensity and adherence to a rehabilitation regimen. The design and feasibility testing of this web-based program, LifeCIT, is presented. We describe how wearable sensors can monitor activity and provide feedback to patients and therapists. The methodology for the development of a wearable device with embedded inertial and mechanomyographic sensors, algorithms to classify functional movement, and a graphical user interface to present meaningful data to patients to support a home exercise program is explained. Recommendations for Clinical Practice: We propose that wearable sensor technologies and TH programs have the potential to provide most-effective, intensive, home-based stroke rehabilitation.;2017;3
Background Exercise rehabilitation is highly recommended by current guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease, but its implementation is still poor. Many clinicians experience difficulties in prescribing exercise in the presence of different concomitant cardiovascular diseases and risk factors within the same patient. It was aimed to develop a digital training and decision support system for exercise prescription in cardiovascular disease patients in clinical practice: the European Association of Preventive Cardiology Exercise Prescription in Everyday Practice and Rehabilitative Training (EXPERT) tool. Methods EXPERT working group members were requested to define (a) diagnostic criteria for specific cardiovascular diseases, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and other chronic non-cardiovascular conditions, (b) primary goals of exercise intervention, (c) disease-specific prescription of exercise training (intensity, frequency, volume, type, session and programme duration), and (d) exercise training safety advices. The impact of exercise tolerance, common cardiovascular medications and adverse events during exercise testing were further taken into account for optimized exercise prescription. Results Exercise training recommendations and safety advices were formulated for 10 cardiovascular diseases, five cardiovascular disease risk factors (type 1 and 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia), and three common chronic non-cardiovascular conditions (lung and renal failure and sarcopaenia), but also accounted for baseline exercise tolerance, common cardiovascular medications and occurrence of adverse events during exercise testing. An algorithm, supported by an interactive tool, was constructed based on these data. This training and decision support system automatically provides an exercise prescription according to the variables provided. Conclusion This digital training and decision support system may contribute in overcoming barriers in exercise implementation in common cardiovascular diseases.;2017;3
Background New technologies in telemedicine may be able to solve impeding supply gaps which are associated with demographic change in Germany. This study evaluated the acceptance of emotion-sensitive training systems for individuals with facial palsy. Methods 76 patients with facial-paralysis and 44 of their relatives where surveyed for technology acceptance and affinity, mental and physical health-related quality of life (HrQoL), depression (PHQ9), social anxiety (LSAS) and dysfunction of facial expression (FACE, patients only). Additional items assessed the patients. attitudes regarding therapeutic benefit, data protection and design of human-machine-interfaces. We compared patients and their relatives with univariate tests. Predictors of the patients' technology acceptance were analysed using a Structural Equation Model. Results Patients and their relatives reported positive attitudes towards therapeutic benefit, data protection and design of the interfaces. No significant differences between both groups were found. The strongest predictor of patients. technology acceptance was their technical competence. Furthermore, patients with more severe impairment of facial expression and higher depression scores rated significantly higher acceptance. Conclusion Emotion-sensitive training systems for patients with facial palsy seem to be a useful therapeutic option if the patients. attitudes are considered. Especially patients with severe impairment would accept telemedicine technologies. One focus of the development of such systems should be easy handling of human-machine-interfaces.;2017;3
Background The use of telehealth steadily increases as it has become a viable modality to patient care. Early adopters attempt to use telehealth to deliver high-quality care. Patient satisfaction is a key indicator of how well the telemedicine modality met patient expectations. Objective The objective of this systematic review and narrative analysis is to explore the association of telehealth and patient satisfaction in regards to effectiveness and efficiency. Methods Boolean expressions between keywords created a complex search string. Variations of this string were used in Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and MEDLINE. Results 2193 articles were filtered and assessed for suitability (n=44). Factors relating to effectiveness and efficiency were identified using consensus. The factors listed most often were improved outcomes (20%), preferred modality (10%), ease of use (9%), low cost 8%), improved communication (8%) and decreased travel time (7%), which in total accounted for 61% of occurrences. Conclusion This review identified a variety of factors of association between telehealth and patient satisfaction. Knowledge of these factors could help implementers to match interventions as solutions to specific problems.;2017;3
"Background. Although rehabilitation therapy is commonly provided after stroke, many patients do not derive maximal benefit because of access, cost, and compliance. A telerehabilitation-based program may overcome these barriers. We designed, then evaluated a home-based telerehabilitation system in patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Methods. Patients were 3 to 24 months poststroke with stable arm motor deficits. Each received 28 days of telerehabilitation using a system delivered to their home. Each day consisted of 1 structured hour focused on individualized exercises and games, stroke education, and an hour of free play. Results. Enrollees (n = 12) had baseline Fugl-Meyer (FM) scores of 39 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD). Compliance was excellent: participants engaged in therapy on 329/336 (97.9%) assigned days. Arm repetitions across the 28 days averaged 24,607 +/- 9934 per participant. Arm motor status showed significant gains (FM change 4.8 +/- 3.8 points, P = .0015), with half of the participants exceeding the minimal clinically important difference. Although scores on tests of computer literacy declined with age (r = -0.92; P < .0001), neither the motor gains nor the amount of system use varied with computer literacy. Daily stroke education via the telerehabilitation system was associated with a 39% increase in stroke prevention knowledge (P = .0007). Depression scores obtained in person correlated with scores obtained via the telerehabilitation system 16 days later (r = 0.88; P = .0001). In-person blood pressure values closely matched those obtained via this system (r = 0.99; P < .0001). Conclusions. This home-based system was effective in providing telerehabilitation, education, and secondary stroke prevention to participants. Use of a computer-based interface offers many opportunities to monitor and improve the health of patients after stroke.";2017;3
Background. Exercise and physical activity are a core component of knee osteoar-thritis (OA) care, yet access to physical therapists is limited for many people. Telephone service delivery models may increase access. Objective. Determine the effectiveness of incorporating exercise advice and behavior change support by physical therapists into an existing Australian nurse-led musculoskeletal telephone service for adults with knee OA. Design. Randomized controlled trial with nested qualitative studies Setting. Community, Australia-wide Participants. One hundred seventy-five people >= 45 years of age with knee symptoms consistent with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA. Eight musculoskeletal physical therapists will provide exercise advice and support. Intervention. Random allocation to receive existing care or exercise advice in addition to existing care. Existing care is a minimum of one phone call from a nurse for advice on OA self-management. Exercise advice involves 5-10 calls over 6 months from a physical therapist trained in behavior change support to prescribe, monitor, and progress a strengthening exercise program and physical activity plan. Measurements. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Primary outcomes are knee pain and physical function. Secondary outcomes include other measures of knee pain, self-efficacy, physical activity and its mediators, kinesiophobia, health service usage, work productivity, participant-perceived change, and satisfaction. Additional measures include adherence, adverse events, therapeutic alliance, satisfaction with telephone-delivered therapy, and expectation of outcome. Semi-structured interviews with participants with knee OA and therapists will be conducted. Limitations. Physical therapists cannot be blinded. Conclusions. This study will determine if incorporating exercise advice and behavior change support by physical therapists into a nurse-led musculoskeletal telephone service improves outcomes for people with knee OA. Findings will inform development and implementation of telerehabilitation services.;2017;3
Background/Introduction:Early telerehabilitation trials with stroke survivors have shown promising results, but there remains a lack of knowledge of what areas of rehabilitation people with stroke are interested and willing to receive using technology. The purpose of this study was to describe the access to low-cost consumer technologies and willingness to use them to receive rehabilitation services among stroke survivors.Materials and Methods:Participants were included in this survey study if they had a stroke, lived in the community, were 19 years of age or older, and able to understand English. Participants completed a study-specific telerehabilitation survey via phone call, mail, in-person, or online. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and survey responses.Results:One hundred two survey responses were returned, representing a 79.1% response rate. The mean age of this urban (67.3%) and rural (32.7%) sample was 67.6 years. The technologies most commonly owned were as follows: televisions (91%), landline telephones (88.0%), and computers (79.0%). A large proportion of the sample reported an interest to receive assessments (58.4%), training and exercise programs (64.0%), and education (61.4%) via telerehabilitation, however, many were not interested to receive telerehabilitation (approximate to 39%) and believed that the quality of care would be less than in-person rehabilitation (71.0%).Conclusions:The use of consumer technologies for the delivery of rehabilitation services is both feasible and desirable by stroke survivors. Telerehabilitation services at present should augment and not replace in-person rehabilitation. However, in cases where in-person rehabilitation is neither accessible nor possible, telerehabilitation could serve as an acceptable alternative and is a key area for future research.;2017;3
"Background: Although the use of telepractice in speechlanguage therapy for assessment purposes is well documented, its effectiveness and potential for rehabilitation in poststroke aphasia remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a remotely delivered synchronous pragmatic telespeech language therapy for improving functional communication in aphasia. Methods: A pre-/post-test design was chosen in which each participant was his or her own control. Using a telerehabilitation platform and software (Oralys TeleTherapy) based on the Promoting Aphasics' Communicative Effectiveness (PACE) approach, 20 participants with chronic poststroke aphasia received 9 speech therapy sessions over a 3-week period. Results: Teletreatment with the PACE pragmatic rehabilitation approach led to improvements in functional communication, marked by (a) an increase in communication effectiveness, reflecting significantly improved autonomy in functional communication; (b) a decrease in communication exchange duration, meaning that the treatment made communication faster and more efficient; (c) a decrease in the number of communication acts, meaning that, after treatment, less information was needed to be efficiently understood by the communication partner; and (d) an increase in the number of different communication strategies used, meaning that the treatment fostered the use of a variety of alternative communication modes. Conclusions: This study provides additional arguments about the benefits of telerehabilitation for poststroke patients with aphasia. It showed that multimodal language therapy delivered through synchronous telerehabilitation had positive effects on functional communication in chronic aphasia.";2017;3
Background: Cardiac rehabilitation has beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, but is vastly underutilised and short-term improvements are often not sustained. Telerehabilitation has the potential to overcome these barriers, but its superiority has not been convincingly demonstrated yet. This may be due to insufficient focus on behavioural change and development of patients' self-management skills. Moreover, potentially beneficial communication methods, such as internet and video consultation, are rarely used. We hypothesise that, when compared to centre-based cardiac rehabilitation, cardiac telerehabilitation using evidence-based behavioural change strategies, modern communication methods and on-demand coaching will result in improved self-management skills and sustainable behavioural change, which translates to higher physical activity levels in a cost-effective way. Methods: This randomised controlled trial compares cardiac telerehabilitation with centre-based cardiac rehabilitation in patients with coronary artery disease. We randomise 300 patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (control group) or cardiac telerehabilitation (intervention group). The core component of the intervention is a patient-centred web application, which enables patients to adjust rehabilitation goals, inspect training and physical activity data, share data with other caregivers and to use video consultation. After six supervised training sessions, the intervention group continues exercise training at home, wearing an accelerometer and heart rate monitor. In addition, physical activity levels are assessed by the accelerometer for four days per week. Patients upload training and physical activity data weekly and receive feedback through video consultation once a week. After completion of the rehabilitation programme, on-demand coaching is performed when training adherence or physical activity levels decline with 50% or more. The primary outcome measure is physical activity level, assessed at baseline, three months and twelve months, and is calculated from accelerometer and heart rate data. Secondary outcome measures include physical fitness, quality of life, anxiety and depression, patient empowerment, patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. Discussion: This study is one of the first studies evaluating effects and costs of a cardiac telerehabilitation intervention comprising a combination of modern technology and evidence-based behavioural change strategies including relapse prevention. We hypothesise that this intervention has superior effects on exercise behaviour without exceeding the costs of a traditional centre-based intervention.;2017;3
"Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature death and disability in Europe, accounting for 4 million deaths per year and costing the European Union economy almost (sic)196 billion annually. There is strong evidence to suggest that exercise-based secondary rehabilitation programs can decrease the mortality risk and improve health among patients with CVD. Theory-informed use of behavior change techniques (BCTs) is important in the design of cardiac rehabilitation programs aimed at changing cardiovascular risk factors. Electronic health (eHealth) is the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for health. This emerging area of health care has the ability to enhance self-management of chronic disease by making health care more accessible, affordable, and available to the public. However, evidence-based information on the use of BCTs in eHealth interventions is limited, and particularly so, for individuals living with CVD. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the application of BCTs in eHealth interventions designed to increase physical activity (PA) in CVD populations. Methods: A total of 7 electronic databases, including EBSCOhost (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, SPORTDiscus with Full Text, and CINAHL Complete), Scopus, and Web of Science (Core Collection) were searched. Two authors independently reviewed references using the software package Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation). The reviewers met to resolve any discrepancies, with a third independent reviewer acting as an arbitrator when required. Following this, data were extracted from the papers that met the inclusion criteria. Bias assessment of the studies was carried out using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias within Covidence; this was followed by a narrative synthesis. Results: Out of the 987 studies that were identified, 14 were included in the review. An additional 9 studies were added following a hand search of review paper references. The average number of BCTs used across the 23 studies was 7.2 (range 1-19). The top three most frequently used BCTs included information about health consequences (78%, 18/23), goal setting (behavior; 74%, 17/23), and joint third, self-monitoring of behavior and social support (practical) were included in 11 studies (48%, 11/23) each. Conclusions: This systematic review is the first to investigate the use of BCTs in PA eHealth interventions specifically designed for people with CVD. This research will have clear implications for health care policy and research by outlining the BCTs used in eHealth interventions for chronic illnesses, in particular CVD, thereby providing clear foundations for further research and developments in the area.";2017;3
Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease that requires multiple care providers working together closely. Recent advances in telemedicine technologies have generated enormous potential benefits for COPD management and care. This review aims to explore the clinical, economic, organizational and patient-quality-of-life impact from using telemedicine systems for COPD and to provide a comprehensive description of these methodologies. Methods: We conducted a structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature using a focused review question. We include quantitative and qualitative studies. Data extraction and quality assessment of the reviewed studies were done with standardized forms and checklists. Results: The support of evidence from studies points to beneficial results of telemedicine in its various manifestations. Benefits include the reduction of emergency department attendances and hospitalizations, but little evidence has been found to make a strong case for telemedicine regarding the quality of life or economic improvements. Internal organizational consequences of telemedicine are frequent and efficient use of the technology requires organizational changes. Telemedicine modifies traditional practices and can help patients better engage in managing their health. Nevertheless, telemedicine must be integrated into a care process and within a care model. Conclusion: COPD telemedicine interventions could significantly reduce the risk of emergency department attendance and hospitalization. It is an important area of research, and further studies of the effect of telemedicine for patients with COPD would be beneficial.;2017;3
Background: Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) is shown to reduce disability, increase use of the more affected arm/hand, and promote brain plasticity for individuals with upper extremity hemiparesis post-stroke. Randomized controlled trials consistently demonstrate that CI therapy is superior to other rehabilitation paradigms, yet it is available to only a small minority of the estimated 1.2 million chronic stroke survivors with upper extremity disability. The current study aims to establish the comparative effectiveness of a novel, patient-centered approach to rehabilitation utilizing newly developed, inexpensive, and commercially available gaming technology to disseminate CI therapy to underserved individuals. Video game delivery of CI therapy will be compared against traditional clinic-based CI therapy and standard upper extremity rehabilitation. Additionally, individual factors that differentially influence response to one treatment versus another will be examined. Methods: This protocol outlines a multi-site, randomized controlled trial with parallel group design. Two hundred twenty four adults with chronic hemiparesis post-stroke will be recruited at four sites. Participants are randomized to one of four study groups: (1) traditional clinic-based CI therapy, (2) therapist-as-consultant video game CI therapy, (3) therapist-as-consultant video game CI therapy with additional therapist contact via telerehabilitation/video consultation, and (4) standard upper extremity rehabilitation. After 6-month follow-up, individuals assigned to the standard upper extremity rehabilitation condition crossover to stand-alone video game CI therapy preceded by a therapist consultation. All interventions are delivered over a period of three weeks. Primary outcome measures include motor improvement as measured by the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), quality of arm use for daily activities as measured by Motor Activity Log (MAL), and quality of life as measured by the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (NeuroQOL). Discussion: This multi-site RCT is designed to determine comparative effectiveness of in-home technology-based delivery of CI therapy versus standard upper extremity rehabilitation and in-clinic CI therapy. The study design also enables evaluation of the effect of therapist contact time on treatment outcomes within a therapist-as-consultant model of gaming and technology-based rehabilitation.;2017;3
Background: Despite compelling evidence linking physical activity and quality of life among adults with spinal cord injury (SCI), exercise participation rates are extremely low in this population. Unfortunately, a lack of behavioral exercise interventions, in particular theory-based randomized controlled trials (RCT), exists within the SCI literature. A pilot RCT is needed to first examine the feasibility to conduct such interventions and determine the appropriate effect size to inform future full-scale interventions. Objective: The overall goal of this pilot RCT is to test an 8-week innovative, video-based telerehabilitation intervention based on self-determination theory and aimed at enhancing the basic psychological needs, motivation, exercise participation, and quality of life. related outcomes of adults with paraplegia. The objectives are to (1) determine if individuals in the intervention group have greater increases in their basic psychological needs and autonomous motivation and a decrease in controlled motivation compared to the control group, (2) determine whether the intervention group reports greater increases in exercise participation and quality of life. related variables (eg, life satisfaction, participation in daily/social activities, depressive symptoms) compared to the control group, and (3) examine if adults with paraplegia who received the intervention report improved scores on psychosocial predictors of exercise (eg, action planning) and well-being (eg, positive affect) compared to the control group. We also aimed to examine the implementation characteristics of the intervention (eg, satisfaction with the technology, counselor's ability to foster the psychological needs). Methods: Adults with paraplegia (N=24) living in the community will be recruited. All participants will be invited to complete assessments of their psychological needs, motivation, exercise, and quality of life. related variables at three time points (baseline, 6, and 10 weeks). Following the baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group will participate in 8 weekly, 1-hour video-based telerehabilitation sessions with a trained physical activity counselor, while participants in the control group will be asked to continue with their regular routine. Results: We expect higher ratings of the basic psychological needs and autonomous motivation and lower scores for controlled motivation for the intervention group compared to the control group (Objective 1). We also expect that our video-based intervention will have moderate effects on exercise participation, as well as small-to-moderate positive effects on the quality of life-related variables (Objective 2). Finally, we expect the intervention to have a small positive effect on psychosocial predictors of physical activity and well-being (Objective 3). Conclusions: We anticipate that the results will show that the intervention is appropriate for adults with paraplegia and feasible to test in a full-scale RCT.;2017;3
"Background: Effective, accessible biopsychosocial treatments are needed to manage chronic knee pain on a population level. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of Internet-delivered, physiotherapist-prescribed home exercise and pain-coping skills training (PCST). Design: Pragmatic parallel-group randomized, controlled trial. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12614000243617) Setting: Community (Australia). Patients: 148 persons aged 50 years or older with chronic knee pain. Intervention: The intervention was delivered via the Internet and included educational material, 7 videoconferencing (Skype [Microsoft]) sessions with a physiotherapist for home exercise, and a PCST program over 3 months. The control was Internetbased educational material. Measurements: Primary outcomes were pain during walking (11-point numerical rating scale) and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were knee pain, quality of life, global change (overall, pain, and functional status), arthritis selfefficacy, coping, and pain catastrophizing. Outcomes were also measured at 9 months. Results: Of participants enrolled, 139 (94%) completed primary outcome measures at 3 months and 133 (90%) completed secondary outcome measures at 9 months; multiple imputation was used for missing data. The intervention group reported significantly more improvement in pain (mean difference, 1.6 units [95% CI, 0.9 to 2.3 units]) and physical function (mean difference, 9.3 units [CI, 5.9 to 12.7 units]) than the control group at 3 months, and improvements were sustained at 9 months (mean differences, 1.1 units [CI, 0.4 to 1.8 units] and 7.0 units [CI, 3.4 to 10.5 units], respectively). Intervention participants showed significantly more improvement in most secondary outcomes than control participants. At both time points, significantly more intervention participants reported global improvements. Limitation: Participants were unblinded. Conclusion: For persons with chronic knee pain, Internetdelivered, physiotherapist-prescribed exercise and PCST provide clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function that are sustained for at least 6 months.";2017;3
"Background: Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct (EVA) is one of the most common congenital malformations associated with sensorineural or mixed hearing loss. The association between hearing loss and EVA is described in syndromic (i.e. Pendred Syndrome, BOR, Waardenburg) and non-syndromic disorders, as isolate or familiar mutations of the SLC26A4 gene. The audiological phenotype of the EVA syndrome is heterogeneous, the type and entity of hearing loss may vary and vertigo episodes might also be present. Objective: The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical and genetic features of a group of adolescent subjects presenting an EVA clinical profile, considering the presence of SLC26A4 gene mutations. Methods: 14 Caucasian patients were assessed (24 ears in total; 4 patients presented a monolateral EVA), 10 females and 4 males. Their age at the time of diagnosis was between 1 and 6 years (mean age 2.5 years). Subjects were assessed by an ENT microscopy evaluation with a complete audiometric assessment, CT & MRI scans and genetic tests for the evaluation of the pendrin gene mutations (SLC26A4). Results: Considering the presence of SLC26A4 mutations and thyroid function, we could identify three sub-groups of patients: group 1, non syndromic EVA (ns EVA, no SLC26A4 mutation and no thyroid dysfunction); group 2, EVA with DFNB4 (single SLC26A4 gene mutation and no thyroid dysfunction); group 3, EVA with Pendred Syndrome (two pathological mutation of SLC26A4 and thyromegaly with thyroid dysfunction). Patients of group 1 (ns-EVA) showed various degrees of hearing loss from mild (55%) to severe-profound (45%). In groups 2 (DFNB4) and 3 (PDS), the degree of hearing loss is severe to profound in 70-75% of the cases; middle and high frequencies are mainly involved. Conclusions: The phenotypic expressions associated with the EVA clinical profile are heterogeneous. From the available data, it was not possible to identify a representative audiological profile, in any of the three sub-groups. The data suggest that: (i) a later onset of hearing loss is usually related to EVA, in absence of SLC26A4 gene mutations; and (ii) hearing loss is more severe in patients with SLC26A4 gene mutations (groups 2 and 3 of this study).

"Background: Finding innovative and cost-efficient care strategies that induce long-term health benefits in cardiac patients constitutes a big challenge today. The aim of this Telerehab III follow-up study was to assess whether a 6-month additional cardiac telerehabilitation programme could induce long-term health benefits and remain cost-efficient after the tele-intervention ended. Methods and results: A total of 126 cardiac patients first completed the multicentre, randomised controlled telerehabilitation trial (Telerehab III, time points t(0) to t(1)). They consequently entered the follow-up study (t(1)) with evaluations 2 years later (t(2)). A quantitative analysis of peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak, primary endpoint), international physical activity questionnaire self-reported physical activity and HeartQoL quality of life (secondary endpoints) was performed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. Even though a decline in VO2 peak (248ml/[min*kg] at t(1) and 226ml/[min*kg] at t(2); P <= 0.001) was observed within the tele-intervention group patients; overall they did better than the no tele-intervention group (P=0.032). Dividing the incremental cost (-(sic)878/patient) by the differential incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.22 QALYs) yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -(sic)3993/QALY. Conclusions: A combined telerehabilitation and centre-based programme, followed by transitional telerehabilitation induced persistent health benefits and remained cost-efficient up to 2 years after the end of the intervention. A partial decline of the benefits originally achieved did occur once the tele-intervention ended. Healthcare professionals should reflect on how innovative cost-efficient care models could be implemented in standard care. Future research should focus on key behaviour change techniques in technology-based interventions that enable full persistence of long-term behaviour change and health benefits.";2017;3
"BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) recipients require close follow-up that can be difficult for patients who have to travel long distances for clinic follow-up. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes between ICD patients followed-up in a telemedicine video-conferencing clinic (TMVC) and a conventional in-person clinic (CIC). We hypothesized that outcomes of patients followed in the TMVC are noninferior to the CIC. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study compares time to first appropriate ICD therapy, time to first inappropriate ICD therapy, time to first shock, and overall survival in patients followed in TMVC compared with CIC between 2001 and 2016. Two hundred and eighty-seven patients were followed in the TMVC group and 236 patients in the CIC. The average age of the TMVC and CIC groups was 64.13 +/- 9.38 and 65.23 +/- 8.57 years, respectively (P=0.164). There was no difference in the modified Seattle heart failure model score between the 2 groups (-0.12 +/- 1.0 versus -0.21 +/- 0.99; P=0.287). The Charlson comorbidity index score was higher in the CIC group compared with the TMVC group (7.0 versus 6.0; P= 0.01). Mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. Adjusted and unadjusted tests of noninferiority found TMVC was not inferior to in-person follow-up for the prespecified outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Video-conferencing ICD follow-up for patients in areas where electrophysiology subspecialty care is not available leads to outcomes that are noninferior to CIC follow-up.";2017;3
"Background: In April 2016, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services initiated mandatory 90-day bundled payments for total hip and knee arthroplasty for much of the country. Our goal was to determine duration of care, 90-day charges, and readmission rates by discharge disposition and U.S. region after hip or knee arthroplasty. Methods: Using the 2008 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review database 100% sample, we identified patients who had undergone elective primary total hip or knee arthroplasty. We collected data on patient age, sex, comorbidities, U.S. Census region, discharge disposition, duration of care, 90-day charges, and readmission. Multivariate regression was used to assess factors associated with readmission (logistic) and charges (linear). Significance was set at p < 0.01. Results: Patients undergoing 138,842 total hip arthroplasties were discharged to home (18%), home health care (34%), extended-care facilities (35%), and inpatient rehabilitation (13%); patients undergoing 329,233 total knee arthroplasties were discharged to home (21%), home health care (38%), extended-care facilities (31%), and inpatient rehabilitation (10%). Patients in the Northeast were more likely to be discharged to extended-care facilities or inpatient rehabilitation than patients in other regions. Patients in the West had the highest 90-day charges. Approximately 70% of patients were discharged home from extended-care facilities, whereas after inpatient rehabilitation, >50% of patients received home health care. Among those discharged to home, 90-day readmission rates were highest in the South (9.6%) for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and in the Midwest (8.7%) and the South (8.5%) for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Having >= 4 comorbidities, followed by discharge to inpatient rehabilitation or an extended-care facility, had the strongest associations with readmission, whereas the region of the West and the discharge disposition to inpatient rehabilitation had the strongest association with higher charges. Conclusions: Among Medicare patients, discharge disposition and number of comorbidities were most strongly associated with readmission. Inpatient rehabilitation and the West region had the strongest associations with higher charges.";2017;3
Background: In this study an interactive distance solution (called the DISKO tool) was developed to enable home-based motor training after stroke. Objectives: The overall aim was to explore the feasibility and safety of using the DISKO-tool, customized for interactive stroke rehabilitation in the home setting, in different rehabilitation phases after stroke. Methods: Fifteen patients in three different stages in the continuum of rehabilitation after stroke participated in a home-based training program using the DISKO-tool. The program included 15 training sessions with recurrent follow-ups by the integrated application for video communication with a physiotherapist. Safety and feasibility were assessed from patients, physiotherapists, and a technician using logbooks, interviews, and a questionnaire. Qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics were used in the analysis. Results: Fourteen out of 15 patients finalized the training period with a mean of 19.5 minutes spent on training at each session. The DISKO-tool was found to be useful and safe by patients and physiotherapists. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of the DISKO-tool and provides guidance in further development and testing of interactive distance technology for home rehabilitation, to be used by health care professionals and patients in different phases of rehabilitation after stroke.;2017;3
Background: Loss of upper-extremity motor function is one of the most debilitating deficits following stroke. Two promising treatment approaches, action observation therapy (AOT) and mirror therapy (MT), aim to enhance motor learning and promote neural reorganization in patients through different afferent inputs and patterns of visual feedback. Both approaches involve different patterns of motor observation, imitation, and execution but share some similar neural bases of the mirror neuron system. AOT and MT used in stroke rehabilitation may confer differential benefits and neural activities that remain to be determined. This clinical trial aims to investigate and compare treatment effects and neural activity changes of AOT and MT with those of the control intervention in patients with subacute stroke. Methods/design: An estimated total of 90 patients with subacute stroke will be recruited for this study. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive AOT, MT, or control intervention for a 3-week training period (15 sessions). Outcome measurements will be taken at baseline, immediately after treatment, and at the 3-month followup. For the magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we anticipate that we will recruit 12 to 15 patients per group. The primary outcome will be the Fugl-Meyer Assessment score. Secondary outcomes will include the modified Rankin Scale, the Box and Block Test, the ABILHAND questionnaire, the Questionnaire Upon Mental Imagery, the Functional Independence Measure, activity monitors, the Stroke Impact Scale version 3.0, and MEG signals. Discussion: This clinical trial will provide scientific evidence of treatment effects on motor, functional outcomes, and neural activity mechanisms after AOT and MT in patients with subacute stroke. Further application and use of AOT and MT may include telerehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation through web-based or video teaching.;2017;3
Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a widespread progressive neurologic disease with consequent impairments in daily activities. Disorders of balance are frequent and equilibrium tests are potentially useful to quantify disability and to verify treatment effectiveness. The fair sensitivity of the widely used not-perturbed tests to detect balance disturbances in MS patients have prompted the development of mechatronic systems capable to impose known equilibrium perturbations, in order to challenge the balance control and, consequently, to better assess the level of impairment. We sought to clarify whether the proposed perturbed-test is capable to discriminate healthy subjects from patients with MS, even in mild or in the absence of clinically evident balance disturbances. Methods: We assessed balance performances of 17 adults with MS and 13 age-matched healthy controls (HC) using both perturbed (PT) and not-perturbed (NPT) postural tests by means of a 3 Degree Of Freedom (DOF) rotational mechatronic platform. Participants stood barefoot on the platform in standing position and their center of pressure (CoP) was gathered by using a pressure matrix. Each trial lasted 30 s and was carried out with and without visual stimuli. Several postural indices were computed for each trial. Correlations between postural indices and clinical scales were analyzed. Results: No significant differences were found between groups for all indices when subjects performed NPTs. Conversely, significant differences in postural indices between MS and HC emerged during PTs. Additionally, PTs revealed significant differences between patients without any cerebellar impairment (cerebellar EDSS subscore equal to 0) and HC. The discrimination capability of PTs was confirmed by the ROC analysis. No significant change of the selected metrics occurred in HC when NPTs were performed with eyes closed, while indices presented a significant worsening in MS subjects. Conclusions: Not-perturbed tests showed lower sensitivity than perturbed ones in the identification of equilibrium impairments in minimally disabled MS patients. However, not-perturbed tests allow to better evaluate the influence of visual flow disturbances on balance control in MS. In conclusion, our findings proved that the use of the novel tests based on a 3DOF mechatronic device represents an effective tool to investigate early balance disturbances in MS.;2017;3
"Background: Patient-centered design that addresses patients' preferences and needs is considered an important aim for improving health care systems. At present, within the field of pain rehabilitation, patients' preferences regarding telerehabilitation remain scarcely explored and little is known about the optimal combination between human and electronic contact from the patients' perspective. In addition, limited evidence is available about the best way to explore patients' preferences. Therefore, the assessment of patients' preferences regarding telemedicine is an important step toward the design of effective patient-centered care. Objective: To identify which telerehabilitation treatment options patients with chronic pain are most likely to accept as alternatives to conventional rehabilitation and assess which treatment attributes are most important to them. Methods: A discrete choice experiment with 15 choice tasks, combining 6 telerehabilitation treatment characteristics, was designed. Each choice task consisted of 2 hypothetical treatment scenarios and 1 opt-out scenario. Relative attribute importance was estimated using a bivariate probit regression analysis. One hundred and thirty surveys were received, of which 104 were usable questionnaires; thus, resulting in a total of 1547 observations. Results: Physician communication mode, the use of feedback and monitoring technology (FMT), and exercise location were key drivers of patients' treatment preferences (P<. 001). Patients were willing to accept less frequent physician consultation offered mainly through video communication, provided that they were offered FMT and some face-to-face consultation and could exercise outside their home environment at flexible exercise hours. Home-based telerehabilitation scenarios with minimal physician supervision were the least preferred. A reduction in health care premiums would make these telerehabilitation scenarios as attractive as conventional clinic-based rehabilitation. Conclusions: Intermediate telerehabilitation treatments offering FMT, some face-to-face consulting, and a gym-based exercise location should be pursued as promising alternatives to conventional chronic pain rehabilitation. Further research is necessary to explore whether strategies other than health care premium reductions could also increase the value of home telerehabilitation treatment.";2017;3
BACKGROUND: Pre-Employment Functional Assessments (PEFA) are increasingly used in an attempt to obtain objective information on a potential employee's functional capabilities. In rural and remote communities, there is typically reduced access to qualified therapists to perform these assessments, in part attributable to the time and costs associated with travelling to training courses. One potential method of providing the relevant training to conduct PEFAs is through the use of technologies such as videoconferencing or internet-based modules. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of training therapists and therapy students in performing JobFit System PEFAs via technology when compared with a face-to-face control group. METHODS: Fifty-three participants, consisting of 28 professional physiotherapists and occupational therapists, and 25 final year University of Queensland (UQ) physiotherapy and occupational therapy students, underwent JobFit Systems International PEFA training via one of four intervention groups: face-to-face, realtime videoconferencing, group-based online module and individual online module. RESULTS: Of the 53 participants, 49 achieved the minimum competency level of 75% in post-training competency assessments. No significant difference was found in training levels between intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that technology, such as real-time videoconference and online learning modules, can be used to train both therapists and students in how to perform JobFit System PEFAs.;2017;3
"Background: Providing mobility skills training to manual wheelchair (MWC) users can have a positive impact on community participation, confidence and quality of life. Often such training is restricted or not provided at all because of the expense of, and limited access to, occupational and physical therapists before and after discharge. This is particularly true among middle-aged and older adults, who often have limited access to rehabilitation services and require more time to learn motor skills. A monitored MWC skills training home program, delivered using a computer tablet (mHealth), was developed as an alternative approach to service delivery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing this mHealth MWC skills training program among middle-aged and older adults. Methods: A 2 x 2 factorial design randomized controlled trial (RCT) was used to compare the mHealth intervention and control groups, with additional wheeling time as a second factor. Community-dwelling MWC users aged 55 and older, who had used their MWC for less than two years and propelled with two hands, were recruited. Feasibility outcomes related to process, resources, management and treatment criteria were collected. Results: Eighteen participants were recruited, with a retention rate of 94%. Mean (+/- SD) duration for the first and second in-person training sessions were 90.1 +/- 20.5 and 62.1 +/- 5.5 min, respectively. In the treatment group, 78% achieved the minimum amount of home training (i.e., 300 min) over four weeks and 56% achieved the preferred training threshold (i.e., 600 min). Trainers reported only seven minor protocol deviations. No tablets were lost or damaged and there was one incident of tablet malfunction. No injuries or adverse incidents were reported during data collection or training activities. Participants indicated 98% agreement on the post-treatment benefit questionnaire. Discussion: Overall, the study protocol enabled implementation of the intervention in a safe, efficient and acceptable manner. Participant recruitment proved to be challenging, particularly gaining access to individuals who might benefit. Resource issue demands were acceptable for administration of the intervention; data collection was more time-consuming than anticipated but could be reduced with minor revisions. Participant retention and home program treatment adherence was high; both participant and trainer burden was acceptable. Treatment group participants reported a positive experience and clinical benefits from training program. The findings suggest a full-scale RCTevaluating the clinical impact of the Enhancing Participation In the Community by improving Wheelchair Skills (EPIC Wheels) intervention is warranted, provided the recruitment issues are addressed through collaborative partnerships and active recruitment strategies.";2017;3
"Background: Rapid evaluation of dysphagia poststroke significantly lowers rates of aspiration pneumonia. Logistical barriers often significantly delay in-person dysphagia evaluation by speech language pathologists (SLPs) in remote and rural hospitals. Clinical swallow evaluations delivered via telehealth have been validated in a number of clinical contexts, yet no one has specifically validated a teleswallow evaluation for in-hospital post-stroke dysphagia assessment. Methods: A team of 6 SLPs experienced in stroke care and a telestroke neurologist designed, implemented, and tested a teleswallow evaluation for acute stroke patients, in which 100 patients across 2 affiliated, urban certified stroke centers were sequentially evaluated by a bedside and telehealth SLP. Inter-rater reliability was analyzed using percent agreement, Cohen's kappa, Kendall's tau-b, and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests. Logistic regression models accounting for age and gender were used to test the impact of stroke severity and stroke location on agreement. Results: We found excellent agreement for both liquid (91% agreement; kappa = 0.808; Kendall's tau-b = 0.813, p < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed rank = -0.818, p = 0.417) and solid (87% agreement; kappa = 0.792; Kendall's tau-b = 0.844, p < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed rank = 0.243, p = 0.808) dietary textures. From regression modeling, there is suggestive but inconclusive evidence that higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores correlate with lower levels of agreement for liquid diet recommendations (OR [95% CI] 0.895 [0.793-1.01]; p = 0.07). There was no impact of NIHSS score for solid diet recommendations and no impact of stroke location on solid or liquid diet recommendations. Qualitatively, we identified professional, logistical, technical, and patient barriers to implementation, many of which resolved with experience over time. Conclusions: Dysphagia evaluation by a remote SLP via telehealth is safe and effective following stroke. We plan to implement teleswallow across our multistate telestroke network as standard practice for poststroke dysphagia evaluation. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel";2017;3
"Background: Rehabilitation after hospital stay implies several benefits for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); still few patients are referred and participate in rehabilitation programs. We conducted a case study to investigate the effects of interventions targeting the referral, uptake, and completion for a program of early rehabilitation in the primary healthcare sector. Methods: We undertook targeted initiatives to make patients participate in an individualized rehabilitation program with gradual increased intensity. After discharge, primary care COPD nurses and physiotherapists guided patients through progressing exercises in small groups online. Patients proceeded to class-based exercises, patient education and/or leisure activities, or continued telerehabilitation. We evaluated the effects of the intervention by assessing referral rates, completion, and readmission. Results: Sixteen (23% of discharged patients) patients were referred to rehabilitation. In comparison, only I (0.8%) in 131 patients from Vejle hospital was referred to Vejle hospital. Twelve patients completed rehabilitation, all having severe COPD. All started the program within 2 weeks and proceeded to the online-guided exercises within 4 weeks. Study data showed that after 30 days, 1 (6.3%) of the 16 patients in the rehabilitation program had been readmitted compared to 8 (14.8%) of 55 patients who were not referred. After 90 days, 2 (I 2.5%) and 11 (20.0%) patients were readmitted, respectively. The readmission rate showed a nonsignificant decline in patients participating in rehabilitation. Conclusion: This case study showed that the referral rate of patients with COPD to early municipal rehabilitation is extremely low without a targeted effort and still insufficient in spite of a focused intervention. We showed that completion of a municipal rehabilitation program shortly after discharge is possible even for patients with severe COPD. The findings from our pilot study can guide further investigations into the effect of implementation strategies for handovers between health-care sectors to secure early-onset rehabilitation of patients with COPD.";2017;3
"Background: Rehabilitation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a key treatment in COPD. However, despite the existing evidence and a strong recommendation from lung associations worldwide, 50% of patients with COPD decline to participate in COPD rehabilitation program and 30-50% drop-out before completion. The main reasons are severe symptoms, inflexible accessibility and necessity for transportation. Currently there are no well-established and evident rehabilitation alternatives. Supervised online screen rehabilitation could be a useful approach to increase accessibility and compliance. The aim of this multicenter RCT study is to compare the potential benefits of a 10-week online COPD rehabilitation program (CORe) with conventional outpatient COPD rehabilitation (CCRe). Methods: This study is a randomized assessor-and statistician blinded superiority multicenter trial with two parallel groups, employing 1: 1 allocation to the intervention and the comparison group. On the basis of a sample size calculation, 134 patients with severe or very severe COPD and eligible to conventional hospital based outpatient COPD rehabilitation will be included and randomized from eight different hospitals. The CORe intervention group receives group supervised resistance-and endurance training and patient education, 60 min, three times/week for 10 weeks at home via online-screen. The CCRe comparison group receives group based supervised resistance-and endurance training and patient education, 90 min, two times/week for 10 weeks (two hospitals) or 12 weeks (six hospitals) in groups at the local hospital. The primary outcome is change in the 6-min walking distance after 10/12 weeks; the secondary outcomes are changes in 30 s sit-to-stand chair test, physical activity level, symptoms, anxiety and depression symptoms, disease specific and generic quality of life. Primary endpoint is 10/12 weeks from baseline, while secondary endpoints are 22, 36, 62 weeks from baseline assessments. Discussion: The study will likely contribute to knowledge regarding COPD tele-rehabilitation and to which extent it is more feasible and thereby more efficient than conventional COPD rehabilitation in patients with severe and very severe COPD.";2017;3
Background: Shoulder pain is common in society, with high prevalence in the general population. Shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) is the most frequent cause. Patients suffer pain, muscle weakness and loss of movement in the affected joint. Initial treatment is predominantly conservative. The surgical option has high success rates and is often used when conservative strategy fails. Traditional physiotherapy and post-operative exercises are needed for the recovery of joint range, muscle strength, stability and functionality. Telerehabilitation programmes have shown positive results in some orthopaedic conditions after surgery. Customized telerehabilitation intervention programmes should be developed to recover shoulder function after SIS surgery. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a telerehabilitation intervention compared with usual care in patients after subacromial decompression surgery. Methods: We will compare an intervention group receiving videoconferences and a telerehabilitation programme to a control group receiving traditional physiotherapy intervention in a single-blind, randomized controlled noninferiority trial study design. Discussion: Through this study, we will further develop our preliminary data set and practical experience with the telerehabilitation programmes to evaluate their effectiveness and compare this with traditional intervention. We will also explore patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. Patient enrolment is ongoing.;2017;3
"Background: Substantial numbers of U.S. military veterans who served in recent conflicts experience mild traumatic brain injury. Data suggest that as many as 25% of veterans do not have a comprehensive traumatic brain injury evaluation to determine a diagnosis and develop a plan to treat symptoms. Technologies like clinical video telehealth offer a potential means to overcome travel distance and other barriers that can impact veteran receipt of a comprehensive traumatic brain injury evaluation after a positive screening; however, little is known about implementing clinical video telehealth in this context. Objective: To examine the perspectives of Veterans Health Administration health care providers on implementing clinical video telehealth technology for the assessment and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury among veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn. Design: Qualitative; semistructured interviews. Setting: Veterans Health Administration Polytrauma System of Care. Participants: Twenty-six providers who participated in a Veterans Health Administration Rehabilitation and Prosthetic Services Teleconsultation Pilot Project for administering comprehensive traumatic brain injury evaluations over clinical video telehealth. Methods: Semistructured interviews that used content-analytic techniques to assess provider experiences implementing clinical video telehealth for veterans with traumatic brain injury, including inhibiting factors and best practices to administer comprehensive traumatic brain injury evaluations. Results: The most commonly reported inhibiting factors to implementing clinical video telehealth for traumatic brain injury evaluation and treatment included scheduling, setting up the clinic, and conducting physical examinations over a virtual modality. To enhance clinical video telehealth implementation, participants described best practices including establishing solid communication and relationships with staff, building rapport with patients, and recognizing the unique needs of patients with traumatic brain injury. Conclusions: Implementing clinical video telehealth programs involves coordinating multiple steps with providers at different sites, highlighting the need for effective communication. Provider-patient communication also emerged as vital to successful clinical video telehealth implementation. These findings suggest that providers would benefit from efforts to build communication competencies.";2017;3
"Background: The Neurosurgical & Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Screening Clinic and Multidisciplinary Service (N/OPSC&MDS) originated as a complementary, non-surgical pathway for patients referred to public neurosurgical and orthopaedic specialist services. Patient access to the N/OPSC&MDS could potentially be improved with the implementation of telerehabilitation as an additional method of service delivery. Objective: To evaluate service provider's views on (1) current barriers to patients' accessing N/OPSC & MD services, and (2) the implementation of telerehabilitation within the N/OPSC&MDS. Design: Qualitative descriptive study design. Methods: Healthcare providers (n = 26) were recruited from six N/OPSC&MD services located throughout Queensland, Australia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore service providers' views with respect to existing barriers to patients accessing the N/OPSC&MDS, and if telerehabilitation could be feasibly adopted to address current barriers. Results: Template analysis resulted in six themes: (1) barriers to some patients' accessing current N/OPSC&MD services are complex & multifaceted; (2) telerehabilitation could improve patient access to appropriate management for their musculoskeletal condition; (3) telerehabilitation may have limitations when compared to face-to-face healthcare; (4) the delivery of telerehabilitation needs to be flexible; (5) perceived barriers, and (6) facilitators to the successful implementation of telerehabilitation within the N/OPSC&MDS. Conclusion: This study represents a critical step in determining the readiness of service providers for the implementation of telerehabilitation within the N/OPSC&MDS. Although cautious, service providers are overall accepting of the implementation of telerehabilitation, acknowledging that it could eliminate several current barriers, subsequently achieving more equitable access to the service.

Background: The Polish Social Insurance Institution (SII), under its pension prevention initiative, has taken measures to support the patients return to work and thus developed a new model of hybrid, comprehensive, cardiac telerehabilitation (HCCT). The aim of the study was to analyze the effects of HCCT in terms of its acceptance, adherence to and influence on patients' physical capacity and ability to return to work. Material and Methods: The study included 99 patients, aged 54.6 +/- 6.3 years, who suffered from cardiovascular diseases. They participated in a 24-day HCCT consisting of preliminary and final examinations, 10 days of out-patients rehabilitation based on cycloergometer training (5 sessions) and Nordic walking training (10 sessions), and 12 days of home telerehabilitation based on Nordic walking training. The effectiveness of HCCT was assessed by comparing changes in functional capacity expressed by metabolic equivalent of task (MET) and a 6-min walking test (6-MWT) distance from the beginning and the end of HCCT. Acceptance of HCCT was evaluated using a questionnaire. Adherence to HCCT was assessed by the patients' participation in the training sessions. Effectiveness of HCCT in terms of return to work was assessed according to SII definition. Results: Hybrid, comprehensive, cardiac telerehabilitation resulted in significant improvement of functional capaci-ty 7.6 +/- 2.0 vs. 8.1 +/- 2.4 MET (p < 0.0001) and distance in 6-MWT 448.5 +/- 79.2 m vs. 480.5 +/- 84.1 m (p < 0.0001). There were 82.8% of adherent, 16.2% of partially adherent and 1% of non-adherent patients. After HCCT 48 patients were able to return to work. Conclusions: Hybrid, comprehensive, cardiac telerehabilitation was well accepted and led to the improvement of the patients' physical capacity. Adherence to HCCT was high and allowed 48.48% of patients return to work.;2017;3
Background: The rapid advancement in telecommunications on the African continent has opened up avenues for improving medical care to underserved populations. Although the greatest burden of neurological disorders is borne by Low-and-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) including sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is a profound paucity of neurologists to serve the population. Telemedicine presents a promising avenue for effective mobilization and utilization of the few neurologists in Africa. Objective: To systematically review the published literature on the use of telemedicine for improved care and outcomes for patients with neurological disorders in SSA. Methods: We searched PubMed and Cochrane library from January 1, 1980 to April 30, 2017 using the following keywords: Telemedicine neurology Africa, Teleneurology Africa, Telestroke Africa, Telerehabilitation Africa, Telemedicine for epilepsy, Telemedicine for Parkinson's disease Africa, Telemedicine for dementia Africa, Telehealth neurology Africa. Our inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials, or case series that reported the utilization of telemedicine for care/education of individuals with neurological disorders in sub-Saharan Africa. Results: This search yielded 6 abstracts. By consensus between two investigators, 1 publication met the criteria for inclusion and further review. The one study identified utilized telemedicine for the purpose of improving education/knowledge of 16 doctors and 17 allied health professionals in Parkinson's disease (PD) in Cameroon. The study noted feasibility and satisfaction of participants with telemedicine as well as improved knowledge base of participants after the educational course but noted access to healthcare by patients did not change. No studies have evaluated the use of telemedicine for care of patients with neurological disorders. Conclusion: The indication is that teleneurology may be feasible in SSA and studies are needed to assess feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, cost-effectiveness of this promising discipline of neurology in these resource -limited settings. We propose the setting up of trans continental, inter-regional, intra-regional, and national networks of neurologists to utilize teleneurology platforms to improve the reach of neurology care in SSA.

Background: To increase the functional capabilities of stroke subjects during activities of daily living, patients receive rehabilitative training to recover adequate motor control. With the goal to motivate self-training by use of the arm in daily life tasks, a sensor system (Arm Usage Coach, AUC) was developed that provides VibroTactile (VT) feedback if the patient does not move the affected arm above a certain threshold level. The objective of this study is to investigate the usability of this system in stroke subjects. Method: The study was designed as a usability and user acceptance study of feedback modalities. Stroke subjects with mild to moderate arm impairments were enrolled. The subjects wore two AUC devices one on each wrist. VT feedback was given by the device on the affected arm. A semi-structured interview was performed before and after a measurement session with the AUC. In addition, the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire was given. Results: Ten ischemic chronic stroke patients (39 +/- 38 months after stroke) were recruited. Four out of 10 subjects have worn the VT feedback on their dominant, affected arm. In the pre-measurement interview, eight participants indicated a preference for acoustic or visual over VT feedback. In the post evaluation interview, nine of 10 participants preferred VT over visual and acoustic feedback. On average, the AUC gave VT feedback six times during the measurement session. All participants, with the exception of one, used their dominant arm more then the non-dominant. For the SUS, eight participants responded above 80%, one between 70 and 80%, and one participant responded below 50%. Discussion: More patients accepted and valued VT feedback after the test period, hence VT is a feasible feedback modality. The AUC can be used as a telerehabilitation device to train and maintain upper extremity use in daily life tasks.;2017;3
"Background: Total hip or knee replacement is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Physical rehabilitation following total hip or knee replacement is an essential part of the therapy to improve functional outcomes and quality of life. After discharge from inpatient rehabilitation, a subsequent postoperative exercise therapy is needed to maintain functional mobility. Telerehabilitation may be a potential innovative treatment approach. We aim to investigate the superiority of an interactive telerehabilitation intervention for patients after total hip or knee replacement, in comparison to usual care, regarding physical performance, functional mobility, quality of life and pain. Methods/design: This is an open, randomized controlled, multicenter superiority study with two prospective arms. One hundred and ten eligible and consenting participants with total knee or hip replacement will be recruited at admission to subsequent inpatient rehabilitation. After comprehensive, 3-week, inpatient rehabilitation, the intervention group performs a 3-month, interactive, home-based exercise training with a telerehabilitation system. For this purpose, the physiotherapist creates an individual training plan out of 38 different strength and balance exercises which were implemented in the system. Data about the quality and frequency of training are transmitted to the physiotherapist for further adjustment. Communication between patient and physiotherapist is possible with the system. The control group receives voluntary, usual aftercare programs. Baseline assessments are investigated after discharge from rehabilitation; final assessments 3 months later. The primary outcome is the difference in improvement between intervention and control group in 6-minute walk distance after 3 months. Secondary outcomes include differences in the Timed Up and Go Test, the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test, the Stair Ascend Test, the Short-Form 36, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and postural control as well as gait and kinematic parameters of the lower limbs. Baseline-adjusted analysis of covariance models will be used to test for group differences in the primary and secondary endpoints. Discussion: We expect the intervention group to benefit from the interactive, home-based exercise training in many respects represented by the study endpoints. If successful, this approach could be used to enhance the access to aftercare programs, especially in structurally weak areas.";2017;3
"Background: Total hip replacement (THR) is the gold standard treatment for severe hip osteoarthritis. Effectiveness of physical rehabilitation for THR patients following discharge from hospital is supported by evidence; however, barriers such as geographical location and transport can limit access to appropriate health care. One solution to this issue is using an alternative model of care using telerehabilitation technology to deliver rehabilitation programs directly into patients' homes. A telerehabilitation model may also have potential health care cost savings for health care providers. Objective: This study aims to determine if a telerehabilitation model of care delivered remotely is as effective as face-to-face rehabilitation in the THR population and cost effective for health care providers and patients. Methods: A total of 70 people undergoing THR will be recruited to participate in a randomized, single-blind, controlled noninferiority clinical trial. The trial will compare a technology-based THR rehabilitation program to in-person care. On discharge from hospital, participants randomized to the in-person group will receive usual care, defined as a paper home exercise program (HEP) targeting strengthening exercises for quadriceps, hip abductors, extensors, and flexors; they will be advised to perform their HEP 3 times per day. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks postoperatively, they will receive a 30-minute in-person physiotherapy session with a focus on gait retraining and reviewing and progressing their HEP. The telerehabilitation protocol will involve a program similar in content to the in-person rehabilitation program, except delivery will be directly into the homes of the participants via telerehabilitation technology on an iPad. Outcomes will be evaluated preoperatively, day of discharge from in-patient physiotherapy, 6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively. The primary outcome will be the quality of life subscale of the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score, measured at 6 weeks. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses as recommended in the extension of the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline for noninferiority trials will be performed. Results: Recruitment commenced in September 2015 and is expected to be completed by June 2017. Data collection will be completed by December 2017. It is anticipated the results from this trial will be published by July 2018. Conclusions: Previous research investigating telerehabilitation in postoperative orthopedic conditions has yielded promising results. If shown to be as effective as in-person care, telerehabilitation after THR could be helpful in addressing access issues in this population. Furthermore, it may help reduce the cost of health care provision by enabling patients to take a more independent approach to their rehabilitation.";2017;3
"Background: Virtual reality (VR) is becoming a popular alternative to traditional upper and lower limb rehabilitation following a stroke. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of VR interventions for improving balance in a chronic stroke (>= 6 months) population. Data sources: A literature search of Pubmed, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase, Psycinfo, and Web of Science databases was conducted. Study selection: English randomized controlled trials published up to September 2015 assessing balance with VR in chronic stroke participants. Data extraction: Mean and standard deviations from outcome measures were extracted. Pooled standard mean differences +/- standard error were calculated for the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). Results: In total, 20 studies were selected which assessed the Nintendo (R) Wii Fit balance board (n = 7), treadmill training and VR (n = 7), and postural training using VR (n = 6). Significant improvements were found for VR interventions evaluating the BBS (n = 12; MD = 2.94 +/- 0.57; p < 0.001) and TUG (n = 13; MD = 2.49 +/- 0.57; p < 0.001). Sub-analyses revealed postural VR interventions had a significant effect on BBS (n = 5) and TUG (n = 3) scores (BBS: MD = 3.82 +/- 0.79; p < 0.001 and TUG: MD = 3.74 +/- 0.97; p < 0.001). VR and treadmill training (n = 5) had a significant effect on TUG scores (MD = 2.15 +/- 0.89, p = 0.016). Conclusion: Overall, VR interventions compared to conventional rehabilitation had significant improvements. The meta-analyses also suggest that the Nintendo (R) Wii Fit balance board may not be effective, although further confirmatory studies are necessary. Results should be interpreted with caution due to differences in therapy intensities and effect sizes within the included studies.";2017;3
Caregivers report poorer health and wellness than the general population and identify numerous barriers to their attending programs to improve health and wellness. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of employing a telehealth delivery method to enhance access to caregiver wellness programs. This article presents the quantitative results of a mixed methods feasibility study of translating the Powerful Tools for Caregivers (PTC) program to a telehealth delivery format. Four unpaid family caregivers of older adults participated in a telehealth delivered PTC program, a wellness program with established outcomes in the in-person environment. The program was delivered using synchronous videoconferencing methods. High class attendance and a high median total average Telehealth Usability Questionnaire score of 5.7 indicated the telehealth delivery method was feasible. This research suggests that telehealth is a feasible delivery format for a caregiver program traditionally delivered in an in-person format.;2017;3
Cognitive impairment affects more than half of all individuals living with multiple sclerosis (MS). We hypothesized that training at home with an adaptive online cognitive training program would have greater cognitive benefit than ordinary computer games in cognitively-impaired adults with MS. This was a double-blind, randomized, active-placebo-controlled trial. Participants with MS were recruited through Stony Brook Medicine and randomly assigned to either the adaptive cognitive remediation (ACR) program or active control of ordinary computer games for 60 hours over 12 weeks. Training was remotely-supervised and delivered through a study-provided laptop computer. A computer generated, blocked stratification table prepared by statistician provided the randomization schedule and condition was assigned by a study technician. The primary outcome, administered by study psychometrician, was measured by change in a neuropsychological composite measure from baseline to study end. An intent-to-treat analysis was employed and missing primary outcome values were imputed via Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Participants in the ACR (n = 74) vs. active control (n = 61) training program had significantly greater improvement in the primary outcome of cognitive functioning (mean change in composite z score +/- SD: 0.25 +/- 0.45 vs. 0.09 +/- 0.37, p = 0.03, estimated difference = 0.16 with 95% CI: 0.02-0.30), despite greater training time in the active control condition (mean +/- SD: 56.9 +/- 34.6 vs. 37.7 +/- 23.8 hours played, p = 0.006). This study provides Class I evidence that adaptive, computer-based cognitive remediation accessed from home can improve cognitive functioning in MS. This telerehabilitation approach allowed for rapid recruitment and high compliance, and can be readily applied to other neurological conditions associated with cognitive dysfunction.;2017;3
Consumer feedback and end-user perceptions provide important information regarding the clinical acceptability of new telepractice systems. This pilot investigation aimed to evaluate end-user perceptions of a new asynchronous telepractice application, 'SwallowIT', designed to support patients to remotely complete intensive swallowing therapy during curative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC). Insights were sought from 15 patients with oropharyngeal cancer who used SwallowIT to complete supported home swallowing therapy. Perceptions were evaluated via structured questionnaires, completed following initial orientation to SwallowIT and on completion of CRT. Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted >= 3 months post-treatment. The majority of patients reported positive initial perceptions towards SwallowIT for comfort (87%), confidence (87%), motivation (73%) and support (87%). No statistically significant change in perceptions was observed from baseline to end of CRT (p > 0.05). Thematic analysis of interviews revealed four main themes: the ease of use of SwallowIT, motivating factors, circumstances which made therapy difficult, and personal preferences for service-delivery models. These preliminary findings demonstrate that SwallowIT was well-perceived by the current group of HNC consumers and suggest that SwallowIT may be well-accepted as an alternate service-delivery model for delivering intensive swallowing therapy during CRT.;2017;3
Currently, a telerehabilitation system includes a therapist and a patient where the therapist interacts with the patient, typically via a verbal and visual communication, for assessment and supervision of rehabilitation interventions. This mechanism often fails to provide physical assistance, which is a modus operandi during physical therapy or occupational therapy. Incorporating an actuation modality such as functional electrical stimulation (FES) or a robot at the patient's end that can be controlled by a therapist remotely to provide therapy or to assess and measure rehabilitation outcomes can significantly transform current telerehabilitation technology. In this paper, a position-synchronization controller is derived for FES-based telerehabilitation to provide physical assistance that can be controlled remotely. The newly derived controller synchronizes an FES-driven human limb with a remote physical therapist's robotic manipulator despite constant bilateral communication delays. The control design overcomes a major stability analysis challenge: the unknown and unstructured nonlinearities in the FES-driven musculoskeletal dynamics. To address this challenge, the nonlinear muscle model was estimated through two neural network functions that approximated unstructured nonlinearities and an adaptive control law for structured nonlinearities with online update laws. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis was used to prove the globally uniformly ultimately bounded tracking performance. The performance of the state synchronization controller was validated through experiments on an able-bodied subject. Specifically, we demonstrated bilateral control of FES-elicited leg extension and a human-operated robotic manipulator. The controller was shown to effectively synchronize the system despite unknown and different delays in the forward and backward channels.;2017;3
Despite documented benefits, many Total Joint Replacement (TJR) patients find it difficult to access rehabilitation following discharge from hospital. One solution to improve access for TJR patients is telerehabilitation. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of introducing a telerehabilitation program for TJR patients. TJR patients at QEII Jubilee Hospital were invited to complete a questionnaire regarding their access, feelings towards and preferences in using technology. Seventy-five patients were recruited. Most patients had computer access (72%) and internet (69%) at home. Sixty-five percent of participants were willing to participate in telerehabilitation. A significant difference was found between older and younger patients. Watching videos on an electronic device was the preferred method for a technology-based home exercise program and phone call the preferred method of communication. Results indicate telerehabilitation in the TJR population is feasible from the perspective of access to, feelings toward, and preferences for technology.;2017;3
Despite the increased interest of academic scholar in telerehabilitation implementation, there is a scarcity of studies that provide an up to date comprehensive research on it. This study provides a systematic literature review (SLR) on telerehabilitation implementation research. This review explores the processes involved in telerehabilitation implementation, research themes and the factors that influence the implementation of telerehabilitation at pre-implementation stage. In doing this, all relevant articles in the electronic databases of Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, SAGE and Web of Science that published from 2007 to 2017 were reviewed. The results show that four themes have been paid attention by the researchers' including adoption, benefits, readiness and decision making. The factors in the adoption and readiness were found more dominant than others with seven and six factors respectively. Most of the factors from adoption were in the quality aspects (e.g., system quality, information quality and service quality) while change elements (e.g., attributes of the change, attributes of the change targets) in the readiness. Thus, this study suggests that more research is needed for understanding this complex process of telerehabilitation at pre-implementation in a more holistic manner. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Enforcement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) has gotten stricter and penalties have become more severe in response to a significant increase in computer-related information breaches in recent years. With health information said to be worth twice as much as other forms of information on the underground market, making preservation of privacy and security an integral part of health technology development, rather than an afterthought, not only mitigates risks but also helps to ensure HIPAA and HITECH compliance. This paper provides a guide, based on the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) audit protocol, for creating and maintaining an audit checklist for multi-user health kiosks. Implementation of selected audit elements for a multi-user health kiosk designed for use by community-residing older adults illustrates how the guide can be applied.;2017;3
"Every year, approximately 62,000 people with stroke and transient ischemic attack are treated in Canadian hospitals. The 2016 update of the Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations Telestroke guideline is a comprehensive summary of current evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations appropriate for use by all healthcare providers and system planners who organize and provide care to patients following stroke across a broad range of settings. These recommendations focus on the use of telemedicine technologies to rapidly identify and treat appropriate patients with acute thrombolytic therapies in hospitals without stroke specialized expertise; select patients who require to immediate transfer to stroke centers for Endovascular Therapy; and for the patients who remain in community hospitals to facilitate their care on a stroke unit and provide remote access to stroke prevention and rehabilitation services. While these latter areas of Telestroke application are newer, they are rapidly developing, with new opportunities that are yet unrealized. Virtual rehabilitation therapies offer patients the opportunity to participate in rehabilitation therapies, supervised by physical and occupational therapists. While not without its limitations (e.g., access to telecommunications in remote areas, fragmentation of care), the evidence-to-date sets the foundation for improving access to care and management for patients during both the acute phase and now through post stroke recovery.";2017;3
Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation has been introduced in medical practice many years ago, initially only as center-based rehabilitation. It is part of the activities for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and has been effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are commonly used in patients who have had an ischemic event or a myocardial revascularization procedure and in patients with heart failure of various etiologies. However, participation rate in center-based rehabilitation programs is low, especially by the elderly or women, and depending on the variability of the symptoms of cardiovascular disease. Alternative models are mainly based on telerehabilitation techniques and are grouped under the name of home-based rehabilitation. Our study aimed at reviewing the main randomized clinical trials published from January 2012 to December 2016, selected from the MEDLINE, Web of Science and Science Direct databases that compared home-based with center-based rehabilitation or usual care, and were focused on psychosocial outcomes. In the studied articles, the mental and social components were assessed by completing upon enrollment and at various times during reassessment quality of life questionnaires, questionnaires for depression and anxiety and self-perceived stress. Several studies highlight the superiority of home-based rehabilitation in hemodynamically stable patients who wanted to resume their social and professional activities. The outcomes are generally similar in terms of increasing exercise capacity and superior in terms of quality of life, reducing anxiety and depression, or socio-professional reintegration.;2017;3
Hearing plays a crucial role in human development. Receiving and processing sounds are essential for the advancement of the speech ability during the early childhood and for a proper functioning in the society. Hearing loss is one of the most frequent disabilities that affect human senses. It can be caused by genetic or environmental factors or both of them. Calcium-and integrinbinding protein 2 (CIB2) is one of the recently identified genes, involved in HI pathogenesis. CIB2 is widely expressed in various human and animal tissues, mainly in skeletal muscle, nervous tissue, inner ear, and retina. The CIB2 protein is responsible for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in cells and interacting with integrins-transmembrane receptors essential for cell adhesion, migration, and activation of signaling pathways. Calcium signaling pathway is crucial for signal transduction in the inner ear, and integrins regulate hair cell differentiation and maturation of the stereocilia. To date, mutations detected in CIB2 are causative for nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB48) or Usher syndrome type 1 J. Patients harboring biallelic CIB2 mutations suffer from bilateral, early onset, moderate to profound HI. In the paper, we summarize the current status of the research on CIB2.;2017;3
In recent years, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals which are biomedical signals generated by muscles have been utilized to estimate human's muscular torque and predict their intention. In this paper, a variable stiffness exoskeleton which utilizes EMG signals to adjust the stiffness of the output link to meet different environmental requirements and guarantee the wearer's safety has been proposed. There is a stiffness adjustment mechanism located on the forearm part of the exoskeleton. Two dry electrodes which collect sEMG signals from agonist and antagonist muscles pair were attached on the subject's skin of corresponding muscle fibers respectively. The collected sEMG signals could be utilized to adjust the stiffness of output link according to the subject's intention. Combining sEMG signals with variable stiffness actuator (VSA) in the proposed exoskeleton, different outputs of stiffness could be realized in a compact and light hardware system. Experimental results showed the stiffness could be adjusted smoothly according to the Intention-based sEMG control.;2017;3

In this paper we outline a novel design of a wireless sensor wearable band for tracking patient movements. This technology and design has potential applications for rehabilitation of stroke survivors who suffer from spasticity in their upper extremities. This technology could be used to track patient movement performed in a non-clinical environment, such as inside the comfort of their home. Data on their treatment progress could be transmitted wirelessly both to the clinician and to the patient. This technology could help realize increased monitoring of the patient, quantitative data on patient improvement over time and decreased health care costs. In this paper we demonstrated a preliminary prototype which can track and distinguish classes of movement of a user performing elbow flexion exercises while seated at a table. A study was completed with 6 participants with classification accuracies up to 88%.;2017;3
Integrating innovations such as telerehabilitation (TR) into routine clinical care is a complex process. This study aimed to identify the factors which impact on TR implementation and routine use. Methods. A mixed-method prospective single-case study with multiple embedded units of analysis was conducted. Interviews (implementation leaders, clinical champions and upper management) and focus groups with users and non-users of TR were conducted, and TR use was recorded. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Normalization Process Theory were used to examine factors which impacted on TR implementation and routine use. Results. Over 18 months, 155 TR sessions were carried out by 12 clinicians (6% of potential staff), eight of which continued using TR routinely clinical activities. During implementation, deviations to the intended implementation and unexpected delays impacted on TR use. TR continued to be used for some clinical activities. Facilitators and barriers were related to the intervention, the organisations and the health care context. Discussion. Comprehensive frameworks and theories used in long term studies of TR use can help identify factors which impact on implementation and routine clinical use.;2017;3
Introduction Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) independently alters the clinical course of cardiovascular diseases resulting in a significant reduction in all-cause and cardiac mortality. However, only 15%-30% of all eligible patients participate in a phase 2 ambulatory programme. The uptake rate of community-based programmes following phase 2 CR and adherence to long-term exercise is extremely poor. Newer care models, involving telerehabilitation programmes that are delivered remotely, show considerable promise for increasing adherence. In this view, the PATHway (Physical Activity Towards Health) platform was developed and now needs to be evaluated in terms of its feasibility and clinical efficacy. Methods and analysis In a multicentre randomised controlled pilot trial, 120 participants (m/f, age 4080 years) completing a phase 2 ambulatory CR programme will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to PATHway or usual care. PATHway involves a comprehensive, internetenabled, sensor-based home CR platform and provides individualised heart rate monitored exercise programmes (exerclasses and exergames) as the basis on which to provide a personalised lifestyle intervention programme. The control group will receive usual care. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after completion of phase 2 of the CR programme. The primary outcome is the change in active energy expenditure. Secondary outcomes include cardiopulmonary endurance capacity, muscle strength, body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, peripheral endothelial vascular function, patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), well-being, mediators of behaviour change and safety. HRQoL and healthcare costs will be taken into account in cost-effectiveness evaluation. Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This protocol has been approved by the director and clinical director of the PATHway study and by the ethical committee of each participating site. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed scientific journals and presentations at congresses and events.;2017;3
"Introduction It is important to understand the interactions, processes, and issues that occur within telerehabilitation interventions to inform research and practice. The aim of this study was to identify the difficulties reported and intervention features that were captured as helpful in the notes written by occupational therapists during a telerehabilitation trial. Method Administrative documentation in the form of 60 subjective, objective, assessment, and plan notes were collected. The trial examined the effectiveness of three teleconference-delivered interventions: physical activity alone, fatigue management with physical activity, and contact-control social support for people with multiple sclerosis. Results Five themes emerged: desiring change, taking action, experiencing difficulty, infrastructure support, and relief and appreciation. Desiring change captured therapists' observations of clients' desire to manage symptoms and improve participation; it was most apparent at the beginning and supported clients' taking action as the interventions progressed. Therapists identified their own difficulties with group facilitation and time management and clients' difficulties with some intervention materials. Infrastructure support was reported to be helpful in minimizing some of these difficulties. In the end, the therapists expressed relief that the clients appeared to benefit from and appreciate the interventions. Conclusion This study highlights the need for and importance of providing resources and training to support teleconference-delivered interventions in clinical practice.";2017;3
Introduction The aftermath of stroke leaves many consequences including cognitive deficits and falls due to imbalance. Stroke survivors and families struggle to navigate the complex healthcare system with little assistance posthospital discharge, often leading to early hospital readmission and worse stroke outcomes. Telemedicine Guided Education on Secondary Stroke and Fall Prevention Following Inpatient Rehabilitation feasibility study examines whether stroke survivors and their caregivers find value in telerehabilitation (TR) home visits that provide individualised care and education by a multidisciplinary team after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Methods and analysis A prospective, single arm, pilot study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of weekly TR home visits initiated postdischarge from inpatient rehabilitation. Newly diagnosed patients with stroke are recruited from a Houston-based comprehensive stroke centre inpatient rehabilitation unit, loaned an iPad with data plan and trained to use information technology security-approved videoconferencing application. After hospital discharge, six weekly TR home visits are led by rotating specialists (pharmacist, physical/occupational therapist, speech therapist, rehabilitation physician, social worker, geriatrician specialised in fracture prevention) followed by satisfaction survey on week 7. Specialists visually assess patients in real time, educate them on secondary stroke and fall prevention and suggest ways to improve function including direct medical interventions when indicated. Primary outcomes are proportion of eligible patients consenting to the study, participation rate in all six TR home visits and satisfaction score. The study started 31 December 2015 with plan to enrol up to 50 patients over 24 months. Feasibility study results will inform us as to whether a randomised controlled trial is warranted to determine efficacy of TR home visit intervention in improving stroke outcomes. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval obtained by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, IRB number: HSC-MS-14-0994. Study results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.;2017;3
"Introduction. Telerehabilitation enables patients to access remote rehabilitation services for patient-physiotherapist videoconferencing in their own homes. Home-based virtual reality (VR) balance training has been shown to reduce postural instability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The primary aim was to compare improvements in postural stability after remotely supervised in-home VR balance training and in-clinic sensory integration balance training (SIBT). Methods. In this multicenter study, 76 PD patients (modified Hoehn and Yahr stages 2.5-3) were randomly assigned to receive either in-home VR telerehabilitation (n = 38) or in-clinic SIBT (n = 38) in 21 sessions of 50 minutes each, 3 days/week for 7 consecutive weeks. VR telerehabilitation consisted of graded exergames using the Nintendo Wii Fit system; SIBT included exercises to improve postural stability. Patients were evaluated before treatment, after treatment, and at 1-month follow-up. Results. Analysis revealed significant between-group differences in improvement on the Berg Balance Scale for the VR telerehabilitation group (p = 0.04) and significant Time x Group interactions in the Dynamic Gait Index (p = 0.04) for the in-clinic group. Both groups showed differences in all outcome measures over time, except for fall frequency. Cost comparison yielded between-group differences in treatment and equipment costs. Conclusions. VR is a feasible alternative to in-clinic SIBT for reducing postural instability in PD patients having a caregiver.";2017;3
"Introduction: Despite the increased interest in telerehabilitation (TR), virtual reality (VR) and outcome measures for stroke rehabilitation, surprisingly little research has been done to map and identify the most common outcome measures used in TR. For this review, we conducted a systematic search of the literature that reports outcome measures used in TR or VR for stroke rehabilitation. Our specific objectives included: 1) to identify the outcome measures used in TR and VR studies; and 2) to describe which parts of the International Classification of Functioning are measured in the studies. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant electronic databases (e.g. PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, PSYCOINFO, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database). The scoping review included all study designs. Two reviewers conducted pilot testing of the data extraction forms and independently screened all the studies and extracted the data. Disagreements about inclusion or exclusion were resolved by consensus or by consulting a third reviewer. Results: In total, 28 studies were included in this scoping review. The results were synthesized and reported considering the implications of the findings within the clinical practice and policy context. Discussion: This scoping review identified a wide range of outcome measures used in VR and TR studies and helped identify gaps in current use of outcome measures in the literature. The review also informs researchers and end users (i.e. clinicians, policymakers and researchers) regarding the most appropriate outcome measures for TR or VR.";2017;3
Introduction: Following (chemo)radiotherapy (C/RT) for head and neck cancer (HNC), patients return to hospital for regular outpatient reviews with speech pathology (SP) and nutrition and dietetics (ND) for acute symptom monitoring, nutritional management, and swallowing and communication rehabilitation. The aim of the current study was to determine the feasibility of a home-based telehealth model for delivering SP and ND reviews, to provide patients with more convenient access to these appointments. Methods: Service outcomes, costs, and consumer satisfaction were examined across 30 matched participants: 15 supported via the standard model of care (SMOC), and 15 via the home-based telehealth model of care (TMOC). Results: All patients were successfully managed via telehealth. The TMOC was more efficient, with a reduced number (p < 0.003) and duration (p < 0.01) of appointments required until discharge. Significant patient cost savings (p=0.002) were reported for the TMOC due to decreased travel requirements. While staff costs were reduced, additional telehealth equipment levies resulted in a lower but non-significant overall cost difference to the health service when using the TMOC. High satisfaction was reported by all participants attending the TMOC. Discussion: The findings support the feasibility of a home-based telehealth model for conducting SP and ND reviews post C/RT for HNC.;2017;3
"Introduction: Increased physical activity and functional ability are the goals of total knee replacement surgery. Therefore, adequate rehabilitation is required for the recovery of patients after discharge from hospital following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This systematic literature review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of home telerehabilitation in patients who underwent TKA. Methods: Studies published in the English language between 2000 and 2014 were retrieved from Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane databases using relevant search strategies. Two researchers independently reviewed the studies as per the Cochrane methodology for systematic literature review. We considered telerehabilitation sessions as those that were conducted by experienced physiotherapists, using videoconferencing to patients' homes via an internet connection. The outcomes assessed included: knee movement (knee extension and flexion); quadriceps muscle strength; functional assessment (the timed up-and-go test); and assessment of pain, stiffness, and functional capacity using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and visual analogue scale for pain. Results: In total, 160 potentially relevant studies were screened. Following the screening of studies as abstracts and full-text publications, six primary publications (four randomized controlled trials, one non-randomized controlled trial, and one singlearm trial) were included in the review. Patients experienced high levels of satisfaction with the use of telerehabilitation alone. There was no significant difference in change in active knee extension and flexion in the home telerehabilitation group as compared to the control group (mean difference (MD) -0.52, 95% CI -1.39 to 0.35, p = 0.24 and MD 1.14, 95% CI -0.61 to 2.89, p = 0.20, respectively). The patients in the home telerehabilitation group showed improvement in physical activity and functional status similar to patients in the conventional therapy group. Discussion: The evidence from this systematic literature review demonstrated that telerehabilitation is a practical alternative to conventional face-to-face rehabilitation therapy in patients who underwent TKA.";2017;3
"Introduction: Lower limb musculoskeletal disorders place a heavy burden on healthcare systems. Appropriate management of these conditions is critical, however access to appropriate physiotherapy services is difficult for those in geographically remote areas or those with mobility or transport difficulties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of an online musculoskeletal physiotherapy assessment of the knee complex using telerehabilitation compared to traditional faceto-face assessment. Methods: In a repeated-measures design, 18 subjects who sought treatment for knee pain underwent a traditional face-to-face assessment and a remote telerehabilitation assessment. Telerehabilitation assessments were conducted with participants performing facilitated self-palpation, self-applied modified orthopaedic tests, active movements and functional tasks. Results: Primary pathoanatomical diagnoses were in exact agreement in 67% of cases and were similar in 89% of cases. The system of pathology was found to be in agreement in 17 out of 18 cases (94%). Comparisons of objective findings from the two physical assessments demonstrated substantial agreement (kappa = 0.635) for categorical data and binary data (chi-squared = 400.36; p< 0.001). A high level of intra-rater (89%) and moderate level of inter-rater (67%) reliability was evident for telerehabilitation assessments. Discussion: Telerehabilitation assessment of the knee complex appears to be feasible and reliable. This study has implications for clinical practice and the development of physiotherapy services to address the burden of lower limb musculoskeletal pain and disability.";2017;3
Introduction: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an integral part of the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, many patients do not access or complete PR, and long-term exercise maintenance has been difficult to achieve after PR. This study aimed to investigate feasibility, long-term exercise maintenance, clinical effects, quality of life and use of hospital resources of a telerehabilitation intervention. Methods: Ten patients with COPD were offered a two-year follow-up via telerehabilitation after attending PR. The intervention consisted of home exercise, telemonitoring and self-management via a webpage combined with weekly videoconferencing sessions. Equipment included a treadmill, a pulse oximeter and a tablet. Data collected at baseline, one year and two years were six-minute walking distance (6MWD), COPD assessment test (CAT), EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D), hospitalisations and outpatient visits. Results: No dropout occurred. Physical performance, lung capacity, health status and quality of life were all maintained at two years. At one year, 6MWD improved by a mean of 40 metres from baseline, CAT decreased by four points and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) improved by 15.6 points. Discussion: Long-term exercise maintenance in COPD via telerehabilitation is feasible. Results are encouraging and suggest that telerehabilitation can prevent deterioration and improve physical performance, health status and quality of life.;2017;3
Introduction: Successful post-operative telerehabilitation following total knee replacement (TKR) has been documented using synchronous (real-time) video. Bandwidth and the need for expensive hardware are cited as barriers to implementation. Web-based asynchronous visual platforms promise to address these problems but have not been evaluated. We performed a randomized control study comparing an asynchronous video-based software platform to in-person outpatient physical therapy visits following TKR. Materials and methods: Fifty-one patients were randomized to either the intervention group, using an asynchronous video application on a mobile device, or the traditional group undergoing outpatient physical therapy. Outcome data were collected using validated instruments prior to surgery and at a minimum three-month follow-up. Results: Twenty-nine patients completed the study. There were no statistically significant differences in any clinical outcome between groups. The satisfaction with care was equivalent between groups. Overall utilization of hospital-based resources was 60% less than for the traditional group. Discussion: We report that clinical outcomes following asynchronous telerehabilitation administered over the web and through a hand-held device were not inferior to those achieved with traditional care. Outpatient resource utilization was lower. Patient satisfaction was high for both groups. The results suggest that asynchronous telerehabilitation may be a more practical alternative to real-time video visits and are clinically equivalent to the in-person care model.;2017;3
Introduction: Telehealth can be an effective way to provide speech pathology intervention to children with speech and language impairments. However, the provision of reliable and feasible standardised language assessments via telehealth to establish children's needs for intervention and to monitor progress has not yet been well established. Further, there is limited information about children's reactions to telehealth. This study aimed to examine the reliability and feasibility of conducting standardised language assessment with school-aged children with known or suspected language impairment via a telehealth application using consumer grade computer equipment within a public school setting. Method: Twenty-three children (aged 8-12 years) participated. Each child was assessed using a standardised language assessment comprising six subtests. Two subtests were administered by a speech pathologist face-to-face (local clinician) and four subtests were administered via telehealth. All subtests were completed within a single visit to the clinic service, with a break between the face to face and telehealth sessions. The face-to-face clinician completed behaviour observation checklists in the telehealth and face to face conditions and provided feedback on the audio and video quality of the application from the child's point of view. Parent feedback about their child's experience was elicited via survey. Results: There was strong inter-rater reliability in the telehealth and face-to-face conditions (correlation coefficients ranged from r = 0.96-1.0 across the subtests) and good agreement on all measures. Similar levels of attention, distractibility and anxiety were observed in the two conditions. Clinicians rated only one session of 23 as having poor audio quality and no sessions were rated as having poor visual quality. Parent and child reactions to the use of telehealth were largely positive and supportive of using telehealth to assess rural children. Discussion: The findings support the use of telehealth in the language assessment of school-aged children using a web application and commercially available computer equipment. This reliable and innovative service delivery model has the potential to be used by speech pathologists to provide assessments to children in remote communities.;2017;3
Introduction: The increasing pandemic of heart failure is becoming a serious challenge for the health care system. The medical world is searching for solutions which could decrease its scale and improve patients' quality of life and prognosis. Telemanagement of heart failure patients is a new promising option. Technical and technological platforms to perform e-Health management in heart failure patients' homes have become available. This paper's aims are to present different forms of e-Health including telecare, home monitoring of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices, remote monitoring of hemodynamic implantable devices and telerehabilitation in providing optimal long term management for heart failure patients.Areas covered: E-education and self-monitoring, structured telephone support and telemonitoring, remote monitoring of cardiovascular implantable electronics devices and hemodynamic implantable electronic devices and telerehabilitation.Expert commentary: The data analyzed in the paper suggests that remote monitoring is capable of identifying life-threatening deterioration and helps heart failure patients avoid seeking medical assistance in hospitals and that home-based telerehabilitation is well accepted, safe, effective and has high adherence among HF patients.;2017;3
Introduction: This pilot study compared tele-intervention to conventional intervention for children with hearing loss in terms of communication performance, parental perceptions and clinician perceptions. Methods: A within-subject design was employed, including 10 children with hearing loss and their parents who each received a structurally similar tele-intervention and conventional intervention session in a counterbalanced manner. Quality of communication performance was analysed using a modified Tait video analysis method. Parent and clinician perceptions were collected through rating-scale surveys and thematic analysis of qualitative responses. Results: No significant difference (p> 0.05) was found between tele-intervention and conventional intervention in terms of communication performance of children. Parent perceptions were not significantly different (p> 0.05) between conventional and tele-intervention in terms of facilitating meaningful communication interaction. Significant differences were evident for parents' comfort level during the session, whether they found it to be a beneficial experience and whether they would like to continue receiving intervention through this method. Clinician perceptions of conventional and tele-intervention were not significantly different (p> 0.05) and tele-intervention was deemed a valuable method of service delivery for clients. Discussion: This study provides preliminary evidence that tele-intervention is effective for communication intervention and can be a valuable solution to typical barriers such as distance and the shortage of trained interventionists.;2017;3
"Introduction: This study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of video-based telerehabilitation assessments in patients with heart failure. Methods: Seventeen consecutive participants (mean age 69 years, SD 12 years and 88% males) undertook assessments of three functional tests via both telerehabilitation and face-to-face approaches, on the same day. The assessment order was randomised and conducted by independent assessors. Outcome measures included functional tests: timed up and go (time), six-minute walk (distance), grip strength (kilograms); system usability scale to rate participant experience with telerehabilitation assessment; and number of technical issues encountered. Validity and inter-and intra-rater reliability of telerehabilitation assessments were examined using limits of agreement, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), and paired t-tests. Results: The limits of agreement for telerehabilitation assessments were within the clinically acceptable limits for timed up and go and grip strength. Telerehabilitation assessments for all functional tests were strongly associated with face-to-face assessments, with ICCs of between 0.85 and 0.96. Inter-and intra-rater reliability of telerehabilitation assessments for all functional tests were excellent (all ICC > 0.95). The mean (SD) system usability scale score was 85 (15)/100. Some incidences of Internet drop-outs, video freezing and auditory fading occurred. Discussion: The use of telehealth for the assessment of functional exercise capacity appears to be valid and reliable in patients with heart failure.";2017;3
Introduction:Timely access to orthopedic rehabilitation is an important problem for the Ukrainian healthcare system. The international orthopedic community aims to achieve the best possible outcome for patient care by modifying rehabilitation methods and using telemedicine technology. The theme of this article is to discuss the integration of telemedicine technology in the rehabilitation of patients with injuries of the lower extremities.Materials and Methods:Consecutive patients were recruited over a 2-year period. A total of 74 subjects with lower extremity injuries were enrolled in the study and monitored during a 3-month period. Twenty-six patients from the control group underwent traditional rehabilitation procedures for a 3-month period after injury. A total of 48 subjects were enrolled in the telerehabilitation group for a 3-month study period and were trained with a set of exercises for home use. Home remote monitoring for the 48 test subjects included use of a smartphone with gyroscope, G-sensor, magnetometer, and barometer, which was fixed to the injured limb. Software for the smartphone was developed at the I. Horbachevsky Ternopil Medical University, Ukraine. Software permits the monitoring of exercise time, the frequency of active movements of the injured limb, the number of steps per hour, and the walking speed.Results:The 3-month rehabilitation period started with the power load of 10% of body weight, following 3-5 steps five times per day with a speed no >1km/h. The orthopedic surgeon, during telerehabilitation, took significantly less time to consult patients (2.3min0.4) than the traditional rehabilitation (12.6min +/- 2.9). Patient satisfaction was higher for the telerehabilitation (83.1%+/- 14.2) than for the orthopedic surgeon's traditional rehabilitation (33.1%+/- 8.9).Conclusions:Telerehabilitation is a good alternative for providing access to specialty care for the growing number of patients with traumatic injuries.;2017;3
Knee and hip joint arthrosis are among the ten most common diagnoses in orthopedic clinics. The effectiveness of inpatient rehabilitation after a total knee or hip replacement has been documented by numerous studies. However, the mid-term and long-term sustainability of a therapeutic success poses a big challenge. The aim of the project ReMove-is to provide a proof of concept for telemedical assisted intervention training for patients after an operation to their lower extremities. This article, based on testimonies, describes how the interactive exercise program for total knee and hip replacement patients was developed and how the telemedical assistance system MeineReha (R) is integrated into the day-to-day treatment of rehabilitation clinics. Similarly, the composition and execution of the clinical study is described and the system evaluated from the view of doctors and therapists.;2017;3

Many functions previously conducted on desktop computers are now performed on smartphones. Smartphones provide convenience, portability, and connectivity. When smartphones are used in the conduct of telehealth, sensitive data is invariably accessed, rendering the devices in need of user authentication to ensure data protection. User authentication of smartphones can help mitigate potential Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) breaches and keep sensitive patient information protected, while also facilitating the convenience of smartphones within everyday life and healthcare. This paper presents and examines several types of authentication methods available to smartphone users to help ensure security of sensitive data from attackers. The applications of these authentication methods in telehealth are discussed.;2017;3
"Motor dexterity assessment is regularly performed in rehabilitation wards to establish patient status and automatization for such routinary task is sought. A system for automatizing the assessment of motor dexterity based on the Fugl-Meyer scale and with loose restrictions on sensing technologies is presented. The system consists of two main elements: 1) A data representation that abstracts the low level information obtained from a variety of sensors, into a highly separable low dimensionality encoding employing t-distributed Stochastic Neighbourhood Embedding, and, 2) central to this communication, a multi-label classifier that boosts classification rates by exploiting the fact that the classes corresponding to the individual exercises are naturally organized as a network. Depending on the targeted therapeutic movement class labels i.e. exercises scores, are highly correlated-patients who perform well in one, tends to perform well in related exercises-; and critically no node can be used as proxy of others-an exercise does not encode the information of other exercises. Over data from a cohort of 20 patients, the novel classifier outperforms classical Naive Bayes, random forest and variants of support vector machines (ANOVA: p < 0.001). The novel multi-label classification strategy fulfills an automatic system for motor dexterity assessment, with implications for lessening therapist's workloads, reducing healthcare costs and providing support for home-based virtual rehabilitation and telerehabilitation alternatives.";2017;3
Motor relearning after stroke is a lengthy process which should be continued after patients get discharged from the clinic. This project aims at developing a system for telerehabilitation which enables stroke patients to exercise at home autonomously or under supervision of a therapist. The system includes haptic therapy devices which are more promising and beneficial for stroke rehabilitation than non-haptic approaches. In this paper, we present the results of two initial studies investigating specific design solutions for the patient's user interface. In the first study, we developed four interactive prototypes illustrating different navigation concepts. A usability test was conducted to identify the best suitable concept. In the second study we followed a participatory design approach to create a set of design solutions for a motivating instant visual feedback for exercising with the haptic devices. The current project status and next steps are described.;2017;3
"Objective. To explore the experience of patients and physical therapists with Skype for exercise management of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. This was a qualitative study. The Donabedian model for quality assessment in health care (structure, process, and outcomes) informed semistructured individual interview questions. The study involved 12 purposively sampled patients with knee OA who received physical therapist-prescribed exercise over Skype, and all therapists (n = 8) who delivered the intervention in a clinical trial were interviewed about their experiences. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Two investigators undertook coding and analysis using a thematic approach. Results. Six themes arose from both patients and therapists. The themes were Structure: technology (easy to use, variable quality, set-up assistance helpful) and patient convenience (time efficient, flexible, increased access); Process: empowerment to self-manage (facilitated by home environment and therapists focusing on effective treatment) and positive therapeutic relationships (personal undivided attention from therapists, supportive friendly interactions); and Outcomes: satisfaction with care (satisfying, enjoyable, patients would recommend, therapists felt Skype more useful as adjunct to usual practice) and patient benefits (reduced pain, improved function, improved confidence and self-efficacy). A seventh theme arose from therapists regarding process: adjusting routine treatment (need to modify habits, discomfort without hands-on, supported by research environment). Conclusion. Patients and physical therapists described mostly positive experiences using Skype as a service delivery model for physical therapist-supervised exercise management of moderate knee OA. Such a model is feasible and acceptable and has the potential to increase access to supervised exercise management for people with knee OA, either individually or in combination with traditional in-clinic visits.";2017;3
Objective: Determine the feasibility of using a physical-activity behavior-change (PABC) intervention for increasing physical activity and reducing disability in Veterans 1-5 years following dysvascular lower-limb amputation (LLA). Design: Cross-over, feasibility trial Setting: VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center and Veterans Homes Participants: 32 Veterans with dysvascular LLA (1-5 years after major LLA) Intervention: The home-based study, using telerehabilitation technology, is intended to reduce participant burden by removing transportation and time bafflers. Participants will be randomized into two participation periods of three months (Months 1-3 and 4-6). PABC intervention will occur Months 1-3 for GROUP1 and Months 4-6 for GROUP2. During PABC Intervention, participants engage in weekly video interaction with a physical therapist, who uses a collaborative approach to develop self-monitoring, barrier identification, problem solving and action planning skills to improve physical activity. GROUP2 will participate in a no physical activity intervention, attention control in Months 1-3. GROUP1 will have a no contact, intervention wash-out period in Months 4-6. Main outcome measures: Feasibility will be determined using measures of 1) participant retention, 2) dose goal attainment, 3) participant acceptability, 4) safety, and 5) initial effect size. Effect size will be based on accelerometer-based physical activity and self-report disability using the Late-Life Function and Disability Index. Conclusions: This study focuses on a prevalent and understudied population with low physical activity and high levels of disability due to dysvascular LLA. The results of this study will guide future development of targeted rehabilitation research to improve long term physical activity and disability outcomes. Published by Elsevier Inc.;2017;3
Objective: Preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of a Web-based group intervention (Online EmReg) to improve emotion regulation (ER) in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: Pre-/post-within-subject design with baseline, end-of-treatment, and 12-week follow-up assessments. Participants: Ninety-one individuals with TBI and deficits in ER. Intervention: Twenty-four sessions of training in ER skills delivered by group videoconference. Measures: Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), Problem Solving Inventory (PSI), Social Problem Solving Inventory-Revised: Short Form (SPSI-R: S), and Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX). Results: Significant changes with large effect sizes were found for the DERS at the 12-week follow-up assessment. Significant and moderate changes were found on the SWLS, DEX, PSI, and subscales of the PANAS and SPSI-R:S. Conclusions: Online EmReg appears to be a promising method of delivering a group intervention to improve ER following TBI.;2017;3
Objective: Telerehabilitation (TR) is not used very widely in our country. Our study was planned to evaluate the usefulness and effect of TR in patients with hemiplegia. Materials and Methods: The study was performed at Mustafa Kemal University Health Practice and Research Hospital. After the demographic data were questioned, cognitive levels were assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination, balance using the Berg Balance Scale, and quality of life using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Quality of Life Scale. A TR program was performed for 3 weeks with 3 sessions per week, a total of 9 sessions. After the therapy program was planned, TR was applied by contacting the patients via laptops with a camera and microphone and an internet connection. The first and last assessments were done at the clinic. Results: According to the results of the study, the balance levels of patients significantly improved after the TR program (p=0.026). There was no difference in terms of quality of life and mental status before and after TR (p>0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that TR could improve the functionality of patients with stroke and routine use of TR would be beneficial. However, our country's technological equipment for TR application has been found not sufficient in the countryside.;2017;3
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether serious games especially customized for physical rehabilitation could be used in daily clinics with patients who are not familiar with informatics and/or new technologies and whether such a clinical approach would be culturally acceptable within a North African population to plan further clinical distribution if the hypothesis appears to be positive. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one patients participated in this study. Experiments were performed in the University Hospital Mohammed VI Oujda in Morocco. Patients were asked to perform physical rehabilitation exercises with dedicated serious games after their conventional therapy session. A questionnaire was used to evaluate patients' habits to rehabilitation exercises and satisfaction and expectation about the use of serious games for physical rehabilitation. Results: The same problem of low participation in at-home exercises was found in Morocco compared to Europe and the United States: 60 (30)% of the exercises was performed by the patients in Morocco and 48 (28)% in Europe and the United States. Results of this study show that serious games are well accepted by the patients (100%) and that it can help during rehabilitation (90%). Most of the patients prefer exercises with games than conventional rehabilitation exercises. Conclusion: Even in a context of low education (participants in this study attended school until the age of 10 years old), and low access and knowledge about new technology and informatics, rehabilitation exercises within serious games seem to be an interesting option to motivate patients during rehabilitation with a physiotherapist. Such a system could be installed also at home to increase patient's participation.;2017;3
Objective: The aims of this work were to evaluate the effects of home-based telesupervising rehabilitation on physical function for stroke survivors with hemiplegia and to determine if the rehabilitation therapy can relieve the burden on caregivers. Design: This study is a randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial. Stroke survivors were randomly assigned to either home-based telesupervising rehabilitation group or conventional rehabilitation group to receive physical exercise and electromyography-triggered neuromuscular stimulation. Modified Barthel Index, Berg Balance Scale, modified Rankin Scale, Caregiver Strain Index, root mean square of extensor carpi radialis longus and tibialis anterior muscle were measured at 3 time points: baseline, postintervention (12 weeks), and 12-week follow-up (24 weeks). Results: Both the home-based telerehabilitation and conventional rehabilitation groups demonstrated significant effects within groups over the 3 time points in increasing Modified Barthel Index, Berg Balance Scale, and root mean square value of extensor carpi radialis longus and tibialis anterior, as well as decreasing Caregiver Strain Index (P < 0.001), but none of the between-group differences was significant. For modified Rankin Scale, the percentage of participants of grades 0 and 1 in 2 groups increased over time without significant difference between the groups. Conclusions: Home-based telesupervising rehabilitation is most likely as effective as the conventional outpatient rehabilitation for improving functional recovery in stroke survivors and could ease the burden of caregivers as conventional rehabilitation.;2017;3
Objective: This study is designed to determine the feasibility of the provision of an evidenced-based aphasia therapy, constraint-induced language therapy, via telerehabilitation. It describes the computer software that was developed specifically for the delivery of constraint-induced language therapy in the online environment and presents two case studies. Methods: Two participants with chronic aphasia were assessed before and after a two-week intensive treatment block of constraint-induced language therapy delivered via Web-based videoconferencing. The group-based, dual card request game utilized in face-to-face constraint-induced language therapy was transformed into an innovative and user-friendly Web-based game - Internet constraint-induced language therapy (iCILT). Participants accessed iCILT via the Internet from their own home every weekday for two weeks. Language and quality of life measures were administered pre- and post-therapy in order to detect treatment effects. Participant satisfaction information was also recorded. Results: Online delivery of iCILT was technically feasible and participant satisfaction was high with a number of benefits associated with telerehabilitation identified by participants. Post-treatment performance for language functioning and communication-related quality of life was variable for each participant, however improvements in naming were noted. Conclusions: Constraint-induced language therapy delivered via telerehabilitation may be a feasible alternative to traditional face-to-face therapy for people with chronic aphasia.;2017;3
Objective: To compare Berg Balance Scale (BBS) rating using videos with differing transmission characteristics with direct in-person rating. Design: Repeated-measures study for the assessment of the BBS in 8 configurations: in person, high-definition video with slow motion review, standard-definition videos with varying bandwidths and frame rates (768 kilobytes per second [kbps] videos at 8, 15, and 30 frames per second [fps], 30 fps videos at 128, 384, and 768 kbps). Setting: Medical center. Participants: Patients with limitations (N=45) in >= 1 of 3 specific aspects of motor function: fine motor coordination, gross motor coordination, and gait and balance. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcomes Measures: Ability to rate the BBS in person and using videos with differing bandwidths and frame rates in frontal and lateral views. Results: Compared with in-person rating (7%), 18% (P =.29) of high-definition videos and 37% (P =.03) of standard-definition videos could not be rated. Interrater reliability for the high-definition videos was.96 (95% confidence interval,.94.97). Rating failure proportions increased from 20% in videos with the highest bandwidth to 60% (P<.001) in videos with the lowest bandwidth, with no significant differences in proportions across frame rate categories. Both frontal and lateral views were critical for successful rating using videos, with 60% to 70% (P<.001) of videos unable to be rated on a single view. Conclusions: Although there is some loss of information when using videos to rate the BBS compared to in-person ratings, it is feasible to reliably rate the BBS remotely in standard clinical spaces. However, optimal video rating requires frontal and lateral views for each assessment, high-definition video with high bandwidth, and the ability to carry out slow motion review.

Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment delivered via real-time telerehabilitation for the management of musculoskeletal conditions, and to determine if real-time telerehabilitation is comparable to conventional methods of delivery within this population. Data sources: Six databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, PEDro, psycINFO, CINAHL) were searched from inception to November 2015 for literature which reported on the outcomes of real-time telerehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions. Review methods: Two reviewers screened 5913 abstracts where 13 studies (n = 1520) met the eligibility criteria. Methodological quality was assessed using the Downs & Black Checklist for Measuring Quality' tool. Results were pooled for meta-analysis based upon primary outcome measures and reported as standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Aggregate results suggest that telerehabilitation is effective in the improvement of physical function (SMD 1.63, 95%CI 0.92-2.33, I-2=93%), whilst being slightly more favourable (SMD 0.44, 95%CI 0.19-0.69, I-2=58%) than the control cohort following intervention. Sub-group analyses reveals that telerehabilitation in addition to usual care is more favourable (SMD 0.64, 95%CI 0.43-0.85, I-2=10%) than usual care alone, whilst treatment delivered solely via telerehabilitation is equivalent to face-to-face intervention (SMD MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.10-0.37, I-2 = 0%) for the improvement of physical function. The improvement of pain was also seen to be comparable between cohorts (SMD 0.66, 95%CI -0.27-1.60, I-2=96%) following intervention. Conclusions: Real-time telerehabilitation appears to be effective and comparable to conventional methods of healthcare delivery for the improvement of physical function and pain in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions.;2017;3
Objective: To identify literature which discusses the barriers and enablers of eHealth technology and which evaluates its role in facilitating interdisciplinary team work for the care of people with a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Studies were identified by searching CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Study selection: Studies included in the review were required to feature an eHealth intervention which assisted interdisciplinary care for people with TBI. Data extraction: Descriptive data for each study described the eHealth intervention, interdisciplinary team, outcomes, and barriers and facilitators in implementing eHealth interventions. Results: The search resulted in 1389 publications, of which 35 were retrieved and scanned in full. Six studies met all the inclusion criteria for the review. Four different eHealth interventions were identified: (i) an electronic goals systems, (ii) telerehabilitation, (iii) videoconferencing, and (iv) a point-of-care team-based information system. Various barriers and facilitators were identified in the use of eHealth. Conclusion: eHealth interventions have been reported to support interdisciplinary teams for the care of TBI. However, there is a substantial gap in existing literature regarding the barriers and enablers which characterize a successful interdisciplinary eHealth model for people with TBI.;2017;3
Objectives: Cardiac telerehabilitation includes, in its most comprehensive format, telemonitoring, telecoaching, social interaction, and eLearning. The specific role of eLearning, however, was seldom assessed. The aim of eEduHeart I is to investigate the medium-term effectiveness of the addition of a cardiac web-based eLearing platform to conventional cardiac care. Methods: In this prospective, multicenter randomized, controlled trial, 1,000 patients with coronary artery disease will be randomized 1:1 to an intervention group (receiving 1-month unrestricted access to the cardiac eLearning platform in addition to conventional cardiac care) or to conventional cardiac care alone. The primary endpoint is health-related quality of life, assessed by the HeartQoL questionnaire at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups. Secondary endpoints include pathology-specific knowledge and self-reported eLearning platform user experience. Data on the eLearning platform usage will be gathered through web logging during the study period. Results: eEduHeart I will be one of the first studies to report on the added value of eLearning. Conclusions: If the intervention is proven effective, current cardiac telerehabilitation programs can be augmented by including eLearning, too. The platform can then be used as a model for other chronic diseases in which patient education plays a key role. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel;2017;3
Objectives: To compare in-person with videoconferencing administration of a communication questionnaire for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their close others. Design: Repeated-measures design with randomized order of administration. Participants: Twenty adults with severe TBI and their close others. Methods: Both participants with TBI and their close others completed the La Trobe Communication Questionnaire (LCQ) via interview with a clinician, once via Skype and once during a home visit. Measures: Total LCQ score and time taken for completion. Results: There were no significant differences between videoconferencing and in-person conditions in the total scores or time taken to complete the questionnaire. Conclusions: Videoconferencing-based administration of the LCQ is as reliable and efficient as in-person administration.;2017;3
Objectives: To describe patient experiences and perspectives of a group-based heart failure (HF) telerehabilitation program delivered to the homes via online video-conferencing. Background: Limited information currently exists on patient experiences of telerehabilitation for HF. Patient feedback and end-user perspectives provide important information regarding the acceptability of this new delivery model which may have a substantial impact on future uptake. Methods: We used mixed-methods design with purposive sampling of patients with HR. We used self report surveys and semi-structured interviews to measure patient experiences and perspectives following a 12-week telerehabilitation program. The telerehabilitation program encompassed group based exercise and education, and were delivered in real-time via videoconferencing. Interviews were transcribed and coded, with thematic analysis undertaken. Results: Seventeen participants with HF (mean age [SD] of 69 [12] years and 88% males) were recruited. Participants reported high visual clarity and ease of use for the monitoring equipment. Major themes included motivating and inhibiting influences related to telerehabilitation and improvement suggestions. Participants liked the health benefits, access to care and social support. Participants highlighted a need for improved audio clarity and connectivity as well computer training for those with limited computer experience. The majority of participants preferred a combined face-to-face and online delivery model. Conclusion: Participants in this study reported high visual clarity and ease-of-use, but provided suggestions for further improvements in group-based video telerehabilitation for HF.

ObjectiveTo investigate the perceptions of people with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA) about the remote delivery of exercise therapy by a physical therapist. MethodsA survey of people age 45 years with a clinical diagnosis of hip and/or knee OA was conducted. The survey comprised 3 sections, including 1) demographic information, 2) statements about receiving exercise via the telephone, and 3) statements about receiving exercise via video over the internet. Data were analyzed by calculating response proportions and evaluating levels of agreement with each statement. Exploratory binomial regression analyses were performed to determine whether participant characteristics influenced perceptions of tele-rehabilitation. ResultsA total of 330 people spanning metropolitan, regional, and rural Australia completed the survey. Respondents were in majority (50%) agreement with 13 of 17 statements, with most agreement about tele-rehabilitation saving time (telephone versus video: 78% versus 81%), being easy to use (79% versus 78%), and maintaining privacy (86% versus 82%). There was no consensus agreement with liking the lack of physical contact (telephone versus video: 20% agreement versus 22%), willingness to pay (32% versus 46%), belief that telephone-delivered exercise would be effective (45%), and belief that a physical therapist could adequately monitor OA over the telephone (42%). ConclusionPeople with knee and/or hip OA hold mostly positive perceptions about tele-rehabilitation, delivered via the telephone or by video over the internet, for provision of physical therapist-prescribed exercise services. There was concern about the lack of physical contact with the therapist when using tele-rehabilitation.;2017;3
Occupational audiologists have a crisis in their profession and need advocates. These audiologists are primarily responsible for industrial hearing conservation programs and their compliance with multiple regulations, such as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the Federal Railroad Administration. Occupational hearing programs, for the most part, are multi-state programs as companies and corporations are national organizations. Also, companies may contract services across state lines as local services may not be desired or available. Individual state telepractice regulations require audiologists who are professionally supervising these programs via the internet and phone, to secure licensure in each state. For this licensure redundancy, the cost in time and tracking are enormous. It is imperative that the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), secure multistate licensure for speech-language pathologists and audiologists. For the profession of occupational audiology, it is essential.;2017;3
Optimal physical activity (PA) interventions are needed to increase PA in individuals with severe obesity, and optimize the results of bariatric surgery (BS). The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and effect of Pre-Surgical Exercise Training (PreSET) delivered in-home via telehealth (TelePreSET) in subjects awaiting BS. Six women following the TelePreSET were compared to the women from a previous study (12 performing the PreSET in a gymnasium and 11 receiving usual care). In-home TelePreSET (12-weeks of endurance and strength training) was supervised twice weekly using videoconferencing. Physical fitness, quality of life, exercise beliefs, anthropometric measures and telehealth perception were assessed before and after 12-weeks. Satisfaction was evaluated with questionnaires at the end of the intervention. The TelePreSET participants attended 96% of the exercise sessions, and were very satisfied by the TelePreSET. The baseline telehealth perception score was high, and increased significantly after the intervention. The TelePreSET group significantly increased their physical fitness compared to the usual care group. No significant change was noted in other outcomes. The TelePreSET is feasible and seems effective to improve the physical fitness of women awaiting BS. Further studies are needed to confirm beneficial effects of this innovative mode of delivery.;2017;3
Our area of interest is robotic-based rehabilitation after stroke, and our goal is to help patients achieve optimal motor learning during high-intensity repetitive movement training through the assistance of robots. It is important, that the robotic assistance is adapted to the patients' abilities, thereby ensuring that the device is only supporting the patient as necessary (assist-as-needed). We hypothesize that natural and learning-effective human-machine interaction can be achieved by programming the robot's control, so that it emulates how a physiotherapist adaptively supports the patients' limb movement during stroke rehabilitation. This paper introduces the design of a novel interactive device Bi-Manu-Interact. This device is suited to be used as an experimental setup for the investigation of haptic humanhuman interaction and for collecting data to model therapists' haptic behavior. In this paper, we present mechanical and sensory specifications as well as tasks visualizations for future investigations. Results of a pilot clinical evaluation of the Bi-Manu-Interact with nine stroke patients are also presented in this work.;2017;3
Patients with undergone traditional physiotherapy have some problems, especially in terms of transportation and doing correct exercise. Nowadays telerehabilitation is becoming a popular method to reduce these problems and to help with treatment. MS Kinect is also one of the effective equipments in telerehabilitation. In this study, the problems of physically treated patients and studies using MS Kinect for this disease were examined. A physiotherapy application was developed with MS Kinect for shoulder joint, muscle and tendon damaged patients. In this application, six exercises have been selected for patients with shoulder joint, muscle and tendon damage. Thanks to the developed physiotherapy application with MS Kinect, the patients can do their exercises with highest accuracy.;2017;3
People with Parkinson disease (PD) demonstrate improvements in motor function following group tango classes, but report long commutes as a barrier to participation. To increase access, we investigated a telerehabilitation approach to group tango instruction. Twenty-six people with mild-to-moderate PD were assigned based on commute distance to either the telerehabilitation group (Telerehab) or an in-person instruction group (In-person). Both groups followed the same twice-weekly, 12-week curriculum with the same instructor. Feasibility metrics were participant retention, attendance and adverse events. Outcomes assessed were balance, PD motor sign severity and gait. Participant retention was 85% in both groups. Attendance was 87% in the Telerehab group and 84% in the In-person group. No adverse events occurred. Balance and motor sign severity improved significantly over time (p < 0.001) in both groups, with no significant groupxtime effects. Gait did not significantly change. Since a priori feasibility criteria were met or exceeded, and there were no notable outcome differences between the two instruction approaches, this pilot study suggests a telerehabilitation approach to group tango class for people with PD is feasible and may have similar outcomes to in-person instruction.;2017;3
Physical and cognitive rehabilitation is usually a challenging activity as people with any kind of deficit have to carry out tasks that are difficult due to their damaged abilities. Moreover, such difficulties become even harder while they have to work at home in an isolated manner. Therefore, the development of collaborative rehabilitation systems emerges as one of the best alternatives to mitigate such isolation and turn a difficult task into a challenging and stimulating one. As any other collaborative system, the need of being aware of other participants (their actions, locations, status, etc.) is paramount to achieve a proper collaborative experience. This awareness should be provided by using those feedback stimuli more appropriately according to the physical and cognitive abilities of the patients. This has led us to define an awareness interpretation for collaborative cognitive and physical systems. This has been defined by extending an existing proposal that has been already applied to the collaborative games field. Furthermore, in order to put this interpretation into practice, a case study based on an association image-writing rehabilitation pattern is presented illustrating how this cognitive rehabilitation task has been extended with collaborative features and enriched with awareness information.;2017;3
Physical telerehabilitation services over the Internet allow physiotherapists to engage in remote consultation with patients at their homes, improving the quality of care and reducing costs. Traditional visual approaches, such as webcams and videophones, are limited in terms of precision of assessment and support for assistance with exercises. In this paper, we present a Physical Telerehabilitation System (PTS) that enhances video interaction with IoT technology to monitor the position of the body of patients in space and provide smart data to physiotherapists and users. We give an overview of the architecture of the PTS and evaluate (i) its usability based on a number of interviews and focus groups with stakeholders, and (ii) its technical efficiency based on a series of measurements. From this evaluation, we derive a number of challenges for further improvement of the PTS and outline a possible solution based on a microservices architecture.;2017;3
"ProblemThe continuity of care for people with neurological conditions in a remote northwest Queensland town as services are currently only available intermittently. DesignMixed methods design using questionnaires and staff review of the program and processes. SettingIntermittent community rehabilitation service for clients with neurological conditions has been offered in Mount Isa and is supported by a similar fulltime service in Townsville. Both services use a unique client-centred, student-assisted, interprofessional model of care. Key measures for improvementUnderstanding participant experiences by obtaining feedback from clients, students and allied health professionals (AHPs) regarding their experiences of using telehealth in this setting. Strategy for changePrevious clients of the North West Community Rehabilitation service were offered a review assessment using telehealth by an interprofessional team. Effects of changeUsing telehealth enabled the client, remote AHP and students in Mount Isa to be connected to expert assistance in Townsville. Lessons learntThe findings suggest that telehealth was useful in a community rehabilitation setting to provide review services for clients. This improved continuity of care for these clients because without this telehealth assessment, the clients would have had to wait up to 12 months for the next service period in Mount Isa or travel to a major urban centre to access a similar service. Feedback from clients, students and AHPs was positive; however, some challenges were identified. Recommendations for future service delivery using telehealth are outlined in the paper.";2017;3
Purpose Cognitive telerehabilitation is the concept of delivering cognitive assessment, feedback, or therapeutic intervention at a distance through technology. With the increase of mobile devices, wearable sensors, and novel human-computer interfaces, new possibilities are emerging to expand the cognitive telerehabilitation paradigm. This research aims to: (1) explore design opportunities and considerations when applying emergent pervasive computing technologies to cognitive telerehabilitation and (2) develop a generative co-design process for use with rehabilitation clinicians. Methods We conducted a custom co-design process that used design cards, probes, and design sessions with traumatic brain injury (TBI) clinicians. All field notes and transcripts were analyzed qualitatively. Results Potential opportunities for TBI cognitive telerehabilitation exist in the areas of communication competency, executive functioning, emotional regulation, energy management, assessment, and skill training. Designers of TBI cognitive telerehabilitation technologies should consider how technologies are adapted to a patient's physical/cognitive/emotional state, their changing rehabilitation trajectory, and their surrounding life context (e.g. social considerations). Clinicians were receptive to our co-design approach. Conclusion Pervasive computing offers new opportunities for life-situated cognitive telerehabilitation. Convivial design methods, such as this co-design process, are a helpful way to explore new design opportunities and an important space for further methodological development.;2017;3
"Purpose of review Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a complex and heterogeneous disease, requiring specialist intervention from a multidisciplinary team including speech language pathology (SLP). Unfortunately, multiple patient and service-related challenges exist which currently limit equitable access to SLP support for all individuals. This review highlights the existing evidence for different telepractice models designed to help patients and services optimize management of swallowing and communication disorders arising from HNC. Recent findings Emerging evidence exists for using computerized screening to enhance the identification of treat-mentrelated toxicities and assist referrals to services, including SLP. Asynchronous telepractice applications are being used to assist delivery of intensive home-based dysphagia therapy, whereas videoconferencing can offer a feasible and effective method to support ongoing management for patients with limited access to local specialist SLP services. Patient and clinician satisfaction with all models has been high. Summary SLP services can be redesigned to incorporate a range of telepractice models to optimize clinical care at different stages of the HNC survivorship pathway. Early evidence supports telepractice can improve patient access to services, enhance outcomes, and optimize health service efficiency; however, further systematic research is needed into these models, particularly relating to large-scale implementation and costs/economic analyses.";2017;3
"Purpose of Review With recent improvements in cardiovascular care and prevention, the demographic of individuals enrolled into cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is shifting towards an older set of individuals. Management plans for elderly cardiovascular patients must consider processes associated with aging, sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and inflammation all contributing to declining functional capacity. Recent Findings Increased debility at baseline does not translate into a significantly higher risk associated with physical activity but does require better access. High-intensity interval training protocols have shown benefits while preserving safety over the standard of moderate-intensity continuous training. Summary In elderly populations, CR needs to include more than just exercise; addressing psychosocial stress burdens as an independent part of CR has the potential to improve adherence and outcomes. Doing this through new programs and at home and through mobile devices has the potential to greatly increase adherence and access, and can help remedy current underutilization of CR in the US medical system.";2017;3
"Purpose This trial determines the effect of an Internet-based tailored exercise program compared to usual care control for improving functional capacity and cognition among breast cancer survivors. Methods A two-arm, assessor-blinded, parallel, randomized controlled efficacy trial was conducted. Participants were recruited from the Oncology and Breast unit at the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital (Granada, Spain) between March 2012 to November 2013 and randomized to either the experimental group (an 8-week Internet-based tailored exercise program) or control group (usual care). The outcome measures were the 6-min walk test, Auditory Consonant Trigrams, and Trail Making Test. All were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Results After intervention, the telerehabilitation group had significantly improved distances (d = 0.92, P < 0.001) as well as percentage of predicted of the 6-min walk test (d = 0.93, P < 0.001) compared with the control group. Significant improvement was also observed favoring the telerehabilitation group for the number of consonants recalled in total compared with the control group (d = 0.47, P = 0.04). These findings were maintained after 6-month follow-up (d = 0.80, P = 0.001; d = 0.76, P = 0.002; and d = 0.57, P = 0.02, respectively). Analysis was based on intention-to-treat principle. Conclusions These findings support the effectiveness of a telehealth system based on an 8-week physical exercise to achieve improvements and maintain them after 6-month follow-up in terms of functional and cognitive performance in breast cancer survivors. This broad-reach modality could help the growing number of cancer survivors to face their disabling side effects.";2017;3
Purpose: The present study reports on a robotic stroke therapy delivery and monitoring system intervention. The aims of this pilot implementation project were to determine participants' general impressions about the benefits and barriers of using robotic therapy devices for in-home rehabilitation. Methods: We used a qualitative study design employing ethnographicbased anthropological methods including direct observation of the in-home environment and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 10 users of the hand or foot robotic devices. Thematic analysis was conducted using an inductive approach. Results: Participants reported positive experiences with the robotic stroke therapy delivery and monitoring system. Benefits included convenience, self-reported increased mobility, improved mood and an outlet for physical and mental tension and anxiety. Barriers to use were few and included difficulties with placing the device on the body, bulkiness of the monitor and modem connection problems. Conclusions: Telerehabilitation robotic devices can be used as a tool to extend effective, evidence-based and specialized rehabilitation services for upper and lower limb rehabilitation to rural Veterans with poor access to care.;2017;3
"Purpose: The purpose of this case study was to evaluate the delivery of an inter-professional (IP) spinal triage management approach to chronic back disorders using remote presence robotic technology as an innovative form of telerehabilitation in a northern Saskatchewan community. Methods: The IP team, consisting of a local nurse practitioner (NP) and a physical therapist in an urban centre, completed a comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal assessment of, and one follow-up visit with, a post-surgical spinal patient. Treatment included detailed education regarding self-management after spinal surgery, provision and progression of home exercises, and reassurance. The patient was then referred to regional, in-person physical therapy care to complete her treatment. Results: A semi-structured interview with the NP revealed a high level of satisfaction; qualitative themes included the value of IP practice and the benefit to the patient of telerehabilitation achieved through patient-centred care. In a post-treatment survey, the patient expressed a high level of satisfaction with and appreciation for the patient-centred approach and the IP team. Objective clinical improvements in spinal and straight-leg raise movements were noted at the final telerehabilitation session. Conclusion: This report demonstrates the feasibility of delivering IP spinal triage management using telerehabilitation, specifically remote presence robotics, in a remote setting. Further research should include larger scale studies that investigate health, system, and economic outcomes as well as comparative studies for other forms of telehealth technology.";2017;3
Purpose: The purpose of this review is to systematically explore and summarise the validity and reliability of telerehabilitation (TR)-based physiotherapy assessment for musculoskeletal disorders. Method: A comprehensive systematic literature review was conducted using a number of electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and CINAHL, published between January 2000 and May 2015. The studies examined the validity, inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of TR-based physiotherapy assessment for musculoskeletal conditions were included. Two independent reviewers used the Quality Appraisal Tool for studies of diagnostic Reliability (QAREL) and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool to assess the methodological quality of reliability and validity studies respectively. Results: A total of 898 hits were achieved, of which 11 articles based on inclusion criteria were reviewed. Nine studies explored the concurrent validity, inter- and intra-rater reliabilities, while two studies examined only the concurrent validity. Reviewed studies were moderate to good in methodological quality. The physiotherapy assessments such as pain, swelling, range of motion, muscle strength, balance, gait and functional assessment demonstrated good concurrent validity. However, the reported concurrent validity of lumbar spine posture, special orthopaedic tests, neurodynamic tests and scar assessments ranged from low to moderate. Conclusion: TR-based physiotherapy assessment was technically feasible with overall good concurrent validity and excellent reliability, except for lumbar spine posture, orthopaedic special tests, neurodynamic testa and scar assessment.;2017;3
"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to present a retrospective study on clients with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) enrolled in a tele-motion-rehabilitation service program for two or more months. Methods: Data from 82 clients (46 males; 74 with ABI), aged 22-85 years, are reported. The Kinect-based CogniMotion System (ReAbility Online, Gertner Institute, Tel Hashomer, Israel) provided services that included 30-min biweekly sessions. Participants were evaluated prior to and 2 months following the commencement of service with clinical assessments that measured movements and function of the weaker upper extremity and cognitive abilities. Results: Clients enrolled in the service had intact or mild cognitive impairment, mild-moderate motor impairment but little use of their weak upper extremity for daily activities. They were satisfied with the service and reported high levels of system usability. Post-intervention clinical assessments were performed on about half of the participants after 2 months; significant improvements in active movements of the weak upper extremity, shoulder flexion range of motion and in the Trail Making Test were found (p<0.05). Conclusions: The service appears to be feasible for people with ABI and effective in important clinical outcomes related to improvements in upper extremity function. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Tele-rehabilitation provided with Microsoft Kinect 3D sensor virtual reality tracking system is feasible for people with Acquired Brain Injury. People with Acquired Brain Injury in the chronic stage were satisfied with the tele-rehabilitation service and perceived it as beneficial to improve their motor and cognitive abilities The CogniMotion System service appears to be effective in important clinical outcomes related to improvements in upper extremity function.";2017;3
"Purpose: This work aims at providing a tool for supporting cognitive rehabilitation. This is a wide field, that includes a variety of diseases and related clinical pictures; for this reason the need arises to have a tool available that overcomes the difficulties entailed by what currently is the most common approach, that is, the so-called pen and paper rehabilitation. Methods: We first organized a big number of stimuli in an ontology that represents concepts, attributes and a set of relationships among concepts. Stimuli may be words, sounds, 2D and 3D images. Then, we developed an engine that automatically generates exercises by exploiting that ontology. The design of exercises has been carried on in synergy with neuropsychologists and speech therapists. Solutions have been devised aimed at personalizing the exercises according to both patients' preferences and performance. Results: Exercises addressed to rehabilitation of executive functions and aphasia-related diseases have been implemented. The system has been tested on both healthy volunteers (n = 38) and patients (n = 9), obtaining a favourable rating and suggestions for improvements. Conclusions: We created a tool able to automate the execution of cognitive rehabilitation tasks. We hope the variety and personalization of exercises will allow to increase compliance, particularly from elderly people, usually neither familiar with technology nor particularly willing to rely on it. The next step involves the creation of a telerehabilitation tool, to allow therapy sessions to be undergone from home, thus guaranteeing continuity of care and advantages in terms of time and costs for the patients and the National Healthcare System (NHS).";2017;3
Question: Is a 12-week, home-based telerehabilitation program conducted in small groups non-inferior to a traditional centre-based program in terms of the change in 6-minute walk distance? Is the telerehabilitation program also non-inferior to a centre-based program in terms of functional capacity, muscle strength, quality of life, urinary incontinence, patient satisfaction, attendance rates, and adverse events? Design: Randomised, parallel, non-inferiority trial with concealed allocation, intention-to-treat analysis and assessor blinding. Participants: Patients with stable chronic heart failure (including heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction) were recruited from two tertiary hospitals in Brisbane, Australia. Intervention: The experimental group received a 12-week, real-time exercise and education intervention delivered into the participant's home twice weekly, using online videoconferencing software. The control group received a traditional hospital outpatient-based program of the same duration and frequency. Both groups received similar exercise prescription. Outcome measures: Participants were assessed by independent assessors at baseline (Week 0), at the end of the intervention (Week 12) and at follow-up (Week 24). The primary outcome was a between-group comparison of the change in 6-minute walk distance, with a non-inferiority margin of 28 m. Secondary outcomes included other functional measures, quality of life, patient satisfaction, program attendance rates and adverse events. Results: In 53 participants (mean age 67 years, 75% males), there were no significant between group differences on 6-minute walk distance gains, with a mean difference of 15 m (95% CI-28 to 59) at Week 12. The confidence intervals were within the predetermined non-inferiority range. The secondary outcomes indicated that the experimental intervention was at least as effective as traditional rehabilitation. Significantly higher attendance rates were observed in the telerehabilitation group. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation was not inferior to a hospital outpatient-based rehabilitation program in patients with chronic heart failure. Telerehabilitation appears to be an appropriate alternative because it promotes greater attendance at the rehabilitation sessions.

Questions: What is the level of technology engagement by people attending pulmonary rehabilitation? Are participant demographics and level of technology engagement associated with willingness to use telerehabilitation? Design: A cross-sectional, multicentre study involving quantitative survey analysis. Participants: Convenience sample of people with chronic respiratory disease attending a pulmonary rehabilitation program, maintenance exercise class or support group. Outcome measures: The survey assessed the participants' level of technology engagement (access to and use of devices), self-rated skill competence, access to online health information and willingness to use telerehabilitation. Results: Among the 254 people who were invited, all agreed to complete the survey (100% response rate). Among these 254 respondents, 41% were male, the mean age was 73 years (SD 10), and the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 59% predicted (SD 23). Ninety-two percent (n = 233) of participants accessed at least one technological device, of whom 85% (n = 198) reported regularly using mobile phones and 70% (n = 164) regularly used a computer or tablet. Fifty-seven percent (n = 144) of participants self-rated their technology skill competence as good and 60% (n = 153) of all participants were willing to use telerehabilitation. The multivariate regression model found regular computer use (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.72 to 5.71) and regular mobile phone use (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.32 to 6.09) were most associated with a willingness to use telerehabilitation. Conclusion: People attending metropolitan pulmonary rehabilitation, maintenance exercise classes and support groups had substantial technology engagement, with high device access and use, and good self-rated technology competence. The majority of participants were willing to use telerehabilitation, especially if they were regular users of technology devices. (C) 2017 Australian Physiotherapy Association.

Recent developments in the field of wearable computing have enabled the deployment of wearable sensors in many area, such as health care and sports. Continuous monitoring of a person's physical activity and movement data facilitates a physician's - or another care giver's - ability to simultaneously monitor multiple patients remotely. Care givers can access realtime data acquired from different sensors, allowing them to offer an appropriate intervention. However, collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the vast amounts of raw data in order to extract and provide valuable information is still a challenge. Recent technologies embedded in smartphones enable sensing the motions of a person. This paper aims to study methods to analyze a patient's physical activity and progress by visualizing her/his motion data. We provide insight into data gathered from multiple sensors built into a smartphone through visualization. We have conducted a case study to evaluate subjects' upper limb movements using data acquired while they were executing various rehabilitation exercises over a period of time. In this paper we present interactive visualizations to better understand the subjects' motion during that period of time. These visualizations offer better insight into the data, as compared to text-only reports. Such analysis and visualization of rich data stand to offer improvements and cost-savings to healthcare. Likewise, they can offer value to many other fields that need to analyze large amounts of data.;2017;3
Recent studies demonstrated that multipronged exercise interventions comprising aerobic, resistance and corrective therapeutic components resulted in endurance and strength improvement and reduction of fatigue and spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, telerehabilitation support of multipronged exercise programs in PwMS has received limited attention. The goal of this project was to introduce telerehabilitation support of individualized multipronged exercise programs and to assess feasibility assessment of the initial prototype in PwMS. In this project, design of telerehabilitation system supporting individualized multipronged exercise program was introduced and its feasibility was assessed in PwMS. Our results indicated high level of acceptance of the system by these patients. On average, it took about 1-2 minutes for the patients to complete the study tasks essential for system operation. They were able to successfully use the system and follow their individualized exercise prescription. The resulting system will have to undergo a definitive systematic evaluation in randomized clinical trial to demonstrate its clinical impact.;2017;3
Rehabilitation robotic systems may afford better care and telerehabilitation may extend the use and benefits of robotic therapy to the home. Data transmissions over distance are bound by intrinsic communication delays which can be significant enough to deem the activity unfeasible. Here we describe an approach that combines unilateral robotic telerehabilitation and serious games. This approach has a modular and distributed design that permits different types of robots to interact without substantial code changes. We demonstrate the approach through an online multiplayer game. Two users can remotely interact with each other with no force exchanges, while a smoothing and prediction algorithm compensates motions for the delay in the Internet connection. We demonstrate that this approach can successfully compensate for data transmission delays, even when testing between the United States and Brazil. This paper presents the initial experimental results, which highlight the performance degradation with increasing delays as well as improvements provided by the proposed algorithm, and discusses planned future developments.;2017;3
Robot-assisted rehabilitation offers benefits, such as repetitive, intensive, and task-specific training, as compared to traditional manual manipulation performed by physiotherapists. In this paper, a robust iterative feedback tuning (IFT) technique for repetitive training control of a compliant parallel ankle rehabilitation robot is presented. The robot employs four parallel intrinsically compliant pneumatic muscle actuators that mimic skeletal muscles for ankle's motion training. A multiple degrees-of-freedom normalized IFT technique is proposed to increase the controller robustness by obtaining an optimal value for the weighting factor and offering a method with learning capacity to achieve an optimum of the controller parameters. Experiments with human participants were conducted to investigate the robustness as well as to validate the performance of the proposed IFT technique. Results show that the normalized IFT scheme will achieve a better and better tracking performance during the robot repetitive control and provides more robustness to the system by adapting to various situations in robotic rehabilitation.;2017;3
Services making use of information and communication technology (ICT) are of potential interest to face the challenges of our aging society. Aim of this article is to describe the possible field of application for ICT-supported services in the management of older adults, in particular those with functional impairment. The current status of ICT-supported services is described and examples of how these services can be implemented in everyday practice are given. Upcoming technical solutions and future directions are also addressed. An ICT-supported service is not only the technological tool, but its combination with clinical purposes for which it is used and the way it is implemented in everyday care. Patient's satisfaction with ICT-supported services is moderate to good. Actual use of patients is higher than those of professionals but very variable. Frequency of use is positively related to clinical outcome. ICT offers a variety of opportunities for the treatment and prevention of frailty and functional decline. Future challenges are related to the intelligence of the systems and making the technologies even more unobtrusive and intuitive.;2017;3
"Several factors may prevent post-stroke subjects from participating in rehabilitation protocols, for example, geographical location of rehabilitation centres, socioeconomic status, economic burden and lack of logistics surrounding transportation. Early supported discharge from hospitals with continued rehabilitation at home represents a well-defined regimen of post-stroke treatment. Information-based technologies coupled with robotics have promoted the development of new technologies for telerehabilitation. In this article, the design and development of a modular architecture for delivering upper limb robotic telerehabilitation with the CBM-Motus, a planar unilateral robotic machine that allows performing state-of-the-art rehabilitation tasks, have been presented. The proposed architecture allows a therapist to set a therapy session on his or her side and send it to the patient's side with a standardized communication protocol; the user interacts with the robot that provides an adaptive assistance during the rehabilitation tasks. Patient's performance is evaluated by means of performance indicators, which are also used to update robot behaviour during assistance. The implementation of the architecture is described and a set of validation tests on seven healthy subjects are presented. Results show the reliability of the novel architecture and the capability to be easily tailored to the user's needs with the chosen robotic device.";2017;3
Study design: A pilot randomised controlled trial. Objectives: The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness and participant satisfaction of web-based physiotherapy in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting: Community patients of a national spinal injury unit in a university teaching hospital, Scotland, UK. Methods: Twenty(four participants were recruited and randomised to receive 8 weeks of web(based physiotherapy (intervention), twice per week, or usual care (control). Individual exercise programmes were prescribed based on participants' abilities. The intervention was delivered via a website (www. webbasedphysio. com) and monitored and progressed remotely by the physiotherapist. Results: Participants logged on to the website an average of 1.4 +/- 0.8 times per week. Between(group differences, although not significant, were more pronounced for the 6(min walk test. Participants were positive about using web(based physiotherapy and stated that they would be happy to use it again and would recommend it to others. Overall, it was rated as either good or excellent. Conclusions: Web(based physiotherapy was feasible and acceptable for people with SCI. Participants achieved good compliance with the intervention and rated the programme highly and beneficial for health and well(being at various states after injury. The results of this study warrant further work with a more homogeneous sample.;2017;3
Techniques originating from the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) areas have extensively been applied to develop intelligent and pervasive systems such as assistive monitoring, feedback in telerehabilitation, energy management, and negotiation. Those application domains particularly include three major characteristics: intelligence, autonomy and real-time behavior. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are one of the major technological paradigms that are used to implement such systems. However, they mainly address the first two characteristics, but miss to comply with strict timing constraints. The timing compliance is crucial for safety-critical applications operating in domains such as health-care and automotive. The main reasons for this lack of real-time satisfiability in MAS originate from current theories, standards, and technological implementations. In particular, internal agent schedulers, communication middlewares, and negotiation protocols have been identified as co-factors inhibiting the real-time compliance. This paper provides an analysis of such MAS components and pave the road for achieving the MAS compliance with strict timing constraints, thus fostering reliability and predictability.;2017;3
Telehealth is a broad term used to describe the use of electronic or digital information and communications technologies to support clinical healthcare, patient and professional health related education, and public health and health administration. Telerehabilitation refers to the delivery of rehabilitation and habilitation services via information and communication technologies (ICT), also commonly referred to as telehealth technologies. Telerehabilitation services can include evaluation, assessment, monitoring, prevention, intervention, supervision, education, consultation, and coaching. Telerehabilitation services can be deployed across all patient populations and multiple healthcare settings including clinics, homes, schools, or community-based worksites. This document was adapted from the American Telemedicine Association's (ATA) A Blueprint for Telerehabilitation Guidelines (2010) and reflects the current utilization of telerehabilitation services. It was developed collaboratively by members of the ATA Telerehabilitation Special Interest Group, with input and guidance from other practitioners in the field, strategic stakeholders, and ATA staff. Its purpose is to inform and assist practitioners in providing effective and secure services that are based on client needs, current empirical evidence, and available technologies. Rehabilitation professionals, in conjunction with professional associations and other organizations are encouraged to use this document as a resource for developing discipline-specific standards, guidelines, and practice requirements.;2017;3
"Telepractice has emerged as a form of service delivery to assess and treat individuals with communication disorders. The present study surveyed speech-language pathologists and audiologists in India about the use of telepractice. Two hundred and five (N=205) speech-language pathologists and audiologists responded to a questionnaire, with 12.19% reporting their use of telepractice to deliver clinical services. Respondents also indicated an urgent shortage of professionals in India to deliver clinical services in speech-language pathology and audiology, and opined that these needs can be met via the use of telepractice. India is well known throughout the world for the advanced application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), with 931.95 million telephone subscribers, over 900 million mobile phone users, and the second-largest mobile phone usage in the world. India has also experienced a tremendous rise in the number of internet users. Therefore, India is well poised to fully develop telepractice to overcome the barriers of distance and amplify the availability of speech-language pathology, audiology and other healthcare services. But first, the widespread use of telepractice throughout the nation will require an improved infrastructure (e.g., to uphold privacy and security); training for professionals; and telepractice policies. While very promising, the deployment of telepractice throughout India will require the attention of policy makers and government organizations.";2017;3
"Tele-rehabilitation (TR) is an emerging concept that aims to deliver heath care service through telecommunication and the Internet. Network speed has been sharply increased over decades and South Korea has been named as a country where not only the Internet connection is most widely available nationwide, but also the Internet connection speed is averagely fastest in the World. This creates an opportunity to help people who have limited access to healthcare service due to barriers such as ambulatory issues, costs to travel, and long distance by deploying TR system in remote areas. Recently, three sets of TR system were deployed at Soonchunhyang University and two independent living centers in Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea. The system offers (1) health record management; (2) motion analysis; (3) interactive rehabilitation trainings; and (4) rehabilitation games. Additionally, this system is capable of video conferencing that enables tele-consultation (TC). In this study, further details of the system and strategies to utilize such a system will be described.";2017;3
"Telerehabilitation is a new technology, which connects the patients and physicians or therapists via internet. This paper represents the systems that proposed for the combination of diagnostic devices and Telemedical system, including plantar pressure measuring devices that use during rehabilitation process. The parameters, determined by the devices, can be sent automatically from patient's computer to their physician's computer via the internet. That is, the results of the development are used to reduce the communication and distance between the patients and the therapists; they can directly communicate together from their places by using the internet. In the future, pressure measuring devices will be adapted with walking robots.";2017;3
Telerehabilitation is an alternative way for physical therapy of stroke patients. The monitoring and correction of exercises can be done through the analysis of body movements recorded by an optical motion capture system. This paper presents a first study to assess the use of Microsoft Kinect in the monitoring and rehabilitation of patients who have suffered a stroke. A comparative study was carried out to assess the accuracy of joint angle measurement with the Microsoft Kinect (for Windows and for Xbox One) and Optitrack (TM). The results obtained in the first experiment showed a good agreement in the measurements between the three systems, in almost all movements. These results suggest that Microsoft Kinect, a low cost and markerless motion capture system, can be considered as an alternative to complex and high cost motion capture devices for the monitoring and rehabilitation of stroke patients.;2017;3
Telerehabilitation, defined as the method by which communication technologies are used to provide remote rehabilitation, although still underused, could be as efficient and effective as the conventional clinical rehabilitation practices. In the literature, there are descriptions of the use of telerehabilitation in adult patients with various diseases, whereas it is seldom used in clinical practice with child and adolescent patients. We have developed a new audiovisual telerehabilitation (AVT) system, based on the multisensory capabilities of the human brain, to provide a new tool for adults and children with visual field defects in order to improve ocular movements toward the blind hemifield. The apparatus consists of a semicircular structure in which visual and acoustic stimuli are positioned. A camera is integrated into the mechanical structure in the center of the panel to control eye and head movements. Patients can use this training system with a customized software on a tablet. From hospital, the therapist has complete control over the training process, and the results of the training sessions are automatically available within a few minutes on the hospital website. In this paper, we report the AVT system protocol and the preliminary results on its use by three adult patients. All three showed improvements in visual detection abilities with long-term effects. In the future, we will test this apparatus with children and their families. Since interventions for impairments in the visual field have a substantial cost for individuals and for the welfare system, we expect that our research could have a profound socio-economic impact avoiding prolonged and intensive hospital stays.;2017;3
"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of non-supervised home-based exercise versus individualized and supervised programs delivered in clinic-based settings for the functional recovery immediately after discharge from a primary TKA. Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and PEDro databases were screened, from inception to April 2015, in search for randomized clinical trials (RCT) of home-based exercise interventions versus individualized and supervised outpatient physical therapy after primary TKA. Target outcomes were: knee range of motion (ROM), patient-reported pain and function, functional performance, and safety. Risk of bias was assessed with the PEDro scale. After assessing homogeneity, data were combined using random effects meta-analysis and reported as standardized mean differences or mean differences. We set a non-inferiority margin of four points in mean differences. The search and selection process identified 11 RCT of moderate quality and small sample sizes. ROM active extension data suitable for meta-analysis was available from seven studies with 707 patients, and ROM active flexion from nine studies with 983 patients. Most studies showed no difference between groups. Pooled differences were within the non-inferiority margin. Most meta-analyses showed significant statistical heterogeneity. Short-term improvements in physical function and knee ROM do not clearly differ between outpatient physiotherapy and home-based exercise regimes in patients after primary TKA; however, this conclusion is based on a meta-analysis with high heterogeneity.

The Commentary contests the increasingly outdated and narrow use of the terminology 'face-to-face' (often abbreviated as F2F) to connote clinical interactions in which both the client and the practitioner are physically present in the same room or space. An expanded definition is necessary because when delivered synchronously via videoconferencing, telehealth also provides face-to-face services (i.e., the practitioner and the client view each other's faces). Terminology that uses face-to-face to connote only in-person care is limiting and perpetuates language that is out of line with progressive US regulatory language and broad interpretation within existing regulatory language. It is this author's hope that this commentary will raise awareness of the important policy implications associated with this seemingly minor distinction in terminology and impact the lingering misapplication of the term, face-to-face.;2017;3
The current state-of-the-art tele-medicine applications only allow audiovisual communication between a doctor and the patient, necessitating a clinician to physically examine the patient. The doctor relies on the physical examination performed by the clinician, along with the audiovisual dialogue with the patient. In this paper, a Haptic-enabled Tele-Immersive Musculoskeletal Examination (H-TIME) system is introduced, that allows doctors to physically examine musculoskeletal conditions of the patients remotely, by looking at the 3D reconstructed model of the patient in the virtual world, and physically feeling the patient's range of mobility using a haptic device. The proposed bidirectional haptic rendering in H-TIME can allow the doctor to evaluate a patient who suffers from problems in their upper extremities, such as the shoulder, elbow, wrist, etc., and evaluate them remotely. Real world user study was performed, between the doctors and the patients, and it highlighted the potential of the proposed system. The study indicated a high degree of correlation between the in-person and H-TIME evaluations of the patient. Both the doctors and patients involved in the study, felt that the system could potentially replace in-person consultations, someday.;2017;3
The development of telemedical assistance systems in rehabilitation and follow-up is in a nascent stage. The trend observed in the past years is a strong focus on concrete treatment processes between the doctor, therapist, and patient. The application of telemedical assistance systems complements and expands the treatment process of the doctor as well as the therapist. Hereby offering new possibilities of treatment both for clinics as well as registered practitioners. The aim of the following article is to provide an overview of current trends and review the position of the discussions and practice. The article initially provides an overview of the current projects and technologies for telemedical assistance systems. In conclusion, for a better classification of the function and mode of action, a reference model of telemedical assistance systems developed is presented.;2017;3
The enhancement of ubiquitous and pervasive computing brings new perspectives in terms of medical rehabilitations. In that sense, the present study proposes a Web-based platform to promote the reeducation of patients after hip replacement surgery. This project focuses on two fundamental aspects in the development of a suitable telerehabilitation application, which are: (i) being based on an affordable technology and (ii) providing the patients with a real-time assessment of the correctness of their movements. A comparative test shows that the movement's evaluation carried out by therapists is consistent with the output of the automatic assessment module. Improvements of the algorithm are discussed, in order to increase the accuracy and depth of the analysis.;2017;3
"The Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy (FSBPT) began the process of implementing the Physical Therapy Compact (PTC) in 2010 with a delegate assembly motion. An interstate compact is an agreement between states to enact legislation and enter into a contract for a specific, limited purpose or to address a particular policy issue. An interstate compact benefits patients, consumers, and licensees by addressing workforce concerns improving licensure portability from state-to-state; facilitating short-term mobility and telehealth consultation for physical therapists. FSBPT formed strategic partnerships with the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) and Council for State Governments' (CSG) to develop and implement the PTC. From April 2014-present, FSBPT followed the CSG recommended stages of compact development: Advisory, Drafting, Education, Enactment, and Transition. The enactment phase began once the threshold number of ten states required in legislation passed the compact bill in 2017. FSBPT anticipates the compact will be fully operational and licensees will be able to take advantage of the compact by mid-2018.";2017;3
The goal of the current study was to examine the feasibility of a telepractice intervention to improve phonological awareness skills in children with hearing loss as compared to a conventional in-person intervention. Twenty children with hearing loss participated in this study. Two groups of ten children each received a supplemental phonological awareness intervention either via telepractice or an in-person service delivery model. Within each of the two groups, five children were enrolled in preschool or kindergarten and five children were enrolled in first or second grade. The two groups of children demonstrated similar phonological awareness, non-verbal IQ, and vocabulary skills during pre-tests. After a 12-week intervention children with hearing loss showed improved phonological awareness skills as measured by a standardized post-test. No significant differences were found between the performance of the telepractice group and in-person group. Nor was a significant interaction found between the two age groups (PreK/K vs. 1st /2nd grade) and the two types of service delivery models (in-person vs. telepractice). The results suggest that a telepractice service delivery model is feasible for young children with hearing loss, and that telepractice may be as effective as in-person intervention in improving phonological awareness skills.;2017;3
The need for developing effective telehealth tools for dysphagia management is high not only for people who live in rural areas, but also for individuals with mobility/access limitations. We aimed to develop an electronic case History Tool/form (thereafter, e-HiT) for dysphagia, and compare its effectiveness with its paper-based version (PBV) on completion time, completeness, independence, and patient perceptions/satisfaction. Secondarily, we examined associations between the aforementioned variables and predictor variables, such as age, cognition, and computer/internet use. Forty adults who expressed concerns with eating/swallowing participated. To compare both versions, a randomized, controlled two-period crossover design was used. In Visit 1, Group A completed the e-HiT and Group B completed the PBV. In Visit 2, Group A completed the PBV and Group B completed the e-HiT. A satisfaction survey was completed post visits. There were no statistically significant differences for completion time (p = 0.743), completeness (p = 0.486), and independence (p = 0.738). Patient perception/satisfaction was significantly higher with the e-HiT (p = 0.004). In addition, a significant association was found between completion time and age (p = 0.0063). Our results indicate that completing the e-HiT is as time efficient as completing the PBV and that both forms elicit the same amount of information with no or minimal support. Also, completion of the e-HiT yielded significantly higher satisfaction responses. This is the first study documenting the effectiveness of the e-HiT for outpatients with dysphagia, providing evidence that the first step of a swallowing assessment-case history completion-can be effectively completed via telehealth by individuals with reliable internet connection and basic computer literacy skills.;2017;3
The objective of this systematic review was to systematically review papers in the United States that examine current practices in privacy and security when telehealth technologies are used by healthcare providers. A literature search was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). PubMed, CINAHL and INSPEC from 2003 - 2016 were searched and returned 25,404 papers (after duplications were removed). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were strictly followed to examine title, abstract, and full text for 21 published papers which reported on privacy and security practices used by healthcare providers using telehealth. Data on confidentiality, integrity, privacy, informed consent, access control, availability, retention, encryption, and authentication were all searched and retrieved from the papers examined. Papers were selected by two independent reviewers, first per inclusion/exclusion criteria and, where there was disagreement, a third reviewer was consulted. The percentage of agreement and Cohen's kappa was 99.04% and 0.7331 respectively. The papers reviewed ranged from 2004 to 2016 and included several types of telehealth specialties. Sixty-seven percent were policy type studies, and 14 percent were survey/interview studies. There were no randomized controlled trials. Based upon the results, we conclude that it is necessary to have more studies with specific information about the use of privacy and security practices when using telehealth technologies as well as studies that examine patient and provider preferences on how data is kept private and secure during and after telehealth sessions.;2017;3
The provision of medical rehabilitation must be embellished to be more flexible, based more on the individual needs of the affected persons and must be interconnected across sectors including associated areas in the acute care and follow-up care. In order to meet these requirements, a sensible implementation of telemedical assistance systems in the actual rehabilitation as well as on the follow-up care is required. It is only on this basis that the offered services can be delivered over time in a cost effective manner and with a high level of quality. This article describes the areas of telemedical assistance systems that have already been implemented and the ensuing advantages. A structured overview of clinical studies in the three broad areas of rehabilitation, cardiology, neurology, and orthopedics as well as other indications is provided.;2017;3
The purpose of the present paper was to examine the social validity of telepractice as a service delivery model for Spanish-speaking families of English learners. Quantitative survey methodology was employed to examine 79 caregivers' opinions regarding telepractice and to obtain background information about participants' home environments. Findings revealed that approximately 46% of the participant sample reported being interested in their children receiving services via telepractice. Caregivers reported limited familiarity with telepractice as an option, but were likely to express interest if their child had an identified speech or language disorder or if they were interested in increased access to Spanish language support for their children. In conclusion, although telepractice is not universally accepted among Spanish-speaking families, it appears to be a promising service delivery model. It is recommended that service providers offer thorough information and address common myths when considering telepractice as a service delivery model for families.;2017;3
The purpose of this article is to determine if telehealth-delivered speech-language pathology interventions are as effective as traditional in-person delivery for primary school-age children with speech and/or language difficulties. A systematic review was conducted (in accordance with PRISMA guidelines) using five databases, two journals and reference lists. Titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion, with relevant studies reviewed in full-text. Initial searches identified 132 articles. Following exclusion of non-relevant studies, seven articles remained for inclusion. Results revealed both telehealth and in-person participants made significant and similar improvements when treatment effects were measured through five of the six outcome measures. Findings showed there is limited but promising evidence to support telehealth for delivering speech-language pathology intervention services to school-age children. Whilst this is encouraging, particularly for rural children where in-person services are limited, more rigorous study designs are required to support the efficacy of telehealth for this population.;2017;3
The remotely supervised tDCS (RS-tDCS) protocol enables participation from home through guided and monitored self-administration of tDCS treatment while maintaining clinical standards. The current consensus regarding the efficacy of tDCS is that multiple treatment sessions are needed to observe targeted behavioral reductions in symptom burden. However, the requirement for patients to travel to clinic daily for stimulation sessions presents a major obstacle for potential participants, due to work or family obligations or limited ability to travel. This study presents a protocol that directly overcomes these obstacles by eliminating the need to travel to clinic for daily sessions. This is an updated protocol for remotely supervised self-administration of tDCS for daily treatment sessions paired with a program of computer-based cognitive training for use in clinical trials. Participants only need to attend clinic twice, for a baseline and study-end visit. At baseline, participants are trained and provided with a study stimulation device, and a small laptop computer. Participants then complete the remainder of their stimulation sessions at home while they are monitored via videoconferencing software. Participants complete computerized cognitive remediation during stimulation sessions, which may serve a therapeutic role or as a placeholder for other computer-based activity. Computers are enabled for real-time monitoring and remote control by study staff. Outcome measures that assess feasibility and tolerance are administered remotely with the aid of visual analogue scales that are presented onscreen. Following completion of all RS-tDCS sessions, participants return to clinic for a study end visit in which all study equipment is returned. Results support the safety, feasibility, and scalability of the RS-tDCS protocol for use in clinical trials. Across 46 patients, 748 RS-tDCS sessions have been completed. This protocol serves as a model for use in future clinical trials involving tDCS.;2017;3
The rise in the cases of motor impairing illnesses demands the research for improvements in rehabilitation therapy. Due to the current situation that the service of the professional therapists cannot meet the need of the motor impaired subjects, a cloud robotic system is proposed to provide an Internet-based process for upper-limb rehabilitation with multimodal interaction. In this system, therapists and subjects are connected through the Internet using client/server architecture. At the client site, gradual virtual games are introduced so that the subjects can control and interact with virtual objects through the interaction devices such as robot arms. Computer graphics show the geometric results and interaction haptic/force is fed back during exercising. Both video/audio information and kinematical/physiological data are transferred to the therapist for monitoring and analysis. In this way, patients can be diagnosed and directed and therapists can. manage therapy sessions remotely. The rehabilitation process can be monitored through the Internet. Expert libraries on the central server can serve as a supervisor and give advice based on the training data and the physiological data. The proposed solution is a convenient application that has several features taking advantage of the extensive technological utilization in the area of physical rehabilitation and multimodal interaction.;2017;3
The use of modern information and telecommunication technologies enables telerehabilitation of neurological deficits in the domestic environment. The current state of studies on rehabilitative teletherapy for improvement of motor function and mobility deficits due to stroke is reviewed. Two neurolinguistic proof of concept studies investigating the efficacy of online interactive telespeech therapy are reported, which compared virtual screen to screen interactive telerehabilitation of aphasia after stroke and dysarthrophonia in Parkinson's disease to conventional face to face rehabilitation. The results of the studies indicate that the neurological rehabilitation of motor and communicative deficits in the domestic environment of patients by means of teletherapy is just as efficient as conventional rehabilitation. Under home-based telerehabilitation patient transfer becomes unnecessary. Rehabilitative Teletherapy is a posthospital component of a cross-sector supply chain for patients with handicaps or impairments due to stroke and other neurological diseases.;2017;3
The work presented here suggests new ways to tackle exergames for physical rehabilitation and to improve the players' immersion and involvement. The primary (but not exclusive) purpose is to increase the motivation of children and adolescents with severe physical impairments, for doing their required exercises while playing. The proposed gaming environment is based on the Kinect sensor and the Blender Game Engine. A middleware has been implemented that efficiently transmits the data from the sensor to the game. Inside the game, different newly proposed mechanisms have been developed to distinguish pure exercise-gestures from other movements used to control the game (e.g., opening a menu). The main contribution is the amplification of weak movements, which allows the physically impaired to have similar gaming experiences as the average population. To test the feasibility of the proposed methods, four mini-games were implemented and tested by a group of 11 volunteers with different disabilities, most of them bound to a wheelchair. Their performance has also been compared to that of a healthy control group. Results are generally positive and motivating, although there is much to do to improve the functionalities. There is a major demand for applications that help to include disabled people in society and to improve their life conditions. This work will contribute towards providing them with more fun during exercise.;2017;3
There are many design challenges in creating at-home tele-monitoring systems that enable quantification and visualization of complex biomechanical behavior. One such challenge is robustly quantifying joint coordination in a way that is intuitive and supports clinical decision-making. This work defines a new measure of coordination called the relative coordination metric (RCM) and its accompanying normalization schemes. RCM enables quantification of coordination during non-constrained discrete motions. Here RCM is applied to a grasping task. Fifteen healthy participants performed a reach, grasp, transport, and release task with a cup and a pen. The measured joint angles were then time-normalized and the RCM time-series were calculated between the shoulder-elbow, shoulder-wrist, and elbow-wrist. RCM was normalized using four differing criteria: the selected joint degree of freedom, angular velocity, angular magnitude, and range of motion. Percent time spent in specified RCM ranges was used as a composite metric and was evaluated for each trial. RCM was found to vary based on: (1) chosen normalization scheme, (2) the stage within the task, (3) the object grasped, and (4) the trajectory of the motion. The RCM addresses some of the limitations of current measures of coordination because it is applicable to discrete motions, does not rely on cyclic repetition, and uses velocity-based measures. Future work will explore clinically relevant differences in the RCM as it is expanded to evaluate different tasks and patient populations. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.;2017;3
This article presents the development of portable walking aid with gait assessment and biofeedback capabilities to realize gait telerehabilitation. The novel gait assessment method based on infrared (IR) cameras and microcontroller was proposed in this developed system so that gait parameters can be accurately achieved and fed back via auditory cue to the patient in real-time during training. Moreover, patient's training information can be automatically recorded and then remotely transmitted to therapists for monitoring of patient's evolution and further adaptive train planning. The gait assessment performance of the developed system was investigated using the conventional motion analyzer (Qualisys system) and it was found that gait assessment parameters with high accuracy and sufficient for clinical practice can be obtained. Thus, this system could be useful to provide the cost-effective and ease-of-use gait training for the patient and enable effective home rehabilitation under the intensive supervision of the therapists at remote site.;2017;3
"This article reports upon an initiative to improve the timeliness of occupational therapy home visits for discharge planning by implementing technology solutions while maintaining patient safety. A community hospital in Queensland, Australia, hosted a process evaluation that examined which aspects of home visiting could be replaced or augmented by alternative technologies. Strategies were trialled, implemented and assessed using the number of home visits completed and the time from referral to completion as outcomes. A technology-enhanced solution called Home Quick was developed using technology to facilitate pre-discharge home visits. The implementation of Home Quick resulted in an increase in the number of home visits conducted prior to discharge (50% increase from 145 to 223) and significantly increased the number of patients seen earlier following referral (X-2=69.3; p<0.001). The substitution of direct home visits with technology-enabled remote visits is suitable for a variety of home visiting scenarios traditionally performed by occupational therapists.";2017;3
This paper presents a patient-centric rehabilitation practice monitoring sensory system, which operates based on monitoring rotational joints' angle. At each joint, an inertial and a magnetometer sensors are simultaneously used to accurately measure a desired angle. Benefiting from a modified complementary filter to combine the results of both sensors, the root mean square errors of less than 1.6 and 1.7 degrees were calculated, respectively, for the static and dynamic evaluation tests. The outcome results show that the errors associated with both the static and dynamic evaluation are in turn similar to 22% and similar to 4.5% lower. To ensure the correctness of practices, the deviation of the measurement results (joint angle) from a known reference over time is considered as a qualification measure. Also, the obtained qualification measure is compared with the overall level of adenosine triphosphate generated in muscles, which is accounted for fatigue. The qualification measure can enable the developed system to calculate to the optimum velocity of specific movements.;2017;3
This paper presents the development process of real-time neurorehabilitation system for paediatric using autonomous humanoid robot NAO and Microsoft Kinect Motion Sensor. This neurorehabilitation system enables paediatric patients to undergo rehabilitation session anywhere with capable Internet access. Humanoid robot NAO and paediatric patients are able to imitate each other aided by Microsoft Kinect Motion Sensor for skeletal tracking movement. Required data from rehabilitation system are then uploaded to cloud server corresponding to the patient's identification. Those stored data can be accessed via monitoring website by the acknowledged therapists and psychologists. They can view the rehabilitation results and do the analysis remotely as the rehabilitation session can be done anytime without the presence of therapists and psychologists.;2017;3
"This paper, presents an inertial and magnetic sensor based technological platform, intended for articular amplitude monitoring and telerehabilitation processes considering an efficient cost/technical considerations compromise. The particularities of our platform offer possibilities of a high social impact by making telerehabilitation accessible to large population sectors in marginal socio-economic sectors, especially in underdeveloped countries where, in contrast to developed countries, specialists are scarce and high technology is not available or inexistent. This platform integrates high resolution low cost inertial and magnetic sensors with adequate user interfaces and communication protocols to perform a diagnostic service through the web, or other available communication networks. Elbow amplitude information is generated by sensors and then transferred to a computing device with adequate interfaces to make it accessible to inexperienced personnel, providing a high social value at a low cost. Experimental methodology includes two different sets of tests: the first one uses flexion - extension movements on a robotic arm to validate our platform (IMOCAP) articular amplitude measurements, against the robotic positioning system. The second set of tests was carried out on human patients to test IMOCAP in real operational conditions; results were validated with an optical positioning system. This paper presents experimental results showing the platform applicability to telerehabilitation processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";2017;3
This study explored the efficacy and feasibility of a motion-capture program that may be utilized for telerehabilitation purposes. Two children attending a school for at-risk children received 20 sessions of Timocco, with sessions lasting for 30 minutes, under the guidance of research assistants. The researchers employed a mixed methods design to analyze quantitative data and qualitative interviews. Both children improved their fine and gross motor coordination, as measured on the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency Short Form. To explore feasibly, qualitative verbal reports of the child participants and research assistants were obtained. The children and research assistants reported positive experiences with the utilization of this platform. A collaborative, consultative telerehabilitation model may be a promising delivery mode of services for improving motor skills in children, with frequent input from the child, aide or teacher, and clinician. Further exploration is needed for telerehabilitative service delivery for at-risk children.;2017;3
This study was aimed at the development of a non-intrusive, biosensor based, Adaptive Interface Design (AID) that utilizes its users' physical abilities (rather than focusing on their disabilities), while simultaneously honoring their integrity and needs. The target users for this study were patients with arthritis in the hand. The AID comprises of eye tracking and data glove technologies, the latter of which will be used to measure the user's physical ability as it translates hand gestures into computer controls. By developing accessible computer interfaces and exploring their use for telerehabilitation purposes, we want to ultimately impact the inclusion and health outcomes of those who experience disability on a daily basis.;2017;3
Total knee arthroplasty has a high success rate. In the interest of enhancing patient outcomes, numerous perioperative interventions have been studied, including preoperative education, preoperative rehabilitation, postoperative inpatient rehabilitation, continuous passive motion, postoperative outpatient rehabilitation, unsupervised in-home exercises, telerehabilitation, and various combinations of these. This comprehensive review analyzes the existing body of evidence on these perioperative interventions and examines some burgeoning opportunities in rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty in the interest of improving patient outcomes and ensuring sustainable health care utilization for the future of total knee arthroplasty.;2017;3
Upper extremity injuries have significant negative effects on personal safety, physical functioning, quality of life, body image and self-concept. In this literature review we present a state of the art for upper extremity impairments in African low-and middle-income countries, with a focus on impairments that have a significant impact on the ability to perform activities of daily living. First, we summarize studies investigating the impact of upper extremity amputation and stroke, and discuss how the treatment and rehabilitation of upper extremity injuries could benefit from telehealth applications. We conclude by discussing how telehealth applications could help increase health care access to those that most need it.;2017;3
Very often persons with disabilities are faced with several obstacles such as lower level of services, limitations and inadequate access to education, health care, information and communication technology resources, unsuitable buildings entrance and workplaces equipment. Existing e-health models are rather general.

"We present the usability evaluation of a haptic-enhanced telerehabilitation system for massage therapy of the back using the Vybe haptic gaming pad and the gesture sensor LEAP motion controller. The evaluated system includes features that allow for (i) administering online therapy programs, (ii) providing self-adjustable and safety treatment of back massages using a virtual environment, and (iii) saving and replaying massage sessions according to a patient's therapy program. The usability evaluation with 25 older adults and 10 specialists suggests that the haptic telerehabilitation system is perceived with high usability and pleasurable user experience, while providing personalized intensity of haptic therapy in a supervised, real-time, and secure way to treat the patient. Moreover, the specialists totally agree that the system design features, such as save and play, and delimiting therapy zones are the most important for back massage therapy, while the features of regulating feedback intensity and providing/receiving a massage remotely are also important. Finally, based on their comments,; five design insights aiming at improving the current version of the system were generated.";2017;3
A physical test called the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) is being used to measure progress in neurological disease, physiotherapy and rehabilitation treatment processes. During the application of this test, possible physical errors, which may be caused by the patient or the specialist, can affect the measurement results. In this study, an application was developed to bring the 9-HPT physical test to the virtual reality environment in order to minimize the most possible errors. For the user to be included in the 9-HPT environment created in the virtual environment, the Leap Motion touchless sensor was used, which enabled the user to interact with the virtual environment and easily perform this test in the virtual environment. With the developed application, it is ensured that the patients can measure their measurements easily by themselves when necessary with minimum losses.;2018;3
"A prospective, randomized, three-arm, evaluator blinded study to demonstrate the feasibility of a telerehabilitation (TR) program in individuals with ambulatory deficits secondary to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and evaluate its efficacy when compared to conventional on-site physical therapy (PT) was completed. Thirty participants were evaluated at baseline and randomized to one of three groups with intervention lasting 8 weeks: Group 1 (control)-customized unsupervised home-based exercise program (HEP) 5 days a week; Group 2 (TR)- remote PT supervised via audio/visual real-time telecommunication twice weekly; Group 3 (PT)- in-person PT at the medical facility twice weekly. Outcomes included patient reported outcomes (PROs) obtained through questionnaires, and measurements of gait and balance performed with bedside tests and a computerized system. Functional gait assessment improved from baseline in all three groups. There were no significant differences between the TR and the conventional PT groups for a variety of outcome measures. TR is a feasible method to perform PT in persons with MS and has comparable efficacy to conventional in-person PT as measured by patient reported outcomes and objective outcomes of gait and balance.";2018;3
Affordability of biomechanical devices have been subjected to numerous discussion amongst users that requires such products. Therefore, this paper will explore on the possible affordable technologies that would enable the end-users to have access to the upper-extremities pneumatically-powered exoskeleton in daily life. Such devices will enable rehabilitation as well as assistances to individual that would require such assistive technology in their daily living. The customizable exoskeleton features adjustable arm-length for proper fitting to users. This exoskeleton is powered by McKibben pneumatic muscles mimicking muscles in the upper extremities. Moreover, the system enables remote monitoring via cloud or IoT platform. Future development of this prototype will be incorporation of more telerehabilitation features to improve adoption in user-friendliness of this enabling technology.;2018;3
"Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of self-directed arm interventions in adult stroke survivors. Methods: A systematic review of Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS and IEEE Xplore up to February 2018 was carried out. Studies of stroke arm interventions were included where more than 50% of the time spent in therapy was initiated and carried out by the participant. Quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: A total of 40 studies (n = 1172 participants) were included (19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 21 before-after studies). Studies were grouped according to no technology or the main additional technology used (no technology n = 5; interactive gaming n = 6; electrical stimulation n = 11; constraint-induced movement therapy n = 6; robotic and dynamic orthotic devices n = 8; mirror therapy n = 1; telerehabilitation n = 2; wearable devices n = 1). A beneficial effect on arm function was found for self-directed interventions using constraint-induced movement therapy (n = 105; standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.00 to 0.78) and electrical stimulation (n = 94; SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.08-0.91). Constraint-induced movement therapy and therapy programmes without technology improved independence in activities of daily living. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated arm function benefit for patients >12 months poststroke (n = 145; SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.21-0.82) but not at 0-3, 3-6 or 6-12 months. Conclusion: Self-directed interventions can enhance arm recovery after stroke but the effect varies according to the approach used and timing. There were benefits identified from self-directed delivery of constraint-induced movement therapy, electrical stimulation and therapy programmes that increase practice without using additional technology.";2018;3
Ankle sprains are frequent injuries that occur among people of all ages. Ankle sprains constitute approximately 15% of all sports injuries, and are the most common traumatic emergencies. Without proper treatment and rehabilitation, a more severe sprain can weaken the ankle, making it more likely for new injures, and leading to long-term problems. In this work, we present an inertial measurement units (IMU)-based physical interface for measuring the foot attitude, and a graphical user interface that acts as a visual guide for patient rehabilitation. A foot-mounted physical interface for ankle rehabilitation was developed. The physical interface is connected to the computer by a Bluetooth link, and provides feedback to the patient while performing dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, eversion, and inversion exercises. The system allows for in-home rehabilitation at an affordable price while engaging the patient through active therapy. According to the results, more consistent rehabilitation could be achieved by providing feedback on foot angular position during therapy procedures.;2018;3

Availability and all-in-one functionality of smartphones have become a multipurpose personal tool to improve our daily life. Recent advancements in hardware and accessibility of smartphones have spawn huge potential for assistive healthcare, in particular telerehabilitation. However, using smartphone sensors face certain challenges, in particular, accurate orientation estimation, which is usually less of a problem in specialized motion tracking sensor devices. Drift is one of the challenges. We first propose a simple feedback loop complementary filter (CFF) to reduce the error caused by the integration of the gyroscope's data in the orientation estimation. Next, we propose a new and better orientation estimation algorithm which combines quaternion-based kalman filter with corrector estimates using gradient descent (KFGD). We then evaluate CFF's and KFGD's performance on two early-stage rehabilitation exercises. The results show that CFF is capable of fast motion tracking and confirm that the feedback loop can correct the error caused by the integration of gyroscope data. The KFGD orientation estimation is comparable to XSENS Awinda and has shown itself to be stable than and outperforms CFF. KFGD also outperforms the prominent Madgwick algorithm using mobile data. Thus, KFGD is suitable for low-cost motion sensors or mobile inertial sensors, especially during early recovery stage of sport injuries and exercise for the elderly.;2018;3
Background and purpose Stroke survivors are often left with deficits requiring rehabilitation to recover function and yet, many are unable to access rehabilitative therapies. Mobile tablet-based therapies (MTBTs) may be a resource-efficient means of improving access to timely rehabilitation. It is unclear what MTBTs have been attempted following stroke, how they were administered, and how patients experienced the therapies. The review summarizes studies of MTBTs following stroke in terms of administrative methods and patient experiences to inform treatment feasibility. Methods Articles were eligible if they reported the results of an MTBT attempted with stroke participants. Six research databases were searched along with grey literature sources, trial registries, and article references. Intervention administration details and patient experiences were summarized. Results The search returned 903 articles of which 23 were eligible for inclusion. Most studies were small, observational, and enrolled chronic stroke patients. Interventions commonly targeted communication, cognition, or fine-motor skills. Therapies tended to be personalized based on patient deficits using commercially available applications. The complexity of therapy instructions, fine-motor requirements, and unreliability of internet or cellular connections were identified as common barriers to tablet-based care. Conclusions Stroke patients responded positively to MTBTs in both the inpatient and home settings. However, some support from therapists or caregivers may be required for patients to overcome barriers to care. Feasibility studies should continue to identify the administrative methods that minimize barriers to care and maximize patient adherence to prescribed therapy regiments.;2018;3
Background and Purpose: Motion sensitivity is a common condition among the general population and may be accompanied by postural instability and anxiety. Preliminary studies suggest that minimal dosage of gaze stability exercises improves postural stability in young adults with chronic motion sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of progressive gaze stability exercises on postural stability, motion sensitivity, and anxiety in healthy young adults with chronic motion sensitivity. Methods: We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of gaze stability exercises on chronic motion sensitivity. Forty-one participants of both genders ages 20 to 40 years with chronic motion sensitivity were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The intervention group performed gaze stability exercises while the sham group performed saccadic eye movement exercises for 6 weeks. Computerized Dynamic Posturography with Immersion Virtual Reality (CDP-IVR)condition 1 (C1) and condition 2 (C2)Motion Sensitivity Quotient (MSQ), Motion Sickness Sensitivity Susceptibility Questionnaire Short Form (MSSQ-Short: MSA, MSB), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI Form Y-2) were the outcome measures used. Results: There was no significant group x time interaction for MSA, MSB, MSSQ percentile, STAI, MSQ, C1 mean, or C2 mean. However, posttreatment a significant difference in the mean CDP-IVR score of C2 was identified between the 2 groups. For C2, the intervention group demonstrated a 117% increase in the mean CDP-IVR score compared with a 35.2% increase in the sham group. MSQ reduced significantly from baseline to 6 weeks postintervention in the intervention group (4.0 1.2 vs 1.9 0.9). Anxiety was significantly reduced in the sham group only (38.2 +/- 1.9 vs 35.8 +/- 2.2). Discussion and Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, progressive gaze stability exercises appear to have value for managing chronic motion sensitivity in healthy young adults. Further research with larger sample size and broader age range is needed to generalize these findings.

"Background and Purpose: This case addresses feasibility of a home-based telehealth system to enhance home exercise program (HEP) adherence for a patient with Parkinson disease (PD). We describe STARTSystem for Technology-Augmented Rehabilitation and Trainingand discuss outcomes after integrating START into the HEP component of an established therapy protocol, Lee Silverman Voice Technique BIG (LSVT BIG). Case Description: The participant was a 67-year-old woman with PD at Hoehn and Yahr Stage II. Intervention: During the first 4 weeks of a 4-month intervention, a physical therapist guided the participant through the LSVT BIG protocol. START was introduced at week 3; the participant was encouraged to complement her daily HEP through the end of the fourth month with START. Outcomes: Improvements in gait, endurance, balance confidence, and quality of life were observed from the start of the assessment to the end of month 1. By month 4, the participant maintained or improved with respect to these outcomes. Monitored by START, the rate of adherence to her twice-daily HEP prescription was 24%, but her daily participation rate was 78%. The participant's satisfaction with the START system was high, although autonomous feedback provided by START was a limiting concern. There were no technical issues or adverse events reported. Discussion: This case supports START as a feasible HEP telehealth solution for physical therapy, given that increased long-term exercise adherence may improve health outcomes for people with PD. The outcomes of this case study support further investigation into the use of START for people with PD.

Background Over the last few years, telerehabilitation services have developed rapidly, and patients value benefits such as reduced travelling barriers, flexible exercise hours, and the possibility to better integrate skills into daily life. However, the effects of physiotherapy with telerehabilitation on postoperative functional outcomes compared with usual care in surgical populations are still inconclusive. Objectives To study the effectiveness of physiotherapy with telerehabilitation on postoperative functional outcomes and quality of life in surgical patients. Data sources Relevant studies were obtained from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, PEDro, Google Scholar and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Study selection Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, quasi-randomised studies and quasi-experimental studies with comparative controls were included with no restrictions in terms of language or date of publication. Data extraction and synthesis Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Twenty-three records were included for qualitative synthesis. Seven studies were eligible for quantitative synthesis on quality of life, and the overall pooled standardised mean difference was 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 1.84), indicating an increase in favour of telerehabilitation in surgical patients. Limitations The variety in contents of intervention and outcome measures restricted the performance of a meta-analysis on all clinical outcome measures. Conclusions Physiotherapy with telerehabilitation has the potential to increase quality of life, is feasible, and is at least equally effective as usual care in surgical populations. This may be sufficient reason to choose physiotherapy with telerehabilitation for surgical populations, although the overall effectiveness on physical outcomes remains unclear.

Background Real time 1:1 videoconferencing (VC) has the potential to play an important role in the management of orthopaedic pathologies. Despite positive reporting of telemedicine studies uptake in clinical practice remains low. Acceptability to patients is an important element of system take-up in telemedicine and a focus towards qualitative methodology may explore the underlying reasons behind its acceptability. In this paper we have systematically reviewed qualitative studies that include evidence about patient responses to VC services in an orthopaedic setting. Objectives To determine whether real time 1:1 videoconferencing is acceptable to patients in an orthopaedic setting. Data sources MEDLINE, AMED, PsychINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Cochrane Database, Evidence Search and Open Grey were searched with forwards and backwards reference screening of eligible papers. Eligibility criteria Qualitative studies exploring the acceptability of VC in an orthopaedic setting were included. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Studies were appraised using the CASP tool. A Directed Content Framework Analysis was conducted using Normalisation Process Theory. Results Four studies were included for review. The themes for the four studies did not overlap and did not report clinician acceptability of VC. The Directed Content Analysis of these papers using Normalisation Process Theory highlighted factors which contribute towards its acceptability. Conclusions All studies concluded that the use of VC was acceptable. Further qualitative research exploring both patient and clinician acceptability is required utilising a theoretical framework to allow for repeatability and generalisability.

Background The benefits of exercise rehabilitation for people with heart failure (HF) are well established. In Australia, little is known about how the guidelines around exercise rehabilitation for people with HF are being implemented in clinical practice. Furthermore, it is unknown what organisational barriers are faced in providing exercise rehabilitation programs for this population. The aim of this study is to provide an updated review of exercise rehabilitation services for people with HF in Australia and to identify perceived organisational barriers to providing these services. Methods A cross-sectional survey of cardiac rehabilitation centres in Australia, investigating the number and characteristics of services providing exercise rehabilitation for people with HF. Results A total of 334 of 457 identified services responded to the survey. Of these, 251 reported providing a supervised group-based exercise rehabilitation program for people with HF. These services were mapped, showing their distribution across Australia. Services which were unable to provide group-based exercise training for HF patients reported organisational barriers including insufficient funding (60%), staffing (56%) and clinical resources (53%). Of the 78 services that reported patients in their local area were unable to access appropriate exercise guidance, 81% were located in regional or remote areas. We found that reported exercise practices align with current best-practice guidelines with 99% of group based exercise programs reportedly including endurance training and 89% including resistance training. Conclusions In Australia, exercise practices for people with HF align with current best-practice guidelines for this condition. Limited resources, funding and geographic isolation are reported as the major organisational barriers to providing these programs. Future endeavours should include the development of alternative and flexible delivery models such as telerehabilitation and other home-based therapies to improve access for these individuals to such services.;2018;3
"Background. Active monitoring of the level of daily physical activity seems to be a useful element for secondary prevention in public health. Low physical activity increases the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, musculoskeletal diseases, and causes loss of the previously achieved effects of rehabilitation. Objectives. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of physical activity in different age groups of adults with the use of the telemedical system based on a mobile application. Material and methods. The research covered data collected remotely from 927 individuals of both genders, aged 20-80 years (group I: 20-40 years, group II:41-60 years, group III: 61-80 years). A monitoring system (Activity Measurement Tool) developed in the Department of General Rehabilitation at the Witold Chodzko Institute of Rural Health (Lublin, Poland) was used to measure home physical activity in the examined group. The system uses a dedicated mobile application, cellular data transmission and web data-showing software. Home physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and simultaneous processing of data from a smartphone accelerometer. Results. The mean level of physical activity in the group of active application users (>= 2 days, n = 494), expressed as Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)-min/week (IPAQ-SF), was as follows: group I (female participants (F): 5,767.9, n = 73; male participants (M): 4,888.4 n = 251), group II (F: 3,468.7, n = 24; M: 4,053.5, n = 119) and in group III (M: 5,769.3, n = 27; no female participants were involved). In 72.3% of users, the registered physical activity was smaller in relation to IPAQ-assessed/7 days physical activity (sign test: n = 494; percentage of negative differences: 72.3%; Z = 9.9; p = 0.00). Conclusions. The research findings indicate a high level of self-reported physical activity among the users in all age and gender groups, although it is not reflected in the level of registered activity. Although the level of daily physical activity was evaluated, it was mainly among young and middle-aged men who gladly and regularly made use of the measurement possibilities offered by mobile technology.";2018;3
"Background. While occupational therapy's inception was from the Arts and Crafts movement and the moral treatment movement with war veterans, the profession has evolved to requiring a professional entry-level master's degree to practice, and involves complex relationships with clients across the life span. Throughout history, a consistent impact of each industrial revolution has been the loss of jobs to automation. This consequence is even more profound today with the exponential growth of innovations and automation. Purpose. The objectives of this article are to (a) set the context by reviewing the evolution, or five eras, of occupational therapy in Canada; (b) present what is meant by the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and (c) examine the technological innovations faced by occupational therapists and our clients as we enter the sixth era of occupational therapy in Canada. Key Issues. Although occupational therapy, as a profession, has low risk for automation, a great number of our clients will not be able to reskill fast enough to keep up with job market requirements. Telerehabilitation, the Internet of Things, virtual reality, 3-D printing, robotics, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles are challenging ways occupational therapists provide services to clients. Implications. It is recommended that occupational therapists engage with disciplines beyond current typical connections, as our expertise is called upon to advocate for ourselves and our clients who are end users of these technologies.";2018;3
Background: Although step counters are popularly employed for physical rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, their effectiveness is inconsistent and even questioned. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether step counter use increases physical activity or improves exercise capacity in COPD patients. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of step counter use in increasing physical activity or in improving exercise capacity. Data were aggregated using a random-effects model to get the overall effect sizes [standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI)], and subgroup analyses were performed. Results: A total of 15 trials enrolling 1316 patients with moderate to severe COPD were included. Step counter use increased physical activity compared with controls (SMD = 0.57, 95% CI 0.31-0.84), which is equal to a magnitude of 1026 steps/day in daily steps. It also enhanced exercise capacity with an effect size of 0.30 (95% CI 0.16-0.45), approximating to a magnitude of 11.6 m in the 6-min walking distance. Step counter use could augment physical activity (SMD = 0.64, 95% CI 0.19-1.08) and exercise capacity (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI 0.01-0.62) for patients receiving pulmonary rehabilitation. Yet it cannot enhance physical activity or exercise capacity in patients with severe COPD or among studies with intervention durations 6 months (both p > 0.50). Conclusions: Step counter use increases physical activity and improves exercise capacity in COPD patients, at least in the short term, which supports the notion of recommending step counter use in COPD management.;2018;3
"Background: Cardiac rehabilitation for ischaemic heart disease effectively reduces cardiovascular readmission rate and mortality. Current uptake rates however, remain low. This study assesses the social and economic impact of increasing centre-based cardiac rehabilitation uptake and the additional value of cardiac telerehabilitation using cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in Belgium. Methods: Cost-benefit analysis was conducted to analyse three scenarios: (1) current situation: 20% uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation; (2) alternative scenario one: 40% uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation; and (3) alternative scenario two: 20% uptake of cardiac rehabilitation and 20% uptake of both cardiac rehabilitation and telerehabilitation. Impacts considered included cardiac (tele)rehabilitation programme costs, direct inpatient costs, productivity losses and burden of disease. Results: Compared to the current situation, there was a net total monetised benefit of 9.18 MEuro and 9.10 MEuro for scenarios one and two, respectively. Disability Adjusted Life Years were 12,805-12,980 years lower than the current situation. This resulted in a benefit-cost ratio of 1.52 and 1.43 for scenarios one and two, respectively. Conclusions: Increased cardiac rehabilitation uptake rates can reduce the burden of disease, and the resulting benefits exceed its costs. This research supports the necessity for greater promotion and routine referral to cardiac rehabilitation to be made standard practice. The implementation of telerehabilitation as an adjunct is to be encouraged, especially for those patients unable to attend centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.";2018;3
Background: Cardiovascular diseases remain the most common causes of death in the world. Instructions for secondary prevention recommend multifaceted approach in cardiovascular diseases risk management. Center-based physical exercise training is considered as an important integral part of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Despite all recognized benefits CR brings, active interest of patients remains low in many countries, including the Czech Republic. That is why there is a need to focus on more effective patients' participation in CR with respect to their preferences and needs. One of possible approaches is using telemonitoring guidance based on obtaining data via technological equipment during home exercise training. The aim of this study is to compare effectiveness of both center-and home-based exercise training with focus on participants' physical fitness and quality of life. Methods/design: This randomized control trial intends to monitor cardiorespiratory health indicators and quality of life of patients diagnosed with a coronary artery disease (CAD) at the University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic. These patients will be randomly separated into 2 groups-a regular outpatient group (ROT) and an intervention training group (ITG). Both groups undergo a 12-week rehabilitation training program. The ROT group will undergo center-based exercise trainings in the hospital and receive feedback and support directly by their coach. The ITG group will be telemonitored during exercise training in their home environment via a wrist sport tester and Internet application. All patients will be supposed to exercise at 70% to 80% of their heart rate reserve obtained from cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). The primary outcome is to measure and compare physical fitness values assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of training. Physical fitness is expressed as peak oxygen uptake assessed by the CPX test. The secondary outcomes are patients, training adherence, and their quality of life. Discussion: This trial focuses on an up-to-date topic. As there have not been any similar trials in the Czech Republic yet, we expect it to bring great benefits not only for our hospital in Brno. In the long term, this method seems to be low-cost for all participants and brings a lot of benefits for those patients, who are for many reasons unable to participate in center-based CR provided by hospitals and other health care centers. Physical exercise therapy brings good results in reducing cardiovascular risk factors and improves its global impact. Thanks to its simplicity, it is expected to increase patients' training adherence as well.;2018;3
"Background: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) frequently coexist in older people, reducing patients' quality of life (QoL) and increasing morbidity and mortality. Objective: we studied the feasibility and efficacy of an integrated telerehabilitation home-based programme (Telereab-HBP), 4 months long, in patients with combined COPD and CHF. The primary outcome was exercise tolerance evaluated at the 6-min walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes were time-to-event (hospitalisation and death), dyspnoea (MRC), physical activity profile (PASE), disability (Barthel) and QoL (MLHFQ and CAT). Study design: randomised, open, controlled, multicenter trial. Methods: the Telereab-HBP included remote monitoring of cardiorespiratory parameters, weekly phone-calls by the nurse, and exercise programme, monitored weekly by the physiotherapist. All outcomes were studied again after 2 months of a no-intervention period. Results: in total, 112 patients were randomised, 56 per group. Their mean (SD) age was 70 (9) years, and 92 (82.1%) were male. After 4 months, the IG were able to walk further than at baseline: mean (95% CI).6MWT was 60 (22.2,97.8) m; the CG showed no significant improvement: -15 (-40.3,9.8) m; P = 0.0040 between groups. In IG, the media time to hospitalisation/death was 113.4 days compared with 104.7 in the CG (P = 0.0484, log-rank test). Other secondary outcomes: MRC (P = 0.0500), PASE (P = 0.0015), Barthel (P = 0.0006), MLHFQ (P = 0.0007) and CAT (P = 0.0000) were significantly improved in the IG compared with the CG at 4 months. IG maintained the benefits acquired at 6 months for outcomes. Conclusions: this 4-month Telereab-HBP was feasible and effective in older patients with combined COPD and CHF.";2018;3
Background: Concerning COPD, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has a positive effect on disease progression and mortality, is cost-effective, and is a part of recommendations of international guidelines. Only a minority of patients profit from conventional PR due to a lack of resources, physicians' guideline adherence, or patients' motivation. Novel digital therapies like Kaia COPD, a smartphone application that digitizes PR in COPD, are promising solutions to fill this void. Methods: Kaia COPD provides a digital version of PR and is certified as a class-I medical device in the European Union. We investigated anonymized data from users of the Kaia COPD app on in-app retention and the change in health-related quality of life (COPD assessment test and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire [CRQ]) during a period of 20 exercise days with the app. Results: Of 349 app downloads, 56 users fulfilled inclusion criteria and 34 (61%) had finished day 20 at the time of analysis and were included. Users took 33 +/- 11 days to complete the 20-day core program. Users finishing the program reduced their COPD assessment test scores (mean 2.5 units from 21.6 +/- 7.7 to 19.1 +/- 8.4 units, P=0.008). In finishers, there was a statistically significant effect above the minimum clinically important threshold of the CRQ score on the domains of fatigue, mastery, and emotional function. There was a statistically significant but not clinically relevant effect on the domain of dyspnea of CRQ. Conclusion: Digitalizing PR with a smartphone app is feasible and accepted by selected patients. The app leads to short-term improvement of health-related quality of life in patients completing a 20-day core program. Due to its observational character, this study has several methodological limitations and was intended to show the feasibility and to extrapolate effect sizes for planned prospective randomized-controlled trials to confirm these findings.;2018;3
"BACKGROUND: Developmental Dyslexia is a disorder, highly frequent in the school population, for which the recommended rehabilitation procedures are not well defined. This study aimed to automatize reading decoding skills by using an innovative system for rehabilitation, based on a telerehabilitation method. It requires an intensive home-exercise with the supervision, by web, of the clinician. The study had three main aims: to diffuse knowledge on new methods for rehabilitation of reading difficulties; to verify whether an intensive and simplified exercise, targeted to the automation of reading, is suitable for different subgroups of dyslexic children; to define the treatment effects on basic cognitive functions underlying reading. METHODS: Twenty-five children, grouped according to the neuropsychological and anamnestic profiles, took part to the treatment by the software Reading Trainer (R). RESULTS: Both speed and accuracy of reading decoding increased significantly after treatment, independently from the functional neuropsychological profile or the history of oral language delay. These changes were specific to decoding and not associated with improvements in reading comprehension or spelling skills. However, there was a cascade effect of the treatment efficacy on those basic cognitive functions considered precursors of the ability to read, with significant improvements in rapid lexical access, phonological processing and visual attention. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides information on the efficacy of new tools for telerehabilitation of specific reading disorders.";2018;3
Background: Facio-Scapulo-Humeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by a variable and asymmetric involvement of facial, trunk, upper and lower extremity muscles. Although respiratory weakness is a relatively unknown feature of FSHD, it is not rare. Telemedicine has been used in a variety of health care fields, but only recently, with the advent of sophisticated technology, its interest among health professionals became evident, even in such diseases. Objective: To demonstrate the telemedicine efficacy in FSHD. Methods: Four siblings affected by a severe form of FSHD, living in a rural area far away from the referral center for neuromuscular diseases, who used a wheelchair, suffered from chronic respiratory failure and were provided with long-term non-invasive mechanical ventilation, received a 6-month period of telemedicine support. This consisted of video conferencing (respiratory physiotherapy, psychological support, neurological and pneumological assessment, nurse-coach supervision) and telemonitoring of cardiorespiratory variables (oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate). Results: We performed 540 video conference sessions per patient, including three daily contacts with short monitoring oximetry measurements, blood pressure, and heart-rate measurements, psychological support, neurological and pneumological assessment, nurse-coach supervision. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that our telemedicine system was user-friendly, efficient for the home treatment of FSHD, and allowed reducing hospital admissions. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Fatigue is a common and debilitating feature of multiple sclerosis (MS) that remains without reliably effective treatment. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising option for fatigue reduction. We developed a telerehabilitation protocol that delivers tDCS to participants at home using specially designed equipment and real-time supervision (remotely supervised transcranial direct current stimulation (RS-tDCS)). Objective: To evaluate whether tDCS can reduce fatigue in individuals with MS. Methods: Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex left anodal tDCS was administered using a RS-tDCS protocol, paired with 20 minutes of cognitive training. Here, two studies are considered. Study 1 delivered 10 open-label tDCS treatments (1.5 mA; n = 15) compared to a cognitive training only condition (n = 20). Study 2 was a randomized trial of active (2.0 mA, n = 15) or sham (n = 12) delivered for 20 sessions. Fatigue was assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Fatigue Short Form. Results and conclusion: In Study 1, there was modest fatigue reduction in the active group (-2.5 +/- 7.4 vs -0.2 +/- 5.3, p = 0.30, Cohen's d = -0.35). However, in Study 2 there was statistically significant reduction for the active group (-5.6 +/- 8.9 vs 0.9 +/- 1.9, p = 0.02, Cohen's d = -0.71). tDCS is a potential treatment for MS-related fatigue.";2018;3
Background: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a disease with neurological and systemic involvement. Clinical assessment tools commonly used for FRDA become less effective in evaluating decay in patients with advanced FRDA, particularly when they are in a wheelchair. Further motor worsening mainly impairs upper limb function. In this study, we tested if serious games (SG) developed for rehabilitation can be used as an assessment tool for upper limb function even in patients with advanced FRDA. Methods: A specific SG has been developed for physical rehabilitation of patients suffering from neurologic diseases. The use of this SG, coupled with Kinect sensor, has been validated to perform functional evaluation of the upper limbs with healthy subjects across lifespan. Twenty-seven FRDA patients were included in the study. Patients were invited to perform upper limb rehabilitation exercises embedded in SG. Motions were recorded by the Kinect and clinically relevant parameters were extracted from the collected motions. We tested if the existence of correlations between the scores from the serious games and the severity of the disease using clinical assessment tools commonly used for FRDA. Results of patients were compared with a group a healthy subjects of similar age. Results: Very highly significant differences were found for time required to perform the exercise (increase of 76%, t(68) = 7.22, P < 0.001) and for accuracy (decrease of 6%, t(68) = -3.69, P < 0.001) between patients and healthy subjects. Concerning the patients significant correlations were found between age and time (R = 0.65, p = 0.015), accuracy (R = -0.75, p = 0.004) and the total displacement of upper limbs. (R = 0.55, p = 0.031). Statistically significant correlations were found between the age of diagnosis and speed related parameters. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that SG reliably captures motor impairment of FRDA patients due to cerebellar and pyramidal involvement. Results also show that functional evaluation of FRDA patients can be performed during rehabilitation therapy embedded in games with the patient seated in a wheelchair.;2018;3
Background: Impairment of upper extremity function is a common outcome following stroke, to the detriment of lifestyle and employment opportunities. Yet, access to treatment may be limited due to geographical and transportation constraints, especially for those living in rural areas. While stroke rates are higher in these areas, stroke survivors in these regions of the country have substantially less access to clinical therapy. Home therapy could offer an important alternative to clinical treatment, but the inherent isolation and the monotony of self-directed training can greatly reduce compliance. Methods: We developed a 3D, networked multi-user Virtual Environment for Rehabilitative Gaming Exercises (VERGE) system for home therapy. Within this environment, stroke survivors can interact with therapists and/or fellow stroke survivors in the same virtual space even though they may be physically remote. Each user's own movement controls an avatar through kinematic measurements made with a low-cost, Kinect (TM) device. The system was explicitly designed to train movements important to rehabilitation and to provide real-time feedback of performance to users and clinicians. To obtain user feedback about the system, 15 stroke survivors with chronic upper extremity hemiparesis participated in a multisession pilot evaluation study, consisting of a three-week intervention in a laboratory setting. For each week, the participant performed three one-hour training sessions with one of three modalities: 1) VERGE system, 2) an existing virtual reality environment based on Alice in Wonderland (AWVR), or 3) a home exercise program (HEP). Results: Over 85% of the subjects found the VERGE system to be an effective means of promoting repetitive practice of arm movement. Arm displacement averaged 350 m for each VERGE training session. Arm displacement was not significantly less when using VERGE than when using AWVR or HEP. Participants were split on preference for VERGE, AWVR or HEP. Importantly, almost all subjects indicated a willingness to perform the training for at least 2-3 days per week at home. Conclusions: Multi-user VR environments hold promise for home therapy, although the importance of reducing complexity of operation for the user in the VR system must be emphasized. A modified version of the VERGE system is currently being used in a home therapy study.;2018;3
Background: Improvements in chronic low back pain (CLBP) seen in physical therapy do not appear to be retained over the long term. Booster sessions have been proposed, but barriers exist to their implementation. Telerehabilitation (TR) and remote patient monitoring (RPM) may be ways to circumvent these barriers. The purpose of this case series was to describe the implementation of TR booster sessions and RPM in three patients with CLBP. Case Series: Three females with CLBP tracked their daily pain level and home exercise program adherence using a mobile phone application for 12months following discharge from traditional face-to-face physical therapy. Synchronous audio and video TR booster sessions were conducted at months 1, 3, 6, and 12. Outcomes: All patients met their individual goals. They demonstrated excellent home exercise program adherence and self-efficacy. A temporary increase in pain was seen in all patients, but they managed solely with the TR booster sessions and without other healthcare resources. Satisfaction with the program was very high. Conclusions: This case series describes the use of TR booster sessions and RPM in three patients with CLBP. The positive results suggest this approach may be helpful in improving long-term management of patients with CLBP but demand further investigation.;2018;3
"Background: In rural and remote communities children with motor difficulties have less access to rehabilitation services. Telerehabilitation technology is a potential method to overcome barriers restricting access to healthcare in these areas. Assessment is necessary to guide clinical reasoning; however it is unclear which paediatric assessments can be administered remotely. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children - 2nd Edition is commonly used by various health professionals to assess motor performance of children. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and concurrent validity of performing the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - 2nd Edition remotely via telerehabilitation technology compared to the conventional in-person method. Methods and procedures: Fifty-nine children enrolled in a state school (5-11 years old) volunteered to perform one in-person and one telerehabilitation mediated assessment. The order of the method of delivery and the therapist performing the assessment were randomized. After both assessments were complete, a participant satisfaction questionnaire was completed by each child. Outcomes and results: The Bland-Altman limits of agreement for the total test standard score were -3.15 to 3.22 which is smaller than a pre-determined clinically acceptable margin based on the smallest detectable change. Conclusions and implications: This study establishes the feasibility and concurrent validity of the administration of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - 2nd Edition via telerehabilitation technology. Overall, participants perceived their experience with telerehabilitation positively.";2018;3
"Background: Internet-delivered exercise, education, and pain coping skills training is effective for people with knee osteoarthritis, yet it is not clear whether this treatment is better suited to particular subgroups of patients. Objective: The aim was to explore demographic and clinical moderators of the effect of an internet-delivered intervention on changes in pain and physical function in people with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Exploratory analysis of data from 148 people with knee osteoarthritis who participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing internet-delivered exercise, education, and pain coping skills training to internet-delivered education alone. Primary outcomes were changes in knee pain while walking (11-point Numerical Rating Scale) and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale) at 3 and 9 months. Separate regression models were fit with moderator variables (age, gender, expectations of outcomes, self-efficacy [pain], education, employment status, pain catastrophizing, body mass index) and study group as covariates, including an interaction between the two. Results: Participants in the intervention group who were currently employed had significantly greater reductions in pain at 3 months than similar participants in the control group (between-group difference: mean 2.38, 95% CI 1.52-3.23 Numerical Rating Scale units; interaction P=.02). Additionally, within the intervention group, pain at 3 months reduced by mean 0.53 (95% CI 0.28-0.78) Numerical Rating Scale units per unit increase in baseline self-efficacy for managing pain compared to mean 0.11 Numerical Rating Scale units (95% CI -0.13 to 0.35; interaction P=.02) for the control group. Conclusions: People who were employed and had higher self-efficacy at baseline were more likely to experience greater improvements in pain at 3 months after an internet-delivered exercise, education, and pain coping skills training program. There was no evidence of a difference in the effect across gender, educational level, expectation of treatment outcome, or across age, body mass index, or tendency to catastrophize pain. Findings support the effectiveness of internet-delivered care for a wide range of people with knee osteoarthritis, but future confirmatory research is needed.";2018;3
"Background: Military veterans returning from a combat zone often face mental health challenges as a result of traumatic experiences. The veteran in the United States has been underdiagnosed and underserved. Since its advancement in the 1990s, telemedicine has become a more prevalent means of delivering services for post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans in the United States, but its adoption is not ubiquitous. Objective: To clarify the association of telemedicine and the treatment of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder through identification of facilitators and barriers to the adoption of the modality. Methods: Reviewers analysed articles from CINAHL and PubMed databases, using relative key words, selecting the 28 most germane to the study objective. Results: The most common adoption facilitators were: improving access to rural populations of veterans (22%), effective treatment outcomes (16%), and decreased costs related to care (13%). The most prevalent barriers were: veterans lacking access to necessary modalities (25%), availability of physicians competent in post-traumatic stress disorder treatment (20%), and complications with technology (20%). Five themes surfaced for facilitators: accessibility, effectiveness, cost reduction, positive patient perception, and supportive community; and 5 themes for barriers: access to technology, technical complications, physician availability, negative patient perception, and uninformed patients. Conclusion: This literature review identifies cost and outcomes-effectiveness. The association of telemedicine with the treatment of veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder is feasible, beneficial and effective.";2018;3
"Background: Musculoskeletal trauma at midlife and beyond imposes significant impact on function and quality of life: Rehabilitation is key to support early and sustained recovery. There are frequent barriers to attending in-person rehabilitation that may be overcome by the recent advances in technology (telerehabilitation). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of published evidence on telerehabilitation as a delivery mode for adults and older adults with musculoskeletal trauma. Methods: We followed established guidelines for conducting and reporting systematic reviews. We searched the following databases up to June 23, 2018: Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Google Scholar, MEDLINE (Ovid and PubMed), PsycINFO, and SportDiscus. We included publications across all available years and languages for community-dwelling adults (50 years and older) with musculoskeletal trauma; and interventions using the following delivery modes: Apps, computer, telephone, videophone, videoconference, webcam, webpage, or similar media. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria: Five studies for hip fracture (n = 260) and one study for proximal humeral fracture rehabilitation (n = 17). Four of the studies used telephone as the delivery mode, one used computer and another used video-conferencing. Two of the studies were pre-post with no comparator group, and the remaining four studies were randomized controlled trials with low or unclear risk of bias. Studies established some modes of remote delivery as feasible, but the generalizability of the findings were limited. Two studies observed significant between-group differences (favoring the intervention) for physical activity, quality of life, and self-efficacy. Conclusion: Very few studies exist that tested the effect of telerehabilitation for recovery after musculoskeletal trauma later in life. Given the global burden imposed by musculoskeletal trauma, this review underscores an important gap in clinical knowledge.";2018;3
Background: Neurological rehabilitation service in developing countries like India is a great challenge in view of limited resources and manpower. Currently, neurological rehabilitation with a multidisciplinary team is limited to a few major cities in the country. Tele-neurorehabilitation (TNR) is considered as an alternative and innovative approach in health care. It connects the needy patients with the health-care providers with minimum inconvenience and yields cost-effective health care. Aim: The aim of this study was to study the socioclinical parameters, feasibility, and utility of TNR services in India. Methodology: A retrospective file review of TNR consultations provided through Telemedicine Center at a quaternary hospital-based research center in south India between August 2012 and January 2016. Results: A total of 37 consultations were provided to the patients belonging to four districts of Karnataka. The mean age of the patients was 34.7 (+/- 19.5) years, 23 (62.1%) were aged between 19 and 60 years, and 31 (83.8%) were male. Thirty-one patients (83.8%) had central nervous system-related disorders such as stroke, cerebral palsy, and tubercular meningitis with sequelae or neuromuscular disorders such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Twelve patients (32.4%) were advised to consult higher centers in the vicinity, and the rest was referred to the district hospital. Conclusion: The findings suggest that TNR services are feasible, effective, and less resource intensive in delivering quality telemedicine care in India. More clinical studies are required to elucidate its full utility at different levels and in different parts of the country.;2018;3
BACKGROUND: New technologies, such as telerehabilitation and gaming devices offer the possibility for patients to train at home. This opens the challenge of safety for the patient as he/she is called to exercise neither with a therapist on the patients' side nor with a therapist linked remotely to supervise the sessions. AIM: To study the safety, usability and patient acceptance of an autonomous telerehabilitation system for balance and gait (the REWIRE platform) in the patients home. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Community, in the stroke patients' home. POPULATION: Fifteen participants with first-ever stroke, with a mild to moderate residual deficit of the lower extremities. METHODS: Autonomous rehabilitation based on virtual rehabilitation was provided at the participants' home for twelve weeks. The primary outcome was compliance (the ratio between days of actual and scheduled training), analyzed with the two-tailed Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. Furthermore safety is defined by adverse events. The secondary endpoint was the acceptance of the system measured with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Additionally, the cumulative duration of weekly training was analyzed. RESULTS: During the study there were no adverse events related to the therapy. Patients performed on average 71% (range 39 to 92%) of the scheduled sessions. The TAM Questionnaire showed excellent values for stroke patients after the training. The average training duration per week was 99 +/- 53min. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomous telerehabilitation for balance and gait training with the REWIRE-system is safe, feasible and can help to intensive rehabilitative therapy at home. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Telerehabilitation enables safe training in home environment and supports of the standard rehabilitation therapy.;2018;3
Background: Nonpharmacological interventions are needed to support the function of older adults struggling with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD). Telerehabilitation aims to provide rehabilitation at a distance, but cognitive rehabilitation by videoconferencing has not been explored. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation delivered in-person with videoconferencing to determine whether telehealth cognitive rehabilitation appears feasible. Methods: Random assignment to in-person or telehealth videoconferencing cognitive rehabilitation with a combined between-subjects, multiple baseline single-case experimental design, cognitive rehabilitation was delivered by a therapist to 6 participants with SCI (n=4), MCI (n=1), or dementia due to AD (n=1). Results: Two of the 6 participants randomly assigned to the telehealth condition withdrew before beginning the intervention. For those who participated in the intervention, 6 out of 6 goals measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure improved for those in the in-person group, and 7 out of 9 goals improved for those in the telehealth group. Conclusions: Delivery of cognitive rehabilitation by telehealth appeared feasible but required modifications such as greater reliance on caregivers and clients for manipulating materials.;2018;3
Background: Painful shoulders pose a substantial socioeconomic burden accounting for 2.4% of all primary care consultations in the UK. There is a strong evidence to indicate that the majority of this shoulder pain can be managed successfully with exercise based treatments and that common surgical procedures provide no extra benefit. Patient adherence and engagement is cited as an important factor in gaining positive outcomes. The MUJO System has been designed to help target the rehabilitation of the rotator cuff muscles which are commonly recommended for the management of shoulder pain. The purpose of this qualitative study was to evaluate the acceptability of the MUJO System amongst clinicians and patients. Methods: A qualitative study was undertaken to look at the usability of the MUJO System both from clinicians' and patients' perspectives. Patients with shoulder problems were identified by an experienced physiotherapist using the study eligibility criteria. and invited to participate. Semi-structured interviews were performed with patients and clinicians to explore factors surrounding its acceptability and feasibility of use. The study was designed using Normalisation Process Theory as a theoretical basis for the inquiry. Results: Seven physiotherapists and ten patients were interviewed in the study. The Internal and External Devices were seen as having the potential to rehabilitate the rotator cuff however it posed limitations towards more functional based exercises. Patients and clinicians found the visual feedback from the Patient App enhanced the rehabilitation experience. The Internal and External Devices were acceptable to all for rehabilitation providing the devices were available for use by the patients in the community. Conclusion: Patients and clinicians found the MUJO System acceptable as a modality to perform shoulder exercises. For the MUJO System to be taken up as a routine part of clinical practice patients need to be able to access the devices in the community. For the MUJO System to be taken up in clinical practice it needs to be workable within the context of the treatment pathway and not interfere with standard processes.;2018;3
Background: People with multiple sclerosis face varying levels of disability and symptoms, thus requiring highly trained therapists and/or exercise trainers to design personalized exercise programs. However, for people living in geographically isolated communities, access to such trained professionals can be challenging due to a number of barriers associated with cost, access to transportation, and travel distance. Generic mobile health exercise apps often fall short of what people with multiple sclerosis need to become physically active (ie, exercise content that has been adapted to accommodate a wide range of functional limitations). Objective: This usability study describes the development process of the TEAMS (Tele-Exercise and Multiple Sclerosis) app, which is being used by people with multiple sclerosis in a large randomized controlled trial to engage in home-based telerehabilitation. Methods: Twenty-one participants with disabilities (10 people with multiple sclerosis) were involved in the double iterative design, which included the simultaneous development of the app features and exercise content (exercise videos and articles). Framed within a user-centered design approach, the development process included 2 stages: ground-level creation (focus group followed by early stage evaluations and developments), and proof of concept through 2 usability tests. Usability (effectiveness, usefulness, and satisfaction) was evaluated using a mixed-methods approach. Results: During testing of the app's effectiveness, the second usability test resulted in an average of 1 problem per participant, a decrease of 53% compared to the initial usability test. Five themes were constructed from the qualitative data that related to app usefulness and satisfaction, namely: high perceived confidence for app usability, positive perceptions of exercise videos, viable exercise option at home, orientation and familiarity required for successful participation, and app issues. Participants acknowledged that the final app was ready to be delivered to the public after minor revisions. After including these revisions, the project team released the final app that is being used in the randomized controlled trial. Conclusions: A multi-level user-centered development process resulted in the development of an inclusive exercise program for people with multiple sclerosis operated through an easy-to-use app. The promotion of exercise through self-regulated mHealth programs requires a stakeholder-driven approach to app development. This ensures that app and content match the preferences and functional abilities of the end user (ie, people with varying levels of multiple sclerosis).;2018;3
"Background: Physical therapists are key players in the management of musculoskeletal conditions, which are common in rural and remote communities. There are few physical therapists in rural regions compared to potential need, so care is either not provided or must be sought in urban centers, requiring travel and time away from work and family to access services. Telerehabilitation strategies, such as real-time videoconferencing, are emerging as possible solutions to address shortages in rural physical therapy services. Objectives: This review will: (1) determine the validity and the reliability of secure videoconferencing for physical therapy management of musculoskeletal conditions; (2) determine the health, system, and process outcomes when using secure videoconferencing for physical therapy management of musculoskeletal conditions. Methods: A protocol-driven systematic review of four databases was carried out by two independent reviewers. Study criteria included English language articles from January 2003 to December 2016, on physical therapy management using secure videoconferencing, pertaining to adults 18-80 years with chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Randomized controlled trials, pre-experimental studies, and case-control studies were included. Quality analysis was performed utilizing standardized tools specific for the study designs. Results and conclusions: Validity and reliability studies were identified as having high risk of bias. Intervention studies were of moderate quality, and found positive impact on health outcomes and satisfaction. Two studies evaluated costs, with evidence of cost savings in one study. More robust research is required to evaluate long-term effects of telerehabilitation for physical therapy management of musculoskeletal disorders, including cost-benefit analyses.";2018;3
Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective therapeutic intervention for people with chronic respiratory disease. However, fewer than 5% of eligible individuals receive pulmonary rehabilitation on an annual basis, largely due to limited availability of services and difficulties associated with travel and transport. The Rehabilitation Exercise At Home (REAcH) study is an assessor-blinded, multi-centre, randomised controlled equivalence trial designed to compare the efficacy of home-based telerehabilitation and traditional centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation in people with chronic respiratory disease. Methods: Participants will undertake an 8-week group-based pulmonary rehabilitation program of twice-weekly supervised exercise training, either in-person at a centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation program or remotely from their home via the Internet. Supervised exercise training sessions will include 30 min of aerobic exercise (cycle and/or walking training). Individualised education and self-management training will be delivered. All participants will be prescribed a home exercise program of walking and strengthening activities. Outcomes will be assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline, after completion of the intervention, and 12-months post intervention. The primary outcome is change in dyspnea score as measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire - dyspnea domain (CRQ-D). Secondary outcomes will evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation on 6-min walk distance, endurance cycle time during a constant work rate test, physical activity and quality of life. Adherence to pulmonary rehabilitation between the two models will be compared. A full economic analysis from a societal perspective will be undertaken to determine the cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation compared to centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation. Discussion: Alternative models of pulmonary rehabilitation are required to improve both equity of access and patient-related outcomes. This trial will establish whether telerehabilitation can achieve equivalent improvement in outcomes compared to traditional centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation. If efficacious and cost-effective, the proposed telerehabilitation model is designed to be rapidly deployed into clinical practice.;2018;3
"Background: Sensory augmentation has been shown to improve postural stability during real-time balance applications. Limited long-term controlled studies have examined retention of balance improvements in healthy older adults after training with sensory augmentation has ceased. This pilot study aimed to assess the efficacy of long-term balance training with and without sensory augmentation among community-dwelling healthy older adults. Methods: Twelve participants (four males, eight females; 75.6 +/- 4.9 yrs) were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 6) or control group (n = 6). Participants trained in their homes for eight weeks, completing three 45-min exercise sessions per week using smart phone balance trainers that provided written, graphic, and video guidance, and monitored trunk sway. During each session, participants performed six repetitions of six exercises selected from five categories (static standing, compliant surface standing, weight shifting, modified center of gravity, and gait). The experimental group received vibrotactile sensory augmentation for four of the six repetitions per exercise via the smart phone balance trainers, while the control group performed exercises without sensory augmentation. The smart phone balance trainers sent exercise performance data to a physical therapist, who recommended exercises on a weekly basis. Balance performance was assessed using a battery of clinical balance tests (Activity Balance Confidence Scale, Sensory Organization Test, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, Five Times Sit to Stand Test, Four Square Step Test, Functional Reach Test, Gait Speed Test, Timed Up and Go, and Timed Up and Go with Cognitive Task) before training, after four weeks of training, and after eight weeks of training. Results: Participants in the experimental group were able to use vibrotactile sensory augmentation independently in their homes. After training, the experimental group had significantly greater improvements in Sensory Organization Test and Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test scores than the control group. Significant improvement was also observed for Five Times Sit to Stand Test duration within the experimental group, but not in the control group. No significant improvements between the two groups were observed in the remaining clinical outcome measures. Conclusion: The findings of this study support the use of sensory augmentation devices by community-dwelling healthy older adults as balance rehabilitation tools, and indicate feasibility of telerehabilitation therapy with reduced input from clinicians.";2018;3
Background: Severe acquired brain injury (SABI) rehabilitation should be as intensive and long as to allow the patients get the best independence and quality of life (QoL), but facing with the rehabilitation socioeconomic burden. Telerehabilitation (TR) could supply frail subjects requiring long-term rehabilitation. Methods: A multicenter, prospective, parallel design, single-blind trial will be conducted at the IRCCS Neurolesi Bonino Pulejo (Messina, Italy) and IRCCS Hospital San Camillo (Venice, Italy) involving patients suffering from SABI and requiring home motor and cognitive rehabilitation. We will investigate the use of TR, based on advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions, taking into account that the supervision of rehabilitation at home will be enriched with the counseling and vital parameters monitoring. The enrolled patients will be balanced for pathology, and randomized in 2 groups, performing TR (G1) or standard rehabilitation training (G2), respectively, according to a pc-generated random assignment. TR will be delivered by means of an advanced video-conferencing system, whereas the patient will be provided with low-cost monitoring devices, able to collect data about his/her health status and QoL. In both the groups each treatment (either cognitive or motor, or both as per patient functional status) will last about 1 hour a day, 5 days/week, for 12 weeks. Two structured telephone interviews will be administered to the patients (when possible) and/or their caregivers, and to all the healthcare professionals involved in the patient management, 1 week after the beginning and at the end of the TR. All the patients will undergo a complete neurological and cognitive examination performed by skilled physicians and psychologists, blindly. Clinical evaluations will be administered blindly, before and after the treatments. Results: the data of this study should demonstrate that TR is at least non-inferior in comparison with the same amount of usual territorial rehabilitative physical treatments, taking into account patients' functional recovery, psychological well-being, caregiver burden, and healthcare costs. Conclusion: data coming from this study could demonstrate the usefulness of TR in facing the rehabilitation socioeconomic burden of managing patients with SABI, so to allow the patients get the best independence and quality of life (QoL).;2018;3
Background: Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) have begun to incorporate telepractice methods into clinical service delivery and online intervention for aphasia is recognised as an appropriate alternative to face-to-face services. However, little is known about the SLP experience of telepractice with no known study exploring the provision of aphasia group therapy online. The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of SLPs who provided the online aphasia group therapy, Telerehabilitation Group Aphasia Intervention and Networking (TeleGAIN), to people with aphasia (PWA) and their perceptions regarding the outcomes of intervention and feasibility of implementation into clinical practice.Aims: The aim of this study was to describe the experience of SLPs who provide TeleGAIN to people with aphasia including the perceived outcomes of the intervention and treatment procedures.Methods & Procedures: Three SLPs with experience in aphasia rehabilitation delivered at least one 12week block of TeleGAIN - an aphasia group intervention purposefully developed for delivery via telepractice. Prior to TeleGAIN, SLPs were trained in using the technology required and the goals, activities, and constructs of TeleGAIN. The goals of TeleGAIN for PWA were to 1) create opportunities for communicative success, 2) share personal life history, and 3) provide support for living successfully with aphasia through networking with others. The SLPs provided this intervention to 21 PWA across six groups. Following completion of all treatment blocks, each SLP participated in a semi-structured interview exploring their perceptions of TeleGAIN and the potential for implementation. Interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis and key categories were identified.Outcomes & Results: SLPs enjoyed providing the online aphasia group therapy TeleGAIN, and considered the intervention to be feasible and worthwhile. SLPs developed a range of strategies to manage the barriers to implementing the online group successfully and promoted those factors that facilitated more efficient and effective group sessions. In addition, benefits for individuals with aphasia, SLPs and SLP services were recognised despite challenges with technology and group dynamics experienced during TeleGAIN.Conclusions: The results from this study suggested that although SLPs may take time to improve their skills and confidence in telepractice, they were successfully able to provide online group aphasia therapy to PWA. The experience of the SLPs in this study suggested that commonly cited barriers to telepractice such as rapport building and technology issues were able to be overcome. SLPs perceived that TeleGAIN offered PWA many communication and psychosocial benefits and may improve SLP service provision. Findings support investigation of the implementation of TeleGAIN into clinical services.;2018;3
"Background: Stroke is one of leading diseases causing adult death and disability worldwide. Home-based telerehabilitation has become a novel approach for stroke patients as effective as conventional rehabilitation, and more convenient and economical than conventional rehabilitation. However, there is no study assessing the mechanism of home-based telerehabilitation in promoting motor recovery among stroke patients with hemiplegic. Aims: This study is designed to determine the efficacy and explore the mechanism of motor recovery after home-based telerehabilitation in stroke patients with motor deficits. Methods/Design: In a single-blinded randomized controlled pilot study, patients with acute subcortical stroke (n=40) are assigned to receive home-based telerehabilitation or conventional rehabilitation. Task-based or resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) score will acquired before and after rehabilitation. Activation volume of bilateral primary motor (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC); lateralization index (LI) of interhemispheric M1, SMA, and PMC; functional connectivity of bilateral M1, SMA, PMC; fractional anisotropy (FA) will be measured; correlation analyses will be performed between neuroimaging biomarkers and FMA score pre- and postrehabilitation. Discussion: We present a study design and rationale to explore the effectiveness and neural mechanism of home-based rehabilitation for stroke patients with motor deficits. The study limitations related to the small-amount sample. Moreover, home-based rehabilitation may provide an alternative means of recovery for stroke patients. Ultimately, results of this trial will help to understand the neural mechanism of home-based telerehabilitation among stroke patients with hand movement disorder.";2018;3
Background: Subacromial impingement syndrome poses a substantial socioeconomic burden, leading to significant consumption of healthcare. Health systems are calling for greater evidence of economic impacts of particular healthcare services. Telerehabilitation programmes have the potential to reduce costs and improve patient access as an alternative to traditional care. Cost analysis has been traditionally included in study protocols and results, although the reliability and research methodology have frequently been under debate. The aim of this study was to compare costs related to a telerehabilitation programme versus conventional physiotherapy following subacromial decompression surgery (ASD). Methods: The study was embedded in a randomised controlled trial. The economic analysis was based on the perspective of the health sector and the human capital method. Only the costs associated with the provision of physiotherapy services were taken into account. Costs were measured during the intervention period between baseline and 12 weeks for both groups. Student's t-test was used to compare independent variables between the two groups, with a 95% confidence interval for the estimates and real costs. Results: The estimated total cost analysis shows a preliminary cost differential in favour of the telerehabilitation group, meaning that for each participant's total intervention, telerehabilitation saves 29.8% of the costs. Real cost analysis, only for received treatments, shows a cost differential in favour of telerehabilitation, meaning that for each participant's total intervention, telerehabilitation saves 22.15% of the costs incurred for conventional rehabilitation. Conclusions: Our study provides direct and meaningful information about telerehabilitation opportunities and can be an essential component in further cost evaluations for different strategies after surgical procedures. This study demonstrates that there was a trend towards lower healthcare costs after ASD. Managers now have the responsibility to decide whether to implement telerehabilitation based on clinical and economic data.;2018;3
Background: Telerehabilitation (TR) aimed at patients with COPD has shown promising effects on symptoms, physical function, and quality of life, but little research has been conducted to understand the impact of implementation on frontline health professionals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the barriers and enablers of health professionals to online exercise-based TR in patients with COPD, to support a successful implementation process. Methods: Semistructured individual and focus group interviews were conducted with 25 health professionals working with conventional CORD rehabilitation or TR. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Investigator triangulation was applied during data generation. The Theoretical Domains Framework directed the interview guide and was used as a coding framework in the analysis. Results: We identified six predominant domains essential in understanding the enablers and barriers of TR from a staff perspective: 1) skills, 2) professional role and identity, 3) beliefs about capabilities, 4) beliefs about consequences, 5) environmental context and resources, and 6) social influences. We found that health professionals held both enablers and barriers important for the implementation process of TR. TR introduces new work tasks and new ways for the health professionals to communicate and exercise with the patients, which influence their professional role and self-perceived capability. Conclusion: Specific attention toward involvement of the health professionals in the decision process combined with sufficient education and skill training is highly essential to support a successful implementation of TR in clinical practice.;2018;3
Background: Tele-rehabilitation after stroke holds promise for under-resourced settings, especially sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with its immense stroke burden and severely limited physical therapy services. Objective: To preliminarily assess the feasibility and outcomes of mobile technology-assisted physical therapy exercises for stroke survivors in Ghana. Methods: We conducted a prospective, single arm, pre-post study involving 20 stroke survivors recruited from a tertiary medical center, who received a Smartphone with the 9zest Stroke App (R) to deliver individualized, goal targeted 5-days-a-week exercise program that was remotely supervised by a tele-therapist for 12 weeks. Outcome measures included changes in stroke levity scale scores (SLS), Modified Rankin score (MRS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and feasibility indicators. Results: Among study participants, mean +/- SD age was 54.6 +/- 10.2 years, 11 (55%) were men, average time from stroke onset was 6 months. No participants dropped out. Compared with baseline status, mean SD scores on SLS improved from 7.5 +/ 3.1 to 11.8 +/- 2.2 at month 1 (p < 0.0001) and 12.2 +/- 2.4 at month 3 (p < 0.0001), MOCA scores improved from 18.2 +/- 4.3 to 20.4 +/- 4.7 at month 1 (p = 0.14), and 22.2 +/- 7.6 at month 3 (p = 0.047). Mean SD weekly sessions performed by participants per month was 5.7 +/- 5.8 and duration of sessions was 25.5 +/- 16.2 min. Erratic internet connectivity negatively affected full compliance with the intervention, although satisfaction ratings by study participants were excellent. Conclusion: It is feasible to administer an m-health delivered physical therapy intervention in SSA, with high user satisfaction. Randomized trials to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this intervention are warranted.;2018;3
Background: Tele-rehabilitation for stroke survivors has emerged as a promising intervention for remotely supervised administration of physical, occupational, speech, and other forms of therapies aimed at improving motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric deficits from stroke. Objective: We aimed to provide an updated systematic review on the efficacy of tele-rehabilitation interventions for recovery from motor, higher cortical dysfunction, and poststroke depression among stroke survivors. Methods: We searched PubMed and Cochrane library from January 1, 1980 to July 15, 2017 using the following keywords: Telerehabilitation stroke, Mobile health rehabilitation, Telemedicine stroke rehabilitation, and Telerehabilitation. Our inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials, pilot trials, or feasibility trials that included an intervention group that received any tele-rehabilitation therapy for stroke survivors compared with a control group on usual or standard of care. Results: This search yielded 49 abstracts. By consensus between 2 investigators, 22 publications met the criteria for inclusion and further review. Tele-rehabilitation interventions focused on motor recovery (n = 18), depression, or caregiver strain (n = 2) and higher cortical dysfunction (n = 2). Overall, tele-rehabilitation interventions were associated with significant improvements in recovery from motor deficits, higher cortical dysfunction, and depression in the intervention groups in all studies assessed, but significant differences between intervention versus control groups were reported in 8 of 22 studies in favor of tele-rehabilitation group while the remaining studies reported nonsignificant differences. Conclusion: This updated systematic review provides evidence to suggest that tele-rehabilitation interventions have either better or equal salutary effects on motor, higher cortical, and mood disorders compared with conventional face-to-face therapy.;2018;3
"Background: Telerehabilitation is an emerging technology through which medical rehabilitation care can be provided from a distance. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to investigate the efficacy of telerehabilitation in poststroke patients. Methods: Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by searching MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science databases. Continuous data were extracted for relevant outcomes and analyzed using the RevMan software as the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI in a fixed-effect meta-analysis model. Results: We included 15 studies (1339 patients) in our systematic review, while only 12 were included in the pooled analysis. The combined effect estimate showed no significant differences between the telerehabilitation and control groups in terms of the Barthel Index (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.08), Berg Balance Scale (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.26), Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (SMD 0.50, 95% CI -0.09 to 1.09), and Stroke Impact Scale (mobility subscale; SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.48]) scores. Moreover, the majority of included studies showed that both groups were comparable in terms of health-related quality of life (of stroke survivors), Caregiver Strain Index, and patients' satisfaction with care. One study showed that the cost of telerehabilitation was lower than usual care by US $867. Conclusions: Telerehabilitation can be a suitable alternative to usual rehabilitation care in poststroke patients, especially in remote or underserved areas. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness with the ongoing improvements in telerehabilitation networks.";2018;3
Background: Telerehabilitation promises to greatly expand access of underserved populations to speech therapy, but concerns remain about the effectiveness of services delivered remotely compared to in-person treatment.Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation, we conducted a randomized non-inferiority trial for chronic poststroke communication disorders, testing whether equivalent gains can be expected from in-person vs. telerehabilitative clinical service delivery, with both groups completing homework exercises outside of therapist contact time.Methods & Procedures: We treated 44 participants with aphasia or cognitive-linguistic communication disorder (CLCD). Treatment comprised tablet-based homework exercises and realistic, customized treatment plans tailored to the needs of each individual client. Clients had weekly 1-h sessions with the therapist over 10weeks, with the interaction randomized to in-person and telerehabilitation conditions. Objective gains were assessed with the Western Aphasia Battery aphasia quotient (WAB-AQ) (for aphasia) and Cognitive-Linguistic Quick Test (CLQT) (for CLCD) and subjective gains with the Communication Confidence Rating Scale for Aphasia (CCRSA) (self-rating) and Communication Effectiveness Index (CETI) (partner rating).Outcomes & Results: Participants improved significantly on all of these measures, with statistically equivalent gains between in-person and telerehabilitation groups for WAB-AQ, CLQT, and CETI. Only the CCRSA showed an advantage for the in-person group. Gains on WAB-AQ were correlated with total time spent on offline exercises.Conclusions: Clinician-guided computer-based treatment is effective for producing widespread gains in language and communication skills in chronic stroke. Linguistic gains are equivalent whether clinician services are provided via telerehabilitation equipment or in person. Communicative confidence may still benefit from in-person treatment, reinforcing the need for social engagement in addition to deficit-focused linguistic treatment.;2018;3
Background: Telerehabilitation promises to improve quality, increase patient access and reduce costs in health care. Physiotherapy with exercises is generally recommended to restore function after surgery in patients with chronic subacromial syndrome. Relatively few studies have investigated the feasibility of telerehabilitation interventions in musculoskeletal and orthopaedic disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a customizable telerehabilitation intervention and compare with traditional care. Methods: This research includes 18 consecutive patients with subacromial impingement who underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression in a controlled clinical prospective study. Patients were randomized to either a 12-week telerehabilitation programme or the usual face-to-face physical therapy for immediate postoperative rehabilitation We have developed a telerehabilitation system to provide services to patients who have undergone shoulder arthroscopy. An independent blinded observer performed postoperative follow-up after 4,8, and 12 weeks. Results: The preliminary efficacy of this telerehabilitation programme in terms of both physical and functional objective outcome measures was assessed on eight patients. Using the Constant-Murley score to evaluate functional outcome, patients in the telerehabilitation group were shown to have improved from a mean 43.50 +/- 3.21 points to a mean 68.50 +/- 0.86 points after 12 weeks. The physical and functional improvements in the telerehabilitation group were similar to those in the control group (p = 0.213). There was a non-significant trend for greater improvements in the telerehabilitation group for most outcome measurements. Conclusion: The results of this study provide evidence for the efficacy of telerehabilitation after shoulder arthroscopy in shoulder impingement syndrome. A telerehabilitation programme with range of motion, strengthening of the rotator cuff and scapula stabilizers exercises seems to be similar and not inferior to traditional face-to-face physiotherapy after subacromial arthroscopic decompression. Through this study, we are developing our preliminary dataset to evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation programmes following surgical procedures in musculoskeletal injuries and for comparison with more traditional interventions.;2018;3
Background: The Cochrane review on the effectiveness of speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke suggests intensity of therapy is a key predictor for outcome. Current aphasia services cannot provide intervention at the intensity observed within trial contexts because of resource limitations. Telerehabilitation could widen access to speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in geographically remote contexts and reduce the time spent on travel by the therapist and patient. The current academic literature within this field is in its infancy, with few trials of speech and language therapy (SLT) delivered by videoconference. Our pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will explore feasibility aspects and effectiveness of telerehabilitation for aphasia in addition to standard SLT. Method/design: Our study is a pragmatic, exploratory, pilot randomized controlled trial, where participants will be randomized to a telerehabilitation group or a control group. Both groups receive standard SLT (usual care) but the telerehabilitation group receives an additional 5 h of telerehabilitation per week over 4 weeks through videoconference. This additional telerehabilitation focuses on spoken language with an emphasis on word naming. We aim to include 40 patients in each group, with inclusion criteria being aphasia any time post stroke. Participants will be assessed blindly at pre-randomization (baseline), and 4 weeks and 4 months after randomization. The primary endpoint is naming ability 3 months after the completed intervention, measured by the Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment (NGA) naming subtest. Secondary endpoints include other subtests of the NGA, the VAST (Verb and Sentence Test) subtest sentence production, Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI) and the Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life scale (SAQOL-39). Experiences of patients and SLPs with telerehabilitation are assessed using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Statistical between group comparisons will be in line with an intention-to-treat analysis. Discussion: This pilot RCT of intensive language training by videoconference will contribute new scientific evidence to the field of aphasia telerehabilitation. Here, we describe our trial which will explore the feasibility of telerehabilitation for aphasia as an intervention, our choice of primary and secondary outcome measures and proposed analyses. Our trial will provide information for the development and delivery of future definitive RCTs.;2018;3
Background: The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to compare formal outpatient physical therapy (PT) and unsupervised home exercises after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Methods: Fifty-two patients were randomized to 6 weeks of outpatient PT or an unsupervised home exercise program after UKA. The primary outcome was change in range of motion at 6 weeks with secondary outcomes including total arc of motion, Knee Society Score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Jr, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, and Veterans Rands-12 score. Results: Twenty-five patients received outpatient PT, 22 patients the self-directed exercise program, while 3 patients deviated from the protocol, 1 patient withdrew, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. There was no difference in the change of range of motion (P = .43) or total arc of motion at 6 weeks (P = .17) between the groups and likewise no significant differences were found in any of the secondary outcomes. Two patients who crossed over from the unsupervised home exercise program to formal outpatient PT within the first 2 weeks postoperatively required a manipulation under anesthesia. Conclusions: Our results suggest self-directed exercises may be appropriate for most patients following UKA. However, there is a subset of patients who may benefit from formal PT.

"Background: There is a lack of evidence-based health services to reduce the impact of stroke in low-income countries at a personal, family or community level. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of: i) a mobile phone supported family-centred intervention (F@ce (TM)), and ii) the study design for evaluating the effects of the intervention on the perceived impact of stroke; perceived participation in everyday life; and self-efficacy in everyday activities amongst persons with stroke and their families in Uganda. Methods: The study comprised a pre-post design with an intervention group (IG) receiving the F@ce (TM) and a control group (CG). The inclusion criteria's were: a) confirmed stroke diagnosis, b) access to and ability to use a mobile phone, c) ability to communicate in English and/or Luganda, d) > 18 years, e) residents in Kampala, and f) a Modified Rankin Scale level 2 to 4. The aimof the F@ce (TM) was to increase functioning in daily activities for persons living with the consequences of stroke, and participation in everyday life for persons with stroke and their families. The F@ce (TM) was an eight-week family-centred intervention, which entailed goal setting and problem-solving strategies, daily reminders and self-rated follow-ups of performance by short message service (SMS). Data were collected in the participants' home environment at baseline and after eight weeks. Data on acceptability of the F@ce (TM) and study procedures were collected by log-books and the responses of the SMS follow ups on the server. The primary outcomes were performance and satisfaction of valued daily activities in everyday life using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), self-efficacy in performance of activities in daily life. Results: The IG comprised n = 13 and the CG n = 15. There were differences between the IG and CG in changes between baseline and follow-up in the primary outcomes COPM (performance component) and self-efficacy in favour of F@ce (TM). Overall with minor modifications the intervention and the study design were feasible for all participants involved. Conclusion: The results support the need for further research to rigorously evaluate the effects of F@ceT (TM) since the intervention appears to be feasible for persons with stroke and their family members.";2018;3
"Background: There is limited research about the effects of video quality on the accuracy of assessments of physical function. Methods: A repeated measures study design was used to assess reliability and validity of the finger-nose test (FNT) and the finger-tapping test (FTT) carried out with 50 veterans who had impairment in gross and/or fine motor coordination. Videos were scored by expert raters under eight differing conditions, including in-person, high definition video with slow motion review and standard speed videos with varying bit rates and frame rates. Results: FTT inter-rater reliability was excellent with slow motion video (ICC 0.98-0.99) and good (ICC 0.59) under the normal speed conditions. Inter-rater reliability for FNT 'attempts' was excellent (ICC 0.97-0.99) for all viewing conditions; for FNT 'misses' it was good to excellent (ICC 0.89) with slow motion review but substantially worse (ICC 0.44) on the normal speed videos. FTT criterion validity (i.e. compared to slow motion review) was excellent (beta = 0.94) for the in-person rater and good (beta = 0.77) on normal speed videos. Criterion validity for FNT 'attempts' was excellent under all conditions (r >= 0.97) and for FNT 'misses' it was good to excellent under all conditions (beta = 0.61-0.81). Conclusions: In general, the inter-rater reliability and validity of the FNT and FTT assessed via video technology is similar to standard clinical practices, but is enhanced with slow motion review and/or higher bit rate.";2018;3
"Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an effective neuromodulation adjunct to repetitive motor training in promoting motor recovery post-stroke. Finger tracking training is motor training whereby people with stroke use the impaired index finger to trace waveform-shaped lines on a monitor. Our aims were to assess the feasibility and safety of a telerehabilitation program consisting of tDCS and finger tracking training through questionnaires on ease of use, adverse symptoms, and quantitative assessments of motor function and cognition. We believe this telerehabilitation program will be safe and feasible, and may reduce patient and clinic costs. Methods: Six participants with hemiplegia post-stroke [mean (SD) age was 61 (10) years; 3 women; mean (SD) time post-stroke was 5.5 (6.5) years] received five 20-min tDCS sessions and finger tracking training provided through telecommunication. Safety measurements included the Digit Span Forward Test for memory, a survey of symptoms, and the Box and Block test for motor function. We assessed feasibility by adherence to treatment and by a questionnaire on ease of equipment use. We reported descriptive statistics on all outcome measures. Results: Participants completed all treatment sessions with no adverse events. Also, 83.33% of participants found the set-up easy, and all were comfortable with the devices. There was 100% adherence to the sessions and all recommended telerehabilitation. Conclusions: tDCS with finger tracking training delivered through telerehabilitation was safe, feasible, and has the potential to be a cost-effective home-based therapy for post-stroke motor rehabilitation.";2018;3
Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most significant cause of death and severe disability following major trauma within Australia. Populations at risk include young adults aged 15 to 34, older adults, and military personnel. The main form of intervention following traumatic brain injury is rehabilitation, which places a large demand on the health care system. Telerehabilitation involves interventions delivered via telecommunication, which can improve accessibility and reduce this burden. There have been no systematic reviews conducted on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation in treating traumatic brain injury. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine the effectiveness of telerehabilitation for adults with traumatic brain injury. Methods: A systematic search of Medline, Embase, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, The Cochrane Library, OTSeeker, and Google Scholar was conducted. Studies were included with participants aged 18 to 64 with traumatic brain injury and receiving telerehabilitation interventions. Methodological quality was assessed using critical appraisal tools: Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for randomized controlled trials and McMaster Critical Review for Quantitative Studies for nonrandomized studies. Results: Three randomized controlled trials, one pseudo-randomized controlled trial, one case-control trial, and one pre-post case series were included in this systematic review. Critical appraisal of the included studies showed overall methodological quality to be moderate. A range of interventions with differing parameters were used as part of telerehabilitation. Collectively, there was some consistent evidence to indicate that telerehabilitation may be equally effective as other forms of care in the delivery of cognitive and psychological interventions in addressing memory and depressive symptoms for adults with mild to severe traumatic brain injury. However, it is unclear if it is superior to other forms of care. Conclusions: In a small number of studies, the effect of telerehabilitation for adults with traumatic brain injury has been investigated. The current evidence base is limited due to lack of standardized intervention parameters, outcomes measures, and robust sample size. Despite these limitations, telerehabilitation may be a complementary model of care for adults with traumatic brain injury, especially in instances in which traditional models of care may not be readily accessible (such as those in rural and remote areas).;2018;3
Background: Unilateral Spatial Neglect (USN) is traditionally assessed with paper-and-pencil tests or computer-based tests. Thanks to the wide-spreading of mobile devices, and the extensive capabilities that they have in dealing complex elements, it is possible to provide clinicians with tools for cognitive assessment. Contemporary 3D engine is, in general generally, able to deploy complex 3D environments for iOS, Android and Windows mobile, i.e., most of the mobile phone and tablet operative systems. Results: This brand-new scenario and pressing requests from professionals, pushed us to build an application for the assessment of USN. Our first attempt was to replicate the classic cognitive tests, traditionally used at this purpose. Ecological assessment is difficult in real scenarios so we implemented virtual environments to assess patients' abilities in realistic situations. At the moment, the application is available only for iPad and iPhone for free, from the Apple Store, under the name of Neglect App. The App contains traditional tests (e.g., barrage with and without distractors) and ecological tests (e.g., to distribute the tea in a table to close people). Scoring of each test is available to the clinicians through a database with the executed ecological tasks, that are stored locally. Conclusion: In conclusion, Neglect App is an advanced mobile platform for the assessment of Neglect.;2018;3
BackgroundPhysical inactivity is associated with poor health outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is therefore crucial for patients to have a physically active lifestyle. The aims of this feasibility study were to assess a tablet-based physical activity behavioural intervention in virtual groups for COPD regarding 1) patients' acceptance 2) technology usability 3) patients' exercise programme adherence and 4) changes in patients' physical activity level.MethodsWe used an application with functionality for a virtual peer group, a digital exercise diary, a follow-along exercise video, and visual rewards on the home screen wallpaper. The exercise programme combined scheduled virtual group exercising (outdoor ground walking, indoor resistance and strength training) with self-chosen individual exercises. Ten participants with COPD were enrolled into two exercise training groups. Patients' acceptance was assessed by semi-structured interviews, technology usability was assessed by the System Usability Scale, and exercise programme adherence and level of physical activity by self-reporting. The interviews were also used for the latter three aspects.ResultsThe virtual peer group was experienced as motivating, helping participants to get started and be physically active. They updated their own activity status and kept track of the others' status. Having a time schedule for the virtual group exercises helped them to avoid postponing the exercise training. All participants recorded individual exercises in the diary, the exercise video was well received and used, and most participants paid attention to the visual rewards. All participants found the technology easy both to learn and to use. The exercise programme adherence was good, with, on average, 77% attendance for the virtual group exercises, and all participants performed additional individual exercises. The average number of physical activity sessions per week was doubled from 2.9 (range 0-10, median 2) at baseline to 5.9 (range 3.3-10.33, median 4.8) during the intervention period.ConclusionThe results indicate that the tablet-based intervention may be feasible in COPD, and that it was acceptable, encouraged a sense of peer support and fellowship in the group and motivated participants to physical activity and exercise training in daily life. Further assessment is needed on patient outcomes.;2018;3
BackgroundThe uptake of eRehabilitation programs in stroke care is insufficient, despite the growing availability. The aim of this study was to explore which factors influence the uptake of eRehabilitation in stroke rehabilitation, among stroke patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare professionals.MethodsA qualitative focus group study with eight focus groups (6-8 participants per group) was conducted: six with stroke patients/informal caregivers and two with healthcare professionals involved in stroke rehabilitation (rehabilitation physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, managers). Focus group interviews were audiotaped, transcribed in full, and analyzed by direct content analysis using the implementation model of Grol.ResultsThirty-two patients, 15 informal caregivers, and 13 healthcare professionals were included. A total of 14 influencing factors were found, grouped to 5 of the 6 levels of the implementation model of Grol (Innovation, Organizational context, Individual patient, Individual professional, and Economic and political context). Most quotes of patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare professionals were classified to factors at the level of the Innovation (e.g., content, attractiveness, and feasibility of eRehabilitation programs). In addition, for patients, relatively many quotes were classified to factors at the level of the individual patient (e.g., patients characteristics as fatigue and the inability to understand ICT-devices), and for healthcare professionals at the level of the organizational context (e.g., having sufficient time and the fit with existing processes of care).ConclusionAlthough there was a considerable overlap in reported factors between patients/informal caregivers and healthcare professionals when it concerns eRehabilitation as innovation, its seems that patients/informal caregivers give more emphasis to factors related to the individual patient, whereas healthcare professionals emphasize the importance of factors related to the organizational context. This difference should be considered when developing an implementation strategy for patients and healthcare professionals separately.;2018;3
"BackgroundTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has been shown to improve common symptoms of neurological disorders like depressed mood, fatigue, motor deficits and cognitive dysfunction. tDCS requires daily treatment sessions in order to be effective. We developed a remotely supervised tDCS (RS-tDCS) protocol for participants with multiple sclerosis (MS) to increase accessibility of tDCS, reducing clinician, patient, and caregiver burden. The goal of this protocol is to facilitate home use for larger trials with extended treatment periods. In this study we determine the generalizability of RS-tDCS paired with cognitive training (CT) by testing its feasibility in participants with Parkinson's disease (PD).MethodsFollowing the methods in our MS protocol development, we enrolled sixteen participants (n=12 male, n=4 female; mean age 66years) with PD to complete ten open-label sessions of RS-tDCS paired with CT (2.0mAx20min) at home under the remote supervision of a trained study technician. Tolerability data were collected before, during, and after each individual session. Baseline and follow-up measures included symptom inventories (fatigue and sleep) and cognitive assessments.ResultsRS-tDCS was feasible and tolerable for patients with PD, with at-home access leading to high protocol compliance. Side effects were mostly limited to mild sensations of transient itching and burning under the electrode sites. Similar to prior finding sin MS, we found preliminary efficacy for improvement of fatigue and cognitive processing speed in PD.ConclusionsRS-tDCS paired with CT is feasible for participants with PD to receive at home treatment. Signals of benefit for reduced fatigue and improved cognitive processing speed are consistent across the PD and MS samples. RS-tDCS can be generalized to provide tDCS to a range of patients with neurologic disorders for at-home rehabilitation.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02746705.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are a proven therapy for patients with cardiovascular disease, reducing future cardiac events and premature mortality. However, as little as 10% of eligible patients attend these programs, with a key reason being geographical inaccessibility. In Canada, more than 90% of Canadians have Internet access, and there are approximately 31 million cell phone subscribers, with these numbers expected to continue to increase. The proliferation of these affordable communications technologies has opened up opportunities for patient communication while bridging geographic distance. This has led to the development of virtual CR that can be remotely conducted, reaching patients in their homes and communities. These programs have used a range of technologies such as telephone, Internet, text messaging, and smartphones. Early research has focused on acceptance of use and feasibility in pilot studies, indicating patient willingness for use. More recently, a number of small, randomized trials have been conducted indicating potential positive effect on various clinical outcomes. This narrative review highlights the evidence to date on the use of virtual CR, using a variety of affordable communications technologies from early feasibility studies to modest randomized controlled trials. Finally, lessons from previous studies are discussed to help inform the development and testing of future virtual CR. This will be important if virtual CR is to become part of standard health care.;2018;3
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) frequently coexist, significantly reducing the patient's quality of life (QoL) and increasing morbidity, disability and mortality. For both diseases, a multidisciplinary disease-management approach offers the best outcomes and reduces hospital readmissions. In both conditions, muscle dysfunction may dramatically influence symptoms, exercise tolerance/performance, health status and healthcare costs. The present review describes muscular abnormalities and mechanisms underlying these alterations. This review also discusses studies on training programs for patients with COPD, CHF and, where available, combined COPD-CHF diagnosis. Dyspnea, peripheral muscles and activities of daily living (ADL) represent a potential starting point for improving patients' functioning level and quality of life in COPD and CHF. A synergy of the combined diagnostic, pharmacological and rehabilitation treatment interventions is also essential. Integration between exercise training, drug therapy and nutritional care could be a valid, synergic and tailored approach for patients presenting with both diseases, and may have a positive impact on the exercise performance.;2018;3
Chronic spinal pain conditions can often be successfully managed by a non-surgical, multidisciplinary approach, however many individuals are unable to access such specialised services within their local community. A possible solution may be the delivery of care via telerehabilitation. This study aimed to evaluate clinicians' perspectives on providing clinical care via telerehabilitation during the early implementation of a novel spinal telerehabilitation service. Eight clinicians' were recruited, completing surveys at four separate time points. Confidence in providing treatment via telerehabilitation significantly improved with time (chi(2)(3)=16.22, p=0.001). Clinicians became significantly more accepting of telerehabilitation being a time(chi(2)(3)=11.237, p=0.011), and cost-effective (chi(2)(3)=9.466, p=0.024) platform in which they could deliver care. Overall satisfaction was high, with technology becoming easier to use (p=0.026) and ability to establish rapport significantly improved with experience (p=0.043). Understanding clinicians' perspectives throughout the early implementation phase of a new telerehabilitation service is a critical component in determining long-term sustainability.;2018;3
Considering the increasing burden of costs on health care systems in general, new approaches to rise effectiveness and increase information transfer are to be sought. Telerehabilitation and rehabilitation at home are promising candidates. The REHABitation database was created in order to effectively communicate new concepts and approaches not only to the researchers in the field of rehabilitative medicine and medical staf at the clinic environment, but also to the general public and potential users. By these means also the patients performing home based rehabilitative exercises could benefit from acquired knowledge. To the current point in time the database includes 450 entries which have been accessed by 266 users from 33 states. The REHABitation database provides information as to what innovative or well established exercises/assessments they could include into the rehabilitation process. Information from each sub-database is reachable either separately or via the concise overview given on the main page.;2018;3
"Context and purpose: Demand for stroke rehabilitation services are reaching unprecedented levels due to an overall population aging, driven by the aging of the baby-boomer generation. Delivery of rehabilitation via mobile-device technologies may provide advantages towards meeting the increasing demands on the rehabilitation system by providing individuals with rehabilitation services in their homes and communities. The aim of this paper is to gain an understanding of the interest of current baby-boomers with stroke to use mobile-device technology to receive rehabilitation services such as education, assessments and exercise programs (mRehab). Methods: People living in the community with stroke born between 1946 and 1964 (i.e., baby-boomer generation) who participated in a larger telerehabilitation survey were included in this study. Regression modeling was used to evaluate personal, health/disability and technological predictors of interest to use mobile-devices for telerehabilitation. Results and significance: Fifty people with stroke, mean age 62.7 (4.4) years, 58% male, 54.2% with moderate or moderately severe disability were included; 86% had access to a mobile phone or tablet. Regression analysis resulted in statistically significant personal (education, beta = 0.29 [95% CI = 0.05 to 1.11], population of residence, beta = 0.30 [95% CI = 0.07 to 0.69]), health (comorbid conditions, beta = 0.30 [95% CI = 0.02 to 0.20]) technology (ownership, beta = 0.26 [95% CI = 0.01 to 0.86] and attitude towards telerehabilitation, beta = 0.25 [95% CI = 0.01 to 0.79]) predictors of interest to use mobile-devices for telerehabilitation (R-2 = 33.1%). This study identifies personal, health and technological factors which predict interest of baby-boomers with stroke with ongoing and complex health needs to use mRehab. Health professionals can use this information as they integrate mRehab into their practice and inform future development of mRehab solutions.";2018;3
Despite the effectiveness of occupational therapy home modification interventions, persons with disabilities may not receive them due to service delivery costs, limited number of therapists, and expansive geographic service areas. The need for occupational therapy home modification interventions will increase with the rising U.S. aging population, incidence of chronic illness, and shift toward community-based care. This study examined the feasibility of telehealth occupational therapy home modification interventions using participant owned smart phones, tablets, or computers. A pretest posttest design (n=4) demonstrated improvement in home safety and perception of performance of daily activities. Participants reported satisfaction with the mode of intervention citing ease of use and reduction in client and caregiver burden. Two key implementation challenges were (1) inconsistent quality of synchronous audio and video and (2) limited funding for home modification interventions. A large-scale telehealth occupational therapy home modification interventions pilot study is warranted.;2018;3
Due to the demographic change, the need of rehabilitation is rising. Home-based rehabilitation can lower the financial burden, support reintegration into daily (work-)life and increase motivation as well as compliance of patients. Several device-supported approaches for rehabilitation were investigated in the research project REHABitation. An insole-based live-feedback system to support patients performing partial weight bearing was developed and tested in a clinical pilot study. Rehabilitative games using commercial gaming control systems like the Microsoft Kinect and the Nintendo Wii Balance Board were developed for range-of-motion and balance training, respectively. For these serious games, usability was tested with the System Usability Scale questionnaire. The comparability of range-of-motion measurements of shoulder movements conducted with inertial measurement units and an optical motion capture system was elaborated. Results fo the clinical study suggest that the patients' compliance with partial weight bearing load restriction was improved with the use of the live-feedback system developed. The use of Wii and Kinect solutions is possible and helps to increase compliance of patients due to high system usability scale scores and positive feedback. The use of intertial measurement units for the detection of motion and its characteristics is highly depending on the used type of system and the intended time span of use. All these approaches were interconnected with diagnosis, corresponding exercises/assessments and tools in the web-based REHABitation database. It shall be used in future as single point of contact for therapists, patients, manufacturers and interested citizens for preventive and rehabilitative exercise and assessment planning.;2018;3
E-Bikes in telerehabilitation programs could be a new intervention for more sustainable rehabilitation results. The aim is to design and build a prototype of an E-Bike usable for rehabilitation - a HEALTHeBIKE. It should avoid overexercising, work independently of the environment and it should enable cycling in a group despite different reference exercise intensities. To achieve these goals, requirements for this system architecture have been identified. A system architecture including an Arduino microcontroller, an Android smartphone and a telemonitoring platform was presented. A power output regulated proportional-integral controller to adjust the motor assistance has been implemented. A feasibility study with two subjects cycling in a group was performed. Seven test rides on varying terrain (flat, hilly, mountainous and uphill) with the same and different exercise intensities were completed. The mean power output was close to or below the target power output of the cyclist for all test rides with a maximal error of 6.7 % above and 27.6 % below the target. Although the exercise intensities of the two subjects were clearly different, cycling in a group was possible without over-exercising.;2018;3
Here, the authors present a low cost telerehabilitation system made up of a commercial red-green-blue depth (RGB-D) camera and a web-based platform. The authors goal is to monitor and assess subject movement providing acceptable and usable at-home remote rehabilitation services without the presence of a clinician. Clinical goals, defined by physiotherapists, are firstly translated into motion analysis features. A Takagi Sugeno fuzzy inference system (FIS) is then proposed to evaluate and combine these features into scores. In this stage, the collaborative design' paradigm is used in depth and complete manner: the contribution of the clinician is not limited only to the rules definition but enters in the core of the evaluation algorithm through the definition of the fuzzy rules. A case study on low back pain rehabilitation involving 40 subjects, 5 exercises, and 4 physiotherapists is then presented to the effectiveness of the proposed system. Results of the validation of the system aimed at the assessment of the reliability of the proposed approach show high correlations between clinician evaluation and FIS scores. In this scenario, due to the high correlation, each FIS could represent a virtual alter-ego of the physiotherapist which enable a real time and free second opinion.;2018;3
Higher life expectancy is increasing the number of age-related cognitive impairment cases. It is also relevant, as some authors claim, that physical exercise may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to improve cognition and memory after strokes. Thus, the integration of physical and cognitive therapies could offer potential benefits. In addition, in general these therapies are usually considered boring, so it is important to include some features that improve the motivation of patients. As a result, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation systems and serious games for health are more and more present. In order to achieve a continuous, efficient and sustainable rehabilitation of patients, they will have to be carried out as part of the rehabilitation in their own home. However, current home systems lack the therapist's presence, and this leads to two major challenges for such systems. First, they need sensors and actuators that compensate for the absence of the therapist's eyes and hands. Second, the system needs to capture and apply the therapist's expertise. With this aim, and based on our previous proposals, we propose an ambient intelligence environment for cognitive rehabilitation at home, combining physical and cognitive activities, by implementing a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that gathers, as far as possible, the knowledge of a rehabilitation expert. Moreover, smart sensors and actuators will attempt to make up for the absence of the therapist. Furthermore, the proposed system will feature a remote monitoring tool, so that the therapist can supervise the patients' exercises. Finally, an evaluation will be presented where experts in the rehabilitation field showed their satisfaction with the proposed system.;2018;3
In the past few years, the advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) led to the development of platforms and applications that aim to support cognitive rehabilitation therapy that contributes to extend patients' treatment at home. In our research we adopted the Human Centered Approach to design a cognitive rehabilitation platform that is able to provide tools and features tailored to the professional needs and strategies and also able to engage patients in their treatment process. In order to explore the clinicians' point of view on the neuropsychological intervention strategies, we applied two different techniques often used in human factors research: the Critical Decision Method to study professionals' strategies with a descriptive perspective, and the Hierarchical Task Analysis to analyze the processes with a normative view. The results of our research showed that the hybrid approach adopted allowed us to have a better focus on the cognitive rehabilitation process and on the professionals' decision making mechanism. This led to a better understanding of functional requirements for supporting clinician's strategic decision making, in terms of personalization of treatments, cognitive exercises settings and feedback customization. In conclusion, our research highlights the value of the CDM to focus deeply on which ftmcdonalities professionals require from a cognitive telerehabilitation system and allowed us to design more precisely clinician-patients interactions inside the system compared to prescriptive methods currently used. Our study offers contribution to the comprehension of the rehabilitation processes, suggesting the positive impacts of an extended clinic treatment by adopting a flexible and adaptable tool.;2018;3
In this paper, an approach to physical collaboration between a patient and a therapist is proposed using a bilateral impedance control strategy developed for delayed tele-robotic systems. The patient performs a tele-rehabilitation task in a resistive virtual environment with the help of online assistive forces from the therapist being provided through teleoperation. Using this strategy, the patient's involuntary hand tremors can be filtered out and the effort of severely impaired patients can be amplified in order to facilitate their early engagement in physical tasks. The response of the first desired impedance model is tracked by the master robot (interacting with the patient), and the master trajectory plus a deviation as the response of the second impedance model is tracked by the slave robot (interacting with the therapist). Note that the first impedance model is a virtual massdamper-spring system that has a response trajectory to the combination of patient and therapist forces. Similarly, the second impedance model is a virtual mass-damper-spring system that generates the desired slave-master deviation trajectory as its response to the therapist force. Transmitted signals through the communication channels are subjected to time delays, which exist in home-based rehabilitation (i.e., tele-rehabilitation). Tracking of the impedance models responses in the presence of modeling uncertainties is achieved by employing a nonlinear bilateral adaptive controller and proven using a Lyapunov analysis. The stability of delayed teleoperation system is also proven using the absolute stability criterion. The proposed control method is experimentally evaluated for patient-therapist collaboration in resistive/assistive tasks. In these experiments, a healthy human operator simulates a poststroke patient behavior during the interaction with the master robot.;2018;3
"In this paper, we discuss the development and testing of a haptics-based stroke rehabilitation system. The system involves a 6-degrees of freedom haptic device and a virtual reality game designed to induce implicit learning in users. We present the preliminary usability/feasibility study of our system as a rehabilitation tool with 15 healthy subjects while using their non-dominant hand. The three-session study demonstrates improvements in all quantitative performance metrics of the learning tasks and the self-perceived workload levels of the subjects. We also studied the differences in performance arising due to three different assistance modes - no assistance, assist-as-needed, and continuous assistance. Comparing the differences in improvements of the performance metrics among the subject groups suggests that fewer sessions of assisted therapy may have the same effects as more sessions of unassisted therapy. We also observed that within the two assisted groups, the assist-as-needed strategy led to greater improvements than the continuously assisted group; which might be due to the lower mental/physical demand associated with the continuously assisted paradigm.";2018;3
Incorporating user requirements in the design of e-rehabilitation interventions facilitates their implementation. However, insight into requirements for e-rehabilitation after stroke is lacking. This study investigated which user requirements for stroke e-rehabilitation are important to stroke patients, informal caregivers, and health professionals. The methodology consisted of a survey study amongst stroke patients, informal caregivers, and health professionals (physicians, physical therapists and occupational therapists). The survey consisted of statements about requirements regarding accessibility, usability and content of a comprehensive stroke e-health intervention (4-point Likert scale, 1=unimportant/4=important). The mean with standard deviation was the metric used to determine the importance of requirements. Patients (N=125), informal caregivers (N=43), and health professionals (N=105) completed the survey. The mean score of user requirements regarding accessibility, usability and content for stroke e-rehabilitation was 3.1 for patients, 3.4 for informal caregivers and 3.4 for health professionals. Data showed that a large number of user requirements are important and should be incorporated into the design of stroke e-rehabilitation to facilitate their implementation.;2018;3
"In-person home-based rehabilitation and telerehabilitation can be as effective as clinic-based rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but require heavy logistics and are highly dependent on human supervision. New technologies that allow independent home-based rehabilitation without constant human supervision may help solve this problem. This was a single-center, feasibility study comparing a digital biofeedback system that meets these needs against conventional in-person home-based rehabilitation after TKA over an 8-week program. Primary outcome was the change in the Timed Up and Go score between the end of the program and baseline. Fifty-nine patients completed the study (30 experimental group; 29 conventional rehabilitation). The study demonstrated a superiority of the experimental group for all outcomes. Adverse events were similar in both groups. This is the first study to demonstrate that a digital rehabilitation solution can achieve better outcomes than conventional in-person rehabilitation, while less demanding in terms of human resources.";2018;3
"Introduction This exploratory qualitative study assessed the feasibility of transitioning three face-to-face, cognitive behavioural interventions for adults with chronic health conditions to online delivery, by examining clinician and clients' satisfaction with intervention training and delivery. Method The interventions adapted for online delivery were: Managing Chronic Disease', a programme for individuals who were nonadherent to prescribed rehabilitation regimens; Real-World Strategy Training', an occupation-based intervention for individuals with subjective cognitive decline; and Learning the Ropes', a memory programme for persons with mild cognitive impairment. Two occupational therapists and one nurse received training in, and then delivered one of the three interventions. Qualitative feedback interviews with participants, and archived video recordings of intervention sessions were analysed thematically. Results Key features of each manualised intervention were evident in the online sessions and perceived by clients as enhancing engagement (for example, peer support and strategy training). Clinicians felt that meeting individually with intervention experts was helpful to problem-solve technical issues and ensure adherence to protocols. Conclusion Three cognitive behavioural interventions transitioned to online delivery were acceptable to older adults and clinicians. A next step would be to complete randomised controlled trials investigating whether the interventions yield equivalent health benefits, using online and face-to-face delivery.";2018;3
"Introduction. Systematic, dynamic physical effort brings about tremendous health benefits, not only in young individuals, but as a form of primary prevention, and primarily as secondary prevention of cardiovascular system diseases. Materials and method. The research project was conducted in the Rehabilitation Centre at the Witold Chodzko Institute of Rural Health (IMW) in Lublin, Poland, and covered a group of 927 ambulatory patients. From among the study group, two subgroups were distinguished (Groups 1 and 2). Selection of patients was targeted, based on the criterion of the existing diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (Group 1; N=53), and the lack of these diseases (Group 2; N=53). The daily level of physical activity was assessed using the monitoring application (Instrument for Activity Measurement IMW) - using a short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and alternatively analyzing the data from a smartphone accelerometer. Results. The total level of weekly physical activity in Group 1 was 4532.88 +/- 3611.6 MET-min/week, and was considerably higher, compared to the control group (3142.58 +/- 2536.9 MET-min/week). Also, the values of weekly caloric cost of physical activity (KAF kcalxweek-1) showed higher values (6935.77 +/- 5957.4), compared to the control group (4274 +/- 3344.9). The group of cardiologic patients (Group 1) showed a higher level of activity, especially within the range of effort on an intensive level, and low level - going for walks, walking(MET1, MET3), which was also translated into the caloric cost of these levels of physical activity (KAF1, KAF3). Conclusions. The results of the study indicated a significantly higher level of physical activity in the group of patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases, compared to the control group. The overestimation of the level of physical activity perceived by patients seems to be an important problem, especially in the control group.";2018;3
Introduction: Given the rapid global growth of older adults with chronic condition(s), the present study explored the effects of telehealth technologies on self-management among older adults with chronic condition(s). Methods: Clinical trial studies on telehealth self-management for older adults with chronic condition(s) published in peer reviewed journals were reviewed systematically. In addition, the potential biases were assessed for included studies. Results: This review identified 31 articles regarding the effectiveness of telehealth technologies on self-management among older adults. Discussion: According to the findings of the present study, telehealth technologies have shown effectiveness on improving self-care skills, improving self-monitoring behaviours and improving clinical outcomes among older adults with chronic condition(s) in different settings. Using telehealth technologies is an advisable intervention for promoting older patients' self-management. However, it is critical to consider racial diversity and culture-related health behaviour differences when using telehealth technologies.;2018;3
Introduction: Knee osteoarthritis is a major cause of disability among the middle to senior age groups. Despite being effective, office-based physical therapy (OBPT) needs professional human resources and is both costly and time-consuming. We aimed to compare the efficacy of tele-rehabilitation (tele-rehab) compared with OBPT in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee were assigned to participate in either a 6-week home-based tele-rehab or an OBPT program between 2015 and 2016. Our primary outcome was the mean change from the baseline until 1 and 6 month's post-intervention in scores of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). We used analysis of variance for the repeated measure statistical test. Results: A total of 54 patients entered the final analysis, with 27 in each group. The mean age of the patients was 58.2 +/- 7.41 years and 60.2% were female. In the tele-rehab and OBPT group, KOOS scores increased from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (50.6 to 83.1 and 49.8 to 81.8) respectively. There was no significant difference between tele-rehab and OBPT groups in any of the studied scales. Discussion: The tele-rehab program is as effective as OBPT in improving the function of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Considering the much lower time and cost consumed by tele-rehab, it is the recommended program for the older population living in remote sites.;2018;3
Introduction: Physical rehabilitation is one of the few non-pharmaceutical therapies for maintaining or improving walking ability for patients with multiple sclerosis. However, travel distance to rehabilitation clinics, neurological disability and insurance coverage often limit access to specialised rehabilitation services. To address these issues, we utilised a web-based system to support a home-based self-directed exercise programme. Methods: Patients (n = 24) were randomised to either routine home rehabilitation or to the multiple sclerosis home automated tele-management system for a six-month period. The study group had a mean age of 50.4 years, 56% of patients were male, and 67% had progressive multiple sclerosis with an overall mean Patient Determined Disease Steps score of 4.4 (cane or crutch required for walking). Key outcomes included the timed 25-foot-walk, six-minute-walk and the Berg Balance Scale. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the change of the primary walking outcome measure, timed 25-foot-walk, at six months between the home automated tele-management intervention and control groups (p = 044). Similarly, change scores for the six-minute-walk were not significantly different between the home automated tele-management or control groups at six months. Discussion: Maintaining overall gait abilities in this group of predominantly progressive multiple sclerosis patients is notable. Exercise adherence was positively associated with higher multiple sclerosis disability and self-reported walking ability. Study engagement and participation in routine home-based exercise for the entire study period was challenging. Further research using clinical video telerehabilitation techniques that optimise patient involvement warrants further study.;2018;3
Introduction: Preliminary evidences showed that telemedicine may allow a reduction of costs and an enhancement of patients' satisfaction and quality of life (QoL), with the same effectiveness of conventional methods of healthcare delivery. Literature is quite absent in relation to the use of telemedicine for patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) whose management is delegated almost entirely to the family. In order to promote an alternative setting to manage persons affected by DoC, also supporting their families, a pilot project was designed to test the feasibility of home-care assistance based on a system of telemonitoring. Methods: In total, 11 patients were supported by a telemonitoring system via a workstation installed at the patients' homes. All patients underwent a clinical and functional evaluation at enrolment, after two months, after six months and at the end of the project, after 12 months by means of clinical scales (Glasgow Coma Scale, Rancho Los Amigos Levels of Cognitive Functioning Scale, Glasgow Outcome Scale, Disability Rating Scale), while the World Health Organization (WHO) QoL, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and a satisfaction score were completed by caregivers. Results: Patients' scores at the clinical scales did not show statistically significant differences from T0 to T3. A trend toward the improvement of caregivers' QoL, anxiety and depression, as well as a high degree of satisfaction with regard to the intervention, were reported. The economic evaluation showed an average cost/day for a patient of about (Sic)70. Discussion: Preliminary data suggest that the use of telemonitoring services in the management of persons affected by DoC is feasible and well accepted by caregivers, with a potential positive effect on their mood and QoL. Therefore, telemonitoring should be considered in the management of DoC patients to favour discharge from acute care and to support families in home care.;2018;3
Introduction: Success of e-health relies on the extent to which the related technology, such as the electronic device, is accepted by its users. However, there has been limited research on the patients' perspective on use of e-health-related technology in rehabilitation care. Objective: To explore the usage of common electronic devices among rehabilitation patients with access to email and investigate their preferences regarding their usage in rehabilitation. Methods: Adult patients who were admitted for inpatient and/or outpatient rehabilitation and were registered with an email address were invited to complete an electronic questionnaire regarding current and preferred use of information and communication technologies in rehabilitation care. Results: 190 out of 714 invited patients completed the questionnaire, 94 (49%) female, mean age 49 years (SD 16). 149 patients (78%) used one or more devices every day, with the most frequently used devices were: PC/laptop (93%), smartphone (57%) and tablet (47%). Patients mostly preferred to use technology for contact with health professionals (mean 3.15, SD 0.79), followed by access to their personal record (mean 3.09, SD 0.78) and scheduling appointments with health professionals (mean 3.07, SD 0.85). Conclusion: Most patients in rehabilitation used one or more devices almost every day and wish to use these devices in rehabilitation. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION In a sample of 190 patients in rehabilitation with access to email, almost all patients used one or more electronic devices almost every day of the week, with the most frequently used devices were: a PC/laptop, smartphone and tablet. Most of the patients wish to incorporate electronic devices in their rehabilitation process and prefer to use those devices to have insight in their health record, communication with peers and scheduling appointments with health professionals. To better assist patients with e-health in rehabilitation care in the future, preferences could be implemented in rehabilitation care by using the most commonly used devices.;2018;3
Introduction: Telehealth offers a solution to assist delivery of occupational therapy (OT) services for hand therapy in rural and remote locations. However, there is currently no evidence to validate this service model. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of clinical decisions made during hand therapy sessions conducted via telehealth compared to a traditional clinical model (TCM) assessment, and explore patient and clinician satisfaction. Methods: Eighteen patients referred for hand therapy to a rural/remote hospital-based outpatient service were assessed simultaneously via telehealth and a TCM assessment. An allied health assistant supported data collection at the patient end. Hand function was assessed using a range of objective measures, subjective scales and patient reported information. Minimal level of percent exact agreement (PEA) between the telehealth OT (T-OT) and the TCM-OT was set at >= 80%. Results: Level of agreement for all objective measures (dynamometer and pinch gauge reading, goniometer flexion and extension, circumference in millimetres) ranged between 82% and 100% PEA. High agreement (>80% PEA) was also obtained for judgements of scar and general limb function, exercise compliance, pain severity and sensitivity location, activities of daily living and global ratings of change (GROC) scores. There was 100% PEA for overall recommendations. Minimal technical issues were experienced. Patient and clinician satisfaction was high. Discussion: Clinical decisions made via telehealth were comparable to the TCM and consumers were satisfied with telehealth as a service option. Telehealth offers the potential to improve access to hand therapy services for rural and remote patients.;2018;3
"Introduction: The aim of this study was to systematically review the evidence on the effectiveness of exercise-based telemedicine in chronic pain. Methods: We searched the Cochrane, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PEDRO databases from 2000 to 2015 for randomised controlled trials, comparing exercise-based telemedicine intervention to no intervention or usual care in adults with chronic pain. Primary outcome data were pooled using random effect meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were pain, physical activity (PA), limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL). Secondary outcomes were barriers, facilitators and usability of telemedicine. Results: Sixteen studies were included. Meta-analyses were performed in three subgroups of studies with comparable control conditions. Telemedicine versus no intervention showed significantly lower pain scores (MD -0.57, 95% CI -0.81; -0.34), but not for telemedicine versus usual care (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.41; 0.26) or in addition to usual care (MD -0.25, 95% CI -1.50; 1.00). Telemedicine compared to no intervention showed non-significant effects for PA (MD 19.93 min/week, 95% CI -5.20; 45.06) and significantly diminished ADL limitations (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.29; -0.12). No differences were found for telemedicine in addition to usual care for PA or for ADL (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.66; 0.34). Telemedicine versus usual care showed no differences for ADL (SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.37; 0.53). No differences were found for telemedicine compared to the three control groups for QoL. Limited information was found on the secondary outcomes. Conclusions: Exercise-based telemedicine interventions do not seem to have added value to usual care. As substitution of usual care, telemedicine might be applicable but due to limited quality of the evidence, further exploration is needed for the rapidly developing field of telemedicine.";2018;3
"Introduction: The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of telerehabilitation for patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) compared with face-to-face rehabilitation. Methods: Medline, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Springer, Science Direct, and Cochrane databases were searched electronically. Relevant journals and references of studies included were hand-searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the efficacy of telerehabilitation on functional recovery in patients after TKA. Two reviewers independently performed data extraction and quality assessment. Data were analysed using RevMan 5.3 software and Stata 12.0 software. Results: Four RCTs involving 442 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with face-to-face rehabilitation, telerehabilitation could achieve comparable pain relief (mean difference = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.20 to 1.24; p=0.16) and better Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index improvement (mean difference = 1.13; 95% CI = 0.23 to 2.02; p = 0.014). In addition, telerehabilitation treatment resulted in a significantly higher extension range (p < 0.00001) and quadriceps strength (p = 0.0002) than face-to-face rehabilitation. Discussion: Telerehabilitation should be recommended for patients after TKA because of its comparable pain control and better improvement of functional recovery as compared to face-to-face rehabilitation.";2018;3
Introduction:Activity trackers are useful tools for physical rehabilitation purposes. Most available activity trackers are designed for fitness and wellness use, lacking in both accuracy and precision at lower speeds. Validity and reliability at all clinically relevant speeds are crucial selection criteria for use in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of four consumer-based activity trackers at clinical relevant walking speeds for patient groups undergoing rehabilitation.Methods:The four commercial activity trackers Fitbit Surge (FS), Fitbit Charge HR (FC), Microsoft Band 2 (MB), and A&D 101NFC Activity Monitor (A&D) were evaluated at 2, 4, 4.5, and 5.5km/h. Twenty healthy participants aged 25.62 years walked on a treadmill at the four velocities in two trials of 100 steps each. Mean average percentage error (MAPE), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement were calculated to assess validity and reliability.Results:MAPE levels were between -8% and -6% for FS, -15% and 0% for MB, 7% and 21% for FC, and -53% and 1% for AD. The biggest inaccuracies were seen at 2km/h, where AD underestimated by 53%. The highest accuracy was predominantly found with MB and AD, which overestimated 2% at velocities 4km/h. ICC was moderate (0.73) for FS, good (0.88) for MB, moderate (0.52) for FC, and excellent (0.98) for AD.Conclusions:MB, FS, and AD accurately counted steps, when participants walked with velocities corresponding to a brisk walk (4km/h). Walking at lower speeds (2km/h) was not counted accurately. Thus, the four evaluated activity trackers are not useful for patient groups walking at lower speeds during rehabilitation, nor for counting indoor walking.;2018;3
"Introduction:E-health software tools have been deployed in managing knee conditions. Reporting of patient and practitioner satisfaction in studies regarding e-health usage is not widely explored. The objective of this review was to identify studies describing patient and practitioner satisfaction with software use concerning knee pain.Materials and Methods:A computerized search was undertaken: four electronic databases were searched from January 2007 until January 2017. Key words were decision dashboard, clinical decision, Web-based resource, evidence support, and knee. Full texts were scanned for effect of size reporting and satisfaction scales from participants and practitioners. Binary regression was run; impact factor and sample size were predictors with indicators for satisfaction and effect size reporting as dependent variables.Results:Seventy-seven articles were retrieved; 37 studies were included in final analysis. Ten studies reported patient satisfaction ratings (27.8%): a single study reported both patient and practitioner satisfaction (2.8%). Randomized control trials were the most common design (35%) and knee osteoarthritis the most prevalent condition (38%). Electronic patient-reported outcome measures and Web-based training were the most common interventions. No significant dependency was found within the regression models (p > 0.05).Discussion and Conclusions:The proportion of reporting of patient satisfaction was low; practitioner satisfaction was poorly represented. There may be implications for the suitability of administering e-health, a medium for capturing further meta-evidence needs to be established and used as best practice for implicated studies in future. This is the first review of its kind to address patient and practitioner satisfaction with knee e-health.";2018;3
IntroductionSupport of neurosurgery patients following discharge from hospital is important. Currently, little is known about patients' in low- and middle-income countries before and after their hospital treatment. This companion paper reports patients' pathways before and after hospital admission and the feasibility of following up this ill-patient population by telephone. MethodsEligible patients were aged 18years admitted to the Neurosurgery Department in Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospitala regional referral hospital in Bandung City, Indonesia. Clinical data were collected on admission by clinicians. In-person interviews were undertaken with a clinical research nurse 1 to 2days pre-discharge, and telephone follow-up interviews at 1, 2, and 3months post-discharge. Information was also collected on pathways prior to admission and following discharge. The number of contact attempts for each patient interview was documented, as was the overall acceptability of undertaking a telephone interview. ResultsOf 178 patients discharged from hospital, 12 later died. Of the remaining 166 patients, 95% were able to be followed up to 3months. Two-thirds of patients had been referred from another hospital. Patients came from, and were discharged to, locations throughout the West Java region. At the 1-month interview, 84% participants reported that they had had a follow-up consultation with a health professionalmostly with a neurosurgeon. ConclusionThis study has shown that, with a neurosurgery nurse delegated to the role, it is feasible to conduct follow-up telephone interviews with patients after discharge from a neurosurgery ward and that in fact such follow-up was appreciated by patients.;2018;3
Long-term exercise/rehabilitation is an integral component of the continual care for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, access to this care, which includes comprehensive exercise/rehabilitation services to people with MS, remains a significant challenge, especially in rural, low-income areas. Telerehabilitation, or what we refer to as teleexercise, can help fill service gaps for underserved MS populations in this region. This pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled effectiveness trial will compare a 12-week, 20 session complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention composed of neurorehabilitative (functional) exercise, yoga and Pilates delivered at home, using pre-loaded tablets and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system technology (TeleCAM), to the same intervention delivered in clinic by a therapist (DirectCAM). Eight hundred and twenty people with MS are being recruited across Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. Primary self-reported patient-centered health outcomes are: pain, fatigue, quality of life and physical activity. Secondary outcomes include four physical functioning measures: balance, endurance, gait, and strength. Each of these outcomes will be examined by age, race, sex, severity of MS and other demographics to determine if outcomes are beneficial across all groups (i.e., heterogeneity of treatment effect). The project is important to people with MS and/or caregivers because it aims to reduce their barriers to receiving exercise treatment and increases the convenience and appeal of such programs through technology.;2018;3
Many patients with primary brain tumors experience cognitive deficits. Cognitive rehabilitation programs focus on alleviating these deficits, but availability of such programs is limited. Our large randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated positive effects of the cognitive rehabilitation program developed by our group. We converted the program into the iPad-based cognitive rehabilitation program ReMind, to increase its accessibility. The app incorporates psychoeducation, strategy training and retraining. This pilot study in patients with primary brain tumors evaluates the feasibility of the use of the ReMind-app in a clinical (research) setting in terms of accrual, attrition, adherence and patient satisfaction. The intervention commenced 3 months after resective surgery and patients were advised to spend 3 h per week on the program for 10 weeks. Of 28 eligible patients, 15 patients with presumed low-grade glioma or meningioma provided informed consent. Most important reason for decline was that patients (7) experienced no cognitive complaints. Participants completed on average 71% of the strategy training and 76% of the retraining. Some patients evaluated the retraining as too easy. Overall, 85% of the patients evaluated the intervention as good or excellent. All patients indicated that they would recommend the program to other patients with brain tumors. The ReMind-app is the first evidence-based cognitive telerehabilitation program for adult patients with brain tumors and this pilot study suggests that postoperative cognitive rehabilitation via this app is feasible. Based on patients' feedback, we have expanded the retraining with more difficult exercises. We will evaluate the efficacy of ReMind in an RCT.;2018;3
Motor impairments after stroke are often persistent and disabling, and women are less likely to recover and show poorer functional outcomes. To regain motor function after stroke, rehabilitation robots are increasingly integrated into clinics. The devices fall into two main classes: robots developed to train lost motor function after stroke (therapy devices) and robots designed to compensate for lost skills (i.e., assistive devices). The article provides an overview of therapeutic options with robots for motor rehabilitation after stroke.;2018;3
"Objective: Evaluate user experiences of an exercise-based cardiac telerehabilitation intervention (REMOTE-CR) that provided near universal access to real-time remote coaching and behavioral support from exercise specialists. Design: Secondary analysis (12-week follow-up) of a parallel group, single blind, randomized controlled noninferiority trial (ACTRN12614000843651). Setting: Community-based cardiac rehabilitation. Participants: Adults (N=162) with coronary heart disease who were eligible for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Eighty-two of 162 trial participants were randomized to receive REMOTE-CR; 67 completed usability and acceptability assessment at 12-week follow-up. Intervention: REMOTE-CR comprised 12 weeks of individualized exercise prescription, real-time physiological monitoring, coaching, and behavioral support, delivered via a bespoke telerehabilitation platform. Outcomes: Ease of use, satisfaction with the technology platform and intervention content, and demand for real-world implementation as an alternative to traditional center-based programs were assessed at 12-week follow-up. Results: Components of usability and acceptability were positively evaluated by most participants (44-66 of 67, 66%-99%). Fifty-eight of 67 (87%) would choose REMOTE-CR if it was available as a usual care service, primarily because it provides convenient and flexible access to real-time individualized support from exercise specialists. Technology challenges were rare and had little effect on user experiences or demand for REMOTE-CR. Conclusions: REMOTE-CR can extend the reach and impact of existing cardiac rehabilitation services by overcoming traditional participation barriers while preserving expert oversight. Adoption of emerging technologies should be accelerated to support dynamic, engaging, individualized intervention delivery models, but optimizing overall cardiac rehabilitation participation rates will require multiple delivery models that are tailored to satisfy diverse participant preferences.

Objective: Investigating the required infrastructure for the implementation of telemedicine and the satisfaction of target groups improves the acceptance of this technology and facilitates the delivery of healthcare services. The aim of this study was to assess the satisfaction of patients with stutter concerning the therapeutic method and the infrastructure used to receive tele-speech therapy services. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on all patients with stutter aged between 14 and 39 years at Jahrom Social Welfare Bureau (n=30). The patients underwent speech therapy sessions through video conferencing with Skype. Data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire. Its content validity was confirmed by three medical informatics specialists. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 19. Results: The mean and standard deviation of patient satisfaction scores concerning the infrastructure and the tele-speech therapy method were 3.15 +/- 0.52 and 3.49 +/- 0.52, respectively. No significant relationship was found between the patients satisfaction and their gender, education level and age (p>0.05). The results of this study showed that the number of speech therapy sessions did not affect the overall satisfaction of the patients (p>0.05), but the number of therapeutic sessions had a direct relationship with their satisfaction with the infrastructure used for tele-speech therapy (p<0.05). Conclusions: The present study showed that patients were satisfied with tele-speech therapy. According to most patients the low speed of the Internet connection in the country was a major challenge for receiving tele-speech therapy. The results suggest that healthcare planner and policy makers invest on increasing bandwidth to improve the success rate of telemedicine programs.;2018;3
Objective: Physiotherapists typically prescribe exercise therapy for people with osteoarthritis (OA) via face-to-face consultations. This study aimed to explore peoples' perceptions of exercise therapy delivered by physiotherapists via telephone for their knee OA. Design: A qualitative study (based on interpretivist methodology) embedded within a randomised controlled trial. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 20 people with knee OA who had received exercise advice and support from one of eight physiotherapists via telephone over 6 months. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Results: Although people with OA were initially sceptical about receiving exercise therapy via telephone, they described mostly positive experiences, valuing the convenience and accessibility. However, some desired visual contact with the physiotherapist and suggested including video-conferencing calls or an initial in-person clinic visit. Participants valued the sense of undivided focus and attention they received from the physiotherapist and believed that they were able to communicate effectively via telephone. Participants felt confident performing their exercise program without supervision and described benefits including increased muscular strength, improved pain, and ability to perform tasks that they had not been previously able to. Conclusions: People with knee OA held mostly positive perceptions about receiving exercise therapy from a physiotherapist via telephone, suggesting that such a service is broadly acceptable to consumers. Such services were generally not viewed as a substitute for face-to-face physiotherapy care, but rather as a new option that could increase accessibility of physiotherapy services, particularly for follow-up consultations.

Objective: The aims of this study are two-fold: 1) To explore how cardiac patients experience their use of a telerehabilitation tool for recuperation from surgery, and 2) To study how the patients' use of the interactive 'Active Heart' web portal affected their eHealth literacy skills. Methods: The 'Active Heart' telerehabilitation web portal offers patients and their relatives information and exercises for recovery from cardiac surgery. 109 cardiac patients were using the Active Heart web portal for a duration of three months. Results: 49 patients completed questionnaires that were administered both before and after their use of the portal, resulting in a 45% response rate. Respondents had a mean age of 60.64 +/- 10.75 years, and 82% of the respondents were males. The respondents had a positive impression of Active Heart, reporting that it was easy to access, user-friendly, and written in an understandable language. The patients' eHealth literacy skills increased during the trial period. Conclusion: Use of a cardiac telerehabilitation web portal can be beneficial for patient education and can increase cardiac patients' eHealth literacy skills. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: The objective of the study was to review the evidence for the effectiveness of telephone psychotherapy on psychological outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: We conducted a systematic search of EMBASE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and hand-searched relevant journals to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of telephone psychotherapy on psychological outcomes in people with MS (last search completed on October 1, 2015). The methodological quality of each included trial was assessed, based on a standardized list of methodological criteria. Where available, data were extracted and combined in a meta-analysis to compute effect size estimates. Results: Eleven RCTs and 1,104 participants were identified. The meta-analysis found a moderate effect of the intervention on depression (SMD 0.47 [95% confidence interval 0.21-0.73]). The meta-analysis also found small to moderate short-term effects of the intervention on fatigue, quality of life, MS symptoms, physical activity, and medication adherence, compared with controls and other interventions. RCT designs were heterogeneous. All studies had at least 1 high or unclear risk of bias. Conclusions: Telephone psychotherapy provides small and moderate benefits in depression, fatigue, quality of life, MS symptoms, physical activity, and medication adherence in the short term. Few gains were sustained in the long term. Studies of better quality are needed.;2018;3
Objective: To assess the effect of distance caregiver coaching on skill acquisition of a child with traumatic brain injury. Interactions between caregivers and persons with brain injury may play a critical role in the rehabilitation process, and coaching caregivers is one method that may foster more positive functional outcomes for the individual as caregiver skills may generalize across domains. Method: This study utilised a single-subject, multiple baseline across behaviours design to examine the effects of caregiver behaviours on skill acquisition by a child with a traumatic brain injury. The caregiver-client dyad in this study was a mother and her 10-year-old adopted child. The caregiver was coached using telehealth technology. Distance coaching consisted of in-vivo feedback on the caregiver's use of general behaviour analytic skills, such as use of effective prompting and positive social consequences, while engaging with the child with a brain injury. Conclusion: Improvements in the child's independent task completion across three functional skills were observed, as a function of improvements in the caregiver's skills.;2018;3
Objective: To compare the effects of traditional mirror therapy (MT), a patient-centred teletreatment (PACT) and sensomotor exercises without a mirror on phantom limb pain (PLP). Design: Three-arm multicentre randomized controlled trial. Setting: Rehabilitation centres, hospital and private practices. Subjects: Adult patients with unilateral lower limb amputation and average PLP intensity of at least 3 on the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Interventions: Subjects randomly received either four weeks of traditional MT followed by a teletreatment using augmented reality MT, traditional MT followed by self-delivered MT or sensomotor exercises of the intact limb without a mirror followed by self-delivered exercises. Main measures: Intensity, frequency and duration of PLP and patient-reported outcomes assessing limitations in daily life at baseline, 4 weeks, 10 weeks and 6 months. Results: In total, 75 patients received traditional MT (n = 25), teletreatment (n = 26) or sensomotor exercises (n = 24). Mean (SD) age was 61.1 (14.2) years and mean (SD) pain intensity was 5.7 (2.1) on the NRS. Effects of MT at four weeks on PLP were not significant. MT significantly reduced the duration of PLP at six months compared to the teletreatment (P = 0.050) and control group (P = 0.019). Subgroup analyses suggested significant effects on PLP in women, patients with telescoping and patients with a motor component in PLP. The teletreatment had no additional effects compared to self-delivered MT at 10 weeks and 6 months. Conclusion: Traditional MT over four weeks was not more effective than sensomotor exercises without a mirror in reducing PLP, although significant effects were suggested in some subgroups.;2018;3
"Objective: To determine the level of agreement between a telehealth and in-person assessment of a representative sample of patients with chronic musculoskeletal conditions referred to an advanced-practice physiotherapy screening clinic. Design: Repeated-measures study design. Participants: 42 patients referred to the Neurosurgical & Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Screening Clinic (Queensland, Australia) for assessment of their chronic lumbar spine, knee or shoulder condition. Intervention: Participants underwent two consecutive assessments by different physiotherapists within a single clinic session. In-person assessments were conducted as per standard clinical practice. Telehealth assessments took place remotely via videoconferencing. Six Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists were paired together to perform both assessment types. Main outcome measures: Clinical management decisions including (i) recommended management pathways, (ii) referral to allied health professions, (iii) clinical diagnostics, and (iv) requirement for further investigations were compared using reliability and agreement statistics. Results: There was substantial agreement (83.3%; 35/42 cases) between in-person and telehealth assessments for recommended management pathways. Moderate to near perfect agreement (AC1 = 0.58-0.9) was reached for referral to individual allied health professionals. Diagnostic agreement was 83.3% between the two delivery mediums, whilst there was substantial agreement (81%; AC1 = 0.74) when requesting further investigations. Overall, participants were satisfied with the telehealth assessment. Conclusion: There is a high level of agreement between telehealth and in-person assessments with respect to clinical management decisions and diagnosis of patients with chronic musculoskeletal conditions managed in an advanced-practice physiotherapy screening clinic. Telehealth can be considered as a viable and effective medium to assess those patients who are unable to attend these services in person.";2018;3
"Objective: To evaluate the influence of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in patients with stroke through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library databases were searched systematically. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation vs placebo transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on stroke were included. Two investigators independently searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. The primary outcome was modified Ashworth scale (MAS). Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effect model. Results: Seven randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with placebo transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation supplementation significantly reduced MAS (standard mean difference (SMD) = -0.71; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = -1.11 to -0.30; p = 0.0006), improved static balance with open eyes (SMD = -1.26; 95% CI = -1.83 to -0.69; p < 0.0001) and closed eyes (SMD = -1.74; 95% CI = -2.36 to -1.12; p < 0.00001), and increased walking speed (SMD = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.84; p = 0.03), but did not improve results on the Timed Up and Go Test (SMD = -0.60; 95% CI=-1.22 to 0.03; p = 0.06). Conclusion: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is associated with significantly reduced spasticity, increased static balance and walking speed, but has no influence on dynamic balance.";2018;3
"Objective: To explore the perceived barriers and facilitators of tele-rehabilitation (TR) by stroke patients, caregivers and rehabilitation therapists in an Asian setting. Design: Qualitative study involving semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Setting: General community. Participants: Participants (N=37) including stroke patients, their caregivers, and tele-therapists selected by purposive sampling. Interventions: Singapore Tele-technology Aided Rehabilitation in Stroke trial. Main Outcome Measures: Perceived barriers and facilitators for TR uptake, as reported by patients, their caregivers, and tele-therapists. Results: Thematic analysis was used to inductively identify the following themes: facilitators identified by patients were affordability and accessibility; by tele-therapists, was filling a service gap and common to both was unexpected benefits such as detection of uncontrolled hypertension. Barriers identified by patients were equipment setup related difficulties and limited scope of exercises; barriers identified by teletherapists were patient assessments, interface problems and limited scope of exercises; and common to both were connectivity barriers. Patient characteristics like age, stroke severity, caregiver support, and cultural influence modified patient perceptions and choice of rehabilitation. Conclusions: Patient attributes and context are significant determinants in adoption and compliance of stroke patients to technology driven interventions like TR. Policy recommendations from our work are inclusion of introductory videos in TR programs, provision of technical support to older patients, longer FaceTime sessions as re-enforcement for severely disabled stroke patients, and training of tele-therapists in assessment methods suitable for virtual platforms.

"Objective: To identify and appraise studies evaluating the efficacy of telerehabilitation for adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: A systematic search of Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and PsycINFO databases was conducted from January 1980 to April 23, 2017, for studies evaluating the efficacy of telerehabilitation for adults with TBI. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and rated methodological quality using 16 criteria related to internal validity, descriptive, and statistical characteristics. Results: The review yielded 13 eligible studies, including 10 randomized controlled trials and 3 pre-/postgroup studies (n 10). These evaluated the feasibility and/or efficacy of telephone-based (10 studies) and Internet-based (3 studies) interventions. Overall, the evidence of efficacy was somewhat mixed. The most common study design evaluated the efficacy of telephone-based interventions relative to usual care, for which 4 of 5 randomized controlled trials reported positive effects at postintervention (d = 0.28-0.51). For these studies, improvements in global functioning, posttraumatic symptoms and sleep quality, and depressive symptoms were reported. The feasibility of Internet-based interventions was generally supported; however, the efficacy could not be determined because of insufficient studies. Conclusions: Structured telephone interventions were found to be effective for improving particular outcomes following TBI. Controlled studies of Internet-based therapy and comparisons of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of in-person and telerehabilitation formats are recommended for future research.";2018;3
Objectives Pediatric brain damage is associated with various cognitive deficits. Cognitive rehabilitation may prevent and reduce cognitive impairment. In recent years, home-based computerized cognitive training (CCT) has been introduced in clinical practice to increase treatment opportunities for patients (telerehabilitation). However, limited research has been conducted thus far on investigating the effects of remote CCT for the juvenile population in contexts other than English-speaking countries. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of a home-based CCT in a group of Italian adolescents with brain damage. A commercially available CCT (Lumosity) developed in the English language was used due to the lack of telerehabilitation programs in the Italian language that allow stimulation of multiple cognitive domains and, at the same time, remote automatic collection of data. Thus, this investigation provides information on the possibility of introducing CCT programs available in foreign languages in countries with limited investment in the telerehabilitation field. Methods 32 adolescents aged 11-16 with a diagnosis of congenital or acquired (either traumatic or non-traumatic) brain damage participated in the study. They received 40 training sessions (5 days/week for 8 weeks). Before starting the training program, they received face-to-face demonstration of training exercises and written instructions in their mother tongue. The feasibility of both training and study design and procedures was assessed through 9 criteria taken from extant literature. Results All 9 feasibility criteria were met. 31 out of the 32 participants demonstrated adherence to the training program. 94.2% of training sessions were completed in the recommended time frame. No significant technical issue was found. Conclusions Telerehabilitation seems to be a feasible practice for adolescents with brain damage. A training program developed in a foreign language can be used to counter the unavailability of programs in patients' mother tongue.;2018;3
Objectives: Customer discovery (CD) is a method to determine if there are actual customers for a product/service and what they would want before actually developing the product/service. This concept, however, is rather new to health information technology (IT) systems. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to demonstrate how to use the CD method in developing a comprehensive health IT service for patients with knee/leg pain. Methods: We participated in a 6-week I-Corps program to perform CD, in which we interviewed 55 people in person, by phone, or by video conference within 6 weeks: 4 weeks in the United States and 2 weeks in Korea. The interviewees included orthopedic doctors, physical therapists, physical trainers, physicians, researchers, pharmacists, vendors, and patients. By analyzing the interview data, the aim was to revise our business model accordingly. Results: Using the CD approach enabled us to understand the customer segments and identify value propositions. We concluded that a facilitating tele-rehabilitation system is needed the most and that the most suitable customer segment is early stage arthritis patients. We identified a new design concept for the customer segment. Furthermore, CD is required to identify value propositions in detail. Conclusions: CD is crucial to determine a more desirable direction in developing health IT systems, and it can be a powerful tool to increase the potential for successful commercialization in the health IT field.;2018;3
"Objectives: To identify the current status of smartphone usage and to describe the needs for smartphone-based cardiac telerehabilitation of cardiac patients. Methods: In 2016, a questionnaire survey was conducted in a supervised ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program in a university affiliated hospital with the participation of heart failure or heart transplantation patients who were smartphone users. The questionnaire included questions regarding smartphone usage, demands for smartphone-based disease education, and home health monitoring systems. Results were described and analyzed according to principal diagnosis. Results: Ninety-six patients (66% male; mean age, 53 +/- 11 years), including 56 heart failure and 40 heart transplantation patients, completed the survey (completion rate, 95%). The median daily smartphone usage time was 120 minutes (interquartile range, 60-300), and the most frequently used smartphone function was text messaging (61.5%). Of the patients, 26% stated that they searched for health-related information using their smartphones more than 1 time per week. The major source of health-related information was Internet browsing (50.0%), and the least sought source was the hospital's website (3.1%). Patients with heart failure expressed significantly higher needs for disease education on treatment plan, home health monitoring of blood pressure, and body weight (chi(2) = 5.79, 6.27, 4.50, p < 0.05). Heart transplantation patients expressed a significant need for home health monitoring of body temperature (chi(2) = 5.25, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Heart failure and heart transplantation patients show high usage of and interest in mobile health technology. A smartphone-based cardiac telerehabilitation program should be developed based on high demand areas and modified to suit to each principal diagnosis.";2018;3
"ObjectiveTo explore the efficacy of remotely-supervised transcranial direct current stimulation (RS-tDCS) paired with cognitive training (CT) exercise in participants with multiple sclerosis (MS). MethodsIn a feasibility study of RS-tDCS in MS, participants completed ten sessions of tDCS paired with CT (1.5 mA x 20 min, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex montage). RS-tDCS participants were compared to a control group of adults with MS who underwent ten 20-min CT sessions through the same remotely supervised procedures. Cognitive outcomes were tested by composite scores measuring change in performance on standard tests (Brief International Cognitive Assessment in MS or BICAMS), basic attention (ANT-I Orienting and Attention Networks, Cogstate Detection), complex attention (ANT-I Executive Network, Cogstate Identification and One-Back), and intra-individual response variability (ANT-I and Cogstate identification; sensitive markers of disease status). ResultsAfter ten sessions, the tDCS group (n=25) compared to the CT only group (n=20) had significantly greater improvement in complex attention (p=0.01) and response variability (p=0.01) composites. The groups did not differ in measures of basic attention (p=0.95) or standard cognitive measures (p=0.99). ConclusionsThese initial findings indicate benefit for RS-tDCS paired with CT in MS. Exploratory analyses indicate that the earliest tDCS cognitive benefit is seen in complex attention and response variability. Telerehabilitation using RS-tDCS combined with CT may lead to improved outcomes in MS.";2018;3
ObjectiveTo investigate physical therapists' perceptions of, and willingness to use, telephone- and internet-mediated service models for exercise therapy for people with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. MethodsThis study used an internet-based survey of Australian physical therapists, comprising 3 sections: 1 on demographic information and 2 with 16 positively framed perception statements about delivering exercise via telephone and video over the internet, for people with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. Levels of agreement with each statement were evaluated. Logistic regression models were used to determine therapist characteristics influencing interest in delivering telerehabilitation. ResultsA total of 217 therapists spanning metropolitan, regional, rural, and remote Australia completed the survey. For telephone-delivered care, there was consensus agreement that it would not violate patient privacy (81% agreed/strongly agreed) and would save patient's time (76%), but there was less than majority agreement for 10 statements. There was consensus agreement that video-delivered care would save a patient's time (82%), be convenient for patients (80%), and not violate patient privacy (75%). Most agreed with all other perception statements about video-delivered care, except for liking no physical contact (14%). Low confidence using internet video technologies, and inexperience with telerehabilitation, were significantly associated with reduced interest in delivering telephone and/or video-based services. ConclusionPhysical therapists agree that telerehabilitation offers time-saving and privacy advantages for people with osteoarthritis and perceive video-delivered care more favorably than telephone-delivered services. However, most do not like the lack of physical contact with either service model. These findings may inform the implementation of telerehabilitation osteoarthritis services and the training needs of clinicians involved in delivering care.;2018;3
Older people with chronic lung diseases and with low physical activity participation rates are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a purpose-designed Internet-based program (ActivOnline) to monitor and encourage exercise and physical activity. Twelve participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis were recruited (54-84 years). Primary outcome measures were feasibility measured by frequency of program access, and acceptability measured by semistructured interview, system usability scores, and participant perception of benefit. The results suggest regular participation in physical activity and exercise during the 8-week study period and high usability scores (mean = 90% +/- 9%). Major themes were the importance of regular exercise and how sustained lifestyle changes were essential to be physically active, regular contact with clinicians assisted with motivation, and aspects of ActivOnline facilitated individual behavior change and confidence to continue exercising. Most participants (82%) reported a benefit from using ActivOnline, and 55% wished to remain on the program indefinitely.;2018;3
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is treated by medication, less with deep brain stimulation and physiotherapy. Different opinions on the clinical meaningfulness of the physiotherapy or recommended intensive physiotherapy were found. Our objectives were to design intensive target-based physiotherapy for upper extremities suitable for telerehabilitation services and examine the clinical meaningfulness of the exergaming at an unchanged medication plan. A telerehabilitation exergaming system using the Kinect sensor was developed; 28 patients with PD participated in the study. The system followed the participants' movements and adapted the difficulty level of the game in real time. The outcomes of the study showed that seven out of 26 participants could set up the equipment at home alone. Clinical outcomes of Box and Blocks Test (mean: 47 vs. 52, P=0.002, Cohen's d=0.40), UPDRS III (mean: 27 vs. 29, P=0.001, d=0.22), and daily activity Jebsen's test; writing a letter (mean: 24.0 vs. 20.6, P=0.003, d=0.23); and moving light objects (mean: 4.4 vs. 3.9, P=0.006, d=0.46) were statistically significant (P<0.05) and considered clinically meaningful. The Nine-Hole Peg Test showed a statistically nonsignificant improvement (mean: 28.0 vs. 26.5, P=0.089, d=0.22). The participants claimed problems with mobility but less with activities of daily living and emotional well-being (PDQ-39). The findings lead to preliminary conclusions that exergaming is feasible, but may require technical assistance, whereas clinically meaningful results could be achieved according to validated instruments and an unchanged medication plan in individuals with PD.";2018;3
"Patients may be offered cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a supervised programme often including exercises, education and psychological care, following a cardiac event, with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality. Cost-constrained healthcare systems require information about the best use of budget and resources to maximise patient benefit. We aimed to systematically review and critically appraise economic studies of CR and its components. In January 2016, validated electronic searches of the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Health Technology Assessment, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Embase databases were run to identify full economic evaluations published since 2001. Two levels of screening were used and explicit inclusion criteria were applied. Prespecified data extraction and critical appraisal were performed using the NHS EED handbook and Drummond checklist. The majority of studies concluded that CR was cost-effective versus no CR (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from $1065 to $71 755 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)). Evidence for specific interventions within CR was varied; psychological intervention ranged from dominant (cost saving and more effective) to $226 128 per QALY, telehealth ranged from dominant to $588 734 per QALY and while exercise was cost-effective across all relevant studies, results were subject to uncertainty. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were risk of subsequent events and hospitalisation, hospitalisation and intervention costs, and utilities. This systematic review of studies evaluates the cost-effectiveness of CR in the modern era, providing a fresh evidence base for policy-makers. Evidence suggests that CR is cost-effective, especially with exercise as a component. However, research is needed to determine the most cost-effective design of CR.";2018;3
Personalized exercise interventions comprising aerobic, resistance and corrective therapeutic components were shown to result in endurance and strength improvement and reduction of fatigue and spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, telerehabilitation support of multipronged exercise programs in PwMS has received limited attention. The goal of this project was to introduce telerehabilitation support of individualized multipronged exercise programs and to assess feasibility assessment of the initial prototype in PwMS. Feasibility was assessed in 10 PwMS who were asked to perform a standardized set of tasks essential for using the telerehabilitation system independently and score each task. Our results indicated high level of acceptance of the system by these patients. On average, it took about 1-2 minutes for the patients to complete the study tasks essential for system operation. They were able to successfully use the system and follow their individualized exercise prescription. The resulting system will have to undergo a definitive systematic evaluation in a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate its clinical impact.;2018;3
Policy makers and practitioners show a continued interest in telehealth's potential to increase efficiency and reach patients facing access barriers. However, telehealth encompasses many applications for varied conditions and populations. It is therefore difficult to draw broad conclusions about telehealth's efficacy. This rapid review examines recent evidence both about telehealth's efficacy by clinical area and about telehealth's impact on utilization. We searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the use of telehealth services by patients of any age for any condition published in English in the period January 2004-May 2018. Twenty systematic reviews and associated meta-analyses are included in this review, covering clinical areas such as mental health and rehabilitation. Broadly, telehealth interventions appear generally equivalent to in-person care. However, telehealth's impact on the use of other services is unclear. Many factors should be carefully considered when weighing the evidence of telehealth's efficacy, including modality, evidence quality, population demographics, and point-in-time measurement of outcomes.;2018;3
Provider acceptance is a first step to implementing a successful telehealth program. This pilot study examined the experience of six providers delivering an education-based wellness program in a telehealth format. Providers indicated an overall positive experience with high Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) total scores (5.6 +/- 1.1) and in their comments. High TUQ subscale scores for Usefulness (6.7 +/- 0.4) and Ease of Use (5.3 +/- 0.3) indicated providers found the telehealth system usable. Strong relationship bonds that developed offset the reported drawback of technical issues related to connectivity and audio. Providers with a wide range of computer experience all reported synchronous remote training via phone and videoconference meetings was adequate to prepare them to deliver classes via telehealth. This research indicates motivated providers with varying technology experience can have a positive telehealth experience with customized remote support.;2018;3
Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is proved to be best supportive management in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPT)) individuals. The literature claims the reduction of dyspnea, fatigue, exacerbations, and improved functional capacity and quality of life. Home-based PR is being prescribed widely than hospital-based rehab due to be less cost and ease of caregiver burden, but efficacy is usually questioned. The poor efficacy may be probably due to recurrent exacerbation and poor quality of life even after years of home rehabilitation. Telerehabilitation is an excellent rehab measure where the COPD patients exercise at his home, while expertise from the tertiary care centers monitors the rehab sessions remotely. In India, the tele-PR is at its budding state. This review shall enable the readers with the basics of telerehabilitation in comparison with the other available rehab measures and evidence in the management of COPD.;2018;3
Pulmonary rehabilitation has short-term benefits on dyspnea, exercise capacity and quality of life in COPD, but evidence suggests these do not always translate to increased daily physical activity on a patient level. This is attributed to a limited understanding of the determinants of physical activity maintenance following pulmonary rehabilitation. This systematic review of qualitative research was conducted to understand COPD patients' perceived facilitators and barriers to physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation. Electronic databases of published data, non-published data, and trial registers were searched to identify qualitative studies (interviews, focus groups) reporting the facilitators and barriers to physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation for people with COPD. Thematic synthesis of qualitative data was adopted involving line-by-line coding of the findings of the included studies, development of descriptive themes, and generation of analytical themes. Fourteen studies including 167 COPD patients met the inclusion criteria. Seven sub-themes were identified as influential to physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation. These included: intentions, self-efficacy, feedback of capabilities and improvements, relationship with health care professionals, peer interaction, opportunities following pulmonary rehabilitation and routine. These encapsulated the facilitators and barriers to physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation and were identified as sub-themes within the three analytical themes, which were beliefs, social support, and the environment. The findings highlight the challenge of promoting physical activity following pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD and provide complementary evidence to aid evaluations of interventions already attempted in this area, but also adds insight into future development of interventions targeting physical activity maintenance in COPD.;2018;3
Purpose Transfer from on-site rehabilitation to the participant's daily environment is considered a weak link in the rehabilitation chain. The main objective of this study is to see if adding boosted telephone follow-up directly after completing an occupational rehabilitation program effects work participation. Methods A randomized controlled study included participants with chronic pain, chronic fatigue or common mental disorders on long-term sick leave. After completing 3A 1/2A weeks of acceptance and commitment therapy based occupational rehabilitation, participants were randomized to boosted follow-up or a control group before returning to their daily environment. The intervention was delivered over 6 months by on-site RTW coordinators mainly via telephone. Primary outcome was RTW categorized as participation in competitive work 1 day per week on average over 8 weeks. Results There were 213 participants of mean age 42 years old. Main diagnoses of sick leave certification were mental disorders (38%) and musculoskeletal disorders (30%). One year after discharge the intervention group had 87% increased odds (OR 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.06-3.31, p = 0.031), of (re)entry to competitive work 1 day per week compared with the controls, with similar positive results for sensitivity analysis of participation half time (2.5 days per week). The cost of boosted follow-up was 390.5 EUR per participant. Conclusion Participants receiving boosted RTW follow-up had higher (re)entry to competitive work 1 day per week at 1 year when compared to the control group. Adding low-cost boosted follow-up by telephone after completing an occupational rehabilitation program augmented the effect on return-to-work.;2018;3
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify how people 6-12 months after stroke were using and integrating information and communication technology (ICT) in their everyday lives. Method: To capture the participants' experiences, one focus group and 14 individual interviews were carried out in Sweden and Denmark regarding the use of ICT in everyday life. The participants comprised 11 men and seven women aged 41-79 years. A grounded theory approach was used throughout the study and a constant comparative method was used in the analysis. Results: Five categories were identified from the analysis of the interviews with the participants: 1) Using the mobile phone to feel safe, 2) Staying connected with others, 3) Recreating everyday life, 4) A tool for managing everyday life, and 5) Overcoming obstacles for using ICT. From these categories one core category emerged: The drive to integrate ICT in everyday life after stroke. Conclusions: People with stroke had a strong drive to integrate ICT in order to manage and bring meaning to their everyday lives, although sometimes they needed support and adaptations. It is not only possible but also necessary to start using ICT in rehabilitation in order to support people's recovery and promote participation in everyday life after stroke.;2018;3
Recent technologic advancements have enabled the creation of portable, low-cost, and unobtrusive sensors with tremendous potential to alter the clinical practice of rehabilitation. The application of wearable sensors to track movement has emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance the care provided to patients with neurologic or musculoskeletal conditions. These sensors enable quantification of motor behavior across disparate patient populations and emerging research shows their potential for identifying motor biomarkers, differentiating between restitution and compensation motor recovery mechanisms, remote monitoring, telerehabilitation, and robotics. Moreover, the big data recorded across these applications serve as a pathway to personalized and precision medicine. This article presents state-of-the-art and next-generation wearable movement sensors, ranging from inertial measurement units to soft sensors. An overview of clinical applications is presented across a wide spectrum of conditions that have potential to benefit from wearable sensors, including stroke, movement disorders, knee osteoarthritis, and running injuries. Complementary applications enabled by next-generation sensors that will enable point-of-care monitoring of neural activity and muscle dynamics during movement also are discussed.;2018;3
"Serving families who live in rural communities can be a challenge for early intervention programs. Factors, such as travel, family needs, and limited program and community resources, have been identified as ongoing barriers for this population. Technology, specifically teleconferencing, can be a solution to provide equitable services compliant with Part C of Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; 2004) mandates and professional practices. This article will discuss how to determine whether teleconference technology is a good fit and how to individualize, plan, and implement technology to support families in rural communities. It will also discuss legal and practical considerations that must be taken into account when using teleconferencing to discuss service delivery.";2018;3
SIGNIFICANCE: This pilot study demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of telerehabilitation between a provider in-office and a low vision patient at home as an approach to provide follow-up care to improve reading ability with magnification devices and that would help overcome barriers related to transportation and paucity of providers. PURPOSE: A recent systematic review found no publications with results on the topic of telerehabilitation for low vision. Our goal was to perform the initial steps to develop, administer, refine, and evaluate components required to deliver follow-up low vision telerehabilitation services. METHODS: Three low vision providers (ophthalmic technician or optometrist) conducted telerehabilitation sessions from their office with 10 visually impaired older adults in their homes, who recently received a handheld magnification device for reading and self-reported difficulty with returning for follow-up training at their provider's office. All except one participant had never used videoconferencing before our study, and three had never used the Internet. Participants and providers rated the use of loaner hardware devices (i.e., tablets, MiFi mobile hotspot) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant, secure videoconference services during telerehabilitation sessions at which participants read MNREAD cards and received feedback on magnifier use. RESULTS: Providers reported little to no difficulty with evaluating participants' reading speed, reading accuracy, and working distance with their magnifier. Both providers and participants rated video quality as excellent to good. Audio quality ratings were variable, generally related to signal strength or technical issues during some sessions. All participants agreed that they were satisfied and comfortable receiving telerehabilitation and evaluation via videoconferencing. Eight of 10 reported that their magnifier use improved after telerehabilitation. All except one reported that they were very interested in receiving telerehabilitation services again if their visual needs change. CONCLUSIONS: Positive feedback from both participants and providers in this pilot study supports the feasibility, acceptability, and potential value of low vision telerehabilitation.

Some people require special treatments for rehabilitating physical, cognitive or even social capabilities after an accident or degenerative illness. However, the ever-increasing costs of looking after an aging population, many of whom suffer chronic diseases, is straining the finances of healthcare systems around Europe. This situation has given rise to a great deal of attention being paid to the development of telerehabilitation (TR) systems, which have been designed to take rehabilitation beyond hospitals and care centers. In this article, we propose which features should be addressed in the development of TR systems, that is, they should consider adaptive, multisensorial, physiological and social aspects. For this aim, the research project Vi-SMARt is being conducted for evaluating whether and how different technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), multi-sensorial feedback, or telemonitoring, may be exploited for the development of the next generation of TR systems. Beyond traditional aural and visual feedback, the exploitation of haptic sense by using devices such as haptic gloves or wristbands, can provide patients with additional guidance in the rehabilitation process. For telemonitoring, Electroencephalography (EEG) devices show signs of being a promising approach, not only to monitor patients' emotions, but also to obtain neuro-feedback useful for controlling his/her interaction with the system and thus to provide a better rehabilitation experience.;2018;3
Stroke remains a major cause of human disability worldwide. In parallel with advances in acute stroke interventions, new therapies are under development that target restorative processes. Such therapies have a treatment time window measured in days, weeks, or longer and so have the advantage that they may be accessible by a majority of patients. Several categories of restorative therapy have been studied and are reviewed herein, including drugs, growth factors, monoclonal antibodies, activity-related therapies including telerehabilitation, and a host of devices such as those related to brain stimulation or robotics. Many patients with stroke do not receive acute stroke therapies or receive them and do not derive benefit, often surviving for years thereafter. Therapies based on neural repair hold the promise of providing additional treatment options to a majority of patients with stroke.;2018;3
Technology has been evolving at an exponential speed in the past decade and the evidence of a dramatic change is all around us such as self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, robotics, and many more. The fusion of physical, digital and biological worlds, the so-called 4th industrial revolution, has impacted all industries and disciplines including healthcare. It has changed the way we live, work, and interacts with people around the globe. Despite its numerous benefits it also brings several concerns such as organisations failing to adapt to this shift at an equal or adequate pace. It is imperative that we grab the opportunities it presents and together shapes a sustainable and highly productive future. The field of rehabilitation has begun to adapt to these changes and became known as Telerehabilitation (TR). A promising field can be instrumental in aiding healthcare delivery, enhancing compliance, and improving health outcomes and quality of life of patients. However, the development of TR has been at a much slower pace than expected in both developing and developed countries. This article is a review of status and trends in TR and will mainly deal with identifying challenges faced by its users, gaps and propose means for rectifying issues and for establishing cost-effectiveness. It is thus concluded that there should be future studies of high quality, analysing its cost effectiveness and cost benefit. Also, the challenges could be overcome by a combination of face to face delivery and TR.;2018;3
Technology is expanding at an unprecedented rate. Because patients value the speed and convenience of the internet, there is an increasing demand for telemedicine. Practitioners must therefore adapt their clinical skills to evolving online technologies. This paper presents a series of three case studies in which a physical therapist first assessed and treated musculoskeletal disorders via a live, secure video. The basis of the mechanical assessment was observation of movement rather than palpation. In each case, the virtual mechanical assessment identified a specific sub-classification with a directional preference. All patients reported improvements in symptoms and function in less than four visits and all maintained a reduction in symptoms after three months. Given the hands-off' role of the evaluator, this approach can become an effective tool in the evolving healthcare platform of telerehabilitation.;2018;3
Telehealth describes the provision of medical services remotely through technology, and may enhance patient access to specialty care services. Although teleneurology has expanded widely since the introduction of telestroke in 1999, telehealth services for outpatients with neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorders are less widespread. In this narrative review, we will describe the current technology, applications, outcomes, and limitations of this dynamically growing field. Evidence for telehealth applications related to neuromuscular diseases, palliative care, specialized multidisciplinary services, and musculoskeletal care are reviewed. With growing demand for specialized services and finite resources, telehealth provides a promising avenue to promote access to high-quality care, decrease the cost and burden of travel for patients, and with the expansion of software to personal computing and mobile devices, offer flexible, low-overhead practice opportunities for clinicians. Providers embarking on careers in telehealth should be aware of current legal restrictions impacting care to minimize risk and avoid liability. Muscle Nerve58: 475-485, 2018;2018;3
Telemedicine is a current trend in healthcare. The present study is part of the ePHoRt project, which is a web-based platform for the rehabilitation of patients after hip replacement surgery. To be economically suitable the system is intended to be based on low-cost technologies, especially in terms of motion capture. This is the reason why the Kinect-based motion tracking is chosen. The paper focuses on the automatic assessment of the correctness of the exercises performed by the user. A Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach is used to discriminate between correct and incorrect movements. The classification of the movements through a Naive Bayes classifier shows a very high percentage of accuracy (98.2%). Models are built for each individual and reeducation exercise with only few attributes and the same accuracy. Due to these promising results, the next step will consist of testing the algorithms on patients performing the exercises in real time.;2018;3
Telerehabilitation is the use of telecommunications technology for rehabilitation. Recently, some studies have shown positive effects of telerehabilitation of swallowing disorders, yet there are no systematic reviews verifying the evidence. The aim of this review is to assess the effects of telerehabilitation in the field of dysphagia as an alternative to face-to-face patient care, considering swallowing recovery and/or quality of life in different patient populations. We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Google Search and the grey literature from inception until December 2016 for publications written in English (keywords: telerehabilitation, telemedicine, dysphagia, swallowing disorders), which resulted in 330 records. Abstract screening and data extraction was carried out independently by two reviewers. Four papers were selected to read in full, and the methodological quality of the studies included was evaluated using Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. One study met our inclusion criteria (Wall et al. 2016), which showed that telerehabilitation improves adherence to treatment compared to patient-directed intervention. Although adherence is an important factor that influences the treatment outcome, clinical outcomes have to be examined in randomised controlled trials in order to reach evidence in this field. Lastly, this systematic review did not demonstrate the efficacy of telerehabilitation compared with face-to face therapy.;2018;3
Telerehabilitation offers great promise to improved access to rehabilitation care. The rising use of technology, the increased expansion of data networks worldwide, and the growing confidence and interest of the general population to incorporate technology into their day-to-day lives via the Internet, smartphones and wearables provide fertile ground for many rehabilitation interventions. Despite this opportunity, telerehabilitation is not integrated into existing health care systems today. Most research is focused on the efficacy of the intervention without addressing the complexity of introducing a system of care that is starkly different from the current health care system in most countries. As such, implementation of telerehabilitation may be considered a 'wicked problem' in that it is extremely complex and challenging situation that is intricately linked with the social, economic and political contexts. This paper discusses telerehabilitation implementation while considering the intervention, patient, and health care system contexts in which it occurs.;2018;3
Telerehabilitation systems that support physical therapy sessions anywhere can help save healthcare costs while also improving the quality of life of the users that need rehabilitation. The main contribution of this paper is to present, as a whole, all the features supported by the innovative Kinect-based Telerehabilitation System (KiReS). In addition to the functionalities provided by current systems, it handles two new ones that could be incorporated into them, in order to give a step forward towards a new generation of telerehabilitation systems. The knowledge extraction functionality handles knowledge about the physical therapy record of patients and treatment protocols described in an ontology, named TRHONT, to select the adequate exercises for the rehabilitation of patients. The teleimmersion functionality provides a convenient, effective and user-friendly experience when performing the telerehabilitation, through a two-way real-time multimedia communication. The ontology contains about 2300 classes and 100 properties, and the system allows a reliable transmission of Kinect video depth, audio and skeleton data, being able to adapt to various network conditions. Moreover, the system has been tested with patients who suffered from shoulder disorders or total hip replacement.;2018;3
The adoption of motor-rehabilitative therapies is highly demanded in a society where the average age of the population is constantly increasing. A recent trend to contain costs while providing high quality of healthcare services is to foster the adoption of self-care procedures, performed primarily in patients' environments rather than in hospitals or healthcare structures, especially in the case of intensive and chronic patients' rehabilitation. This work presents a platform to enhance limb functional recovery through telerehabilitation sessions. It relies on a sensing system based on inertial sensors and data fusion algorithms, a module to provide biofeedback tailored to the users, and a module dedicated to the physicians' practices. The system design had to face several cyber-physical challenges due to the tight interaction between patient and sensors. For instance, integrating the body kinematics into the sensory processing improved the precision of measurements, simplified the calibration procedure, and made it possible to generate bio-feedback signals. The precision of the proposed system is presented through a set of experiments, showing a resolution below one degree in monitoring joint angles. A validation of the proposed solution has been performed through a medical trial on 50 patients affected by osteo-articular diseases. The presented framework has been designed to operate in other application fields, such as neurological rehabilitation (e.g., Parkinson, Stroke, etc.), sports training, and fitness activities.;2018;3
"The aim of this study is to present a review based on the literature and proceedings from selected tele-medicine conferences. The review was developed using the PRISMA framework. The Embase and PubMed (updated until July 13, 2015) literature databases were searched for telemedicine-related terms and Poland. The literature search identified 129 eligible articles in the databases and 85 in conference proceedings until July 2015. Articles measured as a number of contributions per year presented a similar rising, fluctuating and almost parallel pattern. Fifty-nine percent of the reviewed papers were published in impacted journals. Almost half of all publications presented original papers. The published articles concerned mostly cardiology (16%), family medicine (15%) and pathology (11%). Conference proceedings papers concerned orthopedics (29%, significantly more frequent; p < 0.001) and cardiology (14%). Scientific activity of researchers and practitioners in Poland in the field of telemedicine is not high, but it is increasing over time. There is a tendency to present the research rather in high-quality journals instead of conferences before publication. The occurrence of individual medical specialty telemedicine in Poland may reflect country-specific needs.";2018;3
The aim of this work is to analyze the trends and new advances carried out in the last decades in the field of Parkinson's disease monitoring and management and more specifically regarding wearable and mobile technologies. The challenges of such technologies is to monitor, to assess and to manage the full range of PD symptoms through monitoring and testing routines while not hampering the patient's daily activities, identifying the correlation between the different dimensions affecting the severity of symptoms and the evolution of the disease and enabling the clinician to manage more efficiently the patient by providing timely indications on the effectiveness of the therapy and suggestions on therapy changes.;2018;3
The Center for Connected Health Policy conducted a scan of current state policy affecting occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) practice, supervision, and additional requirements for using telehealth. While most states have established telehealth policies for other health care professions, this 50-state scan shows that many states made some reference to telehealth practice for OT (37 states) and PT (40 states). The states that adopted these policies also tended to adopt them in either law or regulation, but not both, and showed no discernable patterns favoring either. Additionally, eight states included OT and PT within telehealth laws that concurrently apply to multiple health professions. More commonly, states enacted policy within laws or regulations specific to OT and PT. Most policies including limitations on telehealth practice for OT and PT did not appear to create requirements that are more restrictive than what is generally seen in telehealth across all states.;2018;3
"The decisive role of teacher education and qualifications [13] is central in optimizing education for the learners' success. However, empirical investigations and review of the literature [3] show that not only are the definitions of the related terms imprecise but also there are practical inconsistencies and unclear conceptions of teacher education [9], [4], [24]. Furthermore, the use of digital technologies popular amongst learners is restricted by teachers, who even despite good digital readiness often are limited by inconsistent conceptualization of digital competencies [1].This list of inconsistencies continues and incorporates teacher gaps in ability to assist adolescents with balance problems. The aim and objectives of this article are to initiate a discussion and approbate the findings of a state research program on adolescent's' balance difficulties and a tool created for adolescents to address these difficulties through self-managed telerehabilitation. The implementation process has identified the need for a program for the further development of teacher competency in the research area, along with the need to test the program and discuss the findings and their interpretation. Research methodology. The program has been implemented, probated and its effectiveness analysed in three regions of the country establishing its validity and reliability. The findings are organised in the following thematic clusters: improvement of teacher competence in assisting adolescents with improvement of complex balance issues and inclusion; self-evaluation of teacher competence; strategies for teachers assisting adolescents with balance measurements; organizational settings for adolescent self-managed telerehabilitation; a tool for self-evaluation of teacher competence. The methods of investigation: theoretical analysis of issues relating to the development of teacher competence and adolescent complex balance (physical, intellectual, emotional, social) development; measuring of adolescents' physical balance by BIOSWAY equipment; questionnaires and interviews with teachers and adolescents. The following data processing SPSS 22.0 programme methods have been applied: a method of descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Kendall's tau-b correlation test. Conclusions and discussion. As preparing teachers to provide quality assistance is traditionally considered a core challenge of this profession [27], adolescents' achievements are identified in terms of a teacher's specific pedagogical ability to initiate, support and enable adolescents to achieve complex self-managed improvement of their balance: the concept of a program developing teacher competence in assisting adolescents with the self-management of complex balance improvements eventuating in inclusion; redressing the lack of clarity about subject teacher responsibilities, the level of general and specialist skills required to identify student balance problems and offer appropriate assistance all of which are not included in general teacher professional skills frameworks.";2018;3
The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of telerehabilitation on mobility in people following hip surgery. This feasibility pilot randomized controlled trial included a sample of 40 participants, with 22 male and 18 female patients and mean age (SD) of 67.5 (7.8) years following a surgical intervention. Participants were equally divided and randomly assigned to a telerehabilitation or control intervention group (6 weeks, 3 sessions/week). Telerehabilitation was based on video clips of common rehabilitation exercises focusing on the lower limbs. The control group received an exercise booklet. Both groups participated in physical therapy sessions, twice a week. Outcome measures included the Timed Up and Go test, 2-min walk test, 10-m walk test, sit to stand test, walking speed, and mean step length. Measurements were completed at baseline, at termination of the intervention, and at a 4-week follow-up examination. Improvements in both groups were demonstrated in all outcome measures in the postintervention evaluation. Improvements in the telerehabilitation group were greater in five of six tests compared with those achieved by the controls. The telerehabilitation group showed greater improvements in the 2-min walking test (86.1%) and walking speed (65.6%). During follow-up, the telerehabilitation group continued to improve in all outcome measures in contrast to the control group, who showed no changes in five of the six outcome measures. Telerehabilitation, a complementary treatment to standard physical therapy, generates a positive effect on mobility in people following hip surgery.;2018;3
The increasing prevalence of chronic heart failure requires new and more cost-efficient methods of chronic heart failure treatment. In the search for comprehensive and more cost-effective disease management, the use of self-monitoring devices has become increasingly popular. However, the usability of these wireless self-trackers needs to be evaluated if they are to be successfully implemented within a healthcare system. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of six self-tracking devices for use in telerehabilitation of heart failure patients. The devices were evaluated by 22 healthy volunteers who used them for 48 hours. Based on structured interviews, the volunteers rated the devices for their user-friendliness, design, comfort, and motivation. Also, the devices' step count precision was assessed using a treadmill walking test. Of the six devices subject to user tests, the Fitbit One, Fitbit Charge HR, Garmin Vivofit 2, and Beddit Sleep Tracker received significantly higher average scores than the Jawbone UP3 and Jawbone UP24, based on the structured interviews, p < 0.001. The Fitbit One and the Garmin Vivofit 2 received the lowest error percentage rates during the walking tests. The results indicate that in terms of overall usability for telerehabilitation purposes, the most suitable self-tracking devices would be the Fitbit One, Garmin Vivofit 2, and the Fitbit Charge HR.;2018;3
"The objective of this study was to identify the necessary features of pulmonary telerehabilitation (P-TR) from the perspectives of individuals living with chronic lung disease and health care professionals (HCPs) who deliver pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Focus groups were carried out with patients (n = 26) and HCPs (n = 26) to elicit and explore their opinions about the critical elements of in-person PR and ideas for how these elements could be supported using technology. A questionnaire was used to assess technology use, PR experience, and general health status. Four key elements of PR were identified as critical to P-TR: the social aspect of PR; communicating with HCPs for education and support; using biosensors for monitoring and promoting self-knowledge; and the evolution of support with progress over time. A range of technology-enabled devices and programs were suggested as means to recreate aspects of these integral elements. Consultations with patients and HCPs suggest that users are interested in technology and want to ensure it recreates the important aspects of PR. Patients and HCPs identified similar key elements for P-TR. The opinions and suggestions of patients and HCPs should be the driving force of innovation if P-TR is to succeed in improving health outcomes.";2018;3
The present study investigated the efficacy of a computerized intervention for aphasia that combined speech-language and cognitive training delivered on an inpatient unit or via telerehabilitation to discharged patients. Forty inpatient and discharged aphasia patients were recruited and randomly assigned to the training group or control group. Computerized speech-language and cognitive training was provided for 14 days to the inpatients and 30 days to the discharged patients. Compared with the control group, training group had significantly more improved language function as assessed by the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) and practical communication skills as assessed by the Communicative Abilities in Daily Living Test (CADL). It was also found that the positive effects of the computerized training when delivered via telerehabilitation to the discharged group were smaller than the effects when delivered on the inpatient unit. The results suggest that combining speech-language and cognitive training program is efficacious in promoting the recovery of patients with aphasia, both inpatients and discharged patients, and that the program works even when administered from a remote location.;2018;3
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of telerehabilitation on missed appointment rates in a rehabilitation clinic. Clients fail to attend scheduled appointments for a variety of reasons. Unmet appointments represent a loss of financial support as well as diminished efficiency and capacity to provide services. Speech therapy utilizing multiple appointments is most difficult to maintain during a treatment regimen. This may cause individuals to miss appointments and therefore not achieve desired results. For this study, researchers utilized an intense speech therapy technique, the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT (R)) to measure compliance with scheduled appointments. Participants were randomized to either in-person treatment or telerehabilitation treatment at a site distant from the speech-language pathologist. Participants in the telerehabilitation (TR) condition completed significantly more appointments than participants in the in-person (IP) condition. When comparing results of treatment for each condition, there were no significant differences in outcome whether treated in the IP or TR condition of the study for monologue and picture description tasks, which are closely associated with conversational speech. There was a difference in the reading task with participants demonstrating significantly better post treatment results in the IP condition. The reason for this disparity is unclear and warrants further study.;2018;3
The study considered the feasibility and impact of interdisciplinary telemedicine discussions in the management of posttreatment dysphagia in patients with head and neck tumors. This is a retrospective analysis of patients with persistent dysphagia after treatment for head and neck pathology, at an institute in India. The cases were discussed in the telemedicine meeting conducted between host institute and a second unit in the United States. A monthly meeting was organized, using an internet-based video conference system. The ongoing swallowing problems and management were presented, and through discussions, a plan for further management was formulated and carried out. The Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) was measured before and after the implementation of the plan. Twenty-six patients were discussed, out of which, 22 were head and neck malignancies. The recommendations concurred with that of the host unit in 18, differed for three and additive in five patients. The pre-treatment mean FOIS was 1.46 with a standard deviation of 0.989 and posttreatment mean improved to 3.92 with a standard deviation of 1.809 (p < 0.0001). The present study supports the success of an interdisciplinary telemedicine meeting to manage difficult cases of dysphagia in head and neck. The outcome in terms of the FOIS score improved significantly after implementing them. In addition to the direct patient benefits, the meeting helped to facilitate interdepartmental collaboration between two units treating similar sets of patients across the globe, in specialized clinical areas like dysphagia management.;2018;3
This paper presents Apraxia World, a remote therapy tool for speech sound disorders that integrates speech exercises into an engaging platformer-style game. In Apraxia World, the player controls the avatar with virtual buttons/joystick, whereas speech input is associated with assets needed to advance from one level to the next. We tested performance and child preference of two strategies for delivering speech exercises: during each level, and after it. Most children indicated that doing exercises after completing each level was less disruptive and preferable to doing exercises scattered through the level. We also found that children liked having perceived control over the game (character appearance, exercise behavior). Our results indicate that (i) a familiar style of game successfully engages children, (ii) speech exercises function well when decoupled from game control, and (iii) children are willing to complete required speech exercises while playing a game they enjoy.;2018;3
This paper presents the development of a robot human imitation program which will be used in a telerehabilitation system for children with disabilities. The purpose of this project is to provide an easier and more efficient way of providing a rehabilitation process for children with disabilities, especially for autistic children. The number of autistic patients needing rehabilitation is increasing rapidly and with the problem of shortage of professional therapist, this can be an alternative solution to assist the therapist during rehabilitation period. Therefore, robot-human imitation program is developed consisting of autonomous programmable humanoid robot NAO and Microsoft Kinect as the motion sensing input device. The imitation program is conducted by sets of instructions given to the patients to imitate certain pose done by humanoid robot NAO. Microsoft Kinect Sensor is used to determine whether the imitation follows the required criteria or not. Matlab software interacts with both humanoid robot NAO and Microsoft Kinect Sensor to perform the rehabilitation program. The number of trials needed to achieve the required imitation will be translated into points and these points will be uploaded into online database for record and evaluation process.;2018;3
This paper proposes a new adaptive patient-cooperative control strategy for improving the effectiveness and safety of robot-assisted ankle rehabilitation. This control strategy has been developed and implemented on a compliant ankle rehabilitation robot (CARR). The CARR is actuated by four Festo Fluidic muscles located to the calf in parallel, has three rotational degrees of freedom. The control scheme consists of a position controller implemented in joint space and a high-level admittance controller in task space. The admittance controller adaptively modifies the predefined trajectory based on real-time ankle measurement, which enhances the training safety of the robot. Experiments were carried out using different modes to validate the proposed control strategy on the CARR. Three training modes include: 1) a passive mode using a joint-space position controller, 2) a patient-robot cooperative mode using a fixed-parameter admittance controller, and 3) a cooperative mode using a variable-parameter admittance controller. Results demonstrate satisfactory trajectory tracking accuracy, even when externally disturbed, with a maximum normalized root mean square deviation less than 5.4%. These experimental findings suggest the potential of this new patient-cooperative control strategy as a safe and engaging control solution for rehabilitation robots.;2018;3
"This report is a summary of a workshop focusing on using telemedicine to facilitate the integrated care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Twenty-five invited participants from 8 countries met for one and one-half days in Stresa, Italy on 7-8 September 2017, to discuss this topic. Participants included physiotherapists, nurses, a nurse practitioner, and physicians. While evidence-based data are always at the center of sound inference and recommendations, at this point in time the science behind telemedicine in COPD remains underdeveloped; therefore, this document reflects expert opinion and consensus. While telemedicine has great potential to expand and improve the care of our COPD patients, its application is still in its infancy. While studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in some patient-centered outcomes, the results are by no means consistently positive. Whereas this tool may potentially reduce health care costs by moving some medical interventions from centralized locations in to patient's home, its cost-effectiveness has had mixed results and telemonitoring has yet to prove its worth in the COPD population. These discordant results should not be unexpected in view of patient complexity and the heterogeneity of telemedicine. This is reflected in the very limited support offered by the National Health Services to a wider application of telemedicine in the integrated care of COPD patients. However, this situation should challenge us to develop the necessary science to clarify the role of telemedicine in the medical management of our patients, providing a better and definitive scientific basis to this approach.";2018;3
This study explored the feasibility and safety of pairing the Microsoft Kinect (R) sensor with the Oculus Rift (R) Head Mounted Display (HMD) as a telerehabilitation technology platform for persons post-stroke. To test initial safety, fourteen participants without disabilities (age 30 +/- 8.8 years) engaged in a game-based task using the Microsoft Kinect (R) with a first-person view using the Oculus Rift (R). These tasks were repeated for five participants post-stroke (age 56 +/- 3.0 years). No significant adverse events occurred in either study population. When using the Oculus Rift (R) HMD, three participants without disabilities reported dizziness and nausea. All of the participants post-stroke required hands-on assistance for balance and fall prevention. The intensive nature of physical support necessary for this type of interaction limits the application as a telerehabilitation intervention. Given the increasing availability of HMDs for commercial use, it is crucial that the safety of immersive games and technologies for telerehabilitation is fully explored.;2018;3
This work proposes a real-time monitoring tool aimed to support clinicians for remote assessing exercise performances during home-based rehabilitation. The study relies on clinician indications to define kinematic features, that describe five motor tasks (i.e., the lateral tilt of the trunk, lifting of the arms, trunk rotation, pelvis rotation, squatting) usually adopted in the rehabilitation program for axial disorders. These features are extracted by the Kinect v2 skeleton tracking system and elaborated to return disaggregated scores, representing a measure of subjects performance. A bell-shaped function is used to rank the patient performances and to provide the scores. The proposed rehabilitation tool has been tested on 28 healthy subjects and on 29 patients suffering from different neurological and orthopedic diseases. The reliability of the study has been performed through a cross-sectional controlled design methodology, comparing algorithm scores with respect to blinded judgment provided by clinicians through filling a specific questionnaire. The use of task-specific features and the comparison between the clinical evaluation and the score provided by the instrumental approach constitute the novelty of the study. The proposed methodology is reliable for measuring subject's performance and able to discriminate between the pathological and healthy condition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2018;3
Total laryngectomy (TL) with neck dissection (ND) is considered as crucial management for advanced-stage of laryngeal cancer. Shoulder dysfunction has long been recognized as a potential complication resulting from neck dissection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of early prophylactic rehabilitation program in patients who underwent TL with ND. A prospective, nonrandomized design was used. Seventy-six participants who underwent TL with ND were assigned into either an intervention or a control group. The control group received current standard care with no formal shoulder exercise provided, while the intervention group attended early preventive rehabilitation lasting 12 weeks. Participants were assessed at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Measured outcomes included shoulder function and patient-reported quality of life. General linear models with repeated measures were used to examine outcome changes in both groups over the designated assessment intervals. Improvement in shoulder function and patient-reported quality of life were both statistically significant over time, with no significant difference between control or intervention groups, indicating little or no benefit of preventative intervention on shoulder function outcomes. Analysis involving five subscales and the summary score of the quality of life questionnaire had only statistically significant improvement over time for both the control or intervention groups, except for physical well-being domain which had statistical significance both over time and between the control and intervention groups. In this study, preventative exercise program initiated immediately after surgery had a limited impact on both shoulder function and perceived quality of life.;2018;3
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown great promise as a neuromodulatory intervention capable of improving behavioral outcomes in a range of neurological and psychiatric populations. Evidence indicates that the neuromodulatory effect of stimulation may be cumulative, with greater improvements in behavior observed following multiple treatment sessions. However, the requirement to attend clinical or research departments for multiple treatment sessions may present a barrier for many people, particularly those with greater disability or living remotely. The portability of tDCS suggests that in-home stimulation may become an avenue for further investigation. However, safe and effective use of tDCS by a participant within their home requires a form of monitoring. This review discusses how telehealth may provide real-time visual monitoring to ensure correct tDCS set-up and adherence to stimulation protocols, manage technical issues and monitor adverse events. The combination of telehealth to supplement in-home tDCS use has potential to transform the way tDCS is delivered.;2018;3
Two male participants with chronic (> 2 years), non-fluent aphasia and their family members participated in script training using videoconferencing. Functional scripts were developed by people with aphasia (PWA) and their family members. Accuracy of scripts was measured by total target words produced per turn. Participant 1 with Broca's aphasia produced scripts with 0% accuracy pre-treatment and 87.5% accuracy post-treatment. Participant 2 with Transcortical Motor aphasia produced scripts with 20.2% accuracy pre-treatment and 63.5% accuracy post-treatment. Pre- and post-questionnaires for communication effectiveness and the use of telepractice for speech therapy indicated improvements in answering yes/no questions, participating in conversations with strangers, and increasing confidence and satisfaction with technology delivered treatment. The use of videoconferencing to deliver script training appears beneficial for individuals with chronic aphasia.;2018;3
Virtual reality for the treatment of motor impairment is a burgeoning application of digital technology in neurorehabilitation. Virtual reality systems pose an opportunity for health care providers to augment the dose of task-oriented exercises delivered both in the clinic, and via telerehabilitation models in the home. The technology is almost exclusively applied as an adjunct to traditional approaches and is typically characterized by the use of gamified exergames which feature task-oriented physiotherapy exercises. At present, evidence for the efficacy of this technology is sparse, with some reviews suggesting it is the same or no better than conventional approaches. The purpose of this article is to provide real-world insights on the adoption of a virtual reality by 3 European clinics in 3 different service delivery models. These include an inpatient setting for Parkinson disease, a kiosk model for pediatric neurorehabilitation, and a home-based telerehabilitation model for neurologic patients. Motivations, settings, requirements for the pathology, outcomes, and challenges encountered during this process are reported with the objective of priming clinicians on what to expect when implementing virtual reality in neurorehabilitation.;2018;3
Virtual rehabilitation yields outcomes that are at least as good as traditional care for improving upper limb function and the capacity to carry out activities of daily living. Due to the advent of low-cost gaming systems and patient preference for game-based therapies, video game technology will likely be increasingly utilized in physical therapy practice in the coming years. Gaming systems that incorporate low-cost motion capture technology often generate large datasets of therapeutic movements performed over the course of rehabilitation. An infrastructure has yet to be established, however, to enable efficient processing of large quantities of movement data that are collected outside of a controlled laboratory setting. In this paper, a methodology is presented for extracting and evaluating therapeutic movements from game-based rehabilitation that occurs in uncontrolled and unmonitored settings. By overcoming these challenges, meaningful kinematic analysis of rehabilitation trajectory within an individual becomes feasible. Moreover, this methodological approach provides a vehicle for analyzing large datasets generated in uncontrolled clinical settings to enable better predictions of rehabilitation potential and dose-response relationships for personalized medicine.;2018;3
"Within telehealth there are a number of domains relevant to pulmonary care: telemonitoring, teleassistance, telerehabilitation, teleconsultation and second opinion calls. In the last decade, several studies focusing on the effects of various telemanagement programs for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been published but with contradictory findings. From the literature, the best telemonitoring outcomes come from programs dedicated to aged and very sick patients, frequent exacerbators with multimorbidity and limited community support; programs using third-generation telemonitoring systems providing constant analytical and decisionmaking support (24 h/day, 7 days/week); countries where strong community links are not available; and zones where telemonitoring and rehabilitation can be delivered directly to the patient's location. In the near future, it is expected that telemedicine will produce changes in work practices, cultural attitudes and organization, which will affect all professional figures involved in the provision of care. The key to optimizing the use of telemonitoring is to correctly identify who the ideal candidates are, at what time they need it, and for how long. The time course of disease progression varies from patient to patient; hence identifying for each patient a 'correct window' for initiating telemonitoring could be the correct solution. In conclusion, as clinicians, we need to identify the specific challenges we face in delivering care, and implement flexible systems that can be customized to individual patients' requirements and adapted to our diverse healthcare contexts.";2018;3
Abundant evidence supports the use of pulmonary rehabilitation as a treatment for stable and exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several questions around the science base of rehabilitation in other patient groups as well as the role of rehabilitation as a component in other comprehensive care trajectories remain to be addressed. The impact of a rehabilitation programme could also perhaps be enhanced if clear guidance would be available on how to individualize the components of a rehabilitation programme in individual patients. The rehabilitation community, in an attempt to increase access to programmes, has developed less rigorous interventions. These may serve specific patients (e.g. less severe patients or may be used as a maintenance programme), but in order to have conceptual clarity they should not be called substitutes for rehabilitation if they do not meet the definition of rehabilitation. Reaching clarity on the best format for maintenance programmes in order to achieve long-lasting health benefits for patients is another challenge. Furthermore, as many patients as possible should be referred to adequate rehabilitation programmes within their reach with fair reimbursement. Programmes should take into account the burden of the disease of a patient, the required components to tackle the problems, adequate assessment to document the outcome and the patient's preference. In summary, pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the most potent evidence-based therapies for patients with respiratory diseases. Researchers should continue to fine tune the interventions, get clarity on terminology as well as the ultimate outcomes for rehabilitation to ensure sustainable health effects.;2019;4
Advancements in computer-mediated exercise put forward the feasibility of telerehabilitation, but it remains a challenge to retain patients' engagement in exercises. Building on our previous study demonstrating enhanced engagement in citizen science through social information about others' contributions, we propose a novel framework for effective telerehabilitation that integrates citizen science and social information into physical exercise. We hypothesized that social information about others' contributions would augment engagement in physical activity by encouraging people to invest more effort toward discovery of novel information in a citizen science context. We recruited healthy participants to monitor the environment of a polluted canal by tagging images using a haptic device toward gathering environmental information. Along with the images, we displayed the locations of the tags created by the previous participants. We found that participants increased both the amount and duration of physical activity when presented with a larger number of the previous tags. Further, they increased the diversity of tagged objects by avoiding the locations tagged by the previous participants, thereby generating richer information about the environment. Our results suggest that social information is a viable means to augment engagement in rehabilitation exercise by incentivizing the contribution to scientific activities.;2019;4
"Aim: To determine the effect of a tele-rehabilitation (TR) program on glucose control, exercise capacity, physical fitness, muscle strength and psychosocial status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Method: Fifty type 2 DM participants were enrolled in the study and divided randomly into two groups; TR (n = 25, mean age: 52.82 +/- 11.86) or control (n =25, mean age: 53.04 +/- 10.45) group. Participants in the TR group performed breathing and callisthenic exercises, three times a week, for 6 weeks, at home by internet based video conferences. Outcome measures including, HbA1c level, 6 min walk testing, physical fitness and muscle strength dynamometer measurement, Beck Depression Inventory were performed before and after the 6 weeks. Results: HbA1c (p = 0.00), 6 min walking distance (p = 0.00), physical fitness subparameters; sit-up (p = 0.00), sit-and-reach (p = 0.04), back scratch (p = 0.00), lateral flexion right (p = 0.04), left (p = 0.00) and time up go tests (p = 0.00), muscles strength (p = 0.00); deltoideus-anterior, middle, quadriceps femoris and gluteus maximus, and depression levels (p = 0.00) changed significantly (p = 0.00) in TR groups. There were no significant improvements in control group p >0.05). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that TR interventions found to be safe and effective, and may be an alternative treatment model for type 2 DM management. In addition to these health benefits, patients and rehabilitation team may save time, labor and treatment costs by using TR. (C) 2019 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Background and aim Telehealth is a strategy to expand the reach of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Smartphones can monitor and transmit oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) data to ensure patient safety during home-based or other exercise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usability, validity and reliability of a Kenek O-2 pulse oximeter and custom prototype smartphone application (smartphone oximeter) during rest and exercise in healthy participants and those with chronic lung disease. Methods Fifteen individuals with chronic lung disease and 15 healthy controls were recruited. SpO(2) and HR were evaluated at rest and during cycling and walking. SpO(2) was valid if the mean bias was within ++/- 2%, the level of agreement (LoA) was within +/- 4%; HR was valid if the mean bias was within +/- 5 beats per min (bpm), LoA was within +/- 10 bpm. Usability was assessed with a questionnaire and direct observation. Results The smartphone oximeter was deemed easy to use. At rest, SpO(2) measures were valid in both groups (bias <2%, lower bound LoA -2 to 3%). During exercise, SpO(2) measurement did not meet validity and reliability thresholds in the patients with chronic lung disease, but was accurate for the healthy controls. HR recording during exercise or rest was not valid (LoA > 10 bpm) in either group. Conclusions The smartphone oximeter did not record HR or SpO(2) accurately in patients with chronic lung disease during exercise, although SpO(2) was valid at rest. During exercise, patients with chronic lung disease should pause to ensure greatest accuracy of SpO(2) and HR measurement.

"Background and objectives: Frozen shoulder is a common musculoskeletal condition. Telerehabilitation has seen emerging use in a variety of conditions. This case report aims to investigate the feasibility of adopting telerehabilitation in treating frozen shoulder. Case presentation: A 43-year old female presented with frozen shoulder of insidious onset. She underwent four sessions of physiotherapy. Sessions two and three were telerehabilitation sessions; the initial and final sessions were conducted in-person. Results: The subject was compliant with all exercises prescribed during her rehabilitation and achieved all rehabilitation goals in four sessions. She was then discharged from physiotherapy. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation is feasible in treating frozen shoulder. One barrier to implementation of telerehabilitation includes the lack of technical skills and knowledge despite the high prevalence of technology in today's society. Telerehabilitation increases accessibility and ease of rehabilitation. Telerehabilitation can be considered for segments of the population that are most inclined to use technology.";2019;4
Background Communication and swallowing disorders are highly prevalent in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Maintenance of functional communication and swallowing over time is challenging for the person with PD and their families and may lead to social isolation and reduced quality of life if not addressed. Speech and language therapists (SLTs) face the conundrum of providing sustainable and flexible services to meet the changing needs of people with PD. Motor, cognitive and psychological issues associated with PD, medication regimens and dependency on others often impede attendance at a centre-based service. The access difficulties experienced by people with PD require a disruptive service approach to meet their needs. Technology-enabled management using information and telecommunications technologies to provide services at a distance has the potential to improve access, and enhance the quality of SLT services to people with PD. Aims To report the status and scope of the evidence for the use of technology in the management of the communication and swallowing disorders associated with PD. Methods & Procedures Studies were retrieved from four major databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Medline via Web of Science). Data relating to the types of studies, level of evidence, context, nature of the management undertaken, participant perspectives and the types of technologies involved were extracted for the review. Main Contribution A total of 17 studies were included in the review, 15 of which related to the management of communication and swallowing disorders in PD with two studies devoted to participant perspectives. The majority of the studies reported on the treatment of the speech disorder in PD using Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD (R)). Synchronous and asynchronous technologies were used in the studies with a predominance of the former. There was a paucity of research in the management of cognitive-communication and swallowing disorders. Conclusions & Implications: Research evidence supporting technology-enabled management of the communication and swallowing disorders in PD is limited and predominantly low in quality. The treatment of the speech disorder online is the most developed aspect of the technology-enabled management pathway. Future research needs to address technology-enabled management of cognitive-communication and swallowing disorders and the use of a more diverse range of technologies and management approaches to optimize SLT service delivery to people with PD.;2019;4
Background Fast-track and outpatient arthroplasty methodologies combine evidence-based clinical features with organizational optimization resulting in a streamlined pathway from admission to discharge and beyond. This qualitative study explored perceived problems of healthcare professionals during fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four surgeons, two anesthesiologists, ten nurses, and four physiotherapists. An inductive content analysis was used to analyze the data. NVivo qualitative data analysis software was used. Results Analysis of the data revealed eight main categories of problems: patient selection, referrals, meeting the Health Care Guarantee, patient flow, homecare, patient counseling, transparency of the journey, and receiving feedback. In addition, problems related to information flows and communication, responsibilities between different stakeholders, and existing information systems were identified. Conclusions The study revealed that healthcare professionals perceived several problems during the fast-track journey that reduce its effectiveness and make it more difficult to meet the Health Care Guarantee. Problems could be alleviated by changing internal and external organizational practices, as well as by developing new information and communication technologies that would provide up-to-date communication channels for healthcare professionals and patients. In addition, new collaboration mechanisms should be developed in order to solve the problems that occur across different organizations.;2019;4
Background Guidelines recommend exercise training as a component of heart failure (HF) management. There are large disparities in access to rehabilitation and introducing hybrid comprehensive telerehabilitation (TR) consisting of remote monitoring of training in patients' homes might be an optimal solution in Poland. Purpose The primary objective of the TELEREH-HF trial is to determine whether introducing TR will significantly increase days alive and out of hospital compared with usual care. The secondary objectives including assessment the effects of TR compared to usual care on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and all-cause, cardiovascular and HF hospitalization. The tertiary analyses include: evaluation of the safety , effectiveness, quality of life, depression, anxiety, patients' acceptance of and adherence to TR. Methods The TELEREH-HF study is a randomized, multicenter, prospective, open-label, parallel group controlled trial in 850 HF patients after a hospitalization incident in NYHA I-III and LVEF <= 40%. Patients were randomized to TR + usual care (TR group) or to usual care only (control group) and are followed for a maximum of 24 months. The TR group patients underwent a 9-week TR program consisting of an initial stage (1 week) conducted at hospital and a basic stage (8-week) home-based TR five times weekly. Results All patients were randomized and completed initial intervention in the TR group. The follow up of both groups is in progress. Conclusion The TELEREH-HF trial will provide novel data on the effects of telerhabilitation on hospitalization and mortality in HF patients, and on safety, quality of life, depression, anxiety and acceptance of and adherence to this intervention.;2019;4
Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major cause of chronic, neurological disability, with a significant long-term disability burden, often requiring comprehensive rehabilitation. Objectives To systematically evaluate evidence from published Cochrane Reviews of clinical trials to summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of rehabilitation interventions for people with MS (pwMS), to improve patient outcomes, and to highlight current gaps in knowledge. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to December 2017, to identify Cochrane Reviews that assessed the effectiveness of organised rehabilitation interventions for pwMS. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of included reviews, using the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (R-AMSTAR) tool, and the quality of the evidence for reported outcomes, using the GRADE framework. Main results Overall, we included 15 reviews published in the Cochrane Library, comprising 164 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and four controlled clinical trials, with a total of 10,396 participants. The included reviews evaluated a wide range of rehabilitation interventions, including: physical activity and exercise therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), whole-body vibration, occupational therapy, cognitive and psychological interventions, nutritional and dietary supplements, vocational rehabilitation, information provision, telerehabilitation, and interventions for the management of spasticity. We assessed all reviews to be of high to moderate methodological quality, based on R-AMSTAR criteria. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that physical therapeutic modalities (exercise and physical activities) improved functional outcomes (mobility, muscular strength), reduced impairment (fatigue), and improved participation (quality of life). Moderate-quality evidence suggested that inpatient or outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes led to longer-term gains at the levels of activity and participation, and interventions that provided information improved patient knowledge. Low-qualitty evidence suggested that neuropsychological interventions, symptom-management programmes (spasticity), whole body vibration, and telerehabilitation improved some patient outcomes. Evidence for other rehabilitation modalities was inconclusive, due to lack of robust studies. Authors' conclusions The evidence suggests that regular specialist evaluation and follow-up to assess the needs of patients with all types ofMS for appropriate rehabilitation interventions may be of benefit, although the certainty of evidence varies across the different types of interventions evaluated by the reviews. Structured, multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes and physical therapy (exercise or physical activities) can improve functional outcomes (mobility, muscle strength, aerobic capacity), and quality of life. Overall, the evidence for many rehabilitation interventions should be interpreted cautiously, as the majority of included reviews did not include data from current studies. More studies, with appropriate design, which report the type and intensity of modalities and their cost-effectiveness are needed to address the current gaps in knowledge.;2019;4
"Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease. There are mixed reports on success of physiotherapy in patients with PD. Our objective was to investigate the functional improvements, motivation aspects and clinical effectiveness when using immersive 3D virtual reality versus non-immersive 2D exergaming. Methods We designed a randomized parallel study with 97 patients, but only 20 eligible participants were randomized in 2 groups; the one using 3D Oculus Rift CV1 and the other using a laptop. Both groups participated in the 10-session 3 weeks training with a pick and place task in the virtual world requiring precise hand movement to manipulate the virtual cubes. The kinematics of the hand was traced with Leap motion controller, motivation effect was assessed with modified Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and clinical effectiveness was evaluated with Box & Blocks Test (BBT) and shortened Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) before and after the training. Mack-Skilling non-parametrical statistical test was used to identify statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) and Cohen's U3 test to find the effect sizes. Results Participants in the 3D group demonstrated statistically significant and substantially better performance in average time of manipulation (group x time, p = 0.009), number of successfully placed cubes (group x time, p = 0.028), average tremor (group x time, p = 0.002) and UPDRS for upper limb (U3 = 0.35). The LCD and 3D groups substantially improved their BBT score with training (U3 = 0.7, U3 = 0.6, respectively). However, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical tests between the groups (group x time, p = 0.2189, p = 0.2850, respectively). In addition the LCD group significantly decreased the pressure/tension (U3 = 0.3), the 3D did not show changes (U3 = 0.5) and the differences between the groups were statistically different (p = 0.037). The 3D group demonstrated important increase in effort (U3 = 0.75) and perceived competences (U3 = 0.9). Conclusions The outcomes of the study demonstrated that the immersive 3D technology may bring increased interests/enjoyment score resulting in faster and more efficient functional performance. But the 2D technology demonstrated lower pressure/tension score providing similar clinical progress. A study with much larger sample size may also confirm the clinical effectiveness of the approaches.";2019;4
"Background Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity and access to timely rehabilitation can reduce morbidity and help patients to return to normal life. Telerehabilitation can deliver rehabilitation services with the use of technology to increase patient options, deliver services more efficiently and overcome geographical barriers to healthcare access. Despite its popularity, there is conflicting evidence for its effectiveness. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to update the current evidence base on the effectiveness of telerehabilitation for stroke. Methods A systematic search of databases (Medline Ovid; Embase; Emcare; Scopus; The Cochrane Library; PEDro; OTSeeker) was conducted in April 2018 (updated in October 2018). This review was conducted and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and methodology registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018090445). A modified McMaster critical appraisal tool for quantitative studies was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Given the heterogeneity of the included studies, a descriptive synthesis was conducted. Results Out of 1868 studies, 13 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. A diverse range of interventions were delivered through a variety of telerehabilitation systems and the effectiveness measured through a myriad of outcome measures. Summarised findings from the heterogeneous evidence base indicate that telerehabilitation may have a positive impact on a range of primary and secondary outcomes. However, despite these positive findings, the current evidence lacks clarity and uniformity in terms of intervention parameters and measurement of outcomes, which limits broader application of these results. Discussion Telerehabilitation, as an alternate form of rehabilitation for people with stroke, shows potential. However, due to methodological and practical concerns, an unequivocal recommendation cannot be made. Findings from this review may inform future policies and practices regarding the use of telerehabilitation for stroke patients.";2019;4
Background Whilst home-based telerehabilitation has been shown non-inferior to traditional centre-based rehabilitation in patients with chronic heart failure, its economic sustainability remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the cost-utility of a home-based telerehabilitation program. Methods A comparative, trial-based, incremental cost-utility analysis was conducted from a health care provider's perspective. We collected data as part of a multi-centre, two-arm, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial with 6 months follow-up. There were 53 participants randomised to either a telerehabilitation program (consisting of 12 weeks of group-based exercise and education delivered into the home via online video-conferencing) or a traditional centre-based program. Health care costs (including personnel, equipment and hospital readmissions due to heart failure) were extracted from health system records, and calculated in Australian dollars using 2013 as the base year. Health utilities were measured using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Estimates were presented as means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on bootstrapping. Costs and utility differences were plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane. Results Total health care costs per participant were significantly lower in the telerehabilitation group (-$1,590, 95% CI: -2,822, -359) during the 6 months. No significant differences in quality-adjusted life years (0, 95% CI: -0.06, 0.05) were seen between the two groups. Conclusions Heart failure telerehabilitation appears to be less costly and as effective for the health care provider as traditional centre-based rehabilitation.;2019;4
Background. Children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP) have strength, coordination, and balance deficits affecting gross motor skills, such as walking, running, and jumping. However, there is a paucity of evidence for effective treatments for lower-extremity (LE) function in children with USCP. Objective. To determine the effectiveness of LE intensive functional training (LIFT) compared with an attention control group receiving upper-extremity bimanual training (Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy [H-HABIT]). Methods. A total of 24 children with USCP were randomized to receive 90 hours of LIFT (5.8 [2.3] years) or an equivalent dosage of H-HABIT (5.1 [2.6] years) delivered 2 h/d, 5 d/wk for 9 weeks. Caregivers were trained to administer the intervention in the home setting. Progress and skill progression were monitored, and supervision was provided via weekly telerehabilitation. The primary outcome was the 1-minute walk test (1MWT). Secondary outcomes included self-selected and fast walking speeds, ABILOCO-kids, 30-s chair rise test, and single-leg stance. Results. LIFT showed greater improvement for the 1MWT (P = .017) and ABILOCO-kids (P = .008) compared with controls. The other secondary outcomes were not different between groups. Conclusions. The administration of LE intensive interventions in the home setting by caregivers was shown to be an effective and novel mode of delivery for improving gait capacity and performance. LIFT delivered in the home setting using telerehabilitation for monitoring resulted in improvements in ambulation distance and overall walking ability as compared to an intervention of equal intensity and duration that also controlled for the increased social interaction and attention between caregiver and child.;2019;4
"Background. Fatigue is one of the most invalidant symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that negatively affects occupational and work performance and social participation. Occupational therapy (OT) assessment and treatment of impairments related to fatigue can have a significant and positive impact on the quality of life. Methods. An umbrella review has been carried out to provide rehabilitative decision makers in healthcare with insight into the role of OT in fatigue management in Multiple Sclerosis. The question is, what type of treatment provided by occupational therapist is more effective in reducing fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis? A search of literature published until June 2018 was undertaken by three independent reviewers using PubMed, PEDro, and Cochrane Library database including systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the last 10 years. Results. 10 studies were selected (5 systematic reviews, 1 meta-analysis, 3 reviews, and 1 guideline). Conclusions. Fatigue management programs have moderate evidence; other strategies such as OT strategies and telerehabilitation show low evidence.";2019;4
Background. Impaired balance is common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and can be present even in those with a mild disability level. With increasing disability, gait, and balance impairment progress, and lead to increased risk of falls. In some recent studies, interactive commercial video games were used for improving balance, but their limitation is their lack of individual training parameter settings needed for rehabilitation purposes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effect of balance exercise in the home setting using the rehabilitation Homebalance (R) system. Methods. A single-centre, controlled, single blind study with allocation to intervention group or to control group was utilised. Participants were assessed at baseline, after four weeks of home-based balance training, and follow-up after four weeks. The primary outcomes were the Berg Balance Test (BBT). The secondary outcome measures included the Mini-BESTest, Timed Up, and Go Test (part of Mini-BESTest), and spatio-temporal gait parameter evaluation using the GAITRite instrument. The patient reported outcomes (PRO) included the 12-Item MS Walking Scale, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, and the Falls Efficacy Scale. Results. A total of 39 people with Multiple Sclerosis (10 men) were enrolled into the study. The mean age of participants was 40.69 +/- 10.2 years, with a mean disease duration 14.76 +/- 9.1 years and mean disability level 3.8 +/- 1.9 EDSS (EDSS range 1.5-7). Statistically significant improvements within the home exercise group were present for the BBT and the Mini-BESTest. This improvement was more significant in the subgroup with moderate and higher disability (EDSS 4.5-7). All other gait parameters and PRO did not show any improvement. Follow-up assessment after four weeks showed that the reached improvement persisted for a short time period after finishing the regular training regimen. Conclusion. In comparison with no intervention, a short-term programme of home-based balance training using Homebalance (R) improved balance but not gait performance in a group of people with MS. It seems that home-based balance training tailored according to individual needs by a physiotherapist may be a future approach to consider for telerehabilitation of people with MS.;2019;4
Background. Physical activity remains low and nearly unchanged from preoperative levels following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and this is thought to underlie long-term functional limitations, secondary health problems, and higher health care costs after TKA. Objective. Our objective is to determine whether a telehealth-based intervention could improve physical activity and functional outcomes after TKA. Design. The design is a 2-arm, parallel, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial with baseline, midintervention, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up assessments. Setting. The setting is one academic medical center and one Veterans Affairs health care system. Participants. One hundred US military veterans (aged 50-85 years) scheduled for unilateral TKA will participate in this study. Intervention. The telehealth-based intervention to change physical activity behavior will be delivered through 10 sessions each of 30 minutes over a 12-week period. Participants will be provided with a wearable physical activity monitor to receive feedback on step count and guide goal-setting. Control participants will receive telehealth-based education on nonbehavioral aspects of health for the same frequency and duration as the intervention group. For both groups, telehealth sessions will occur concurrently with standardized outpatient rehabilitation. Measurements. The primary outcome will be change in physical activity, assessed as daily step counts measured using an accelerometer-based sensor. Secondary outcomes will be measured using the Life-Space Assessment questionnaire and change in physical function (30-Second Chair-Stand Test, Timed Up & Go Test, Six-Minute Walk Test, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey). Limitations. Participant and interventionist blinding is not possible. Conclusions. This trial will assess the efficacy of a novel behavior-change intervention to improve physical activity and physical function in patients after TKA. Effective physical activity behavior change could provide clinicians with a technique to augment current practice and resolve poor physical activity outcomes, long-term health problems, and high costs following TKA.;2019;4
"Background: A large number of mobile health (mHealth) apps have been created to help users to manage their health or receive health care services. Many of these mHealth apps have proven to be helpful for maintaining or improving their users' health. However, many people still choose not to use mHealth apps or only use them for a short period. One of the reasons behind this lack of use is the concern for their health information security and privacy. Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between users' characteristics and their security and privacy concerns and to identify desired security features in mHealth apps, which could reduce these concerns. Methods: A questionnaire was designed and validated by the research team. This questionnaire was then used to determine mobile app users' security and privacy concerns regarding personal health data in mHealth apps as well as the security features most users' desire. A semistructured interview was used to identify barriers to and facilitators of adopting mHealth apps. Results: In total, 117 randomly selected study participants from a large pool took part in this study and provided responses to the validated questionnaire and the semistructured interview questions. The results indicate that most study participants did have concerns about their privacy when using mHealth apps. They also expressed their preferences regarding several security features in mHealth apps, such as regular password updates, remote wipe, user consent, and access control. An association between their demographic characteristics and their concerns and preferences in security and privacy was identified; however, in most cases, the differences among the different demographic groups were not statistically significant, except for a few very specific aspects. These study participants also indicated that the cost of apps and lack of security features in mHealth apps were barriers for adoption, whereas having free apps, strong but easy-to-use security features, and clear user protection privacy policies might encourage them to use mHealth apps in their health management. Conclusions: This questionnaire and interview study verified the security and privacy concerns of mHealth app users, identified the desired security and privacy features, and determined specific barriers to and facilitators of users adopting mHealth apps. The results can be used to guide mHealth app developers to create apps that would be welcomed by users.";2019;4
Background: Accessing suitable fitness programs post-stroke is difficult for many. The feasibility of telehealth delivery has not been previously reported. Objectives: To assess the feasibility of, and level of satisfaction with home-based telehealth-supervised aerobic exercise training post-stroke. Methods: Twenty-one ambulant participants (? 3 months post-stroke) participated in a home-based telehealth-supervised aerobic exercise program (3 d/week, moderate-vigorous intensity, 8-weeks) and provided feedback via questionnaire postintervention. Session details, technical issues, and adverse events were also recorded. Results: Feasibility was high (83% of volunteers met telehealth eligibility criteria, 85% of sessions were conducted by telehealth, and 95% of participants rated usability favourably). Ninety-five percent enjoyed telehealth exercise sessions and would recommend them to others. The preferred telehealth exercise program parameters were: frequency 3 d/week, duration 20-30 min/session, program length 6-12 weeks. Conclusion: The telehealth delivery of exercise sessions to people after stroke appears feasible and may be considered as a viable alternative delivery means for providing supervised exercise post-stroke.;2019;4
"Background: and purpose: We aimed to investigate the adherence to yoga as an antihypertensive intervention through telerehabilitation. Materials and methods: In a randomized controlled trial patients were consecutively enrolled and randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Both groups received standardized yoga training during three weeks of inpatient rehabilitation. The intervention group received telerehabilitation after discharge; the control group received the usual care. Data was collected at admission (t1), discharge (t2) and at follow up after six (t3) and 12 months (t4). The primary endpoint was follow-up adherence assessed in an intention-to-treat analysis. Results: 228 male rehabilitation patients (mean age 53.3 +/- 5.8 years, mean blood pressure 139.5 +/- 10.2/86.7 +/- 8.0 mmHg) The intervention resulted in significantly increased adherence compared to control group (t3: 40.0% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.001; t4: 36.5% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.038); blood pressure and quality of life improved. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation significantly improves yoga adherence maintaining achieved health benefits in the long term.";2019;4
BACKGROUND: Ankle dorsiflexion range of motion is commonly measured during the weight-bearing lunge test (WBLT) as the horizontal knee distance traveled or tibial inclination. These measures are assumed to represent talocrural dorsiflexion, yet have not been validated against radiographic images. OBJECTIVES: To determine the (1) contribution of the talocrural joint to tibial inclination during the WBLT, (2) validity of inclinometer and photographic measures of tibial inclination compared to radiographic images, and (3) the association between tibial inclination and horizontal distance measures. METHODS: Tibial inclination using an inclinometer, horizontal distance via a ruler, and radiographic and photographic images were recorded in 20 participants in standing and during the end-range WBLT. Two assessors used computer software to measure talar rotation and tibial inclination from digital radiographs and photographs. The limits of agreement between photographic and inclinometer measures compared to radiographic measures, as well as correlations between measures, were calculated. RESULTS: In the end-range WBLT, 91.8% of motion occurred at the talocrural joint, with 8.2% occurring distally. There were very strong correlations (all, r 0.88, P<.001) between end-range radiographic and photographic measures, radiographic and inclinometer measures, and radiographic, inclinometer, and photographic measures of tibial inclination and horizontal lunge distance. Calculation of the limits of agreement indicated unacceptable agreement between inclinometer and radiographic measures (-7.84 degrees, 5.92 degrees) and acceptable agreement between photographic and radiographic measures (-2.17 degrees, 2.49 degrees). CONCLUSION: Tibial inclination during the WBLT primarily occurs at the talocrural joint. While inclinometer and photographic measures of tibial inclination can reliably be used clinically to measure dorsiflexion range of motion during the WBLT, inclinometer results differ slightly from those obtained via radiographs.;2019;4
Background: Aphasia is a quite common and very disabling symptom following stroke, negatively affecting patient's quality of life. Aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a rehabilitation training for aphasia that employ a touch-screen tablet using a virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS-Tablet). Material mid Methods: Thirty patients with aphasia due to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were randomized into either the control or the experimental group and assessed by means of a specific neuropsychological evaluation. The study lasted 6 months and included 2 phases. During the former, the experimental group underwent an experimental linguistic treatment performed using the VRRS-Tablet, while the control group was trained with a traditional linguistic treatment. In the latter, the control groups were delivered to territorial services, while the experimental group was provided with the VRRS-Tablet. Results: The experimental group improves in all the investigated areas, except for writing, while the control group only improves in comprehension, depression, and quality of life. Conclusions: Our study has demonstrated the effectiveness of a home-based telerehabilitation program specific for post-stroke aphasia. The use of telerehabilitation by means of VRRS-Tablet could be one of the best solutions to treat aphasic patients after their discharge, promoting continuity of care by monitoring functional outcomes, maintaining preserved abilities, reducing depression, and improving linguistic functions, besides the psychological well-being.;2019;4
Background: Behavioral interventions based on psychological theory can facilitate continued recovery after discharge from cardiac or orthopedic rehabilitation. For example, health professionals can encourage patients to engage in coping planning to support the maintenance of physical activity. Telephone-based interviews or web-based interventions are two promising delivery modes to provide such after-care services from a distance (telerehabilitation). However, previous evaluations of such behavioral interventions lack a detailed description of the specific content, and its connection to psychosocial antecedents and health outcomes. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to (i) describe the content of user-specified coping plans. Second, we aimed to identify (ii) coping plan characteristics associated with health outcomes post-rehabilitation and (iii) socio-demographic and psychosocial variables associated with coping plan characteristics. Methods: This was a secondary analysis from a larger behavioral intervention study, using remote delivery modes, within orthopedic and cardiac rehabilitation. Two raters evaluated the content, quality and number of coping plans from 231 participants. Physical activity and quality of life (health outcomes) were measured via self-reports at the end of rehabilitation and six months after discharge. We used linear regression analyses to examine the relationship between plan characteristics and health outcomes. Results: Content analyses of participants' coping plans emphasized that physical barriers such as pain or other health limitations presented major obstacles for engagement in physical activity post-rehabilitation. The most frequently identified external barriers to physical activity were workload, family obligations or bad weather. There was a statistically significant difference in quality of life and physical activity for participants who formulated highly instrumental coping plans (higher quality of life and activity) compared with participants with coping plans of lower quality (lower quality of life and activity). The number of plans (quantity) was not related with outcomes. Conclusion: Generating coping plans can be a useful theory-based approach for inclusion in telerehabilitation to facilitate the maintenance of physical activity and quality of life. It is important to encourage adults and older adults to engage in coping planning and, specifically, to formulate strategies that support tenacious plan pursuit.;2019;4
Background: Besides its initial use as a video gaming system the Kinect might also be suitable to capture human movements in the clinical context. However, the system's reliability and validity to capture rehabilitation exercises is unclear. Research question: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of lower extremity kinematics during squat, hip abduction and lunge exercises captured by the Kinect and to evaluate the agreement to a reference 3D camera-based motion system. Methods: Twenty-one healthy individuals performed five repetitions of each lower limb exercise on two different days. Movements were simultaneously assessed by the Kinect and the reference 3D motion system. Joint angles and positions of the lower limb were calculated for sagittal and frontal plane. For the inter-session reliability and the agreement between the two systems standard error of measurement (SEM), bias with limits of agreement (LoA) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) were calculated. Results: Parameters indicated varying reliability for the assessed joint angles and positions and decreasing reliability with increasing task complexity. Across all exercises, measurement deviations were shown especially for small movement amplitudes. Variability was acceptable for joint angles and positions during the squat, partially acceptable during the hip abduction and predominately inacceptable during the lunge. The agreement between systems was characterized by systematic errors. Overestimations by the Kinect were apparent for hip flexion during the squat and hip abduction/adduction during the hip abduction exercise as well as for the knee positions during the lunge. Knee and hip flexion during hip abduction and lunge were underestimated by the Kinect. Significance: The Kinect system can reliably assess lower limb joint angles and positions during simple exercises. The validity of the system is however restricted. An application in the field of early orthopedic rehabilitation without further development of post-processing techniques seems so far limited.;2019;4
"Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for 13%-15% of all deaths. Cardiac rehabilitation has poor compliance and adherence. Telerehabilitation has been introduced to increase patients' participation, access, and adherence with the help of digital technologies. The target group is patients with heart failure. A telerehabilitation program called Future Patient has been developed and consists of three phases: (1) titration of medicine (0-3 months), (2) implementation of the telerehabilitation protocols (3 months), and (3) follow-up with rehabilitation in everyday life (6 months). Patients in the Future Patient program measure their blood pressure, pulse, weight, number of steps taken, sleep, and respiration and answer questions online regarding their well-being. All data are transmitted and accessed in the HeartPortal by patients and health care professionals. Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the research design, outcome measures, and data collection techniques in the clinical test of the Future Patient Telerehabilitation Program for patients with heart failure. Methods: A randomized controlled study will be performed. The intervention group will follow the Future Patient Telerehabilitation program, and the control group will follow the traditional cardiac rehabilitation program. The primary outcome is quality of life measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are development of clinical data; illness perception; motivation; anxiety and depression; health and electronic health literacy; qualitative exploration of patients', spouses', and health care professionals' experiences of participating in the telerehabilitation program; and a health economy evaluation of the program. Outcomes were assessed using questionnaires and through the data generated by digital technologies. Results: Data collection began in December 2016 and will be completed in October 2019. The study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences. Results from the Future Patient Telerehabilitation program are expected to be published by the spring of 2020. Conclusions: The expected outcomes are increased quality of life, increased motivation and illness perception, reduced anxiety and depressions, improved electronic health literacy, and health economics benefits. We expect the study to have a clinical impact for future telerehabilitation of patients with heart failure.";2019;4
Background: Cardiovascular diseases account for 47% of all deaths in Europe, currently constituting one of the highest public relevance disease categories. Innovations in telecommunication technologies could enable the advent of cardiac telerehabilitation. Objectives: The purpose of the research was to assess the efficiency of a Cloud based system designed for telerehabilitation in patients that suffered a myocardial infarction. Materials and Methods: 69 patients enrolled in a rehabilitation program, divided in two groups, 32 performed a personalised rehabilitation program using the proposed solution and 37 patients performed individual unmonitored noninstitutionalised rehabilitation, based on the discharge report recommendations provided following their hospitalisation. Results: The cardiovascular fitness levels were improved in the group of patients that performed the online rehabilitation, with improved ejection fraction (average growth of 5%), of the estimated cardiopulmonary capacity during effort (average growth of 8%) and a decrease of the vascular stiffness (average 0.02%). From the general user and technological experience evaluation, the solution received a good acceptability score. Conclusion: This innovative type of rehabilitation offers real-time interaction between doctor and patient, to detect dangerous situations and seems feasible for conducting a telerehabilitation program.;2019;4
"Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a major burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Tele-monitoring has recently been used for management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Objectives: We analyzed the effect of tele-monitoring on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and performed subgroup analysis by patient severity and intervention type. Design: Systematic review. Data source: Electronic databases including Ovid-Medline, Ovid-Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Review methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published up to April 2017. Three databases were searched, two investigators independently extracted data and assessed study quality using risk of bias. Results: Out of 1,185 studies, 27articles were identified to be relevant for this study. The included studies were divided by intervention: 15studies used tele-monitoring only, 4studies used integrated telemonitoring (pure control), and 8studies used integrated tele-monitoring (not pure control). We also divided the studies by patient severity: 16studies included severely ill patients, 8studies included moderately ill patients, and 3studies did not discuss the severity of the patients' illness. Meta-analysis showed that tele-monitoring reduced the emergency room visits (risk ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.72) and hospitalizations (risk ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.80-0.97). The subgroup analysis of patient severity showed that tele-monitoring more effectively reduced emergency room visits in patients with severe vs. moderate disease (risk ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.74; risk ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 0.61-2.69, retrospectively) and hospitalizations (risk ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82-1.02; risk ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.57-2.70, retrospectively). The mental health quality of life score (mean difference 3.06, 95% confidence interval 2.15-3.98) showed more improved quality of life than the physical health quality of life score (mean difference-0.11, 95% confidence interval-0.83-0.61). Conclusions: Tele-monitoring reduced rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations and improved the mental health quality of life score. Integrated tele-monitoring including the delivery of coping skills or education by online methods including pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended to produce significant improvement. This application of integrated tele-monitoring (the delivery of education, exercise etc. in addition to tele-monitoring) is more useful for patients with (very) severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than those with moderate disease. Tele-monitoring might be a useful application of information and communication technologies, if the intervention includes the appropriate intervention components for eligible patients. Further studies such as large size randomized controlled trials with sub-group by patient severity and intervention type is needed to confirm these finding.

Background: Implementation of cardiac rehabilitation has not been optimal, with patient participation rates below 50%. Factors that contribute to cardiac patients' lack of participation in rehabilitation programs are patient motivation, logistical difficulties in getting to the rehabilitation facilities, lack of psychosocial elements, and individualization of activities in the rehabilitation programs. Telerehabilitation has been proposed as a new way to address the challenge of engaging and motivating cardiac patients and their partners to participate in rehabilitation. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of cardiac patients and their partners of participating in the Teledialog Telerehabilitation Program (TTP). The Teledialog program consisted of a digital rehabilitation plan, transmission of health data from patient's home to hospital and health care center, and an interactive Web portal with information and training videos. Methods: This case study used a theoretical approach combining the community of practice approach and self-determination theory. A triangulation of data collection techniques was used, including documents, participant observation (72 hours), and qualitative interviews with cardiac patients and their partners enrolled in the telerehabilitation group. A total of 14 cardiac patients, 12 patient spouses/partners, and 1 son participated in the study. The participants were interviewed at enrollment in the telerehabilitation program and after 12 weeks of participation in the program. Interview data were analyzed using NVivo 11.0. Results: Patients and their partners found the Web portal ActiveHeart.dk and the electronic rehabilitation (e-rehabilitation) plan to be helpful tools for health education, coordinating rehabilitation goals, creating an overview of the data, and ensuring continuity in the rehabilitation process. The patients felt that the TTP treated them as individuals, gave them a sense of autonomy, and provided enhanced relatedness to health care professionals and partners and a sense of competence as active participants in their own rehabilitation process. Some patients missed being part of a community of practice with other cardiac patients and did not use the Web forum. Patients' partners found that the telerehabilitation program gave them a sense of security and helped them balance their involvement as a partner to the patient and not push the patient too hard. Conclusions: Cardiac patients and their partners found telerehabilitation technologies a useful digital toolbox in the rehabilitation process. Telerehabilitation motivated the patients to integrate rehabilitation activities into their work schedule and everyday life and made them feel like unique individuals. Participating in the Teledialog Telerehabilitation Program might not be a suitable strategy for all cardiac patients. Being a patient's partner in the telerehabilitation program was associated with a heightened sense of security, navigation between active involvement in the rehabilitation process, being an equal partner, and not pushing the patient too hard.;2019;4
"Background: Improving physical activity (PA) is a core component of secondary prevention and cardiac (tele)rehabilitation. Commercially available activity trackers are frequently used to monitor and promote PA in cardiac patients. However, studies on the validity of these devices in cardiac patients are scarce. As cardiac patients are being advised and treated based on PA parameters measured by these devices, it is highly important to evaluate the accuracy of these parameters in this specific population. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy and responsiveness of 2 wrist-worn activity trackers, Fitbit Charge 2 (FC2) and Mio Slice (MS), for the assessment of energy expenditure (EE) in cardiac patients. Methods: EE assessed by the activity trackers was compared with indirect calorimetry (Oxycon Mobile [OM]) during a laboratory activity protocol. Two groups were assessed: patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Results: A total of 38 patients were included: 19 with CAD and 19 with HFrEF (LVEF 31.8%, SD 7.6%). The CAD group showed no significant difference in total EE between FC2 and OM (47.5 kcal, SD 112 kcal; P=.09), in contrast to a significant difference between MS and OM (88 kcal, SD 108 kcal; P=.003). The HFrEF group showed significant differences in EE between FC2 and OM (38 kcal, SD 57 kcal; P=.01), as well as between MS and OM (106 kcal, SD 167 kcal; P=.02). Agreement of the activity trackers was low in both groups (CAD: intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] FC2=0.10, ICC MS=0.12; HFrEF: ICC FC2=0.42, ICC MS=0.11). The responsiveness of FC2 was poor, whereas MS was able to detect changes in cycling loads only. Conclusions: Both activity trackers demonstrated low accuracy in estimating EE in cardiac patients and poor performance to detect within-patient changes in the low-to-moderate exercise intensity domain Although the use of activity trackers in cardiac patients is promising and could enhance daily exercise behavior, these findings highlight the need for population-specific devices and algorithms.";2019;4
Background: Integrating biomedical sensors to a telerehabilitation platform allowed clinicians to receive real-time transmissions of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, oxygen saturation, and heart rate during an exercise program. These clinical data could be helpful to adjust and personalize the intensity of exercises to each patient's condition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of biomedical sensors in telerehabilitation in patients with heart failure (HF). Methods: Four participants with HF (mean age 66 years) followed the 12-week cardiac program using telerehabilitation, including sensors to monitor real-time vital signs during sessions. The exercise program included cardiovascular, strengthening and flexibility exercises. Participants were evaluated before the intervention and one month after the end of the program. Functional capacity was measured with Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPX), the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and the sit to stand test (STST). Quality of life was objectified using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Results: Our main objective demonstrated that real-time biomedical sensors can be safely used by clinicians during a telerehabilitation session. Most participants showed a tendency to improve their physical capacities such as walking distance and lower limb muscular strength. As a main outcome of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), quality of life seems to improve after the 12-week intervention. Conclusions: This study proved the feasibility of using telerehabilitation with real-time biomedical sensors as an alternative or a complement to the conventional CR program. Use of sensors allowed a safe environment for the patient and an adequate and personalized exercise prescription. Limitation in one-to-one supervision must be challenged in future clinical trials to demonstrate that telerehabilitation could be efficient for cardiac patients requiring more individual supervision than group sessions in a gymnasium.;2019;4
"Background: Lung cancer patients experience various symptoms during treatment. Although pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective way to improve these symptoms, a medical environment of limited availability makes it difficult to provide seamless and adequate rehabilitation for lung cancer patients. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of a personalized pulmonary rehabilitation program using real-time mobile patient health data for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: We conducted a prospective clinical trial in 64 patients with non-small cell lung cancer aged between 20 and 80 years at a large tertiary hospital in Seoul, South Korea. A 12-week personalized pulmonary rehabilitation program, called efil breath, was administered to determine the effectiveness of the newly developed rehabilitation app. Participants were randomly allocated to the fixed exercise or fixed-interactive exercise group (which received the personalized program). We measured changes in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council [mMRC] score) at 6 weeks; and quality of life and service satisfaction at 12 weeks. We used the paired t test to analyze the variables. Results: Patients used the newly developed mobile health pulmonary rehabilitation app and a real-time patient monitoring website. In all participants, significant changes were observed in 6MWD at 12 weeks from a mean of 433.43m (SD 65.60) to 471.25m (SD 75.69; P=.001), and mMRC from a mean score of 0.94 (0.66) to 0.61 (SD 0.82; P=.02). The intervention significantly improved their quality of life (EuroQol-visual analog scale [EQ-VAS]) compared with baseline (mean score 76.05, SD 12.37 vs 82.09, SD 13.67, respectively; P=.002). Conclusions: A personalized mobile health-based pulmonary rehabilitation app for recording and monitoring real-time health data of patients with non-small cell lung cancer can supplement traditional health care center-based rehabilitation programs. This technology can encourage improvement of physical activity, dyspnea, and quality of life.";2019;4
Background: Many forms of home-based technology targeting stroke rehabilitation have been devised, and a number of human factors are important to their application, suggesting the need to examine this information in a comprehensive review. Objective: The systematic review aims to synthesize the current knowledge of technologies and human factors in home-based technologies for stroke rehabilitation. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in three electronic databases (IEEE, ACM, PubMed), including secondary citations from the literature search. We included articles that used technological means to help stroke patients conduct rehabilitation at home, reported empirical studies that evaluated the technologies with patients in the home environment, and were published in English. Three authors independently conducted the content analysis of searched articles using a list of interactively defined factors. Results: The search yielded 832 potentially relevant articles, leading to 31 articles that were included for in-depth analysis. The types of technology of reviewed articles included games, telerehabilitation, robotic devices, virtual reality devices, sensors, and tablets. We present the merits and limitations of each type of technology. We then derive two main human factors in designing home-based technologies for stroke rehabilitation: designing for engagement (including external and internal motivation) and designing for the home environment (including understanding the social context, practical challenges, and technical proficiency). Conclusion: This systematic review presents an overview of key technologies and human factors for designing home-based technologies for stroke rehabilitation.;2019;4
Background: Medical care for the Chinese population has been focused on first-line activities, that is, therapy, but with little follow-up on treated patients. However, efficacy of therapy is highly dependent upon post-therapy recovery. For coronary heart disease (CHD), home-based cardiac telerehabilitation (HBCTR) is an alternative to hospital-based or center-based cardiac rehabilitation, and is an innovative approach to enhance recovery, but the approach is seldom used in China. Our preliminary survey in Shantou, China, indicated that most CHD patients showed a positive attitude toward the HBCTR technology. Our follow-up study was focused on assessing the effect of the HBCTR program in low-risk patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Materials and Methods: A two-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of the Shantou University Medical College, China. The effectiveness of this program was measured by using blood pressure, Six-Minute Walking Test (6MWT), Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS), and SF-36 Health Survey (SF36). Results: A total of 80 post-PCI patients were recruited and randomly divided into two equal groups. Based upon our effort, the usual care (UC) group received paper-based CHD educational booklets and biweekly outpatient review. The HBCTR group carried out outdoor walking/jogging exercise with real-time physiological monitoring along with CHD education materials. After the 6-week intervention, the 6MWT, SF36 (PCS, MCS), FTND and CDS in both groups were found to have significantly improved compared with baseline. In addition, the improvements in SF36, FTND scores, and 6MWT distance in the HBCTR group were significantly better than those in the UC group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our observations indicated that the HBCTR program may be applied successfully in Chinese patients who had very little technical skills and its application may be highly cost-effective.;2019;4
Background: Moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) commonly result in persistent physical, cognitive, and/or emotional deficits that require long-term rehabilitation. Technology-enabled rehabilitation provides an innovative alternative to traditional intervention models. End-user acceptance of these interventions, however, is a critical factor in determining the effective implementation and acceptance of these technologies. Objective: To systematically review the literature to identify methods and measures used to evaluate user acceptance relating to rehabilitation technologies for adults with moderate to severe TBI, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals. Methods: Six key databases including Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using the relevant search terms. Results: From a yield of 2059 studies, 13 studies met the eligibility criteria. The review revealed limited research that formally evaluated user acceptance in relation to rehabilitation technologies designed for adults with TBI. Furthermore, where such evaluations were conducted, comprehensive research designs incorporating theoretical frameworks of technology acceptance were sparse. Importantly, a range of technologies and recommendations that positively influenced user acceptance were identified. Future directions for research in this area include the use of theory-driven research designs to enhance our understanding of technology acceptance, to support the development of rehabilitation technologies that maximize functional outcomes for individuals with TBI.;2019;4
Background: More feasible rehabilitation programmes for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are warranted. Even so, still in its infancy, telerehabilitation to COPD patients reveals promising results, wherefore it is anticipated to contribute significant value to the current challenges of rehabilitation to these patients. To expand useful knowledge in the field, more sophisticated telerehabilitation interventions must be developed and appraised, but first and foremost, thoroughly described. Aims and methods: The aim of this article is to give a detailed description of the rationale and content of the >C(sic)PD-Life>> programme, within the bounds of the checklist of Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR). Approach: >C(sic)PD-Life>> is a telerehabilitation programme for COPD patients delivered as a study intervention by an interprofessional team of clinicians collaborating from both the hospital and the municipal healthcare system. Making use of two-way audio and visual communication software, 15 patients participated in the intervention via a tablet computer from their private setting. The programme was a six-month-long empowerment-based rehabilitation that aimed to support COPD patients in leading a satisfactory and confident life with appropriate physical activity and high disease management. Conclusions: A long-term interprofessional cross-sectoral telerehabilitation programme has been justified and described. The intervention was tested in 2017-2018 and the qualitative appraisal, along with an analysis of case-based measurements of development in physical capacity, COPD Assesment Test, and health management, is currently under production.;2019;4
Background: Occupational therapists working in hospitals are usually involved in discharge planning to assess patients' safety and autonomy upon returning home. However, their assessment is usually done at the hospital due to organizational and financial constraints. The lack of visual data about the patients' home may thus reduce the appropriateness and applicability of the support recommended upon discharge. Although various technological tools such as mobile devices ( mobile health) are promising methods for home-based distance assessment, their application in hospital settings may raise several feasibility issues. To our knowledge, their usefulness and added value compared to standard procedure have not been addressed yet in previous studies. Moreover, several feasibility issues need to be explored. Objective: This paper aims to (1) document the clinical feasibility of using an electronic tablet to assess the patient's home environment by mobile videoconferencing and (2) explore the added value of using mobile videoconferencing, compared to the standard procedure. Methods: A feasibility and comparative study using a mixed-methods (convergent) design is currently undergoing. Six occupational therapists will assess the home environment of their patients in the hospital setting: they will first perform a semistructured interview (a) and then use mobile videoconferencing (b) to compare a versus a+b. Interviews with occupational therapists and patients and their caregivers will further explore the advantages and disadvantages of mobile videoconferencing. Two valid tools are used (the Canadian Measure of Occupational Performance and the telehealth responsivity questionnaire). Direct and indirect time is also collected. Results: The project was funded in the spring of 2016 and authorized by the ethics committee in February 2017. Enrollment started in April 2017. Five triads (n=4 occupational therapists, n=5 clients, n=5 caregivers) have been recruited until now. The experiment is expected to be completed by April 2019 and analysis of the results by June 2019. Conclusions: Mobile videoconferencing may be a familiar and easy solution for visualizing environmental barriers in the home by caregivers and clinicians, thus providing a promising and inexpensive option to promote a safe return home upon hospital discharge, but clinical feasibility and obstacles to the use of mobile videoconferencing must be understood.;2019;4
"Background: People with disabilities need rehabilitation interventions to improve their physical functioning, mental status, and quality of life. Many rehabilitation interventions can be delivered digitally via telehealth systems. For people with disabilities in underserved areas, digitally delivered rehabilitation interventions may be the only feasible service available for them. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the current status of digital intervention for people with disabilities in remote and underserved areas. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on this topic. Keyword searches in multiple databases (PubMed, CINAHL, and Inspec) were performed to collect articles published in this field. The obtained articles were selected based on our selection criteria. Of the 198 identified articles, 16 duplicates were removed. After a review of the titles and abstracts of the remaining articles, 165 were determined to be irrelevant to this study and were therefore removed. The full texts of the remaining 17 articles were reviewed, and 6 of these articles were removed as being irrelevant to this study. The 11 articles remaining were discussed and summarized by 2 reviewers. Results: These 11 studies cover a few types of disabilities, such as developmental disabilities and mobility impairments as well as several types of disability-causing disorders such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy. Most of these studies were small-scale case studies and relatively larger-scale cohort studies; the project evaluation methods were mainly pre-post comparison, questionnaires, and interviews. A few studies also performed objective assessment of functional improvement. The intervention technology was mainly videoconferencing. Moreover, 10 of these studies were for people with disabilities in rural areas and 1 was for people in urban communities. Conclusions: A small number of small-scale studies have been conducted on digital interventions for people with disabilities in underserved areas. Although the results reported in these studies were mostly positive, they are not sufficient to prove the effectiveness of telehealth-based digital intervention in improving the situation among people with disabilities because of the small sample sizes and lack of randomized controlled trials.";2019;4
"Background: Recently, self-directed physical therapy (SDPT) programs have gained popularity following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the routine use of an SDPT program in a nonselect patient population. Methods: This is a single-surgeon, retrospective study of 296 consecutive patients from August 2016 to October 2017 discharged home after primary, unilateral TKA and enrolled in a web-based SDPT program. Patients were seen 2 weeks after surgery and outpatient physical therapy (OPPT) was prescribed if flexion was less than 90 degrees, upon patient request, or inability to use the web-based platform. Results: Overall, 195 of 296 (65.9%) patients did not require OPPT (SDPT-only) while 101 of 296 were prescribed OPPT (34.1%, SDPT + OPPT). In SDPT + OPPT, 66.3% were for flexion <90 degrees, 27.7% by patient request, 5.0% received a prescription but did not attend OPPT, and 1.0% due to inability to use the webbased platform. The rate of manipulation under anesthesia was 2.36% overall (SDPT + OPPT, 6.93%; SDPT-only, 0.0%). Multivariate analysis identified elevated Charlson comorbidity index, elevated body mass index, higher preoperative SF12 mental score, and loss of flexion at 2 weeks as independent predictors associated with the need for OPPT. Conclusion: Web-based SDPT is safe and effective for most patients eligible for home discharge after TKA. It is difficult to preoperatively predict those patients who will require OPPT; therefore, we recommend close follow-up. It is critical to preserve these services for patients who require them after TKA as up to a third of patients required OPPT. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.";2019;4
Background: Regular participation in physical activity by people with cystic fibrosis (CF) promotes positive clinical and health outcomes including reduced rate of decline in lung function, fewer hospitalizations and greater wellbeing. However adherence to exercise and activity programs is low, in part due to the substantial daily therapy burden for young people with CF. Strict infection control requirements limit the role of group exercise programs that are commonly used in other clinical groups. Investigation of methods to promote physical activity in this group has been limited. The Active Online Physical Activity in Cystic fibrosis Trial (ActionPACT) is an assessor-blinded, multi-centre, randomized controlled trial designed to compare the efficacy of a novel web-based program (ActivOnline) compared to usual care in promoting physical activity participation in adolescents and young adults with CF. Methods: Adolescents and young adults with CF will be recruited on discharge from hospital for a respiratory exacerbation. Participants randomized to the intervention group will have access to a web-based physical activity platform for the 12-week intervention period. ActivOnline allows users to track their physical activity, set goals, and self-monitor progress. All participants in both groups will be provided with standardised information regarding general physical activity recommendations for adolescents and young adults. Outcomes will be assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline, after completion of the intervention, and at 3-months followup. Healthcare utilization will be assessed at 12 months from intervention completion. The primary outcome is change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity participation measured objectively by accelerometry. Secondary outcomes include aerobic fitness, health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression and sleep quality. Discussion: This trial will establish whether a web-based application can improve physical activity participation more effectively than usual care in the period following hospitalization for a respiratory exacerbation. The web-based application under investigation can be made readily and widely available to all individuals with CF, to support physical activity and exercise participation at a time and location of the user's choosing, regardless of microbiological status.;2019;4
"Background: Rehabilitation is crucial for postoperative patients with low back pain (LBP). However, the implementation of traditional clinic-based programs is limited in developing countries, such as China, because of the maldistribution of medical resources. Mobile phone-based programs may be a potential substitute for those who have no access to traditional rehabilitation. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of mobile phone-based rehabilitation systems in patients who underwent lumbar spinal surgery. Methods: Patients who accepted spinal surgeries were recruited and randomized into 2 groups of rehabilitation treatments: (1) a mobile phone-based eHealth (electronic health) program (EH) or (2) usual care treatment (UC). The primary outcomes were (1) function and pain status assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and (2) the visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were (1) general mental health and (2) quality of life (Likert scales, EuroQol-5 Dimension health questionnaire, and 36-item Short-Form Health Survey). All the patients were assessed preoperatively and then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Results: A total of 168 of the 863 eligible patients were included and randomized in this study. Our analysis showed that the improvement of primary outcomes in the EH group was superior to the UC group at 24 months postoperatively (ODI mean 7.02, SD 3.10, P<.05; VAS mean 7.59, SD 3.42, P<.05). No significant difference of primary outcomes was found at other time points. A subgroup analysis showed that the improvements of the primary outcomes were more significant in those who completed 6 or more training sessions each week throughout the trial (the highest compliance group) compared with the UC group at 6 months (ODI mean 17.94, SD 5.24, P<.05; VAS mean 19.56, SD 5.27, P<.05), 12 months (ODI mean 13.39, SD 5.32, P<.05; VAS mean 14.35, SD 5.23, P<.05), and 24 months (ODI mean 18.80, SD 5.22, P<.05; VAS mean 21.56, SD 5.28, P<.05). Conclusions: This research demonstrated that a mobile phone-based telerehabilitation system is effective in self-managed rehabilitation for postoperative patients with LBP. The effectiveness of eHealth was more evident in participants with higher compliance. Future research should focus on improving patients' compliance.";2019;4
Background: Robot-mediated telerehabilitation has the potential to provide patient-tailored cost-effective rehabilitation. However, compliance with therapy can be a problem that undermines the prospective advantages of telerehabilitation technologies. Lack of motivation has been identified as a major factor that hampers compliance. Exploring various motivational interventions, the integration of citizen science activities in robotics-based rehabilitation has been shown to increase patients' motivation to engage in otherwise tedious exercises by tapping into a vast array of intrinsic motivational drivers. Patient engagement can be further enhanced by the incorporation of social interactions. Objective: Herein, we explored the possibility of bolstering engagement in physical therapy by leveraging cooperation among users in an environmental citizen science project. Specifically, we studied how the integration of cooperation into citizen science influences user engagement, enjoyment, and motor performance. Furthermore, we investigated how the degree of interdependence among users, such that is imposed through independent or joint termination (JT), affects participation in citizen science-based telerehabilitation. Methods: We developed a Web-based citizen science platform in which users work in pairs to classify images collected by an aquatic robot in a polluted water canal. The classification was carried out by labeling objects that appear in the images and trashing irrelevant labels. The system was interfaced by a haptic device for fine motor rehabilitation. We recruited 120 healthy volunteers to operate the platform. Of these volunteers, 98 were cooperating in pairs, with 1 user tagging images and the other trashing labels. The other 22 volunteers performed both tasks alone. To vary the degree of interdependence within cooperation, we implemented independent and JTs. Results: We found that users' engagement and motor performance are modulated by their assigned task and the degree of interdependence. Motor performance increased when users were subjected to independent termination (P=.02), yet enjoyment decreased when users were subjected to JT (P=.005). A significant interaction between the type of termination and the task was found to influence productivity (P<.001) as well as mean speed, peak speed, and path length of the controller (P=.01, P=.006, and P<.001, respectively). Conclusions: Depending on the type of termination, cooperation was not always positively associated with engagement, enjoyment, and motor performance. Therefore, enhancing user engagement, satisfaction, and motor performance through cooperative citizen science tasks relies on both the degree of interdependence among users and the perceived nature of the task. Cooperative citizen science may enhance motivation in robotics-based telerehabilitation, if designed attentively.;2019;4
Background: Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability in the adult population. Technology at the service of medicine provides new solutions for the assessment, treatment, and monitoring of subjects with neurological disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the use of commercial mobile applications in the therapeutic approach of subjects who have suffered a stroke, as well as to analyze if there is scientific evidence on their use. Methods: A search of specific apps for the therapeutic approach to stroke, as well as its possible clinical after-effects, in the main applications repositories was made: Google Play and App Store. Besides, the possible scientific evidence for each app obtained was analyzed using the following databases: Web of Science, Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Google Scholar. Results: A total of 45 apps were obtained meeting the criteria established in the study. These were subdivided into different cate.gories: assessment tools (13), therapeutic exercise program (8) perception of laterality and body scheme (7), management of secondary disorders (7), mobility, dexterity and manual coordination (5) and postural correction and ergonomics (5). From the 45 apps obtained, only 10 of them had been used in scientific studies. Conclusions: There is a wide variety of commercial mobile applications of great utility and low cost, applicable in the assessment and treatment of subjects who have suffered a stroke, there is even scientific evidence, although limited, about the validity of such apps.;2019;4
Background: Telehealth is a great approach for providing high quality health care services to people who cannot easily access these services in person. However, because of frequently reported health data breaches, many people may hesitate to use telehealth-based health care services. It is necessary for telehealth care providers to demonstrate that they have taken sufficient actions to protect their patients' data security and privacy. The government provided a HIPAA audit protocol that is highly useful for internal security and privacy auditing on health care systems, however, this protocol includes extensive details that are not always specific to telehealth and therefore is difficult to be used by telehealth practitioners. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop and validate a telehealth privacy and security self-assessment questionnaire for telehealth providers. Methods: In our previous work, we performed a systematic review on the security and privacy protection offered in various telehealth systems. The results from this systematic review and the HIPAA audit protocol were used to guide the development of the self-assessment questionnaire. The draft of the questionnaire was created by the research team and distributed to a group of telehealth providers for evaluating the relevance and clarity of each statement in the draft. The questionnaire was adjusted and finalized according to the collected feedback and face-to-face discussions by the research team. A website was created to distribute the questionnaire and manage the answers from study participants. A psychometric analysis was performed to evaluate the reliability of the questionnaire. Results: There were 84 statements in the draft questionnaire. Five telehealth providers provided their feedback to the statements in this draft. They indicated that a number of these statements were either redundant or beyond the capacity of telehealth care practitioners, who typically do not have formal training in information security. They also pointed out that the wording of some statements needed to be adjusted. The final released version of the questionnaire had 49 statements. In total, 31 telehealth providers across the nation participated in the study by answering all the statements in this questionnaire. The psychometric analysis indicated that the reliability of this questionnaire was high. Conclusion: With the availability of this self-assessment questionnaire, telehealth providers can perform a quick self-assessment on their telehealth systems. The assessment results may be used to identify possible vulnerabilities in telehealth systems and practice or demonstrate to patients the sufficient security and privacy protection to patients' data.;2019;4
BACKGROUND: Telehealth is an accepted service-delivery model in a variety of health professions, including occupational therapy. Telehealth holds potential for school-based occupational therapy evaluation, intervention, consultation, monitoring, and supervision. As the use of telehealth becomes prevalent, it will be important to describe the benefits and barriers to potential types of occupational therapy evaluation, intervention, consultation, monitoring, and supervision delivered via a telehealth service-delivery model. Querying stakeholder perceptions of telehealth may help guide additional precipitating factors that have not yet been explored. OBJECTIVE: This study gathers information regarding perceptions, perceived barriers, and benefits of the use of telehealth in school-based occupational therapy practice. METHODS: School-based occupational therapy practitioners (OTP), district administrators, and related technology staff were invited to complete a survey intended to explore attitudes about the use of telehealth. RESULTS: 28.57% of respondents stated that their districts were likely to adopt the use of telehealth. Participants noted perceived barriers and benefits to the use of telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary feedback regarding school-based OTP and administrator perceptions of telehealth as a component of school-based OT practice.;2019;4
BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has emerged as a tool for overcoming the challenges of healthcare systems and is likely to become increasingly viable, since information and communication technologies have become more sophisticated and user-friendly. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify all Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) on telemedicine within healthcare and to summarize the current evidence regarding its use. DESIGN AND SETTING: Review of CSRs, developed at the Discipline of Emergency and Evidence-Based Medicine, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo. METHODS: We searched for studies that compared use of telemedicine with conventional treatment or management of diseases within healthcare. Diagnostic telemedicine studies or studies using automatic text, voice-text or even self-managed care were excluded. The main characteristics and the certainty of evidence were synthetized and critically discussed by all authors. RESULTS: We included 10 CSRs that investigated a broad range of diseases. There is still insufficient evidence to determine what types of telemedicine interventions are effective, for which patients and in which settings, and whether such interventions can be used as a replacement for the standard treatment. Harm relating to telemedicine technologies needs to be better investigated and addressed. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine might be an excellent way to facilitate access to treatment, monitoring and dissemination of important clinical knowledge. However, given the recognition of systematic reviews as the best evidence resource available for decision-making, further randomized controlled trials with stricter methods are necessary to reduce the uncertainties in evidence-based use of telemedicine.;2019;4
"Background: Telemedicine, the remote delivery of health care services, increases access to care for patients with mobility or geographic limitations. Virtual house calls (VHCs) are one type of telemedicine in which clinical visits are conducted remotely using an audio-visual connection with the patient at home. Use of VHCs is more established in other neurologic disorders but is only recently being formally evaluated in multiple sclerosis (MS). This randomized crossover study systematically assessed VHCs compared with in-clinic visits in persons with MS. Methods: Recruitment occurred in a university based MS clinic. Each subject completed one VHC and one in-clinic follow-up visit. A 1:1 randomization determined whether the VHC or in-clinic follow-up visit occurred first. Baseline surveys included demographics and MS history; post-visit surveys elicited subject responses regarding each visit type to assess feasibility, satisfaction, and cost differences. Outcomes were compared using t-tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for proportions. Results: Thirty-six participants completed both study visits and both post-visit surveys. VHC feasibility was demonstrated by a lack of statistically significant difference in the number of completed VHCs as compared with in-clinic visits. VHCs provided both cost and time savings to participants. The majority of participants reported that they would recommend telemedicine visits to others (97.1%) and rated it easy to connect via telemedicine (94.3%). In qualitative comments, participants expressed appreciation for VHCs due to convenience and similarity to in-clinic visits. Conclusions: VHCs were found to be feasible, cost-effective, and appealing to persons with MS and physicians, supporting their utility as a care delivery method for MS.";2019;4
"Background: Telerehabilitation approaches have been successful in supporting coronary artery disease (CAD) patients to rehabilitate at home after hospital-based rehabilitation. However, on completing a telerehabilitation program, the effects are not sustained beyond the intervention period because of the lack of lifestyle adaptations. Furthermore, decline in patients' motivation lead to recurrence of disease and increased rehospitalization rates. We developed HeartHab, using persuasive design principles and personalization, to enable sustenance of rehabilitation effects beyond the intervention period. HeartHab promotes patients' understanding, motivates them to reach personalized rehabilitation goals, and helps to maintain positive lifestyle adaptations during telerehabilitation. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the HeartHab app on patients' overall motivation, increasing physical activities, reaching exercise targets, quality of life, and modifiable risk factors in patients with CAD during telerehabilitation. The study also investigated carryover effects to determine the maintenance of effects after the conclusion of the intervention. Methods: A total of 32 CAD patients were randomized on a 1:1 ratio to telerehabilitation or usual care. We conducted a 4-month crossover study with a crossover point at 2 months using a mixed-methods approach for evaluation. We collected qualitative data on users' motivation, user experience, and quality of life using questionnaires, semistructured interviews and context-based sentiment analysis Quantitative data on health parameters, exercise capacity, and risk factors were gathered from blood tests and ergo-spirometry tests. Data procured during the app usage phase were compared against baseline values to assess the impact of the app on parameters such as motivation, physical activity, quality of life, and risk factors. Carryover effects were used to gather insights on the maintenance of effects. Results: The qualitative data showed that 75% (21/28) of patients found the HeartHab app motivating and felt encouraged to achieve their rehabilitation targets. 84% (21/25) of patients either reached or exceeded their prescribed physical activity targets. We found positive significant effects on glycated hemoglobin (P=.01; d=1.03; 95% CI 0.24-1.82) with a mean decrease of 1.5 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P=.04; d=0.78; 95% CI 0.02-1.55) with a mean increase of 0.61 mg/dL after patients used the HeartHab app. We observed significant carryover effects on weight, HDL cholesterol, and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), indicating the maintenance of effects. Conclusions: Persuasive design techniques integrated in HeartHab and tailoring of exercise targets were effective in motivating patients to reach their telerehabilitation targets. This study demonstrated significant effects on glucose and HDL cholesterol and positive carryover effects on weight, HDL cholesterol, and VO2 max. There was also a perceived improvement in quality of life. A longer-term evaluation with more patients could possibly reveal effectiveness on other risk factors and maintenance of the positive health behavior change.";2019;4
Background: The gold standard in dysarthria assessment involves subjective analysis by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). We aimed to investigate the feasibility of dysarthria assessment using automatic speech recognition. Methods: We developed an automatic speech recognition based software to assess dysarthria severity using hidden Markov models (HMMs). Word-specific HMMs were trained using the utterances from one hundred healthy individuals. Twenty-eight patients with dysarthria caused by neurological disorders, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson's disease were participated and their utterances were recorded. The utterances of 37 words from the Assessment of Phonology and Articulation for Children test were recorded in a quiet control booth in both groups. Patients were asked to repeat the recordings for evaluating the test-retest reliability. Patients' utterances were evaluated by two experienced SLPs, and the consonant production accuracy was calculated as a measure of dysarthria severity. The trained HMMs were also employed to evaluate the patients' utterances by calculating the averaged log likelihood (aLL) as the fitness of the spoken word to the word-specific HMM. Results: The consonant production accuracy reported by the SLPs strongly correlated r= 0.808) with the aLL, and the aLL showed excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.964). Conclusion: This leads to the conclusion that dysarthria assessment using a one-word speech recognition system based on word-specific HMMs is feasible in neurological disorders.;2019;4
Background: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the usage of prehabilitation on a telehealth platform prior to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and its impact on short-term outcomes. Specifically, the study examined whether patients participating in a prehabilitation program impacted length of stay (LOS) and discharge disposition. Methods: A total of 476 consecutive patients who underwent TKA at three institutions were included. The average age of the 476 patients was 65.1 years (range, 35 and 93 years).There was a total of 114 patients who utilized the novel prehabilitation program that provided exercises, nutritional advice, education regarding home safety and reducing medical risks, and pain management skills prior to surgery. A group of 362 patients who did not utilize the program formed the control cohort. The outcomes evaluated were LOS and discharge disposition to home, home with health aide (HHA), or skilled nursing facility (SNF). Results: The average LOS in the prehabilitation group was significantly shorter than in the control group (2.0 vs. 2.7 days, P<0.001). Additionally, prehabilitation patients had more favorable discharge disposition status in comparison to the control group. In the prehabilitation patients, 77.2% went home without assistance, compared to 42.8% in the control group (P<0.001). Also, significantly fewer patients in the prehabilitation group were discharged to a SNF when compared to the control group (1.8% vs. 21.8%, P<0.0001). Conclusions: Prehabilitation preceding TKA in the current study showed early benefits in LOS and discharge disposition. This study will help expand the current literature and educate orthopaedic surgeons on a novel technology. To truly appreciate the role of telerehabilitation in the setting of TKA, further investigation is needed to investigate long-term outcomes, cost analysis, and patient and clinician satisfaction.;2019;4
"Background: The recent exponential growth of Digital Health (DH) in the healthcare system provides a crucial transformation in healthcare, answering to alarming threats related to the increasing number of Chronic Neurological Diseases (CNDs). New long-term integrated DH-care approaches, including rehabilitation, are warranted to address these concerns. Methods: The Human Empowerment Aging and Disability (HEAD) rehabilitation program, a new long-term integrated care including DH-care system, was evaluated in terms of efficiency and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in 107 CND patients (30 with Parkinson's Disease, PD; 32 with Multiple Sclerosis, MS; 45 with stroke in chronic stage). All participants followed 1-month of HEAD rehabilitation in clinic (ClinicHEAD: 12 sessions, 3/week), then 1:3 patient was consecutively allocated to 3-months telerehabilitation at home (HomeHEAD: 60 sessions, 5/week). Efficiency (i.e., adherence, usability, and acceptability) and PROMs (i.e., perceived functioning in real-world) were analyzed. Results: The rate of adherence to HEAD treatment in clinic (>= 90%) and at home (77%) was high. Usability of HEAD system was judged as good (System Usability Scale, median 70.00) in clinic and even more at home (median 80.00). Similarly, administering the Technology Acceptance Model 3 questionnaire we found high scores both in clinic/at home (Usefulness, mean 5.39 +/- 1.41 SD/mean 5.33 +/- 1.29 SD; Ease of use, mean 5.55 +/- 1.05 SD/ mean 5.45 +/- 1.17 SD, External Control, mean 4.94 +/- 1.17 SD/mean 5.07 +/- 1.01 SD, Relevance, mean 5.68 +/- 1.29 SD/mean 5.70 +/- 1.13 SD and Enjoyment, mean 5.70 +/- 1.40 SD/mean 6.01 +/- 1.08 SD). After ClinicHEAD, participation and autonomy in daily routine was maintained or even ameliorated (PD and stroke > MS). Whereas, increased functionality and participation in the MS group was found only after HomeHEAD intervention. Discussion: Our results suggest that a tele-health-based approach is both feasible and efficient in providing rehabilitation care to CNDs from clinic to home. Increasing and maintaining participation as well as autonomy in daily routine are promising findings that open up scenarios for the continuity of care at home through DH-care for CNDs.";2019;4
Background: The shoulder is one of the joints with the greatest mobility within the human body and its evaluation is complex. An assessment can be conducted using questionnaires or functional tests, and goniometry can complement the information obtained in this assessment. However, there are now validated devices that can provide more information on the realization of movement, such as inertial sensors. The cost of these devices is usually high and they are not available to all clinicians, but there are also inertial sensors that are implemented in mobile phones which are cheaper and widely available. Results from the inertial sensors integrated into mobile devices can have the same reliability as those from dedicated sensors. Conclusions: Compared with the InertiaCube3, the Nexus 4 smartphone is a reliable and valid tool for recording the velocity produced in the shoulder. Methods: A total of 43 subjects, 27 affected by shoulder pathologies and 16 asymptomatic, participated in the study. Shoulder flexion, abduction, and scaption were measured using an InertiaCube3 and a Nexus 4 smartphone, which were attached to the participants to record the results simultaneously. The interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated based on the 3 movements performed. Objective: This study aimed to validate the use of the Nexus 4 smartphone as a measuring tool for the mobility of the humerus during shoulder movement compared with a dedicated InertiaCube3 (Intersense) sensor. Results: The smartphone reliably recorded the velocity values and simultaneously recorded them alongside the inertial sensor. The ICCs of the 3 gestures and for each of the axes of movement were analyzed with a 95% CI. In the abduction movement, the devices demonstrated excellent interclass reliability for the abduction humeral movement axis (Cronbach alpha=.98). The axis of abduction of the humeral showed excellent reliability for the movements of flexion (Cronbach alpha=.93) and scaption (Cronbach alpha=.98).;2019;4
"Background: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of technology-assisted rehabilitation following total hip/knee replacement (THR/TKR). Methods: Six electronic databases were searched without language or time restrictions for relevant studies: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro); from inception to November 7th, 2018. Two reviewers independently applied inclusion criteria to select eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effectiveness of technology-based interventions, compared with usual care or no intervention for people undergoing THR/TKR. Two reviewers independently extracted trial details (e.g. patients' profile, intervention, outcomes, attrition and adverse events). Study methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Quality of evidence was critically appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: We identified 21 eligible studies assessing telerehabilitation, game- or web-based therapy. There were 17 studies (N = 2188) in post- TKR rehabilitation and 4 studies (N = 783) in post- THR rehabilitation. Compared to usual care, technology-based intervention was more effective in reducing pain (mean difference (MD): - 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.48, - 0.02; moderate evidence) and improving function measured with the timed up-and-go test (MD: -7.03; 95% CI: - 11.18, - 2.88) in people undergoing TKR. No between-group differences were observed in rates of hospital readmissions or treatment-related adverse events (AEs) in those studies. Conclusion: There is moderate-quality of evidence showed technology-assisted rehabilitation, in particular, telerehabilitation, results in a statistically significant improvement in pain; and low-quality of evidence for the improvement in functional mobility in people undergoing TKR. The effects were however too small to be clinically significant. For THR, there is very limited low-quality evidence shows no significant effects.";2019;4
BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been investigated as a therapeutic neuromodulation tool in several neurological disorders. However, evidence supporting its efficacy in disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is limited possibly due to limited patient accessibility for research, particularly for individuals with advanced disease progression. Telerehabilitation using home-based protocols allows for remote supervision of tDCS over longer durations, thereby increasing participation, compliance and adherence. In this study, we explored the safety, feasibility and preliminary effects of a remotely supervised tDCS (RS-tDCS) protocol in ALS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this pre-post case series study, two individuals with ALS completed 24 remotely supervised anodal tDCS sessions (20 minutes, 2 mA). Outcomes included adherence, compliance, disease progression, walking speed, risk of fall, endurance, fatigue and depression. RESULTS: Both participants successfully completed the study without any major adverse effects. Minor side effects included mild sensations of itching and throbbing under the electrodes during stimulation. Clinical outcomes showed minimal to no change for any of the measures. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings suggest that the RS-tDCS protocol is safe and feasible in individuals with ALS. Our protocol serves as a model for future long-term studies to evaluate the clinical and neurophysiological effects of tDCS using a telerehabilitation protocol in ALS.;2019;4
Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may impact an individual physically, cognitively, socially, and emotionally. Poor balance, reduced mobility, and low daily physical activity often will require ongoing physical rehabilitation intervention. However, face-to-face specialized physiotherapy is not always accessible for individuals living in rural settings. Objective: We will answer four questions: (1) What is the feasibility of a remotely supervised, home-based, intensive exercise intervention with survivors of moderate and severe TBI? (2) Does the frequency of remote supervision have an impact on the feasibility of completing a home based intensive exercise program? (3) Does the frequency of remote supervision impact balance, functional mobility, and physical activity? (4) What is the lived experience of remote supervision for both survivors and caregivers? Methods: Four participants will complete two intensive, 4-week (five days per week) home-based exercise interventions remotely supervised via synchronous videoconference. Each exercise intervention will have a goal of 160 to 300 repetitions or 60 minutes of tailored exercises to promote neuroplasticity and be defined as an intensive home-based exercise intervention. An alternating single-subject design will allow for the comparison between two frequencies of remote supervision, once weekly and five times weekly. Daily repeated outcome measures, pre- and postintervention outcome measures, and 1-month follow-up outcome measures will be collected to explore the effect on feasibility and physical variables. Daily outcome measures include step count and Five Times Sit-to-Stand test. Pre-post measures include assessment of quiet stance and the Community Balance and Mobility Scale. A semistructured interview will be completed at the end of each intervention segment to document the lived experience of both survivors and their study partners. Finally, five questionnaires will be used to understand the overall experience: the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 Participation Index, Satisfaction With Life Scale, Fall Efficacy Scale-International, Interpersonal Behavior Questionnaire, and System Usability Scale. Data will be analyzed following traditional single-subject methods of analysis. Results: Ethics approval was received from both the Bruyere Research Institute and University of Ottawa review boards in March 2019. Recruitment is underway. Conclusions: The proposed intervention is complex in nature due to the involvement of multiple technology sources and the inclusion of a complex dyad (survivors and caregivers) in a community setting. This type of research is timely given that alternative methods of physical intervention delivery are needed to facilitate gains in balance, mobility, physical activity among TBI survivors with limited access to clinical care, and the quality of the patients' experience.;2019;4
BACKGROUND: Using telehealth in pulmonary rehabilitation (telerehabilitation) is a new field of health-care practice. To successfully implement a telerehabilitation program, measures of acceptance of this new type of program need to be assessed among potential users. The purpose of this study was to develop a scale to measure acceptance of using telerehabilitation by health-care practitioners and patients. METHODS: Three objectives were met (a) constructing a modified scale of the technology acceptance model, (b) judging the items for content validity, and (c) judging the scale for face validity. Nine experts agreed to participate and evaluate item relevance to theoretical definitions of domains. To establish face validity, 7 health-care practitioners and 5 patients were interviewed to provide feedback about the scale's clarity and ease of reading. RESULTS: The final items were divided into 2 scales that reflected the health-care practitioner and patient responses. Each scale included 3 subscales: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention. CONCLUSIONS: The 2 scales, each with 3 subscales, exhibited evidence of content validity and face validity. The 17-item telerehabilitation acceptance scale for health-care practitioners and the 13-item telerehabilitation acceptance scale among patients warrant further psychometric testing as valuable measures for pulmonary rehabilitation programs.;2019;4
Background: We propose a Phase III trial that compares the effectiveness of an exercise training program delivered in a facility-based setting with direct, in-person supervision or a home-based setting with remote supervision via telerehabilitation for improving walking performance in persons with multiple sclerosis(MS) who have walking dysfunction and mobility disability. Methods/design: The study was developed with stakeholder engagement and is a multi-site trial that follows a 2-stage, randomized choice design, The trial compares the effectiveness of a 16-week evidence-based, individualized exercise program delivered in a supervised, facility-based setting versus a remotely coached/ guided, home-based setting using telerehabilitation in physically inactive and cognitively intact people with MS who have walking dysfunction and mobility disability(N = 500). The primary outcome is walking speed. The secondary outcomes are walking endurance, disability status, and patient-reported outcomes of physical activity, walking impairment, fatigue, and quality of life. The components of the exercise program itself are similar between the groups and follow the Guidelines for Exercise in MS protocol. This includes a program manual, exercise prescription, exercise equipment, social-cognitive theory materials including newsletters, logs, and calendars, and one-on-one behavioral coaching by exercise specialists with background in MS. The main difference between groups is the coaching approach and setting for delivering the exercise training program. The outcomes will be collected by treatment-blinded assessors at baseline(week 0), mid-intervention(week 8), postintervention(week 16), and follow-up(week 52). Discussion: The proposed study will provide evidence for the effectiveness of a novel, widely-scalable program for delivering exercise training in persons with MS who have walking dysfunction and mobility disability.;2019;4
"Background: Wearable technology is finding its way into clinical practice. Physical activity describes patients' functional status after cardiac surgery and can be monitored remotely by using dedicated trackers. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the progress of physical activity in cardiac rehabilitation by using wearable fitness trackers in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery by either the conventional off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) or the robotically assisted minimally invasive coronary artery bypass (RA-MIDCAB). We hypothesized faster recovery of physical activity after RA-MIDCAB in the first weeks after discharge as compared to OPCAB. Methods: Patients undergoing RA-MIDCAB or OPCAB were included in the study. Each patient received a Fitbit Charge HR (Fitbit Inc, San Francisco, CA) physical activity tracker following discharge. Rehabilitation progress was assessed by measuring the number of steps and physical activity level daily. The physical activity level was calculated as energy expenditure divided by the basic metabolic rate. Results: A total of 10 RA-MIDCAB patients with a median age of 68 (min, 55; max, 83) years and 12 OPCAB patients with a median age of 69 (min, 50; max, 82) years were included. Baseline characteristics were comparable except for body mass index (RA-MIDCAB: 26 kg/m(2); min, 22; max, 28 versus OPCAB: 29 kg/m(2); min, 27; max, 33; P<.001). Intubation time (P<. 05) was significantly lower in the RA-MIDCAB group. A clear trend, although not statistically significant, was observed towards a higher number of steps in RA-MIDCAB patients in the first week following discharge. Conclusions: RA-MIDCAB patients have an advantage in recovery in the first weeks of revalidation, which is reflected by the number of steps and physical activity level measured by the Fitbit Charge HR, as compared to OPCAB patients. However, unsupervised assessment of daily physical activity varied widely and could have consequences with regard to the use of these trackers as research tools.";2019;4
"BackgroundA user-centered design approach for eHealth interventions improves their effectiveness in stroke rehabilitation. Nevertheless, insight into requirements of end-users (patients/informal caregivers and/or health professionals) for eRehabilitation is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify end-user requirements for a comprehensive eHealth program in stroke rehabilitation.MethodsEight focus groups were conducted to identify user requirements; six with patients/informal caregivers and two with health professionals involved in stroke rehabilitation (rehabilitation physicians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, team coordinators, speech therapist). The focus groups were audiotaped and transcribed in full. Direct content analysis was used to identify the end-user requirements for stroke eHealth interventions concerning three categories: accessibility, usability and content.ResultsIn total, 45 requirements for the accessibility, usability and content of a stroke eRehabilitation program emerged from the focus groups. Most requirements concerned content (27 requirements), followed by usability (12 requirements) and accessibility (6 requirements). Patients/informal caregivers and health professionals each identified 37 requirements, respectively, with 29 of them overlapping.ConclusionsRequirements between stroke patients/informal caregivers and health professionals differed on several aspects. Therefore, involving the perspectives of all end users in the design process of stroke eRehabilitation programs is needed to achieve a user-centered design.Trial registrationThe study was approved by the Medical Ethical Review Board of the Leiden University Medical Center [P15.281].";2019;4
BackgroundInertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based wearable sensors have found common use to track arm activity in daily life. However, classifying a high number of arm motions with single IMU-based systems still remains a challenging task. This paper explores the possibility to increase the classification accuracy of these systems by incorporating a thermal sensor. Increasing the number of arm motions that can be classified is relevant to increasing applicability of single-device wearable systems for a variety of applications, including activity monitoring for athletes, gesture control for video games, and motion classification for physical rehabilitation patients. This study explores whether a thermal sensor can increase the classification accuracy of a single-device motion classification system when evaluated with healthy participants. The motions performed are reproductions of exercises described in established rehabilitation protocols.MethodsA single wrist-mounted device was built with an inertial sensor and a thermal sensor. This device was worn on the wrist, was battery powered, and transmitted data over Bluetooth to computer during recording. A LabVIEW Graphical User Interface (GUI) instructed the user to complete 24 different arm motions in a pre-randomized order. The received data were pre-processed, and secondary features were calculated on these data. These features were processed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and then several machine learning models were applied to select the optimal model based on speed and accuracy. To test the effectiveness of the scheme, 11 healthy subjects participated in the trials.ResultsAverage personalized classification model accuracies of 93.55% were obtained for 11 healthy participants. Generalized model accuracies of 82.5% indicated that the device can classify arm motions on a user without prior training. The addition of a thermal sensor significantly increased classification accuracy of a single wrist-mounted inertial device, from 75 to 93.55%, (F(1,20)=90.53, p=7.25e-09).ConclusionThis study found that the addition of the thermal sensor improved the classification accuracy of 24 arm motions from 75 to 93.55% for a single-device system. Our results provide evidence that a single device can be used to classify a relatively large number of arm motions from arm rehabilitation protocols. While this study provides a conceptual proof-of-concept with a healthy population, additional investigation is required to evaluate the performance of this system for specific applications, such as activity classification for physically affected stroke survivors undergoing home-based rehabilitation.;2019;4
BackgroundMost surviving hip-fracture patients experience reduced mobility and lose some of their functional ability, which increases the risk of complications and rehospitalization. Post-discharge transitional programs to reduce readmissions and disabilities have shown some success. Telerehabilitation refers to the use of technologies to provide rehabilitation services to people in their homes. Considering the need for long-term follow-up care for people with hip fracture, in-home telerehabilitation could increase independence, decrease hospital stays and reduce the burden for caregivers. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention program based on telerehabilitation on activities of daily living (ADL), quality of life (QOL), depression and burden on caregivers compared to face-to-face home visits and usual care of community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture.Methods/designThis will be a three-armed randomized control trial (RCT) including pre/post intervention and follow-up. The trial will include 90 older people with hip fractures who will be randomly assigned to a telerehabilitation group (N=30), face-to-face visits (N=30) and a control group. The aim of the intervention is to improve the transition from rehabilitation units to community dwelling. It will include 10 videoconferencing/ face-to-face sessions from an occupational therapist in the presence of the primary caregiver. Each session will be utilized to guide the participants to achieve their self-identified goals, focusing on problem-solving for daily life situations and on the ability to implement the discussed strategies for a variety of activities. Outcome measures include Functional Independence Measure (FIM) for evaluation of ADL, SF-12 for evaluation of Health-related QOL, The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and The Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale. Data will be analyzed using Repeated measures MANOVA.DiscussionThe current study will enable the cost-effectiveness examination of a suggested rehabilitation service based on available technology. The proposed intervention will increase accessibility of in-home rehabilitation services, improve function and health, and reduce economic burden.Trial registrationNCT03376750 (12/15/2017).;2019;4
BackgroundProgressive cerebellar ataxia is a neurodegenerative disorder without effective treatment options that seriously hinders quality of life. Previously, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been demonstrated to benefit cerebellar functions (including improved motor control, learning and emotional processing) in healthy individuals and patients with neurological disorders. While tDCS is an emerging therapy, multiple daily sessions are neededfor optimal clinical benefit. This case study tests the symptomatic benefit of remotely supervised tDCS (RS-tDCS) for a patient with cerebellar ataxia.MethodsWe report a case of a 71-year-old female patient with progressive cerebellar ataxia, who presented with unsteady gait and balance impairment, treated with tDCS. tDCS was administered using our RS-tDCS protocol and was completed daily in the patient's home (Monday - Friday) with the help of a trained study technician. tDCS was paired with 20min of simultaneous cognitive training, followed by 20min of physical exercises directed by a physical therapist. Stimulation consisted of 20min of 2.5mA direct current targeting the cerebellum via an anodal electrode and a cathodal electrode placed over the right shoulder. The patient completed baseline and treatment end visits with neurological, cognitive, and motor (Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test, 25ft walk test and Timed Up and Go Test) assessments.ResultsThe patient successfully completed sixty tDCS sessions, 59 of which were administered remotely at the patient's home with the use of real time supervision as enabled by video conferencing. Mild improvement was observed in the patient's gait with a 7% improvement in walking speed, which she completed without a walking-aid at treatment end, which was in stark contrast to her baseline assessment. Improvements were also achieved in manual dexterity, with an increase in pegboard scores bilaterally compared to baseline.ConclusionsResults from this case report suggest that consecutively administered tDCS treatments paired with cognitive and physical exercise hold promise for improving balance, gait, and manual dexterity in patients with progressive ataxia. Remotely supervised tDCS provides home access to enable the administration over an extended period. Further controlled study in a large group of those with cerebellar ataxia is needed to replicate these findings.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03049969.

BackgroundThe prevalence of stroke in Uganda is increasing. In stroke rehabilitation, information and communication technology has been shown to have potential in improving service delivery in high-income countries but there is limited knowledge of its use and impact in low-income countries.The aim of the study was to evaluate the implementation process of a mobile phone-supported family-centred rehabilitation intervention and to gain knowledge on the mechanisms of impact as well as the contextual factors that might have affected the implementation process and its outcome.MethodThis was a single-case study design using the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework and the Medical Research Council guidance as frameworks. Quantitative process data was derived from 14 log books used by occupational therapists during the implementation. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 implementers in different professions, 12months into the implementation, in order to obtain the primary data. Secondary data was derived from six semi-structured interviews conducted directly after pre-intervention workshops and 6 months later. The framework method was used in the data analysis.ResultsIn 11 out of 14 cases, the clients were compliant with the intervention. Yet, challenges such as technical problems were reported. The target of conducting 16 phone calls for each client was achieved to 74%. Eight categories emerged from the qualitative analysis of the interviews including: 1) perceptions on facilitation, 2) using scientific and experience-based knowledge, 3) tailoring the intervention, 4) supportive working culture, 5) barriers to the service delivery, 6) implementers' interaction with the intervention, 7) perceptions on motivations and values, and 8) improving the model and enabling sustainability. Mechanisms contributing to the implementation of the intervention included engaged facilitators and motivated participants. Challenges in the client recruitment and poor information dissemination were some of the mechanisms impeding the implementation.ConclusionsThe intervention was partially delivered in accordance with the logic model for the project, where the implementation process was influenced by several barriers in the context such as technical setbacks. However, there were also several mediators in the process driving the project forward, including strong facilitation and motivated participants.;2019;4
"BackgroundVirtual reality training (VRT) uses computer software to track a user's movements and allow him or her to interact with a game presented on a television screen. VRT is increasingly being used for the rehabilitation of arm function, balance and walking after stroke. Patients often require ongoing therapy post discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Outpatient therapy may be limited or inaccessible due to waiting lists, transportation issues, distance etc.; therefore, home-based VRT could provide the required therapy in a more convenient and accessible setting. The objectives of this parallel randomized feasibility trial are to determine (1) the feasibility of using VRT in the home post stroke and (2) the feasibility of a battery of quantitative and qualitative outcome measures of stroke recovery.MethodsForty patients who can stand for at least 2 min and are soon to be discharged from inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation post stroke are being recruited in Ottawa, Canada and being randomized to control and experimental groups. Participants in the experimental group use home-based VRT to do rehabilitative exercises for standing balance, stepping, reaching, strengthening and gentle aerobic fitness. Control group participants use an iPad with apps selected to rehabilitate cognition, hand fine motor skills and visual tracking/scanning. Both groups are instructed to perform 30min of exercise 5days a week for 6weeks. VRT intensity and difficulty are monitored and adjusted remotely. Weekly telephone contact is made with all participants. Ability to recruit participants, ability to handle the technology and learn the activities, compliance, safety, enjoyment, perceived efficacy and cost of program delivery will be assessed. A battery of assessments of standing balance, gait and community integration will be assessed for feasibility of completion within this population and potential for improvement following the intervention. Effect sizes will be calculated.DiscussionThe results of this study will be used to support the creation of a definitive randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of home-based VRT for rehabilitation post stroke.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03261713. Registered on 21 August 2017. Registration amended on 1 June 2018 to decrease enrollment from 40 to 20 due to a cut in study funding and difficulty recruiting participants.";2019;4
BackgroundWe present a robot-assisted telerehabilitation system that allows for haptic interaction between therapist and patient over distance. It consists of two arm therapy robots. Attached to one robot the therapists can feel on their own arm the limitations of the patient's arm which is attached to the other robot. Due to the exoskeleton structure of the robot, movements can be performed in the three-dimensional space.MethodsFifteen physical and occupational therapists tested this strategy, named Beam-Me-In, while using an exoskeleton robot connected to a second exoskeleton robot in the same room used by the study experimenter. Furthermore, the therapists assessed the level of impairment of recorded and simulated arm movements. They quantified four typical impairments of stroke patients: reduced range of motion (active and passive), resistance to passive movement, a lack of ability to fractionate a movement, and disturbed quality of movement.ResultsOn a Likert Scale (0 to 5 points) therapists rated the Beam-Me-In strategy as a very useful medium (mode: 4 points) to evaluate a patient's progress over time. The passive range of motion of the elbow joint was assessed with a mean absolute error of 4.9 degrees (absolute precision error: 6.4 degrees). The active range of motion of the elbow was assessed with a mean absolute error of 4.9 degrees (absolute precision error: 6.5 degrees). The resistance to passive movement (i.e. modified Tardieu Scale) and the lack of ability to fractionate a movement (i.e. quantification of pathological muscle synergies) was assessed with an inter-rater reliability of 0.930 and 0.948, respectively.ConclusionsThe Beam-Me-In strategy is a promising approach to complement robot-assisted movement training. It can serve as a platform to assess and identify abnormal movement patterns in patients. This is the first application of remote three-dimensional haptic assessmen t applied to telerehabilitation. Furthermore, the Beam-Me-In strategy has a potential to overcome barriers for therapists regarding robot-assisted telerehabilitation.;2019;4
Because medical professionals lack the means to monitor exercises performed by patients in their home environment directly, there is a strong case for introducing technological solutions into this domain. They include methods that use wireless inertial sensors, which emit signals recorded and processed by special applications that work with mobile devices. This paper's aim is (a) to evaluate whether such sensors are suitable for qualitative and quantitative motion analysis, and (b) to determine the repeatability of results over a few recordings. Knee joint activity was analysed using a system of inertial sensors connected through a Wi-Fi network to mobile devices. The tested individuals did eight different activities, all of which engaged the knee joint. Each excercise was repeated three times. Study results did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the three measurements for most of the studied parameters. Furthermore, in almost every case, there were no statistically significant differences between the results of the right and left lower limb (p > 0.05). This study shows that easy use and repeatability of results combined with the feature of quantitative and qualitative analysis make the examined method useful for functional evaluations of the knee joint.;2019;4
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) imposes a huge burden to our healthcare systems and societies. To alleviate the burden, digital health-the use of digital technologies for health- has been recognized as a potential solution for improving COPD care at scale. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of digital health interventions in COPD care. We accordingly reviewed recent and emerging evidence on digital transformation approaches for COPD care focusing on (I) self-management, (II) in-hospital care, (III) post-discharge care, (IV) hospital-at-home, (V) ambient environment, and (VI) public health surveillance. The emerging approaches included digital-technology-enabled homecare programs, electronic records, big data analytics, and environment-monitoring applications. The digital health approaches of telemonitoring, telehealth and health support the self-management, post-discharge care, and hospital-at-home strategy, with prospective effects on reducing acute COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations. Electronic records and classification tools have been implemented; and their effectiveness needs to be further evaluated in future studies. Air pollution concentrations in the ambient environment are associated with declined lung functions and increased risks for hospitalization and mortality. In all the digital transformation approaches, clinical evidence on reducing mortality, the ultimate goal of digital health intervention, is often inconsistent or insufficient. Digital health transformation provides great opportunities for clinical innovations and discovery of new intervention strategies. Further research remains needed for achieving reliable improvements in clinical outcomes and cost-benefits in future studies.";2019;4
Compared to in-clinic balance training, in-home training is not as effective. This is, in part, due to the lack of feedback from physical therapists (PTs). In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of using trunk sway data and machine learning (ML) techniques to automatically evaluate balance, providing accurate assessments outside of the clinic. We recruited sixteen participants to perform standing balance exercises. For each exercise, we recorded trunk sway data and had a PT rate balance performance on a scale of 1-5. The rating scale was adapted from the Functional Independence Measure. From the trunk sway data, we extracted a 61-dimensional feature vector representing the performance of each exercise. Given these labeled data, we trained a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) to map trunk sway features to PT ratings. Evaluated in a leave-one-participant-out scheme, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 82%. Compared to participant self-assessment ratings, the SVM outputs were significantly closer to PT ratings. The results of this pilot study suggest that in the absence of PTs, ML techniques can provide accurate assessments during standing balance exercises. Such automated assessments could reduce PT consultation time and increase user compliance outside of the clinic.;2019;4
Despite proven efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in reducing the all-cause mortality in patients after myocardial revascularization, the penetration of CR, due to patient-related factors and referral rates remains limited. To improve the outcomes, home-based tele-rehabilitation (TR) has been proposed recently. In theory TR enhances the effects of standard CR procedures due to implementation of an intelligent monitoring system designed to ensure optimal training through on-demand transmission of vital signs, aimed at motivating the patients through daily schedule reminders, setting daily goals and creating a platform for mutual feedback. Several meta-analyses assessing various studies comparing these two methods (CR and TR) have proven that they are at least equally effective, with some of the research showing superiority of TR. Although there was a small sample size, lack of long-term follow-up, reporting effects of TR itself, no integration with tools designed for coaching motivating and promoting a healthy lifestyle constitutes an important limitation. The latter carries a hopeful prognosis for improvement when utilizing a broad-spectrum approach, especially with use of dedicated technological solutions exploiting the fact of a large and yet rapidly increasing penetration of smartphones, mobile PCs and tablets in the population. The above-mentioned findings worked as the basis and rationale for commencing the RESTORE project aimed at developing and delivering state-of-the-art, comprehensive TR for patients after myocardial revascularization and evaluating its molecular aspect in view of how it influences the atherosclerosis progression attenuation. This paper presents the current state and rationale behind the project based on up-to-date TR efficacy data.;2019;4
"Despite the evidence that cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reduces the risk of recurrent cardiac events, only a minority of eligible patients are willing to join existing programs at cardiac rehabilitation centers. The unique remote patient monitoring system presented here enables healthcare providers to monitor CR patients at home in real-time and at low cost. The system combines mobile technology, artificial intelligence, and supportive services, expanding the delivery of medical care to the patient's home. The primary aim of the study is to increase the long-term adherence to physical activity in patients who participate in CR via the addition of a home-based digitally monitored CR component to the standard CR program in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), with the idea of forming new habitual health behaviors and increasing the long-term motivation for physical exercise (PE) habits at home. Secondary aims are to assess the program's impact on the physical activity level measured by average steps per day, minutes of exercise per week, blood pressure, metabolic parameters, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio, as well as a quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaire. The study has two arms: (1) home-based monitored exercise using a smart digital garment and wristband, in addition to motivation and reinforcement via text messages; (2) standard CR facility-based exercise. The study design is a randomized, controlled trial comparing standard CR to a home-based monitoring and reinforcement program. The study program is designed for 12 weeks. Clinical tests and anthropometric measurements are performed before and after the study, measuring height, weight, waist circumference, visceral fat and body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and HbA1c and lipid profile. Patients have to complete a baseline survey including socio-demographic characteristics and QoL questionnaire SF-36. At the end of the study, patients complete a survey regarding the use of the smart digital garment's benefits and usability. The study is currently underway.";2019;4
During the last years, the significant increase in the number of patients in need of rehabilitation has generated an unsustainable economic impact on healthcare systems, implying a reduction in therapeutic supervision and support for each patient. To address this problem, this paper proposes a telerehabilitation system based on serious games and in-cloud data analytics services, in accordance with Industry 4.0 design principles regarding modularity, service orientation, decentralization, virtualization, and real-time capability. The system, specialized for post-stroke patients, comprises components for real-time acquisition of patient's motor data and a decision support service for their analysis. Raw data, reports, and recommendations are made available on the cloud to clinical operators to remotely assess rehabilitation outcomes and dynamically improve therapies. Furthermore, the results of a pilot study on the clinical impact deriving from the adoption of the proposed solution, and of a qualitative analysis about its acceptance, are presented and discussed.;2019;4
Earlier rehabilitation interventions, like community-based rehabilitation (CBR), could not make a remarkable impact because they ran parallel to the health system, but the newer model establishes health-related rehabilitation as an integral part of the health care system at all levels and thus should be implemented as such. Collaborating with other players relevant to the CBR matrix, such as social and vocational services, can be imparted for the empowerment of a disabled group at the village level through the CBR center. A multipurpose rehabilitation worker, through skill transfer or task shifting, can start rehabilitation at the primary health center.;2019;4
Evidence of personal and health-system benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation are undeniable. However, the capacity of traditional centre-based models to both reach and appeal to the intended population of people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains difficult. it is well established that issues with access, suitability, referral, uptake, and attrition exist. Consequently, considerable energy has been invested into exploring innovative alternative modes of rehabilitation in an effort to increase the awareness and appeal, and expand the availability of pulmonary rehabilitation. The process of 'thinking differently' and 'pushing the boundaries' of clinical practice is underway, particularly in the United Kingdom and Australia, where new models of pulmonary rehabilitation are being evaluated. The number one priority is reaching the population of people with COPD and ensuring they are referred to rehabilitation services. Active case-finding in primary care, inviting health professionals and health consumers to pulmonary rehabilitation programs to increase understanding and awareness, and utilizing peer support via patient success stories, are just a few suggestions for increasing awareness of pulmonary rehabilitation. Once referred, engaging the population to complete a program is the next challenge. Marketing, patient co-design, alternative rehabilitation settings and modes of exercise training, use of technology, and focusing on modes which provide patient enjoyment and choice are all potential strategies to target in an effort to broaden the appeal and reduce the high attrition rate of traditional centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Reaching and engaging the target population in pulmonary rehabilitation is an important first step in people with COPD achieving successful outcomes from rehabilitation.;2019;4
Frozen shoulder is a common clinical shoulder condition. Measuring the degree of shoulder joint movement is crucial to the rehabilitation process. Such measurements can be used to evaluate the severity of patients' condition, establish rehabilitation goals and appropriate activity difficulty levels, and understand the effects of rehabilitation. Currently, measurements of the shoulder joint movement degree are typically conducted by therapists using a protractor. However, along with the growth of telerehabilitation, measuring the shoulder joint mobility on patients' own at home will be needed. In this study, wireless inertial sensors were combined with the virtual reality interactive technology to provide an innovative shoulder joint mobility self-measurement system that can enable patients to measure their performance of four shoulder joint movements on their own at home. Pilot clinical trials were conducted with 25 patients to confirm the feasibility of the system. In addition, the results of correlation and differential analyses compared with the results of traditional measurement methods exhibited a high correlation, verifying the accuracy of the proposed system. Moreover, according to interviews with patients, they are confident in their ability to measure shoulder joint mobility themselves.;2019;4
Home-based tele-rehabilitation programs are under development and may be a future option for some patients. The objectives of this non-randomized clinical trial are to design a home-based multidisciplinary tele-rehabilitation protocol for patients with hip fracture, and to compare this protocol versus the home-based usual outpatient rehabilitation protocol. Seventy patients treated for an acute hip fracture, aged 65 years or older, with a high pre-fracture functional level (Functional Independence Measure score >90), without severe cognitive impairment, absence of terminal disease, discharged to their own home or a relatives home postoperatively, allowed weight-bearing, and with signed informed consent, will be allocated into a tele-rehabilitation group (n = 35) or a control group (n = 35). The inclusion criterion for the intervention group will be to have a caregiver with the ability to access the Internet who is willing to perform exercises and activities with the patient at home. The intervention includes a program of physical exercise and occupational therapy (five weekly sessions during 12 weeks), and recommendations for patients and their caregivers, all delivered through a website. The patient's functional level (Functional Independence Measure), quality of life (Euro-Qol), physical performance (Timed Up and Go), caregiver burden (Zarit Interview), and other descriptive data will be assessed at hospital discharge, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. This project will add to the knowledge concerning the feasibility of tele-rehabilitation as an option to promote recovery of the pre-fracture functional level for some patients with a hip fracture.

Human joint moment plays an important role in quantitative rehabilitation assessment and exoskeleton robot control. However, the existing moment prediction methods require kinematic and kinetic data of human body as input, and the measurement of them needs special equipment, which makes them unable to be used in an unconstrained environment. According to the situation, this paper develops a novel method where a small number of input variables selected by Elastic Net are used as the input of artificial neural network (ANN) to predict joint moments, which makes the prediction in daily life possible. The method is tested on the experimental data collected from eight healthy subjects that are running on a treadmill at a speed of 2, 3, 4, and 5 m/s, respectively. Taking the right lower limb's 10 electromyography (EMG) and 5 joints angle data as candidate variable sets, Elastic Net is used to obtain the variable coefficients of the right lower limb's four joint moments. The inputs of the ANN determined by the variable coefficients are used to train and predict the joint moments. Prediction accuracy is evaluated by using the normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE %) and cross correlation coefficient (rho) between the predicted joint moment and multi-body dynamics moment. Results of our study suggest that the method can accurately predict joint moment (NRMSE < 7.89%, rho > 0.9633) with only 5-6 EMG signals. In conclusion, this method can effectively reduce the input variables while keeping a certain precision, which makes the joint moment prediction simple and out of equipment limitation. This method may facilitate the researches on real-time gait analysis and exoskeleton robot control in motor rehabilitation.;2019;4
"IMPORTANCE Most patients with advanced-stage cancer develop functional losses that jeopardize their independence. pairment and pain-driven OBJECTIVE To determine whether collaborative telerehabilitation and pharmacological pain management improve function, lessen pain, and reduce requirements for inpatient care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS The Collaborative Care to Preserve Performance in Cancer (COPE) study was a 3-arm randomized clinical trial conducted at 3 academic medical centers within 1 health care system. Patient recruitment began in March 2013 and follow-up concluded in October 2016. Participants (N = 516) were low-level community or household ambulators with stage IIIC or IV solid or hematologic cancer. INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to the (1) control arm, (2) telerehabilitation arm, or (3) telerehabilitation with pharmacological pain management arm. All patients underwent automated function and pain monitoring with data reporting to their care teams. Participants in arms 2 and 3 received 6 months of centralized telerehabilitation provided by a physical therapist-physician team. Those in arm 3 also received nurse-coordinated pharmacological pain management. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Blinded assessment of function using the Activity Measure for Postacute Care computer adaptive test, pain interference and average intensity using the Brief Pain Inventory, and quality of life using the EQ-5D-3L was performed at baseline and months 3 and 6. Hospitalizations and discharges to postacute care facilities were recorded. RESULTS The study included 516 participants (257 women and 259 men; mean [SD] age, 65.6 [11.1] years), with 172 randomized to 1 of 3 arms. Compared with the control group, the telerehabilitation arm 2 had improved function (difference, 1.3; 95% Cl, 0.08-2.35; P =.03) and quality of life (difference, 0.04; 95% Cl, 0.004-0.071; P =.01), while both telerehabilitation arms 2 and 3 had reduced pain interference (arm 2,-0.4; 95% Cl,-0.78 to - 0.09; P =.01 and arm 3,-0.4; 95% CI,-0.79 to-0.10; P =.01), and average intensity (arm 2, - 0.4; 95% CI,-0.78 to-0.07; P =.02 and arm 3,-0.5; 95% CI,-0.84 to-0.11; P =.006). Telerehabilitation was associated with higher odds of home discharge in arms 2 (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% CI, 1.3-14.3; P =.02) and 3 (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.1-12.4; P =.03) and fewer days in the hospital in arm 2 (difference,-3.9 days; 95% CI,-2.4 to-4.6; P =.01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Collaborative telerehabilitation modestly improved function and pain, while decreasing hospital length of stay and the requirement for postacute care, but these outcomes were not enhanced with the addition of pharmacological pain management.";2019;4
"IMPORTANCE Recent publication of the largest trials to date investigating rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) necessitate an updated evidence review. OBJECTIVE To determine whether inpatient or clinic-based rehabilitation is associated with superior function and pain outcomes after TKA compared with any home-based program. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PubMed were searched from inception to November 5, 2018. Search terms included knee arthroplasty, randomized controlled trial, physiotherapy, and rehabilitation. STUDY SELECTION Published randomized clinical trials of adults who underwent primary unilateral TKA and commenced rehabilitation within 6 postoperative weeks in which those receiving postacute inpatient or clinic-based rehabilitation were compared with those receiving a home-based program. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers extracted data independently and assessed data quality and validity according to the PRISMA guidelines. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Data were analyzed from June 1, 2015, through June 4, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were mobility (6-minute walk test [6MWT]) and patient-reported pain and function (Oxford knee score [OKS] or Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) reported at 10 to 12 postoperative weeks. The GRADE assessment (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) was applied to the primary outcomes. RESULTS Five unique studies involving 752 unique participants (451 [60%] female; mean [SD] age, 68.3 [8.5] years) compared clinic- and home-based rehabilitation, and 1 study involving 165 participants (112 [68%] female; mean [SD] age, 66.9 [8.0] years) compared inpatient and home-based rehabilitation. Low-quality evidence showed no clinically important difference between clinic- and home-based programs for mobility at 10 weeks (6MWT favoring home program; mean difference [MD], -11.89 m [95% CI, -35.94 to 12.16 m]) and 52 weeks (6MWT favoring home program; MD, -25.37 m [95% CI, -47.41 to -3.32 m]). Moderate-quality evidence showed no clinically important difference between clinic- and home-based programs for patient-reported pain and function at 10 weeks (OKS MD, -0.15 [95% CI, -0.35 to 0.05]) and 52 weeks (OKS MD, 0.10 [95% CI, -0.14 to 0.34]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, no superiority of clinic-based or inpatient programs compared with home-based programs was found in the early subacute period after TKA. This evidence suggests that home-based rehabilitation is an appropriate first line of therapy after uncomplicated TKA for patients with adequate social supports.";2019;4
Importance: Along with growth in telerehabilitation, a concurrent need has arisen for standardized methods of tele-evaluation. Objective: To examine the feasibility of using the Kinect sensor in an objective, computerized clinical assessment of upper limb motor categories. Design: We developed a computerized Mallet classification using the Kinect sensor. Accuracy of computer scoring was assessed on the basis of reference scores determined collaboratively by multiple evaluators from reviewing video recording of movements. In addition, using the reference score, we assessed the accuracy of the typical clinical procedure in which scores were determined immediately on the basis of visual observation. The accuracy of the computer scores was compared with that of the typical clinical procedure. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: Seven patients with stroke and 10 healthy adult participants. Healthy participants intentionally achieved predetermined scores. Outcomes and Measures: Accuracy of the computer scores in comparison with accuracy of the typical clinical procedure (immediate visual assessment). Results: The computerized assessment placed participants' upper limb movements in motor categories as accurately as did typical clinical procedures. Conclusions and Relevance: Computerized clinical assessment using the Kinect sensor promises to facilitate tele-evaluation and complement telehealth applications. What This Article Adds: Computerized clinical assessment can enable patients to conduct evaluations remotely in their homes without therapists present.;2019;4
In neuro-motion rehabilitation it is important for the subjects to plan a neural and motion rehabilitation program at home. Telerehabilitation could represent a valid aid for subjects involved in a rehabilitation process at home. Motion and neural rehabilitation are strictly correlated. Prompt motion rehabilitation is essential to ensure good recovery performance. Remote therapy, which involves a tele-rehabilitation program, should monitor daily motion activity. The integration of step-counters in the process could improve the care, providing daily quantitative measurements. Three different step counters (a) have been proposed and (b) integrated in a kit (c) with a study aimed at designing a guideline for the optimal assignment on the basis of the pathology.;2019;4
In persons with haemophilia (PWH), the importance of comprehensive disease management to prevent bleeding, joint damage and secondary diseases has been well established. However, because haemophilia is a chronic disease, intervention programmes carried out for prolonged periods of time may create problems of patient adherence. Driven by continuous technological innovation, telemedicine is being increasingly proposed as a way to provide PWH with a range of services designed to improve their health, saving the time and cost involved in going to the treatment centre, and increasing therapeutic adherence. The aim of this article is to identify and discuss the tools available for the management of PWH by means of telemedicine and infonnation technology. Video conferences are helpful to obtain a rapid evaluation at a distance of the occurrence and severity of bleeding episodes by the personnel of the treatment centre. Cell phones and associated applications (apps) help to improve the regular implementation of replacement therapy and monitor any ensuing adverse effect. Portable sensors help to improve lifestyle and to monitor the degree of physical activity through the fulfilment of a given number of daily walking steps and other physical activities. In the context of telerehabilitation, exergames have the potential to improve the musculoskeletal function of PWH by exploiting the recreational features of videogames. Thus, telemedicine and its multiple applications may be useful in the management of haemophilia, especially for patients living far from specialised centres. However, since this is a recent and rapidly evolving field, published studies are few and have, so far, involved only a limited number of cases. Therefore, additional evidence needs to be obtained by means of accrual of cumulative data from multiple centres specialised in haemophilia.;2019;4
In the latest years at-home autonomous rehabilitation platforms have grown in popularity. Some of them allow patients to recover from their physical damages by playing exer-games, which are more enjoyable than classic rehabilitation. One of the main problems of this approach is the repetitive structure of the exer-games, since rehabilitation requires intensive training each day and patients could lose motivation if they are not enough entertained. We describe here few methods we recently implemented that can be used alongside with exer-games to make the platform more compelling and entertain the patient during the day-by-day rehabilitation cycle without losing motivation.;2019;4
"In the recent years, software applications for medical assistance, including the tele-rehabilitation, have known a high and continuous presence in the medical field. Guaranteeing the correct use of these applications induces to incorporate a study of usability in the life cycle of any interactive system. This paper synthesizes the results obtained from a study of effectiveness, efficiency, and subjective user satisfaction conducted with ePHoRt. ePHoRt is a web-based platform for home motor rehabilitation; 39 participants tested the platform. We report the empirical results based on the subjective usability perception and self-reported feedback based on the IBM Computer System Usability Questionnaire. The results suggest that ePHoRt is useful, effective, efficient, easy to use, and its interfaces are acceptable. Overall, the participants are satisfied to use the platform. The main findings of this paper show that the user guidance is a critical aspect to ensure a good usability of the tele-rehabilitation platform.";2019;4
In this paper, an IoT-based knee functional rehabilitation smart system is proposed. This system aims to reduce patient mobility to attend the rehabilitation session, in order to achieve good accessibility and proper management of transport, improving thus smart cities' characteristics in terms of smart living, smart mobility, and smart healthcare. The architectural model of the proposed system is designed in a manner to ensure the telemonitoring function of the rehabilitation process, and the remote access to feedback information for both the practitioners and patients. It consists of three main components: measurement instrumentation, processing and transmission unit, and cloud data storage and visualization. Furthermore, the results obtained in the experimental test showed that measurements error percentages were lower than 2%, and the data displayed in the cloud are significant, indicating that the accuracy and reliability of the developed system are satisfactory, as well as telerehabilitation engineering has prospects in Inclusive smart city applications.;2019;4
"In this paper, we present MyoTrack, a realtime classification procedure that identifies levels of subject participation during robot-assisted rehabilitation using a wearable surface electromyography (sEMG) Myo armband. We hypothesize, test, and prove that high sEMG correlates with high participation and vice versa. We then use Myo's inertial measurement unit to extract the subject's hand trajectory during the rehabilitation task. Comparing this hand trajectory with the ground-truth robot trajectory enables us to identify whether any high muscle activity corresponds to the active participation of the subject in robotic therapy or not (random gestures and motions). Since the robotic assistance implemented in this paper can autonomously complete the therapy task without any subject participation; it is crucial to identify the patient's participation level in realtime and develop a suitable intervention strategy. Using 15 healthy subjects, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology of combining sEMG activation and robot-hand trajectory matching is a reliable indicator of subject participation with a realtime accuracy of 91.45%. We also present a realtime application that uses MyoTrack in the back-end to identify the realtime participation of a subject and intervene accordingly.";2019;4
"In this paper, we present MyoTrack, a two-step classification routine that uses a wearable surface electromyography (sEMG) sensor to identify the level of subject participation during robot assisted rehabilitation. In the first step, we use sEMG activation as a measure of patient participation; stating that, high sEMG correlates with high participation. We then extract the subject's hand trajectory using the Myo's inertial measurement unit. The hand trajectory is compared with the robot's trajectory to identify whether the high muscle activity observed is due to the active participation of the subject in therapy or due to random gestures and motions. As the robot assistance considered in this paper can autonomously complete the therapy task without any subject participation, it is crucial to identify this participation level. We demonstrate that high muscle activation along with high similarity between the hand and robot end-effector trajectory is a reliable indicator of subject participation with an accuracy >90% for the cases considered.";2019;4
Introducing innovations such as telerehabilitation (TR) into routine care involves complex changes in organizations. This study protocol aims to (1) examine the extent to which a TR platform was implemented as intended in three clinical settings and (2) identify which TR activities were becoming integrated into routine clinical practices, and which factors affect the routine use of the platform. A mixed-method prospective single-case study design with multiple embedded units of analysis will be used. Pre/post-implementation data collection will focus on implementation leaders, clinical champions, upper management, and clinical staff. Qualitative data include semistructured individual interviews with leaders, champions, and upper management as well as focus groups with clinical staff who are users and non-users of the TR platform. Quantitative data include TR use data and TR implementation questionnaires. The consolidated framework for implementation research will be used to analyze the implementation process and normalization process theory will be used to analyze the embedding of TR in routine daily practice. The project is expected to yield evidence regarding which specific TR activities are implemented in day-to-day clinical activities as well as capture threats and opportunities to normalization at a critical moment when it is expected to occur.;2019;4
"Introduction A recent trend in low vision (LV) has been towards the use of portable head-mounted displays (HMDs) to enhance residual vision. The decision process around the (non-)use of such devices have been identified as multifactorial. Among important barriers identified in the context of magnifying LV aids were transportation issues and insufficient training. In recent years, telerehabilitation has become of growing interest in healthcare because it allows individuals to remain at home while receiving rehabilitation services. A recent pilot study indicated encouraging outcomes; however, very few applications of telerehabilitation for LV have been tested systematically. Methods and analysis To help guide evidence-based practice recommendations for this modality, we will carry out a feasibility study to assess the recruitment, retention, accessibility and acceptability of an eventual fully randomised trial of telerehabilitation for people with LV using HMDs. We will recruit 60 participants aged 18+ years among prospective eSight Eyewear owners, randomised 1:1 into two parallel groups. The active intervention will be the telerehabilitation operated by a LV therapist; the control arm will be the current self-training standard provided by the device vendor. The primary feasibility outcome measures will be: time to recruit participants, loss to follow-up, accessibility and acceptability of the telerehabilitation (satisfaction of the users and LV therapist). Exploratory outcomes will be the impact of telerehabilitation on eSight Eyewear use behaviour (discontinuance rate), and validated measures of assistive-technology-related quality of life. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire en Readaptation de Montreal metropolitain (CRIR# 1286-1217). Dissemination is planned via local, national and international healthcare conferences and peer-reviewed journal publications.";2019;4
Introduction Given the limited effectiveness of pharmacological treatments, non-pharmacological interventions in neurodegenerative diseases have gained increasing attention in recent years and telerehabilitation has been proposed as a cognitive rehabilitation strategy. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the evidence for the efficacy of cognitive telerehabilitation interventions compared with face-to-face rehabilitation in patients with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Methods In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search of the Medline database was conducted. Out of 14 articles assessed for eligibility, five studies were identified, three in participants with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, two in patients with primary progressive aphasia. Results The Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale was used to assess the methodological quality of four out of five studies included in this systematic review, with only one report receiving a high-quality rating. Effect-size analysis evidenced positive effects of telerehabilitation interventions, comparable with those reported for face-to-face rehabilitation. Discussion The available evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive telerehabilitation is limited, and the quality of the evidence needs to be improved. The systematic review provides preliminary evidence suggesting that cognitive telerehabilitation for neurodegenerative disease may have comparable effects as conventional in-person cognitive rehabilitation.;2019;4
"Introduction Home assessments conducted by occupational therapists can identify hazards and prevent falls. However, they may not be conducted because of limited time or long distances between the therapist's workplace and the person's home. Developments in technologies may overcome such barriers and could improve the quality of the home assessment process. Method This scoping review synthesises the findings of studies evaluating information and communication technology use within occupational therapy home assessments. Results Fourteen studies were included and revealed the two main approaches to technology use: the development of new applications and the use of existing and readily available technologies. Facilitators and barriers to use were also identified. Facilitators included usefulness, ease of use and the potential for cost-effectiveness. Barriers to use included poor usability, unsuitability for some populations and perceived threat to the role of occupational therapy. The synthesis revealed that traditional in-home assessments conducted by therapists are more sensitive in identifying hazards. Conclusion The availability of new technologies offers potential to improve service delivery; however these technologies are underutilised in clinical practice. Technologies may offer advantages in the conduct of home assessments, especially regarding efficiency, but have not yet been shown to be superior in terms of patient outcome.";2019;4
"Introduction Increasing physical activity reduces secondary stroke risk factors, but many stroke survivors have low levels of physical activity. Supervised exercise delivered via telehealth has the potential to overcome barriers to increased physical activity in stroke survivors. Our scoping review will examine the emerging field of supervised exercise delivered via telehealth to map the available evidence in relation to its efficacy, acceptability, safety and feasibility in chronic conditions to inform future research into its ability to increase physical activity. Methods and analysis The methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley will be applied to our scoping review. A systematic search of Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane, Pedro and Embase; hand searching of pertinent studies' reference lists; and consultation with experts in the field will identify relevant papers. Studies involving participants with a chronic condition who undertake supervised exercise delivered by a health professional via telehealth targeted at improving secondary stroke risk factors or involving lower limb weight-bearing exercise will be included. Study selection and critical appraisal of individual studies will be carried out independently by two authors with discrepancies resolved by a third author. Quantitative and qualitative data will be charted using a standardised form. Results will be tabulated and narratively summarised to highlight findings relevant to the review's research questions and to inform recommendations for future research. Ethics and dissemination Our review will significantly contribute to the knowledge base of exercise and rehabilitation delivered via telehealth and its application in chronic conditions, including stroke. Findings will be relevant to researchers, healthcare workers and policy-makers and will be disseminated through publication and presentations. Only secondary deidentified data will be included, therefore ethics approval will not be sought. This protocol is not registered as PROSPERO currently excludes scoping reviews.";2019;4
Introduction Stroke survivors frequently experience a range of post-stroke deficits. Specialized stroke rehabilitation improves recovery, especially if it is started early post-stroke. However, resource limitations often preclude early rehabilitation. Mobile technologies may provide a platform for stroke survivors to begin recovery when they might not be able to otherwise. The study objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of RecoverNow, a tablet-based stroke recovery platform aimed at delivering speech and cognitive therapy. Methods We recruited a convenience sample of 30 acute stroke patients to use RecoverNow for up to 3 months. Allied health professionals assigned specific applications based on standard of care assessments. Participants were encouraged to take home the RecoverNow tablets upon discharge from acute care. The study team contacted participants to return for a follow-up interview 3 months after enrollment. The primary outcome of interest was feasibility, defined using 5 facets: recruitment rate, adherence rate, retention rate, the proportion of successful follow-up interventions, and protocol deviations. We tracked barriers to tablet-based care as a secondary outcome. Results We successfully recruited 30 of 62 eligible patients in 15 weeks (48% recruitment rate). Participants were non-adherent to tablet-based therapy inside and outside of acute care, using RecoverNow for a median of 12 minutes a day. Retention was high with 23 of 30 patients participating in follow-up interviews (77% retention rate) and all but 3 of the 23 interviews (87%) were successfully completed. Only 2 major protocol deviations occurred: one enrollment failure and one therapy protocol violation. Barriers to tablet-based care were frequently encountered by study participants with many expressing the assigned applications were either too easy or too difficult. Conclusions Acute stroke patients are interested in attempting tablet-based stroke rehabilitation and are easily recruited early post-stroke. However, tablet-based therapy may be challenging due to patient, device and system-related barriers. Reducing the frequency of common barriers will be essential to keeping patients engaged in tablet-based therapy.;2019;4
"Introduction Telehealth interventions have the potential of improving exacerbation and health outcomes for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), by delivering care in between clinical visits. However, the precise impact on avoiding exacerbation and reducing the incidence of hospital readmissions remains inconclusive. This lack of knowledge on the effectiveness of telehealth for COPD care might be due to non-adherence or partial adherence to intervention programmes and/ or the withdrawal of participants over the course of previous studies. Objectives To conduct a systematic review of trials of telehealth interventions (including randomised control trials (RCT), crossover and pre-post studies) to: (1) estimate the acceptance, adherence and dropout rates; (2) identify the reasons for dropout from telehealth interventions among individuals with COPD; (3) evaluate the impact of trialrelated, sociodemographic and intervention-related factors on the acceptance, adherence and dropout rates and (4) estimate the extent to which the acceptance, adherence and dropout rates impact outcomes in comparison with usual monitoring. Methods and analysis A systematic literature review of four databases from earliest records to November 2018 will be carried out using CINAHL, Medline (Ovid), Cochrane Library and Embase. Randomised and nonrandomised control studies will be included, in addition to crossover and pre-studies post-studies comparing telehealth with standard monitoring among individuals with COPD only. Two independent reviewers will screen all relevant abstracts and full-text studies to determine eligibility, assess the risk of bias and extract the data using structured forms. If the included studies are sufficiently homogenous in terms of interventions, populations and objectives, a meta-analysis will be performed. Ethics and dissemination Ethical considerations are not required for this research.";2019;4
"Introduction Tele-monitoring (TM) has proved effective in the home management of adult ventilator-dependent neuromuscular disease (NMD) patients. We aimed to evaluate a 2-year longitudinal multicentre TM trial designed for young ventilated NMD patients in terms of feasibility, home management of exacerbations and caregivers' burden. Methods The TM trial protocol included patients' weekly scheduled overnight home-recording of SpO(2), heart rate and ventilation and their transmission to each TM centre the following morning. Overnight data were reviewed by non-physicians and calls to families made to assess clinical condition. If clinical conditions (assessed by a scoring system) or overnight parameters worsened, either unscheduled transmissions or calls were activated and managed by non-physicians or medical team according to severity. Hospitalisations were compared with those of TM patients prior to TM start and with those of age-disease-severity-matched controls. Scores from the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) questionnaire pre- and post-TM were compared. Results Forty-eight patients were enrolled, 30 males, median age 16.4 years (interquartile range (IQR) 8.9-22.1), median ventilation/day 10.5 h (IQR 8-16). Exacerbations in TM patients did not differ (59 versus 53; p = 0.15) from controls. Hospitalisations were significantly reduced in TM patients when compared with those prior to TM (11 versus 24, p = 0.04) and to controls (11 versus 21, p = 0.03). Median hospitalisation length was significantly lower in TM patients than controls (6 versus 7 days, p = 0.03). Caregivers satisfaction was excellent whereas no significant changes in CBI were seen (32.5 versus 35.5, p = 0.06).

Introduction The use of telepractice, a method of delivering services through telecommunications technologies that provides two-way, synchronous audio and video signals in real-time, is becoming increasingly commonplace in early childhood education and intervention for children who are deaf or hard of hearing. Although the use of telepractice has been validated in the health sector as a viable and effective alternative to in-person service provision, evidence to support its use in the delivery of family-centred early intervention is still emerging. The purpose of this scoping review was to describe the current use of telepractice in the delivery of family-centred early childhood intervention for children who are deaf or hard of hearing, and their families. Method The review followed the framework outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute (2015), including an iterative three-step search strategy. Specific inclusion criteria and data extraction fields were outlined in advance. Results A total of 23 peer-reviewed publications were included in the review. Most publications (70%) provided anecdotal evidence of the challenges and benefits associated with telepractice. The remaining publications (30%) reported on research studies evaluating the effectiveness of early intervention delivered through telepractice. Of the 23 included papers, 18 viewed the use of telepractice positively while the remaining 5 reported mixed conclusions and the need for more data. Discussion Current evidence in the literature indicates that telepractice can be an effective model for delivering family-centred early intervention for children who are deaf or hard of hearing. However, more research is needed to substantiate the use of telepractice as a viable alternative to traditional in-person services, rather than being seen as supplemental to such services.;2019;4
Introduction. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes gait abnormalities and a deficit in balance control in the vast majority of people affected by it. Virtual reality has been proposed as a complementary approach to conventional physiotherapeutic treatment as a way of improving these variables. Aim. To assess the real efficacy of this approach compared to other neurorehabilitation therapies, or no intervention, in MS. Patients and methods. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted. Studies of the last five years that compare virtual reality with conventional treatment or no intervention, on balance and/or gait, in adults with MS, were included. PEDro scale was used to assess methodological quality and the Oxford scale to determine the level of evidence and grades of recommendations. Results. Eight studies met the eligibility criteria. For balance, the efficacy of virtual reality is, at least, comparable as conventional training. For gait, virtual reality seems not to be superior in improving the speed, compared with the other types of interventions assessed. Methodological quality of studies was low-moderate. Conclusions. Virtual reality is as effective as conventional training for improving balance in people with MS. No data suggests that virtual reality is superior to other interventions in improving gait speed. For other gait parameters, virtual reality's efficacy remains unknown.;2019;4
Introduction: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a multidisciplinary intervention that improves quality of life and reduces the risk of recurrent heart attack. Unlike all known benefits for CR, the patient participation in CR is low. Telerehabilitation has the potential to improve lifestyle and helps patients having long-term compliance with clinician advice. The objective of this study was the development of a web-based cardiac telerehabilitation platform to engage the post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients in self-management of disease. Method: Development process of creating and evaluating a telerehabilitation platform included four phases: (1) need assessment, (2) design the prototype, (3) implement the cardiac telerehabilitation platform, (4) usability evaluation. Result: Cardiac telerehabilitation platform consists of an Android-based application for patients and web-based dashboard for rehabilitation mentors. The modules of the application are daily self-assessment, weekly self-assessment, educational content, stress and sleep improvement skills, medication reminder, online chat, prescribed diet, prescribed physical activity and rehabilitation records. The self-assessment modules allow users to enter the data such as physical activity, diet, blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight. The patient data entries are interpreted in the system knowledge base and colored symbol feedbacks display for patients and mentors. In the dashboard, the mentors review the patient data entries and set the rehabilitation plan for next week. In a beta test of usability evaluation, the mean of SUS score for patients was 75.16, for clinicians was 73.33 and for medical informatics specialist was 72.33. These results showed that the usability of our system was at an acceptable level. Conclusion: The cardiac telerehabilitation platform is a convenient tool for post-MI patients who cannot attend at outpatient cardiac rehabilitation centers for any reason.;2019;4
Introduction: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive deterioration of speech and language. A growing body of research supports the utility of speech and language intervention in individuals with PPA, although access to these services remains limited. One potential means of increasing treatment accessibility is the delivery of treatment via telemedicine. Evidence supports the use of teletherapy in stroke-induced aphasia, but research examining the application of teletherapy in PPA is limited. In the current study, a non-randomized group comparison design was used to evaluate the feasibility and utility of treatment delivered via teletherapy relative to treatment administered in person for individuals with PPA. Methods: Two treatment protocols were administered as part of a larger study investigating treatment for speech and language deficits in PPA. Participants with semantic (n=10) and logopenic (n=11) PPA received lexical retrieval treatment and individuals with nonfluent/agrammatic PPA (n=10) received video-implemented script training for aphasia designed to promote speech production and fluency. Treatment was administered via teletherapy for approximately half of the participants receiving each intervention. Treatment outcomes and performance on standardized tests were assessed at pre-treatment and post-treatment, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Results: Overall, both treatment approaches resulted in significant gains for primary outcome measures. Critically, comparison of in-person and teletherapy groups revealed comparable outcomes. Generalization to untrained targets and tasks and maintenance of treatment-induced gains were also comparable for traditional vs teletherapy participants. Conclusion: Overall, treatment outcomes were largely equivalent for individuals receiving treatment via teletherapy vs traditional, in-person delivery. Results support the application of teletherapy for administering restitutive interventions to individuals with mild-to-moderate PPA. Potential implications for using teletherapy in the treatment of cognitive-linguistic and motoric impairments in other disorders and suggestions for administering treatment via telemedicine are discussed.;2019;4
"Introduction: Telemedicine (TM) has transformed the field of emergency cardiology, particularly the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The ability to record an electrocardiogram (EKG) in the early prehospital phase, thus avoiding any delay in diagnosing myocardial infarction with direct transfer to the cath-lab for primary angioplasty, has proven to significantly reduce treatment times and mortality. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the available evidence and organizational models based on a support by TM in cardiology, including the applications of TM in cardiovascular disease based on a review of the literature. Results: The most important areas of application of TM in the field of cardiology are as follows: (1) Early prehospital diagnosis of AMI with EKG transmission; (2) Patient Remote control through wearable and devices; (3) Monitoring of patients with chronic heart failure; (4) Monitoring of patient's arrhythmias; and (5) Transmission of echo images to a III level center for a second opinion. Conclusions: TM services should, therefore, be considered as a true diagnostic/therapeutic aspect of cardiovascular emergencies. It is necessary to educate medical staff and to provide a tempting environment for software engineers. Investing in infrastructure and equipment is imperative, as well as a positive climate for its implementation.";2019;4
Introduction: Telemedicine represents an emerging model for the assessment and management of various neurological disorders. Methods: We sought to discuss opportunities and challenges for the integration of telemedicine in the management of common and uncommon neurological disorders by reviewing and appraising studies that evaluate telemedicine as a means to facilitate the access to care, deliver highly specialized visits, diagnostic consultations, rehabilitation, and remote monitoring of neurological disorders. Results: Opportunities for telemedicine in neurological disorders include the replacement of or complement to in-office evaluations, decreased time between follow-up visits, reduction in disparities in access to healthcare, and promotion of education and training through interactions between primary care physicians and tertiary referral centers. Critical challenges include the integration of the systems for data monitoring with an easy-to-use, secure, and cost-effective platform that is both widely adopted by patients and healthcare systems and embraced by international scientific societies. Conclusions: Multiple applications may spawn from a model based on digitalized healthcare services. Integrated efforts from multiple stakeholders will be required to develop an interoperable software platform capable of providing not only a holistic approach to care but also one that reduces disparities in the access to care.;2019;4
Introduction: Veterans with low vision who live in rural communities have limited access to low-vision rehabilitation services, unless they are able to travel several miles to a specialty low-vision clinic. A low-vision optometry telerehabilitation evaluation is a thorough assessment of patient's functional vision. Following each low-vision optometry telerehabilitation evaluation is a low-vision telerehabilitation initial assessment with a blind rehabilitation therapist. Our objective was to estimate the acceptance and practicality of low-vision telerehabilitation and investigate the travel cost and time savings. Methods: Utilizing Google Maps (TM), round-trip travel mileage and travel time can be estimated between the veteran's home and the Buffalo Veterans Affairs (VA) and compared with the round-trip mileage and travel time between the veteran's home and local community-based outpatient center (CBOC) or local VA for low-vision telerehabilitation services. The difference is the savings in travel miles and time. Cost saving can be calculated by multiplying difference in travel miles by cost per mile. Results: Veterans who chose not to schedule face-to-face low-vision rehabilitation at the Buffalo VA due to an average round-trip travel distance of 151 miles scheduled a low-vision telerehabilitation at a local CBOC or local VA with an average round-trip travel distance of 29 miles. Adding low-vision telerehabilitation services from fiscal year (FY) 13 to FY 17 resulted in a 24% increase in low-vision patient care. The median saving of travel miles for rural veterans was 122 miles per veteran, and the median saving of travel time was 2.09 h per veteran. Overall, the median saving of the travel cost was $65.29 per veteran. Conclusions: This study shows and supports low-vision telerehabilitation as an accepted, practical, time-saving, and cost-saving alternative option to traditional face-to-face consultations with a low-vision optometrist and blind rehabilitation therapist.;2019;4
"IntroductionTelerehabilitation programmes have been attracting increasing attention as a potential alternative to conventional rehabilitation. Video conferencing can facilitate communication between healthcare professionals and patients. However, in certain cases, video conferencing may face practical limitations. As an alternative to real-time conferencing, sensor-based technologies can transmit the acquired data to healthcare providers. This study aimed to design and develop a sensor-based telerehabilitation programme and to outline the corresponding requirements for such a system.DevelopmentThe development of the sensor-based telerehabilitation programme was carried out based on user needs. The programme includes a portable platform for the patient as well as a web-based platform for the healthcare professional, thus allowing for an individualised rehabilitation programme. Communication, training, reporting, and information services were provided for the patients. Moreover, the portability and usability of the programme were enhanced by utilising the system in offline mode as well.ApplicationThe programme is currently being tested in the North Denmark Region to assess the feasibility and acceptance of a telerehabilitation programme as an alternative solution to the self-training programme for patients who have been discharged from knee surgery. The preliminary results of our assessment showed a high level of acceptance among the users.DiscussionIn this study, a semi-online sensor-based telerehabilitation programme was tested. It is argued that a similar sensor-based telerehabilitation programme can be utilised as an alternative solution for self-training rehabilitation in the future; however; further studies and development are required to ensure the quality and reliability of sensor-based services.";2019;4
It is well known that the sense of presence in a tele-robot system for both home-based tele-rehabilitation and rescue operations is enhanced by haptic feedback. Beyond several advantages, in the presence of communication delay haptic feedback can lead to an unstable teleoperation system. During the last decades, several control techniques have been proposed to ensure a good trade-off between transparency and stability in bilateral teleoperation systems under time delays. These proposed control approaches have been extensively tested with teleoperation systems based on identical master and slave robots having few degrees of freedom (DoF). However, a small number of DoFs cannot ensure both an effective restoration of the multi joint coordination in tele-rehabilitation and an adequate dexterity during manipulation tasks in rescue scenario. Thus, a deep understanding of the applicability of such control techniques on a real bilateral teleoperation setup is needed. In this work, we investigated the behavior of the time-domain passivity approach (TDPA) applied on an asymmetrical teleoperator system composed by a 5-DoFs impedance designed upper-limb exoskeleton and a 4-DoFs admittance designed anthropomorphic robot. The conceived teleoperation architecture is based on a velocity-force (measured) architecture with position drift compensation and has been tested with a representative set of tasks under communication delay (80 ms round-trip). The results have shown that the TDPA is suitable for a multi-DoFs asymmetrical setup composed by two isomorphic haptic interfaces characterized by different mechanical features. The stability of the teleoperator has been proved during several (1) high-force contacts against stiff wall that involve more Cartesian axes simultaneously, (2) continuous contacts with a stiff edge tests, (3) heavy-load handling tests while following a predefined path and (4) high-force contacts against stiff wall while handling a load. The found results demonstrated that the TDPA could be used in several teleoperation scenarios like home-based tele-rehabilitation and rescue operations.;2019;4
Key PointsQuestionDoes a 6-week course of intensive home-based telehealth targeting arm movements after stroke provide rehabilitation benefits that are comparable with those derived from dose-matched traditional in-clinic rehabilitation therapy? FindingsIn this randomized, assessor-blinded, noninferiority clinical trial of 124 adults following stroke, telerehabilitation showed comparable efficacy to traditional in-clinic rehabilitation for improving motor status (Fugl-Meyer arm motor scale) and for improving patient knowledge about stroke. MeaningTelehealth is an effective means to provide rehabilitation therapy and improve patient outcomes after stroke and may be useful for improving access to rehabilitation therapy. ImportanceMany patients receive suboptimal rehabilitation therapy doses after stroke owing to limited access to therapists and difficulty with transportation, and their knowledge about stroke is often limited. Telehealth can potentially address these issues. ObjectivesTo determine whether treatment targeting arm movement delivered via a home-based telerehabilitation (TR) system has comparable efficacy with dose-matched, intensity-matched therapy delivered in a traditional in-clinic (IC) setting, and to examine whether this system has comparable efficacy for providing stroke education. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this randomized, assessor-blinded, noninferiority trial across 11 US sites, 124 patients who had experienced stroke 4 to 36 weeks prior and had arm motor deficits (Fugl-Meyer [FM] score, 22-56 of 66) were enrolled between September 18, 2015, and December 28, 2017, to receive telerehabilitation therapy in the home (TR group) or therapy at an outpatient rehabilitation therapy clinic (IC group). Primary efficacy analysis used the intent-to-treat population. InterventionsParticipants received 36 sessions (70 minutes each) of arm motor therapy plus stroke education, with therapy intensity, duration, and frequency matched across groups. Main Outcomes and MeasuresChange in FM score from baseline to 4 weeks after end of therapy and change in stroke knowledge from baseline to end of therapy. ResultsA total of 124 participants (34 women and 90 men) had a mean (SD) age of 61 (14) years, a mean (SD) baseline FM score of 43 (8) points, and were enrolled a mean (SD) of 18.7 (8.9) weeks after experiencing a stroke. Among those treated, patients in the IC group were adherent to 33.6 of the 36 therapy sessions (93.3%) and patients in the TR group were adherent to 35.4 of the 36 assigned therapy sessions (98.3%). Patients in the IC group had a mean (SD) FM score change of 8.36 (7.04) points from baseline to 30 days after therapy (P<.001), while those in the TR group had a mean (SD) change of 7.86 (6.68) points (P<.001). The covariate-adjusted mean FM score change was 0.06 (95% CI, -2.14 to 2.26) points higher in the TR group (P=.96). The noninferiority margin was 2.47 and fell outside the 95% CI, indicating that TR is not inferior to IC therapy. Motor gains remained significant when patients enrolled early (<90 days) or late (<greater than or equal to>90 days) after stroke were examined separately. Conclusions and RelevanceActivity-based training produced substantial gains in arm motor function regardless of whether it was provided via home-based telerehabilitation or traditional in-clinic rehabilitation. The findings of this study suggest that telerehabilitation has the potential to substantially increase access to rehabilitation therapy on a large scale. Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02360488 This randomized clinical trial examines whether a treatment targeting arm movement delivered via a home-based telerehabilitation system has comparable efficacy with dose-matched, intensity-matched therapy delivered in a traditional in-clinic setting for adults following stroke.;2019;4
Nowadays, the penetration of sensors and actuators in different application fields is revolutionizing all aspects of our daily life. One of the major sectors that is taking advantage of such cutting-edge cheap smart devices is healthcare. In this context, Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) at home represents a tempting opportunity for hospitals to reduce clinical costs and to improve the quality of life of both patients and their families. It allows patients to be monitored remotely by means networks of Internet of Things (IoT) medical devices equipped with sensors and actuators that collect healthcare data from patients and send them to a Cloud-based Hospital Information System (HIS) for processing. Up to now, many different proprietary software systems have been developed as stand-along expensive solutions, presenting interoperability, extensibility, and scalability issues. In recent years, the European Commission (EC) has promoted the wide adoption of FIWARE technology, launching 16 Industrial Accelerators focusing on different application fields. One of these, i.e., FICHe, is specialized in healthcare, providing the guidelines on how to develop eHealth systems. This paper focuses on how to compose new cutting-edge IoT and Cloud-based Cyber Physical Health Sytem (CPHS) services and applications interconnected with remote medical sensors and actuators using FIWARE technology in the context envisioned by FICHe. In particular, we discuss the design and development of an RPM system implemented through the collaboration between the Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Bonino Pulejo (i.e., a clinical and research healthcare centre specialized in the treatment of neuro lesions), University of Messina, IBM Research, Telefonica, and the University of the Western Cape in South Africa. The description of our best practice provides a model and guidelines for the development of lightweight and low cost RPM services for rural and isolated areas, with the expectation of expanding healthcare to the developing world and in general allows us to outline how to deal with the real adoption of the FIWARE technology in an e-health project.;2019;4
Nowadays, the tools for remote monitoring and training analysis are a matter of deep interest in the field of telerehabilitation. In this study we present a method for the automated evaluation of performance in exergames for motor rehabilitation that can be performed by the patient, even autonomously in a domestic environment, with Microsoft Kinect and Leap Motion. The proposed method is based on a machine learning approach utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM). It uses a radial basis function kernel that deals with a two-class classification problem. The performance outcomes for one of the 10 exergames developed by our team are provided as a case study. After a crucial phase consisting of hyperparameter optimization, the SVM algorithm proved to be able to distinguish the Good class from the Other class with an accuracy of 0.80.;2019;4
"Objective Compare the effects and costs of remotely monitored exercise-based cardiac telerehabilitation (REMOTE-CR) with centre-based programmes (CBexCR) in adults with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods Participants were randomised to receive 12 weeks of telerehabilitation or centre-based rehabilitation. REMOTE-CR provided individualised exercise prescription, real-time exercise monitoring/coaching and theory-based behavioural strategies via a bespoke telerehabilitation platform; CBexCR provided individualised exercise prescription and coaching via established rehabilitation clinics. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 and/or 24 weeks included maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max, primary) modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, exercise adherence, motivation, health-related quality of life and programme delivery, hospital service utilisation and medication costs. The primary hypothesis was a non-inferior between-group difference in VO(2)max at 12 weeks (inferiority margin=-1.25 mL/kg/min); inferiority margins were not set for secondary outcomes. Results 162 participants (mean 61 +/- 12.7 years, 86% men) were randomised. VO2 max was comparable in both groups at 12 weeks and REMOTE-CR was non-inferior to CBexCR (REMOTE-CR-CBexCR adjusted mean difference (AMD)=0.51 (95% CI -0.97 to 1.98) mL/kg/min, p=0.48). REMOTE-CR participants were less sedentary at 24 weeks (AMD=-61.5 (95% CI -117.8 to -5.3) min/day, p=0.03), while CBexCR participants had smaller waist (AMD=1.71 (95% CI 0.09 to 3.34) cm, p=0.04) and hip circumferences (AMD=1.16 (95% CI 0.06 to 2.27) cm, p=0.04) at 12 weeks. No other between-group differences were detected. Per capita programme delivery (NZD1130/GBP573 vs NZD3466/GBP1758) and medication costs (NZD331/GBP168 vs NZD605/GBP307, p=0.02) were lower for REMOTE-CR. Hospital service utilisation costs were not statistically significantly different (NZD3459/GBP1754 vs NZD5464/GBP2771, p=0.20). Conclusion REMOTE-CR is an effective, cost-efficient alternative delivery model that could-as a complement to existing services-improve overall utilisation rates by increasing reach and satisfying unique participant preferences.";2019;4
Objective/background: This study aimed to review the current evidence on the application of telerehabilitation in occupational therapy practice and its clinical outcomes over the last 10 years. Methods: A systematic review was performed on studies published in English in the decade 2008 to 2017, retrieved from seven electronic databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, SAGE, Science Direct and EMBASE). Only articles evaluating the use of telerehabilitation to provide occupational therapy services from a distance were included, with no restrictions on pathology, impairment, age, or the nature of occupational therapy intervention. Results: Fifteen articles (three randomised controlled trials, eight quasi-experimental studies, one trial with single-group post-intervention and three case studies) were reviewed. Despite various study designs and outcome measures, most studies indicated positive therapeutic effects of using telerehabilitation in occupational therapy practice. There is insufficient evidence, however, to confirm that telerehabilitation is more effective than the face-to-face model. Little evidence was shown on the long-term effect and cost efficacy. Only two studies used smartphones in their applications. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation offers an alternative service delivery model for occupational therapy, not only bridging distance but also offering user-friendly treatment for patients at home. Further research, particularly on the use of the most cutting-edge mobile technology, is needed to determine effectiveness in occupational therapy practice treating various diseases, conditions and impairments and the characteristics of patients, interventions and therapists that lead to the best fit with this alternative and emerging form of service delivery.;2019;4
"Objective: Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a leading cause of long-term disability. This calls for effective and accessible interventions to support participation in the community over time. One promising avenue to answer this need is telerehabilitation. Prior to conducting a larger trial, the main objective of this pilot study is to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a metacognitive occupation-based intervention in a telerehabilitation format with adults and older adults in the chronic phase after ABI. Methods: Five community dwelling participants (ages 65-72), 6-10 months post-ABI, with scores 2-4 on the modified Rankin scale and without dementia, completed the teleintervention. The intervention included similar to 10 weekly videoconferencing sessions administered by an occupational therapist using the Cognitive Orientation to Daily Occupational Performance approach. Each participant defined five functional goals and three were trained and two were not trained during the intervention. Evaluations were conducted at pre, post, and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome measures included activity performance (The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure; COPM), participation (the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 Participation Index; MPAI-4-P), and quality of life (QoL) (stroke impact scale; SIS). Other measures included a feedback interview, satisfaction questionnaire, field notes, and a treatment fidelity checklist. Results: The teleintervention was found to be feasible and the participants expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the intervention and the technology use. A Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test indicated statistically significant improvements post intervention in COPM performance (z = -2.023, p = 0.043) and satisfaction (z = -2.023, p = 0.043) ratings. Additionally, clinically significant improvements (>= 2 points) in both performance and satisfaction with performance were found for each participant in at least three of their five defined functional goals. Trends toward significant improvement were found in MPAI-4-P ratings post intervention (z = -1.826, p = 0.068). Furthermore, clinically significant improvements (>= 15 points) post intervention were found for each participant in some subscales of the SIS. Results were partially maintained at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a metacognitive occupation-based telerehabilitation intervention and its potential benefits in activity performance, participation, and QoL for older adults coping with long-term disability following ABI.";2019;4
"Objective: Despite the increasing availability of eRehabilitation, its use remains limited. The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with willingness to use eRehabilitation. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Subjects: Stroke patients, informal caregivers, health-care professionals. Methods: The survey included personal characteristics, willingness to use eRehabilitation (yes/no) and barriers/facilitators influencing this willingness (4-point scale). Barriers/facilitators were merged into factors. The association between these factors and willingness to use eRehabilitation was assessed using logistic regression analyses. Results: Overall, 125 patients, 43 informal caregivers and 105 healthcare professionals participated in the study. Willingness to use eRehabilitation was positively influenced by perceived patient benefits (e.g. reduced travel time, increased motivation, better outcomes), among patients (odds ratio (OR) 2.68; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.34-5.33), informal caregivers (OR 8.98; 95% CI 1.70-47.33) and healthcare professionals (OR 6.25; 95% CI 1.17-10.48). Insufficient knowledge decreased willingness to use eRehabilitation among patients (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17-0.74). Limitations of the study include low response rates and possible response bias. Conclusion: Differences were found between patients/informal caregivers and healthcare professionals. However, for both groups, perceived benefits of the use of eRehabilitation facilitated willingness to use eRehabilitation. Further research is needed to determine the benefits of such programs, and inform all users about the potential benefits, and how to use eRehabilitation.";2019;4
Objective: This article describes the findings of a study examining the ability of persons with strokes to use home virtual rehabilitation system (HoVRS), a home-based rehabilitation system, and the impact of motivational enhancement techniques on subjects' motivation, adherence, and motor function improvements subsequent to a 3-month training program. Materials and Methods: HoVRS integrates a Leap Motion controller, a passive arm support, and a suite of custom-designed hand rehabilitation simulations. For this study, we developed a library of three simulations, which include activities such as flexing and extending fingers to move a car, flying a plane with wrist movement, and controlling an avatar running in a maze using reaching movements. Two groups of subjects, the enhanced motivation (EM) group and the unenhanced control (UC) group, used the system for 12 weeks in their homes. The EM group trained using three simulations that provided 8-12 levels of difficulty and complexity. Graphics and scoring opportunities increased at each new level. The UC group performed the same simulations, but difficulty was increased utilizing an algorithm that increased difficulty incrementally, making adjustments imperceptible. Results: Adherence to both the EM and UC protocols exceeded adherence to home exercise programs described in the stroke rehabilitation literature. Both groups demonstrated improvements in upper extremity function. Intrinsic motivation levels were better for the EM group and motivation levels were maintained for the 12-week protocol. Conclusion: A 12-week home-based training program using HoVRS was feasible. Motivational enhancement may have a positive impact on motivation, adherence, and motor outcome.;2019;4
Objective: To evaluate the delivery, acceptance and experiences regarding a traditional and teletreatment approach to mirror therapy as delivered in a randomized controlled trial. Design: Mixed methods, prospective study. Setting: Rehabilitation centres, hospital and private practices. Subjects: Adult patients with phantom pain following lower limb amputation and their treating physical and occupational therapists. Interventions: All patients received 4 weeks of traditional mirror therapy (n = 51), followed by 6 weeks of teletreatment (n = 26) or 6 weeks of self-delivered mirror therapy (n = 25). Main measures: Patient files, therapist logs, log files teletreatment, acceptance questionnaire and interviews with patients and their therapists. Results: In all, 51 patients and 10 therapists participated in the process evaluation. Only 16 patients (31%) received traditional mirror therapy according to the clinical framework during the first 4 weeks. Between weeks 5 and 10, the teletreatment was used by 14 patients (56%) with sufficient dose. Teletreatment usage decreased from a median number of 31 (weeks 5-10) to 19 sessions (weeks 11-24). Satisfactory teletreatment user acceptance rates were found with patients demonstrating higher scores (e.g. regarding the usefulness to control pain) than therapists. Potential barriers for implementation of the teletreatment perceived by patients and therapists were related to insufficient training and support as well as the frequency of technical problems. Conclusion: Traditional mirror therapy and the teletreatment were not delivered as intended in the majority of patients. Implementation of the teletreatment in daily routines was challenging, and more research is needed to evaluate user characteristics that influence adherence and how technology features can be optimized to develop tailored implementation strategies.;2019;4
"Objective: To evaluate the effect of an mHealth wheelchair skills training program on clinical outcomes among older adult manual wheelchair users. Design: 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial. Setting: Community setting in 2 Canadian cities. Participants: Convenience sample of manual wheelchair users 50 years and older living in the community who were able to self-propel with both hands and communicate in English. Participants (N = 18) were randomized into either a mHealth treatment (n = 10) or tablet gaming control (n = 8) group. Interventions: All participants received 2 in-person sessions with their trainer and engaged in a 4-week monitored home training program with a computer tablet. The Enhancing Participation In the Community by improving Wheelchair Skills program provided wheelchair skills training; the control program included 9 dexterity and cognitive training games. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was wheelchair skill capacity. Secondary outcomes included safety, self-efficacy, activity participation, mobility, divided-attention, and health-related quality of life. Results: Data collection was blinded to group allocation. Capacity improved by 2 skills but with no statistically significant between-group difference. The mHealth training program had a significant effect on participation (P = .03) and self-efficacy (P = .06) with large effect sizes (eta(2)(p) = 0.22-0.29). Mobility, safety with skill performance, and divided attention measures demonstrated medium effect size changes, but only safety with skill performance was statistically significant. The program was more beneficial for participants with <1 year of wheelchair experience. Conclusion: Enhancing Participation In the Community by improving Wheelchair Skills participants demonstrated good program adherence and clinical benefits were evident in community participation and wheelchair self-efficacy. Wheelchair safety and mobility were positively affected, while skill capacity showed a small, nonsignificant improvement. Future study should investigate benefit retention over time.

"Objective: To examine the feasibility of a trial to evaluate web-based physiotherapy compared to a standard home exercise programme in people with multiple sclerosis. Design: Multi-centre, randomized controlled, feasibility study. Setting: Three multiple sclerosis out-patient centres. Participants: A total of 90 people with multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale 4-6.5). Interventions: Participants were randomized to a six-month individualized, home exercise programme delivered via web-based physiotherapy (n = 45; intervention) or a sheet of exercises (n = 45; active comparator). Outcome measures: Outcome measures (0, three, six and nine months) included adherence, two-minute walk test, 25 foot walk, Berg Balance Scale, physical activity and healthcare resource use. Interviews were undertaken with 24 participants and 3 physiotherapists. Results: Almost 25% of people approached agreed to take part. No intervention-related adverse events were recorded. Adherence was 40%-63% and 53%-71% in the intervention and comparator groups. There was no difference in the two-minute walk test between groups at baseline (Intervention-80.4(33.91)m, Comparator-70.6(31.20)m) and no change over time (at six-month Intervention-81.6(32.75)m, Comparator-74.8(36.16)m. There were no significant changes over time in other outcome measures except the EuroQol-5 Dimension at six months which decreased in the active comparator group. For a difference of 8(17.4)m in two-minute walk test between groups, 76 participants/group would be required (80% power, P > 0.05) for a future randomized controlled trial. Conclusion: No changes were found in the majority of outcome measures over time. This study was acceptable and feasible by participants and physiotherapists. An adequately powered study needs 160 participants.";2019;4
Objective: To investigate the effects of EEG-based neurofeedback training, in which one can learn to self-regulate one's own brain activity, on cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Methods: Fourteen pwMS performed ten neurofeedback training sessions within 3-4 weeks at home using a tele-rehabilitation system. The aim of the neurofeedback training was to increase voluntarily the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR, 12-15 Hz) in the EEG over central brain areas by receiving visual real-time feedback thereof. Cognitive function was assessed before and after all neurofeedback training sessions using a comprehensive standardized neuropsychological test battery. Results: Half of the pwMS (N = 7) showed cognitive improvements in long-term memory and executive functions after neurofeedback training. These patients successfully learned to self-regulate their own brain activity by means of neurofeedback training. The other half of pwMS (N= 7) did neither show any cognitive changes when comparing the pre- and post-assessment nor were they able to modulate their own brain activity in the desired direction during neurofeedback training. Conclusions: Data from this interventional study provide first preliminary evidence that successful self-regulation of one's own brain activity may be associated with cognitive improvements in pwMS. Significance: These promising results should stimulate further studies. Neurofeedback might be a promising and alternative tool for future cognitive rehabilitation.

"Objective: To investigate the efficacy of real instrument training in virtual reality (VR) environment for improving upper-extremity and cognitive function after stroke. Design: Single-blind, randomized trial. Setting: Medical center. Participants: Enrolled subjects (N= 31) were first-episode stroke, assessed for a period of 6 months after stroke onset; age between 20 and 85 years; patients with unilateral paralysis and a Fugl-Meyer assessment upper-extremity scale score >18. Interventions: Both groups were trained 30 minutes per day, 3 days a week, for 6 weeks, with the experimental group performing the VR combined real instrument training and the control group performing conventional occupational therapy. Main Outcome Measures: Manual Muscle Test, modified Ashworth scale, Fugl-Meyer upper motor scale, hand grip, Box and Block, 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), Korean Mini-Mental State Examination, and Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Results: The experimental group showed greater therapeutic effects in a time-dependent manner than the control group, especially on the motor power of wrist extension, spasticity of elbow flexion and wrist extension, and Box and Block Tests. Patients in the experimental group, but not the control group, also showed significant improvements on the lateral, palmar, and tip pinch power, Box and Block, and 9-HPTs from before to immediately after training. Significantly greater improvements in the tip pinch power immediately after training and spasticity of elbow flexion 4 weeks after training completion were noted in the experimental group. Conclusions: VR combined real instrument training was effective at promoting recovery of patients' upper-extremity and cognitive function, and thus may be an innovative translational neurorehabilitation strategy after stroke.

"Objective: To study the effectiveness of technology-based distance physical rehabilitation interventions on physical functioning in stroke. Data Sources: A systematic literature search was conducted in 6 databases from January 2000 to May 2018. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria applied the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome, study design framework as follows: (P) stroke; (I) technology-based distance physical rehabilitation interventions; (C) any comparison without the use of technology; (0) physical functioning; (S) randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The search identified in total 693 studies, and the screening of 162 full-text studies revealed 13 eligible studies. Data Extraction: The studies were screened using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines and assessed for methodological quality and quality of evidence. Meta-analysis was performed if applicable. Data Synthesis: A total of 13 studies were included, and online video monitoring was the most used technology. Seven outcomes of physical functioning were identified-activities of daily living (ADL), upper extremity functioning, lower extremity functioning, balance, walking, physical activity, and participation. A meta-analysis of 6 RCTs indicated that technology-based distance physical rehabilitation had a similar effect on ADL (standard mean difference 0.06; 95% confidence interval: -0.22 to 0.35, P=.67) compared to the combination of traditional treatments (usual care, similar and other treatment). Similar results were obtained for other outcomes, except inconsistent findings were noted for walking. Methodological quality of the studies and quality of evidence were considered low. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the effectiveness of technology-based distance physical rehabilitation interventions on physical functioning might be similar compared to traditional treatments in stroke. Further research should be performed to confirm the effectiveness of technology-based distance physical rehabilitation interventions for improving physical functioning of persons with stroke.

Objectives This article attempts to highlight the challenges and possibilities for hearing healthcare through technology and aural rehabilitation in a resource-constrained setting, using South Africa as an example. Results and conclusion The authors argue that it is possible to enhance service delivery by using free resources and maximising the limited existing resources. In order to provide a sustainable hearing healthcare service in developing countries, it is pertinent to understand the context where the services are needed, and not just adopt an approach developed for a different context. Audiologists in such settings need to employ strategies to develop context-specific tools, and adapt existing tools to serve the needs of the local population. Some examples, although not exhaustive, are provided in the article.;2019;4
Occupational therapy services delivered via telehealth can support families of young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in everyday routines such as mealtime, bedtime, and play. The aim of the current study was to understand the lived experiences of parents who participated in a 12-week, telehealth-delivered occupational therapy intervention (Occupation-Based Coaching). We used semi-structured interviews and subsequent thematic content analysis to understand how parents perceived the mechanism of service delivery (i.e., videoconferencing) and the content of the intervention. Themes that emerged from the data included Compatibility with Everyday Life, Collaborative Relationship, and Parent Empowerment. Parents expressed how telehealth fit within their daily lives, how telehealth supported a collaborative relationship with the occupational therapist, and how the content of the intervention built a sense of empowerment.;2019;4
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) contribute to improving the evidence base in many areas of clinical care. An area where PROMS can help build the evidence base is in person-generated health data (PGHD) that is available to people who engage with many health technologies. An important use case for PGHD outcomes is in simulated poststroke rehabilitation that use body-tracking technologies. This study gathered stroke survivor perceptions through 2 focus groups and 5 interviews on PGHD effects from a leading poststroke simulated rehabilitation technology. Deductive thematic analysis was performed. The findings show that PGHD outcomes of utilising PGHD can be measured. Moreover, the findings provided a deeper understanding of PGHD effects and broadened the scope through the perceptions of stroke survivors themselves. This work will further refine and validate the development of a PROM for utilising PGHD for poststroke simulated rehabilitation systems, and has wider relevance and application.;2019;4
"Physical rehabilitation refers to the recovery of human capacity for the autonomous performance of daily activities based on an evaluation and treatment leading to minimizing problems in neuromotor function. This is a process that takes time, constant support and the making of appropriate decisions by health professionals, but above all the motivation of the patient. To this end, the architecture of a web platform integrated with serious videogames and a motion capture system to support the process of musculoskeletal rehabilitation is proposed. A review of the literature with therapeutic proposals for the rehabilitation of the upper limb using videogames and motion capture systems is presented. The results obtained showed that some works focus on the use of Kinect as a motion capture system; others are commercial systems; and other proposals explore the advantages of inertial measurement units. Regarding the use of videogames, the works reaffirm the significant contribution that they make in rehabilitation processes of the neuromotor system. Taking the above into consideration, an architecture for a telerehabilitation platform is proposed as a motivating alternative, which offers precise physiotherapeutic information in real time, as an attempt to help accelerating recovery time of patients.";2019;4
Physical therapy helps patients during their rehabilitation programme after orthopaedic post-operative interventions or in case of musculoskeletal injuries. For a full recovery and a minimisation of the risk of complications, the prescribed in-clinical therapy sessions must be supplemented by independent home training The purpose of this paper is to present the emerging technologies used for monitoring ortophedic movements and to introduce an innovative telerehabilitation-as-aservice solution, called reflex, which consists of two IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) motion tracking sensors and a mobile application The therapist makes use of standardised digitised physical exercises that are carefully chosen so as to create, by selection, a custom designed training program that will meet the needs of each patient. The feedback provided by the sensors enables the therapist to a) monitor the patients' compliance with the training program in a transparent manner, b) keep track of the documentation related to the recovery progress through data-collection during in-clinical and in-home exercise-based rehabilitation c) customize the training program. The real-time 3D smartphone animations and the direct visual, audio and haptic feedback from the sensors assist patients in performing the rehabilitation exercises assigned to them. The above mentioned application allows the patients to visualise their injured limb on their smartphone or tablet in an innovative 3D 360 manner, thereby reducing their fear of making mistakes during the recovery process and offering them constant security. The study evaluates the effects of this kind of approach for a group of 30 participants and the results recorded are in favour of the patients recovering with reflex.;2019;4
"Post-stroke cognitive disorders can affect different domains, depending on typology of stroke and lesion localization, onset time, age and diagnostic tools used. In recent years, telerehabilitation using virtual reality has been used to reduce the healthcare costs encouraging continuity of care. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of a virtual reality rehabilitation system in improving cognitive function in stroke survivors. Forty patients affected by stroke were enrolled in this study and randomized into either the control or the experimental groups in order of recruitment. The study lasted 6 months, and included two phases: (1) during the first phase the experimental group underwent cognitive rehabilitation training using the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System-Evo, whereas the control group was submitted to standard cognitive training; (2) in the second phase (after discharge), the experimental group was treated by means of virtual reality rehabilitation system Home Tablet (three sessions a week, each session lasting about 50 minutes), and the control group continued the traditional training, with the same amount of treatment. The patients underwent a neuropsychological evaluation before and at the end of the treatment. Linear mixed-effects analysis results showed that the scores of Montreal overall cognitive assessment, attentive matrices. Trail Making Test B, Phonemic Fluency, Semantic Fluency, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test I, Hamilton Rating Scale-Anxiety and Hamilton Rating Scale-Depression were affected by the type of the rehabilitative treatment. Our data show the effectiveness of telerehabilitation for the treatment of cognitive disorders following stroke. Copyright (C) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.";2019;4
Presently, we are observing an explosion of data that need to be stored and processed over the Internet, and characterized by large volume, velocity and variety. For this reason, software developers have begun to look at NoSQL solutions for data storage. However, operations that are trivial in traditional Relational DataBase Management Systems (DBMSs) can become very complex in NoSQL DBMSs. This is the case of the join operation to establish a connection between two or more DB structures, whose construct is not explicitly available in many NoSQL databases. As a consequence, the data model has to be changed or a set of operations have to be performed to address particular queries on data. Thus, open questions are: how do NoSQL solutions work when they have to perform join operations on data that are not natively supported? What is the quality of NoSQL solutions in such cases? In this paper, we deal with such issues specifically considering one of the major NoSQL document oriented DB available on the market: MongoDB. In particular, we discuss an approach to perform join operations at application layer in MongoDB that allows us to preserve data models. We analyse performance of the proposes approach discussing the introduced overhead in comparison with SQL-like DBs.;2019;4
Purpose of Review The progressive nature of dementia requires ongoing care delivered by multidisciplinary teams, including rehabilitation professionals, that is individualized to patient and caregiver needs at various points on the disease trajectory. Video telehealth is a rapidly expanding model of care with the potential to expand dementia best practices by increasing the reach of dementia providers to flexible locations, including patients' homes. We review recent evidence for in-home video telehealth for patients with dementia and their caregivers with emphasis on implications for rehabilitation professionals. Recent Findings Eleven studies were identified that involved video visits into the home targeting patients with dementia and/or their family caregivers. The majority describe protocolized interventions targeting caregivers in a group format over a finite, pre-determined period. For most, the discipline of the interventionist was unclear, though two studies included rehabilitation interventions. While descriptions of utilized technology were often lacking, many reported that devices were issued to participants when needed and that technical support was provided by study teams. Positive caregiver outcomes were noted but evidence for patient-level outcomes and cost data are mostly lacking. More research is needed to demonstrate implementation of dementia best care practices through in-home video telehealth. Though interventions delivered using in-home video telehealth appear to be effective in addressing caregivers' psychosocial concerns, the impact on patients and the implications for rehabilitation remain unclear. Larger, more systematic inquiries comparing in-home video telehealth to traditional visit formats are needed to better define best practices.;2019;4
Purpose of ReviewMobile health (mHealth) interventions may be useful for individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but there is minimal knowledge regarding how mHealth technology is currently being used for TBI treatment or rehabilitation. The purpose of this review is to examine the extant literature on the use of mHealth for intervention delivery in order to identify considerations for using mHealth with the TBI population, and to provide recommendations for further study.Recent FindingsConsistent with recent literature in other disability populations, mHealth shows promise for people with TBI as a compensatory strategy for cognitive impairment, a method for monitoring and reducing symptoms, and a means of addressing goals in social and educational spheres.SummaryIn this review article, we summarize the results of 16 articles on mHealth interventions for individuals with TBI, highlighting relevant findings for clinical application and discussing challenges unique to the use of mHealh post-TBI.;2019;4
"Purpose The burden of musculoskeletal conditions, particularly osteoarthritis (OA), is expected to increase in coming decades as the world's population ages, and obesity rates continue to rise. Self-management via lifestyle interventions, such as exercise and physical activity, is integral to minimizing pain and maintaining physical function, yet access to qualified health professionals for evidence-based advice and support is difficult for many people. This article discusses how technology provides new opportunities for delivering physiotherapy services remotely to people with persistent joint pain, through telephone, and internet-mediated video conferencing. Methods The evidence for effectiveness of such service models is reviewed. Key challenges to implementation are discussed, and future directions for research in the field are highlighted. Results There is emerging evidence that the provision of care via telephone and internet-mediated video technologies is effective for, and acceptable to, people with OA. Advantages include its convenience and accessibility, as well as the hands-off nature of consultations. Challenges include patient safety and privacy and workforce willingness and capacity to deliver care via non-traditional methods. Conclusions Using technology to deliver physiotherapy services to people with OA is feasible and acceptable to users; however, further research is required to expand the evidence-base for remotely-delivered physiotherapy service models.";2019;4
Purpose: A motivational surrounding is desirable in stroke rehabilitation considering the need to train repetitively to improve balance, even after discharge from rehabilitation facilities. This review aims to investigate whether it is feasible to combine virtual reality (VR) which allows exercising in game-like environments with tele-rehabilitation in a community-dwelling stroke population. Methods: Literature searches were conducted in five databases, for example, PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) and non-RCT investigating feasibility and effectiveness of VR-based tele-rehabilitation were included. Based on the risk of bias and study design, methodological quality is ranked according to the GRADE guidelines. Results: Seven studies (n=120) were included, of which four are RCTs. Evidence regarding therapy adherence and perceived enjoyment of VR, as well as a cost-benefit of tele-rehabilitation emphasizes feasibility. Equal effects are reported comparing this approach to a therapist-supervised intervention in the clinical setting on balance and functional mobility. Conclusions: Tele-rehabilitation could be a promising tool to overcome burdens that restrict accessibility to rehabilitation in the future. VR can increase motivation allowing longer and more training sessions in community-dwelling stroke survivors. Therefore, combining the benefits of both approaches seems convenient. Although evidence is still sparse, functional improvements seem to be equal compared to a similar intervention with therapist-supervision in the clinic, suggesting that for cost-efficient rehabilitation parts of therapy can be transferred to the homes.;2019;4
Purpose: Although rural and remote residents face general challenges accessing health care in comparison to urban dwellers, care for musculoskeletal conditions like chronic back disorders (CBD) is particularly challenging for rural and remote residents due to lack of access to physical yherapists. Telerehabilitation such as secure videoconferencing offers one solution to this disparity in rural care delivery, but incorporating the perspectives of health practitioners and patients is important when developing new sustainable care models. Patients and methods: This study investigated the experiences of practitioners and patients during a novel interprofessional model of assessment where an urban-based physical therapist used videoconferencing to virtually join a rural nurse practitioner and a rural patient with CBD. Patient surveys and semi-structured interviews of practitioners and patients were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: Most patients were very satisfied (62.1%) or satisfied (31.6%) with the overall experience, and very (63.1%) or somewhat (36.9%) confident with the assessment. Thematic analysis of interviews revealed that this novel assessment method identified: access to care for CBD, effective interprofessional practice, enhanced clinical care for CBD, and technology considerations. Conclusion: Patient satisfaction with the telerehabilitation model of care was high. Patients and practitioners reported their experiences were impacted by access to care, interprofessional practice, enhanced care for CBD and technology. These findings will be useful in the development of patient-centered models of care utilizing telehealth strategies.;2019;4
Purpose: Aphasia group therapy can result in improvements in communication, participation and quality of life (QOL). However, evidence for aphasia group interventions with combined aims across the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is limited. TeleGAIN is a holistic aphasia group intervention that can be delivered via telepractice. This study builds on prior pilot work and addresses the need for additional research into the effectiveness of TeleGAIN. The aim of this study was to describe changes in aphasia severity, communication related QOL and participation, for people with chronic aphasia following TeleGAIN. Method: Nineteen participants with aphasia were assessed on a range of outcome measures before and after a twelve-week block of TeleGAIN delivered via web based videoconferencing. Treatment provided opportunities to participate in conversation, engage with others with aphasia and complete functional communication activities. Result: Statistical analyses revealed statistically significant improvements in communication related QOL, increased engagement in communicative activities, and decreased aphasia severity. Conclusion: Results from this study suggest that the online delivery of a multi-purpose group intervention for people with aphasia can result in improved communication, communicative participation, and QOL. It also highlights the potential for intervention provided via telepractice to offer an alternative to face-to-face services.;2019;4
Purpose: Aphasia group therapy offers many benefits, however people with aphasia report difficulty accessing groups and speech-language pathologists are faced with many challenges in providing aphasia group therapy. Telerehabilitation may offer an alternative service delivery option. An online aphasia group therapy program - Telerehabilitation Group Aphasia Intervention and Networking (TeleGAIN) - has been developed according to the guidelines of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of TeleGAIN and the results of a pilot trial to determine feasibility and acceptability. Method: The development of TeleGAIN was informed through literature reviews in relevant topic areas, consideration of expert opinion and application of the social cognitive theory. TeleGAIN was then modelled through a feasibility pilot trial with four people with aphasia. Result: TeleGAIN appeared to be feasible and acceptable to participants and able to be implemented as planned. Participant satisfaction with treatment was high and results suggested some potential for improvements in language functioning and communication-related quality of life. Conclusion: TeleGAIN appeared to be feasible and acceptable, however the study highlighted issues related to technology, clinical implementation and participant-specific factors that should be addressed prior to a larger trial.;2019;4
Purpose: Providing care to older adults using assistive technology can be challenging for family caregivers. To inform the development of an Internet-based intervention, this study aimed to identify older assistive technology users and family caregivers' needs related to assistive technology procurement, and to explore how to offer remote support through an Internet-based intervention. Methods: Based on an iterative user-centered design approach, 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders about their experiences with assistive technology procurement/attribution and their perceptions of a proposed intervention. A modified content analysis approach was used, with a mix of emerging and a priori concepts. Results: Participants view assistive technology procurement as an ongoing cyclical process, with potential unmet needs at key moments before and after assistive technology procurement. Assistive technology user-family caregiver dyads needs focus on assistive technology information, access, assistive technologyperson-context match, training and support. While participants felt there were benefits to the proposed intervention they also identified potential implementation barriers. Conclusion: Assistive technology Internet-based interventions dedicated to family caregivers should ensure systematic and tailored follow-up while integrating some form of human support. This study guides the prototype design of the proposed intervention towards a graded support approach, empowering assistive technology users and family caregivers to resolve assistive technology-related challenges.;2019;4
"Purpose: This study aimed to determine the feasibility of delivering a group speech maintenance programme (eLoud and Proud) to people with Parkinson?s disease via telerehabilitation. Method: Treatment was delivered to eight participants who had previously received LSVT LOUD?. The programme focussed on using a ?loud? voice within conversational and cognitively loaded tasks, and was delivered in two 90-minute sessions per week for four weeks. Data pertaining to sound pressure level (SPL) (for sustained phonation, reading and monologue tasks), maximum frequency range, maximum phonation duration and impact of dysarthria on quality of life were collected at three time points: (1) pre-treatment (PRE); (2) immediately post-treatment (POST); and (3) three months post-treatment (FU). Participant satisfaction with telerehabilitation was also obtained at POST. Result: Significant improvements were identified for all SPL measures PRE-POST and maintained for sustained phonation and reading tasks at FU. No significant differences were identified for the remaining outcome measures. Participants were overall highly satisfied with telerehabilitation and considered it to be an acceptable alternative to traditional service delivery. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the feasibility of delivering group speech maintenance therapy via telerehabilitation, and the potential for eLoud and Proud to improve and maintain vocal loudness in people with PD.";2019;4
Questions: Can people referred to pulmonary rehabilitation easily learn to use a system for remote transmission of oximetry data? Do they consider remote transmission of oximetry data to be satisfactory? Are the transmitted data valid compared with locally stored data? Design: Multicentre, prospective, observational study. Participants: One hundred and five adults with chronic respiratory disease who were referred to pulmonary rehabilitation. Intervention: At an initial session, participants were taught to record and transmit their oximetry data to a remote server. At subsequent testing session(s), participants were requested to independently activate and use the oximetry monitoring system for a period of exercise on a cycle ergometer, until autonomy with the system was demonstrated. A subgroup of five participants undertook five 45-minute training sessions to generate a dataset to assess whether the transmitted data were valid compared with the locally stored data. Outcome measures: Outcome measures included the number of sessions needed to become autonomous, participant satisfaction with the system, and measures of the validity of the transmitted data. Results: Participants became autonomous quickly: 86% at the first testing session and 100% within three testing sessions. At least 98% of participants agreed that the system was easy to use and they would be willing to use it throughout pulmonary rehabilitation. The system transmitted usable data from 98% (95% CI 96 to 100) of sessions and introduced minimal artefact. Mean absolute differences were 0.365 beats/minute for heart rate and 0.133% for oxyhaemoglobin saturation. For heart rate, exact agreement was 72% (SD 9) and similar agreement (within 3 beats/minute) was 99% (SD 1). For oxyhaemoglobin saturation, exact agreement was 87% (SD 3) and similar agreement (within 3%) was 100% (SD 0). Conclusion: The telemonitoring system used in this study was sufficiently valid and acceptable for use in at-home pulmonary rehabilitation by people with chronic respiratory disease.

Recent increases in demand for post-stroke motor rehabilitation services together with limited time of therapist and accessibility issues, in particular for patients living in remote areas, have created a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Semi-autonomous techniques that allow for sharing the time of a therapist between multiple patients have attracted great interest. Among them Learning from Demonstration (LfD) based robots have been studied as solutions to address this growing demand. In this work, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) based LfD approach are proposed to generate a versatile framework to deliver rehabilitation in the absence of the therapist. To collect data for training the models, a bilateral telerehabilitation system is used to enable patient-therapist collaborative task performance is one Degree of Freedom (DOF). The performance and generalizability of the trained model are demonstrated for a variety of patient actions.;2019;4
Rehabilitation in healthcare systems provides therapy and training to restore quality life after certain illness, addiction or accident. Currently, there is a significant unmet need for rehabilitation services, and it is frequently undervalued in the health system. As populations age and the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and injuries increases, and the demand for rehabilitation grows, strengthening rehabilitation in health systems becomes ever more paramount. Conventional rehabilitation service can be costly and time consuming to people not living near the rehabilitation centres. Often people with lower income who live in rural areas refuse rehabilitation services due to the logistic issue. On the other hand, in urban areas, most people are too busy with their daily activities and unable to keep their therapy schedule consistently. In consequence, patients do not enjoy the actual benefit of rehabilitation because of a certain limitation such as cost and time. These limitations can be surpassed by putting telerehabilitation, an emerging area of performing rehabilitation medical treatment with the use of technology from a distance into practice. Scientific studies of telerehabilitation in the current literature are discussing primarily in the area of readiness, technologies, and illnesses such as children autism and heart failure. However, there is limited evidence about telerehabilitation service for stroke patients, concentrating on the pre-implementation and implementation stages, which makes this paper viable and significant, potentially for telerehabilitation implementation in Malaysia. This paper proposes a new conceptual model of hybrid telerehabilitation that combines several technological principles, such as cloud, virtual reality, and computer-based system. The model was derived based on a study of a public tertiary hospital in Malaysia. The current traditional system was investigated and discussed. A new telerehabilitation model is proposed to widen the access for rehabilitation to patients of all ages.;2019;4
"Rehabilitation procedures recommended for developmental dyslexia (DD) are still not fully defined, and only few studies directly compare different types of training. This study compared a training (Reading Trainer) working on the reading impairment with one (Run the RAN) working on the rapid automatized naming (RAN) impairment, one of the main cognitive deficits associated with DD. Two groups of DD children (N = 45) equivalent for age, sex, full IQ, and reading speed were trained either by Reading Trainer (n = 21) or by Run the RAN (n = 24); both trainings required an intensive home exercise, lasting 3 months. Both trainings showed significant improvements in reading speed and accuracy of passages and words. Bypassing the use of alphanumeric stimuli, but empowering the cognitive processes underlying reading, training RAN may be a valid tool in children with reading difficulties opening new perspectives for children with severe impairments or, even, at risk of reading difficulties.";2019;4
Stakeholder satisfaction is often considered a key to the success of telemedicine systems. However, it can be difficult to understand and compare satisfaction evaluations because of variations in reporting and study designs. This research will contribute to the knowledge by developing a conceptual framework around key concepts that relate to understanding studies on telemedicine satisfaction. The framework is built based on a developmental review of the telemedicine and telehealth literature obtained from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar. Using a conceptual matrix, researchers have synthesized the results into a framework that includes: satisfaction dimensions, stakeholders, type of care, type of system, context and methodologies. This research expands these concepts by discussing attributes of each and tests the framework by conducting a pilot study that identifies the concepts in primary study sources. The results of the framework and the pilot study are reported.;2019;4
Studies on validation of telerehabilitation as an effective platform to help manage as well as reduce burden of care for Low-Back Pain (LBP) are sparse. This study compared the effects of Telerehabilitation-Based McKenzie Therapy (TBMT) and Clinic-Based McKenzie Therapy (CBMT) among patients with LBP. Forty-seven consenting patients with chronic LBP who demonstrated 'directional preference' for McKenzie Extension Protocol (MEP) completed this quasi experimental study. The participants were assigned into either the CBMT or TBMT group using block permuted randomization. Participants in the CBMT and TBMT groups received MEP involving a specific sequence of lumbosacral repeated movements in extension aimed to centralize, decrease, or abolish symptoms, thrice weekly for eight weeks. TBMT is a comparable version of CBMT performed in the home with the assistance of a mobile phone app. Outcomes were assessed at the 4th and 8th weeks of the study in terms of Pain Intensity (PI), Back Extensors Muscles' Endurance (BEME), Activity Limitation (AL), Participation Restriction (PR), and General Health Status (GHS). Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at p<0.05. Within-group comparison across baseline, 4th and 8th weeks indicate that both CBMT and TBMT had significant effects on PI (p=0.001), BEME (p=0.001), AL (p=0.001), PR (p=0.001) and GHS (p=0.001) respectively. However, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) in the treatment effects between TBMT and CBMT, except for 'vitality' (p=0.011) scale in the GHS where TBMT led to significantly higher mean score. Mobile-app platform of the McKenzie extension protocol has comparable clinical outcomes with the traditional clinic-based McKenzie Therapy, and thus is an effective supplementary platform for care of patients with low-back pain.;2019;4
Successful rehabilitation of oropharyngeal swallowing disorders (i.e., dysphagia) requires frequent performance of head/neck exercises that primarily rely on expensive biofeedback devices, often only available in large medical centers. This directly affects treatment compliance and outcomes, and highlights the need to develop a portable and inexpensive remote monitoring system for the telerehabilitation of dysphagia. Here, we present the development and preliminarily validation of a skin-mountable sensor patch that can fit on the curvature of the submental (under the chin) area non-invasively and provide simultaneous remote monitoring of muscle activity and laryngeal movement during swallowing tasks and maneuvers. This sensor patch incorporates an optimal design that allows for the accurate recording of submental muscle activity during swallowing and is characterized by ease of use, accessibility, reusability, and cost-effectiveness. Preliminary studies on a patient with Parkinson's disease and dysphagia, and on a healthy control participant demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this system.;2019;4
Telehealth is an alternative method of delivering health care to people required to travel long distances for routine health care. The aim of this systematic review was to examine whether patients and their caregivers living in rural and remote areas are satisfied with telehealth videoconferencing as a mode of service delivery in managing their health. A protocol was registered with PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (#CRD42017083597) and conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A systematic search of Ovid Medline, Embase, CINAHL, ProQuest Health Research Premium Collection, Joanna Briggs Institute and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Studies of people living in rural and remote areas who attended outpatient appointments for a health condition via videoconference were included if the studies measured patient and/or caregivers' satisfaction with telehealth. Data on satisfaction was extracted and descriptively synthesised. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using a modified version of the McMaster Critical Review Forms for Quantitative or Qualitative Studies. Thirty-six studies of varying study design and quality met the inclusion criteria. The outcomes of satisfaction with telehealth were categorised into system experience, information sharing, consumer focus and overall satisfaction. There were high levels of satisfaction across all these dimensions. Despite these positive findings, the current evidence base lacks clarity in terms of how satisfaction is defined and measured. People living in rural and remote areas are generally satisfied with telehealth as a mode of service delivery as it may improve access to health care and avoid the inconvenience of travel.;2019;4
Telemedicine and remote monitoring represent more than the communication of health data via a 'remote connection'. Modern systems can be stand-alone and can be equipped with the ability to acquire and summarize data in order to inform the patient, carer or health care giver. The information can be held locally or be shared with a health care centre. Contemporary telemedicine and telemonitoring solutions have shifted their focus, trying to work on a system which is ubiquitous, efficient and sustainable. Along with devices that collect and elaborate data, a new generation of plug and play sensors has also come to life, which with standardization can lower management costs and make introduction into practice more feasible. Multiple trials (TIM-HF, TEN-HMS and BEAT.HF) have reported varying outcomes, depending on the monitoring system and the background health care process. A special mention is necessary for home tele-rehabilitation programmes for patients with heart failure. Despite the progress obstacles remain, including adequate training, data ownership and handling and applicability to larger populations. This article will review contemporary advances in this area.;2019;4
TeleRehab enables the rehabilitation services to be delivered in distance by providing information exchange between patient with disabilities and the clinical professionals. The readiness step in any adoption of healthcare services should always be one of the requirements for a successful implementation of an innovation. However, little scholarly has been undertaken to study its influence on TeleRehab and the various barrier factors that influence its adoption. This research explores the barrier factors that influence the readiness of healthcare institution to adopt TeleRehab. This paper presents a semi-structured interview involving 23 clinical professionals of a case study on the issues of TeleRehab readiness in one rehabilitation centre in Malaysia. By applying thematic analysis, the study uncovers seven barriers that affect the TeleRehab readiness. This includes barriers of no urgency to change, less awareness, less involvement in planning, not enough exposure on e-Healthcare knowledge, resistance to change, low usage of hardware and software, and less connectivity. The study contributes to both TeleRehab management and technology readiness research in hospitals.;2019;4
Telerehabilitation (TR) has gained attention as a promising rehabilitation format. Our study examined how patients responded to TR and whether it provided adequate support for their lifestyle changes and self-care efforts when compared to conventional rehabilitation (CR). Cardiac patients (n = 136) were randomly assigned to a TR or CR group. The TR group was provided with relevant health care technology for a period of three months, and both groups filled in questionnaires on their motivation for lifestyle changes and self-care psychological distress, and quality of life at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients in both groups were found to be equally motivated for lifestyle changes and self-care (p < 0.05) and they experienced similar levels of psychological distress and quality of life. TR is comparable to conventional rehabilitation in motivating patients, preventing psychological distress and improving quality of life. Although we observed an initial increase in autonomous motivation in the telerehabilitation group, this positive difference in motivation does not last over time. As such, neither rehabilitation format seems able to ensure long-term motivation. Therefore, TR may serve as a viable replacement for conventional rehabilitation when considered relevant. Further research is needed to enhance long-term motivation, and maybe telerehabilitation can help to achieve this.;2019;4
Telerehabilitation in older adults is most needed in the patient environments, rather than in formal ambulatories or hospitals. Supporting such practices brings significant advantages to patients, their family, formal and informal caregivers, clinicians, and researchers. This paper presents a focus group with experts in physiotherapy and telerehabilitation, debating on the requirements, current techniques and technologies developed to facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of telerehabilitation, and the still open challenges. Particular emphasis is given to (i) the body-parts requiring the most rehabilitation, (ii) the typical environments, initial causes, and general conditions, (iii) the values and parameters to be observed, (iv) common errors and limitations of current practices and technological solutions, and (v) the envisioned and desired technological support. Consequently, it has been performed a systematic review of the state of the art, investigating what types of systems and support currently cope with telerehabilitation practices and possible matches with the outcomes of the focus group. Technological solutions based on video analysis, wearable devices, robotic support, distributed sensing, and gamified telerehabilitation are examined. Particular emphasis is given to solutions implementing agent-based approaches, analyzing and discussing strength, limitations, and future challenges. By doing so, it has been possible to relate functional requirements expressed by professional physiotherapists and researchers, with the need for extending multi-agent systems (MAS) peculiarities at the sensing level in wearable solutions establishing new research challenges. In particular, to be employed in safety-critical cyber-physical scenarios with user-sensor and sensor-sensor interactions, MAS are requested to handle timing constraints, scarcity of resources and new communication means, crucial to providing real-time feedback and coaching. Therefore, MAS pillars such as the negotiation protocol and the agent's internal scheduler have been investigated, proposing solutions to achieve the aforementioned real-time compliance.;2019;4
Telerehabilitation is defined as delivery of rehabilitation services over telecommunication networks and the internet, which comprise of clinical assessment (the patients functional abilities in his or her environment) and clinical therapy. This new area of medical advancement, using state of the art technology is developing at a great speed and is definitely going to be the next milestone in health care revolution. The objective of this study was to explore the awareness, knowledge and perception of the patients for using telerehabilitation as a medium to provide physiotherapy services as a part of home healthcare services. A pretest-post test design was used where the home healthcare patients (n = 90) aged between 50-75 years were asked to express views by given a validated modified TUQ questionnaire followed by an in depth interviewing to develop a key understanding regarding the themes. Interviews were transcribed and a qualitative thematic analysis was conducted. The awareness level regarding the telerehabilitation changed significantly from 57% to 96% post session(p<0.05). Similarly, the knowledge of the participants regarding online consultation, followup and online therapy changed significantly from 50%, 47% and 57% to 96%, 76% and 96% respectively post session of rehabilitation(p<0.05). The perception level regarding the key benefits including its usage in emergency(83%), convenience of no travel(84%), ease of getting treated at home(97%) and availability of specialist consultation (84%) were the prime ideas for excellent rating among 95% participants (p<0.05) post session. Findings are helpful to health practitioners in designing their intervention programsacross the kingdom. However the actual impact could be only derived from future studies which has to conducted based on different clinical conditions.;2019;4
Telerehabilitation or known as TeleRehab offers better cost-effectiveness in healthcare service delivery over distance for patients with disabilities. Most of the TeleRehab studies focused on its benefits, applications, and methods in delivering services. However, there is still a limited number of studies discussing the significance of success/failure factors that influence the healthcare personnel for TeleRehab. The identification of these factors that affect TeleRehab may avert project failure. A systematic review was conducted from five digital databases including ScienceDirect, Scopus, IEEE, Springer, and PubMed. The manual type of searching also conducted. There are 1283 of total potential papers were identified. 735 papers have gone through the inclusive and exclusive criteria, and quality assessment process which leaves 12 papers for further review. The result shows that there are three success factors and nine failure factors that can be considered as important. The success factors include satisfaction and willingness, cost/ financial benefits, and e-healthcare knowledge. The failure factors include resistance to change, lack of knowledge, financial limitation, lack of awareness, less use of hardware and software, lack of skill optimizing, connectivity issues, less involvement in planning, and less of training. This review provides a synthesis of the literature of success/failure factors among healthcare personnel for TeleRehab.;2019;4
Tele-rehabilitation provides remote physiotherapy services for patients who have limited access to hospitals. This paper proposes a sensorless tele-rehabilitation system for the upper-limb using two robots in master-slave configuration. The system provides a transparent haptic feeling between the therapist and the patient by simultaneous tracking of both position and torque. The torque is measured using the reaction torque observer. Furthermore, an online recursive numerical parameter estimation method is proposed to identify the gravity disturbance in bilateral teleoperation. The system automatically estimates the parameters using the reaction torque observer output's data while the therapist is delivering remote physiotherapy services. The estimated gravity torque is compensated in the system as an improvement of the transparency of the teleoperated system. Therefore the therapist would feel only the abnormalities of the patient's arm. Estimated parameters automatically update the system and enhance the performance. The proposed method was practically verified with a master slave tele-rehabilitation system. Results suggest the applicability of the proposed method.;2019;4
Telerehabilitation refers to the virtual delivery of rehabilitation services into the patient's home. This methodology has shown to be advantageous when used to enhance or replace conventional therapy to overcome geographic, physical, and cognitive barriers. The exponential growth of technology has led to the development of new applications that enable health care providers to monitor, educate, treat, and support patients in their own environment. Best practices and well-designed Telerehabilitation studies are needed to build and sustain a strong Telerehabilitation system that is integrated in the current health care structure and is cost-effective.;2019;4
The development of telerehabilitation and virtual assistive devices is an active research area. The delivery of rehabilitation service to a patient's home or a remote clinic could result in tremendous savings in cost, effort, and human resources. Currently, most existing telerehabilitation systems need some human intervention, and require the patients to place on their body complex and expensive sensors. This work investigates whether the Leap Motion, a low-cost, non-intrusive, motion tracking device, can be a viable source to be used in telerehabilitation and similar applications. Experiments with various hand movements were carried out, with positional and velocity-related parameters tracked, captured, and analyzed.;2019;4
"The goal of a telerehabilitation platform is to safely and securely facilitate the rehabilitation of patients through the use of telecommunication technologies complemented with the use of biomedical smart sensors. The purpose of this study was to perform a usability evaluation of a telerehabilitation platform. To improve the level of usability, the researchers developed and proposed an iterative process. The platform uses a digital representation of the patient which duplicates the therapeutic exercise being executed by the patient; this is detected by a Kinect camera and sensors in real time. This study used inspection methods to perform a usability evaluation of an exploratory prototype of a telerehabilitation platform. In addition, a cognitive workload assessment was performed to complement the usability evaluation. Users were involved through all the stages of the iterative refinement process. Usability issues were progressively reduced from the first iteration to the fourth iteration according to improvements which were developed and applied by the experts. Usability issues originally cataloged as catastrophic were reduced to zero, major usability problems were reduced to ten (2.75%) and minor usability problems were decreased to 141 (38.74%). This study also intends to serve as a guide to improve the usability of e-Health systems in alignment with the software development cycle.";2019;4
The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of digital health supported targeted patient communication versus usual provision of health information, on the recovery of fragility fractures. The review considered studies including older people, aged 50 and above, with a fragility fracture. The primary outcome was prevention of secondary fractures by diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, and its adherence. This review considered both experimental and quasi-experimental study designs. A comprehensive search strategy was built to identify key terms including Medical subject headings (MeSH) and applied to the multiple electronic databases. An intention to treat analysis was applied to those studies included in the meta-analysis and odds ratio was calculated with random effects. Altogether, 15 studies were considered in the final stage for this systematic review. Out of these, 10 studies were Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and five were quasi experimental studies, published between the years 2003 and 2016 with a total of 5037 participants. Five Randomised control trails were included in the meta-analysis suggesting that digital health supported interventions were overall, twice as effective when compared with the usual standard care (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.30-3.48), despite the population sample not being homogeneous. Findings from the remaining studies were narratively interpreted.;2019;4
The reason for this review based on the results of many meta-analyses is the great assessed difference in the methods of most studies in e-Health, telemedicine and tele-rehabilitation. It consists of different understanding of new terms, using different hard-and software, including criteria, different methodology of patient's treatment and its evaluation. This status suggests that first of all m-Health/e-Health requires a unique ontology of terms using and methodology of studies comparing. In this review we try to describe shortly the most significant points of modern e-Health field of medicine. The basic parts include methodology of review formation, tele-communication implementation results, tele-education, interactive questioning, tele-consultation, telemedicine diagnosis, tele-monitoring, rehabilitation and tele-rehabilitation, gamification, acceptability of mobile electronic devices and software in e-Health and planning studies. At the end of the review the new ontological structure of digital medicine is presented.;2019;4
The spreading diffusion of wireless devices and the crowded coexistence of multimedia applications greedy of bandwidth and with strict requirements stress the service provisioning offered by wireless technologies. WiFi is a reference for wireless connectivity and it requires a continuous evolution of its mechanism in order to follow increasingly demanding service needs. In particular, despite the evolution of physical layer, some critical contexts, such as industrial networks, telemedicine, telerehabilitation, and virtual training, require further refined improvements in order to ensure the respect of strict real-time service requirements. In this paper an in-depth analysis of Dynamic TXOP HCCA (DTH) MAC enhanced centralized scheduler is illustrated and it is further refined introducing a new improvement, DTH with threshold. DTH and DTH with threshold can be integrated with preexisting centralized schedulers in order to improve their performances, without any overprovisioning that can negatively impact on the admission control feasibility test. Indeed, without modifying the centralized scheduler policy, they combine together the concepts of reclaiming transmission time and statistical estimation of the traffic profile in order to provide, at each polling, an instantaneous transmission time tailored to the variable traffic requirements, increasing, when necessary, the service data rate. These mechanisms can coexist with advanced physical layer-based solutions, providing the required service differentiation. Experimental results and theoretical analysis, based on elastic scheduler theory, show that they are effective especially in the case of Variable Bit Rate traffic streams in terms of transmission queues length, packets loss, delay, and throughput.;2019;4
The study of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research, and in numerous applied fields such as comparative genomics, evolutionary biology, pan genomics, genetics of disease, regulation of gene expression, oncology and many others, all supported by bioinformatics. In the era of Cloud computing, federating the Cloud systems of different genetics research organisations paves the way towards a new era of data sharing and new mashup services and applications. However, due to the huge amount of genomics data (genomics Big Data) that have to be managed, a parallel distributed NoSQL DataBase Management System (DBMS) approach becomes fundamental. Specifically, due to the textual nature of genomics data, a NoSQL DBMS appears to be the most suitable solution. In this paper, by considering the whole human genome, we present a preliminary study comparing this latter using MongoDB with a SQL-like database solution, i.e., MySQL in order to look for DNA sequences. Moreover, in order to optimize the research of genomics codes, we adopt hash functions that allow mapping nucleotides sequences of arbitrary size onto data of a fixed smaller size. Experiments, shows that MongoDB apart simplifying the management of genomics data provides better performances.;2019;4
The use of telehealth as a service delivery method for early intervention (EI) is in its infancy and few studies have examined its use within the context of a statewide program. The focus of this report was to determine the factors that influence providers' utilization of telehealth in Colorado's Part C Early Intervention program (EI Colorado). This report presents information that was gathered through surveys sent to Part C program administrators, service coordinators, providers, and caregivers. Surveys were used to understand perceptions of telehealth, actual experiences with telehealth, and perceived benefits and challenges using this service delivery method. Follow-up focus groups were conducted with program administrators and family members to gather more nuanced information. Participants identified several benefits associated with telehealth including its flexibility, access to providers, and more family engagement. The primary barriers included access to high speed internet and the opinion that telehealth was not as effective as in-person treatment. The results in the report served to identify next steps in the implementation of telehealth in Colorado's Part C EI program.;2019;4
The validity and reliability of using the Kinect camera to measure standardized assessment of transitional movement, stepping, and balance was systematically reviewed and critically appraised for quality of the methods and results. The study made recommendations of specific tests for practice based on inclusion of both validity and reliability testing as well as quality of results. Authors' willingness to share their software was reported. Translation into practice is limited by lack of redundancy among studies and access to the software to implement the tests.;2019;4
There is a growing and significant interest in home-based therapy or telerehabilitation for physiological disabilities, for example, as a result of stroke. These technologies allow more flexibility in implementing rehabilitation sessions and offer the potential to reduce the economic burden of outpatient appointments and reduce the reliance on healthcare systems. However, extra effort needs to be made to make such systems effective. This paper investigates the feasibility of a home-based device, which is capable of detecting minute movements of patients' fingers in regular training and testing sessions, addressing ease of use, motivation of practice, as well as feedback and guidance on performance. Toward this aim, the measuring techniques that are compatible with these targets were investigated. Based on a customizable three-layer electrodes design for use with an MGC3030 motion sensor IC, a finite-element method simulation in COMSOL Multiphysics and a nonlinear regression analysis using MATLAB were carried out. Four nonlinear equations were introduced to describe the motion of the index and middle fingers in the electrical field (E-field) generated. The form of the prediction models agrees with the hypothesis based on the quasi-static E-field sensing theory. In addition, these prediction models fit well with the relationship between finger distance and the voltage signals detected. With the prediction model, the targeted system is capable of detecting combined movements of two fingers at a resolution of 0.94 mm in a portable smart device for robust hand rehabilitation.;2019;4
This paper introduces a framework for building adaptive serious games in the context of telerehabilitation. This framework takes advantage of 3D motion tracking and virtual reality devices, to present a personalized and adaptive gaming system, which allows patients to perform exercises as suggested by their physiotherapy experts, while being fully engaged in a gamified 3D scene. Virtual characters are dynamically displayed within scenes to guide users through the different set of required gestures. Virtual assistants have the ability to learn and adapt to the best level of difficulty in real-time based on the user performance. An intelligent alerting and automatic correction components are embedded in our engine, so that pre-calculated gesture patterns are correlated and matched with patients' gestures. Consequently, the system estimates the perceived difficulty of gestures by the patient, so that automatic adjustments are executed to ensure a highly engaging and adaptive serious game experience. A pilot study has been conducted to prove the usability and effectiveness of our gamified physiotherapy solution.;2019;4
This paper introduces 'RehaBot', a framework for building adaptive serious games in the context of telerehabilitation. RehaBot takes advantage of 3D motion tracking and virtual reality devices, to develop an immersive and gamified telerehabilitation environment. A personalized and adaptive gaming system is developed, which allows patients to perform exercises with the help of embedded virtual assistants, hereafter called 'rehab bots', that are dynamically displayed within scenes to guide the patient through the different sets of gestures required to complete the session. These rehab bots have the ability to learn and adapt to the best level of difficulty in real-time based on the user performance. An intelligent alerting and automatic correction technique is incorporated within our engine, so that pre-calculated gesture patterns are correlated and matched with patients' gestures. Consequently, the system estimates the perceived difficulty of gestures by the patient, and automatically adjusts the game behavior to ensure a highly engaging and adaptive gaming experience. Furthermore, multimodal instructions are conveyed to users with details on joints that are not performing as expected, and to guide them towards improving the current gesture. A pilot study has been conducted to prove the usability and effectiveness of our adaptive physiotherapy solution.;2019;4
This paper investigates the Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) for Multi-User Telerehabilitation Systems (MUTSs) which are modelled as Ito stochastic differential equations with the occurrence of actuator loss-of-effectiveness faults, directed link failures, communication noise, and disturbances. Furthermore, an active FTC strategy using an Adaptive Sliding Mode Control (ASMC) method is addressed. By employing such strategy, MUTSs achieve stochastic consensus in the mean square sense onto the predefined stochastic switching sliding surfaces in finite time. Finally, Stochastic Input-to-State Stability (SISS) of the systems' states (positions, velocities, and orientations) will be shown and a numerical simulation will be provided.;2019;4
"This paper presents a characterization of the wireless transmission of biomechanical signals in an embedded system, where a TCP protocol is used in an IEEE 802.11 communications network (Wi-Fi). The embedded system under study, called Imocap, allows the collection, analysis and transmission of biomechanical signals in real-time for various applications, among which the analysis of the movement of the lower and upper extremities and the operation of various control systems stand out. To accomplish this, Imocap is equipped with a Wi-Fi transceiver module (ESP8266) and various input and output peripherals. The wireless communication performance of Imocap, exposed in this paper, was analyzed through different tests in miscellaneous conditions like indoors, outdoors and in the presence of interference, noise and other wireless networks. The different test protocols conducted result in the Imocap system: 1) has a maximum effective range of 45.6 m when in Access Point mode; 2) has a maximum effective range of 44.3 m when in Station mode. In indoors and under the same conditions, the Imocap system: 3) has a maximum effective range of 81.25 m(2), either Access Point or Station mode. The results showed that the transmission of biomechanical information through Wi-Fi using the TCP protocol is efficient and robust, both indoors and outdoors, even in environments of radio frequency interference. The use of this protocol is emphasized since its use allows the transmission of packages to be carried out in a controlled manner, allowing the error handling and recovery. In this way, it is possible to carry out efficient and robust wireless communication through embedded and portable devices, focusing mainly on areas such as medicine, telemedicine and telerehabilitation.";2019;4
"This paper presents a user study to evaluate the system's performance by measuring objective indicators and subjective perception between the two versions of a planar rehabilitation robotic device: (i) PupArm system, called RoboTherapist 2D system for commercial purpose, designed and developed for clinical settings; and (ii) Homerehab system, developed for home use. Homerehab system is a home rehabilitation robotic platform developed inside the EU HOMEREHAB-Echord++ project framework. Nine patients with different neurological disorders participate in the study. Based on the analysis of subjective assessments of usability and the data acquired objectively by the robotic devices, we can conclude that the performance and user experience with both systems are very similar. This finding will be the base of more extensively studies to demonstrate that home-therapy with HomeRehab could be as efficient as therapy in clinical settings assisted by PupArm robot.";2019;4
This paper proposes a free dataset, available at the following link, 1 named KIMORE, regarding different rehabilitation exercises collected by a RGB-D sensor. Three data inputs including RGB, depth videos, and skeleton joint positions were recorded during five physical exercises, specific for low back pain and accurately selected by physicians. For each exercise, the dataset also provides a set of features, specifically defined by the physicians, and relevant to describe its scope. These features, validated with respect to a stereophotogrammetric system, can be analyzed to compute a score for the subject's performance. The dataset also contains an evaluation of the same performance provided by the clinicians, through a clinical questionnaire. The impact of KIMORE has been analyzed by comparing the output obtained by an example of rule and template-based approaches and the clinical score. The dataset presented is intended to be used as a benchmark for human movement assessment in a rehabilitation scenario in order to test the effectiveness and the reliability of different computational approaches. Unlike other existing datasets, the KIMORE merges a large heterogeneous population of 78 subjects, divided into 2 groups with 44 healthy subjects and 34 with motor dysfunctions. It provides the most clinically-relevant features and the clinical score for each exercise.;2019;4
This poster presents the design of a connected system for telerehabilitation for patients with obesity and the assessment of the system through a randomized qualitative study on a sample of 15 patients. The patients expressed positive motivation but negatively assessed (as a deficiency) the system operation. All patients found that the system was neither intuitive nor easy to use.;2019;4
"This study describes the features and utility of a novel augmented reality based telemedicine system with haptics that allows the sense of touch and direct physical examination during a synchronous immersive telemedicine consultation and physical examination. The system employs novel engineering features: (a) a new force enhancement algorithm to improve force rendering and overcoming the just-noticeable-difference limitation; (b) an improved force compensation method to reduce the delay in force rendering; (c) use of the haptic interface point to reduce disparity between the visual and haptic data; and (d) implementation of efficient algorithms to process, compress, decompress, transmit and render 3-D tele-immersion data. A qualitative pilot study (n=20) evaluated the usability of the system. Users rated the system on a 26-question survey using a seven-point Likert scale, with percent agreement calculated from the total users who agreed with a given statement. Survey questions fell into three main categories: (1) ease and simplicity of use, (2) quality of experience, and (3) comparison to in-person evaluation. Average percent agreements between the telemedicine and in-person evaluation were highest for ease and simplicity of use (86%) and quality of experience (85%), followed by comparison to in-person evaluation (58%). Eighty-nine percent (89%) of respondents expressed satisfaction with the overall quality of experience. Results suggest that the system was effective at conveying audio-visual and touch data in real-time across 20.3 miles, and warrants further development.";2019;4
This study evaluated the use of telerehabilitation during the postoperative period for patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Specifically, this study evaluated the following: (1) patient compliance and adherence to the program, (2) time spent performing physical therapy exercises, (3) the usability of the virtual rehabilitation platform, and (4) clinical outcome scores in a selected primary knee arthroplasty cohort. A total of 157 consecutive patients underwent TKA (n = 18) or UKA (n = 139). These patients used a telerehabilitation system with an instructional avatar, three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis software, and real-time televisit capability designed for arthroplasty patients. Compliance was determined by how many times the patients followed prescribed repetitions of exercises. The total time spent performing exercises for each patient was collected. The usability of the virtual rehabilitation platform (on the patient's end) was evaluated using the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire. The number of in-person and televisits was recorded for each patient. Patient-reported outcomes were collected through the patient and clinician interfaces and included the Knee Society Score (KSS) for pain and functions, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and Boston University Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) score. Patients spent an average of 29.5 days partaking in the therapy. TKA and UKA patients had a mean of 3.5 and 3.2 outpatient follow-up visits, each, for in-office therapy with a physical therapist, respectively. This figure exceeded the mean number of real-time virtual patient-clinician visits by 0.8 visits per patient in the TKA cohort and by 1 visit per patient in the UKA cohort. Patients spent on average 26.5 minutes per day conducting an average of 13.5 exercises. By the end of rehabilitation, patients had spent an average of 10.8 hours performing exercises, and of all the exercises performed, approximately 21 exercises were uniquely designed. Mean SUS score in the cohort was 93 points, which was interpreted as being above the 50th percentile point of the scale. Following therapy, KSS pain and function scores improved markedly and the improvements were measured at 368% for TKA and 350% for UKA (pain) and 27% for UKA and 33% for TKA (function). In addition, WOMAC scores improved by 57% and 66% for UKA and TKA patients while the improvement in AM-PAC scores was at 22% and 24%. This telerehabilitation platform encouraged clinician-patient interaction beyond the hospital setting and offers the advantage of cost savings, convenience, at-home monitoring, and coordination of care, all of which are geared to improve adherence and overall patient satisfaction. Additionally, the biometric data can be used to develop custom physical therapy regimens to assure proper rehabilitation, which is lacking in other telerehabilitation applications that use noninteractive videos that can be watched on mobile devices and tablets.;2019;4
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is among the most common elective procedures performed worldwide. Recent efforts have been made to significantly improve patient outcomes, specifically with postoperative rehabilitation. Despite the many rehabilitation modalities available, the optimal rehabilitation strategy has yet to be determined. Therefore, this systematic review focuses on evaluating existing postoperative rehabilitation protocols. Specifically, this review analyses the study designs, rehabilitation methods, and outcome measures of postoperative rehabilitation protocols for TKA recipients in the past five years. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were queried for studies evaluating rehabilitation protocols following primary TKA. Of the 11,013 studies identified within the last five years, 70 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After assessing for relevance and removing duplicates, a final count of 20 studies remained for analysis. Level-of-evidence was determined by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) classification system. Our findings demonstrated that continuous passive motion and inpatient rehabilitation may not provide additional benefit to the patient or healthcare system. However, early rehabilitation, telerehabilitation, outpatient therapy, high intensity, and high velocity exercise may be successful forms of rehabilitation. Additionally, weight-bearing biofeedback, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and balance control appear to be beneficial adjuncts to conventional rehabilitation. Postoperative rehabilitation following TKA facilitates patient recovery and improves quality of life. This systematic review analyzed the existing rehabilitation protocols from the past five years. Some studies did not accurately describe the conventional rehabilitation protocols, the duration of therapy sessions, and the timing of these sessions. As such, future studies should explicitly describe their methodology. This will allow high-quality assessments and the conception of standardized protocols.;2019;4
"We investigated feasibility and preliminary effects of telerehabilitation for people living with HIV (PLWH) and taking antiretroviral therapy. We randomized 25 PLWH to either an endurance and resistance training exercise (ERTE) group or a control group. Endurance and resistance training exercise sessions occurred in a public fitness center, with online guidance and weekly telephone advice. The primary outcome was feasibility (recruitment and retention rates and safety). Secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6 weeks according to the three International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health domains. Nine patients completed the ERTE program. Recruitment and retention rates were 93% and 69%, respectively. No adverse events occurred. After 6 weeks, percentage change in D-dimer was lower in the ERTE group, but not significantly after the Bonferroni correction. Other parameters were not different between the groups. Therefore, telerehabilitation is feasible in PLWH taking antiretroviral therapy; however, the performance of the program is still questioned, and future research is warranted.";2019;4
While optical motion analysis systems can provide high-fidelity gait parameters, they are usually impractical for local clinics and home use, due to high cost, requirement for large space, and lack of portability. In this study, the authors focus on a cost-effective and portable, single-camera gait analysis solution, based on video acquisition with calibration, autonomous detection of frames-of-interest, Kalman-filter + structural-similarity-based marker tracking, and autonomous knee angle calculation. The proposed system is tested using 15 participants, including 10 stroke patients and 5 healthy volunteers. The evaluation of autonomous frames-of-interest detection shows only 0.2% difference between the frame number of the detected frame compared to the frame number of the manually labelled ground truth frame, and thus can replace manual labelling. The system is validated against a gold standard optical motion analysis system, using knee angle accuracy as metric of assessment. The accuracy investigation between the RGB- and the greyscale-video marker tracking schemes shows that the greyscale system suffers from negligible accuracy loss with a significant processing speed advantage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can automatically estimate the knee angle, with R-squared value larger than 0.95 and Bland-Altman plot results smaller than 3.0127 degrees mean error.;2019;4
With the heavy use of consumer electronic devices (CEDs) like smartphones, laptops, etc. in daily life, more and more people feel head, neck, and back pains because of long time poor body postures during the use of these devices. This paper presents a patients-robots-doctors architecture and designs a wearable robotic system for body postures monitoring, correction, and rehabilitation assist. The system mainly includes a wearable robotic device (WRD) and the CEDs. The WRD monitors the postures of body segments and reminds the user to correct bad postures. The posture data are sent to CEDs for processing and visualization. The data can also be uploaded to a cloud server for professional analysis by doctors. The human body posture is modeled and simulated to show that the different postures of the body segments have large effects on the torques and forces acting on the joints and muscles. A posture detection method is proposed and the WRD is designed. The basic functions of the architecture and system are verified by experiments including head-neck posture, back posture, sleeping posture, and leg posture monitoring and correction warning. The architecture and system can be utilized not only by the patients-doctors in telerehabilitation exercise assist but also by the parents-children in good sitting habits development, the athletes-coaches and bodybuilders-instructors in training efficiency improvement, etc.;2019;4
(1) Background: The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a virtual reality (VR) program, as a complementary tool to a conventional cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program in phase II of patients with ischemic heart disease compared to a conventional treatment group. (2) Methods: A single blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted. The patients were randomized to a control group (CG) or an experimental group (EG). The EG carried out a training based on VR of aerobic exercise using the XBOX ONE console and Kinect sensor. Ergometry, metabolic equivalents (METS), Functional Independence Measure, 6-min walk test (6MWT), the Short Form Health Survey-36 Questionnaire (SF-36), the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the degree of satisfaction and adherence to treatment were used as outcome measures. (3) Results: Our results showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Statistical analysis within group for the EG showed statistically significant changes in the variables HR final ergometry, ergometry minutes, % ergometry, METS, final HR 6MWT, 6MWT distance, 6MWT number of laps, and for the SF-36 and Beck Depression Inventory-II. (4) Conclusion: A VR-based video game program, as an adjunct tool to a CR program, showed improvements in ergometry, METS, resistance to fatigue and health-related quality of life with excellent adherence and satisfaction perceived by patients with ischemic heart disease in phase II.;2020;4
"(1) Telerehabilitation (TR) is a part of telemedicine involved in providing rehabilitation services to people in remote locations. TR in physical therapy in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is still in its infancy and its implementation may pose different challenges in the physical therapy settings. The purpose of this nation-wide survey is to explore physiotherapists (PTs) knowledge, attitudes, and barriers towards implementation of TR in physical therapy settings; (2) Methods: A 14 item questionnaire was developed and mailed to PTs working in hospitals and rehabilitation centers across 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia; (3) Results: 347 PTs responded. Results are as follows: 58.8% (n = 204) of PTs reported that they had sufficient knowledge about TR. About31.7% (n = 110) of PTs reported that their hospital and rehabilitation center had installed TR, yet only 19.9% (n = 69) utilized the TR facility. Image-based TR was more frequently used (n = 33) as compared to sensor-based TR (n = 29) and virtual reality TR (n = 10).The main barriers were technical issues and cost related to implement TR in physical therapy settings; and (4) Conclusions: There is a relatively high number of PTs with self-reported knowledge about TR, however facilities and usage were limited. The main barriers were technical issues, staff skills, and the high cost involved in the introduction of TR in the PT-based health care settings.";2020;4
A global pandemic of a new highly contagious disease called COVID-19 resulting from coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Cov-2) infection was declared in February 2020. Though primarily transmitted through the respiratory system, other organ systems in the body can be affected. Twenty percent of those affected require hospitalization with mechanical ventilation in severe cases. About half of the disease survivors have residual functional deficits that require multidisciplinary specialist rehabilitation. The workforce to deliver the required rehabilitation input is beyond the capacity of existing community services. Strict medical follow-up guidelines to monitor these patients mandate scheduled reviews within 12 weeks post discharge. Due to the restricted timeframe for these events to occur, existing care pathway are unlikely to be able to meet the demand. An innovative integrated post-discharge care pathway to facilitate follow up by acute medical teams (respiratory and intensive care) and a specialist multidisciplinary rehabilitation team is hereby proposed. Such a pathway will enable the monitoring and provision of comprehensive medical assessments and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. This paper proposes that a model of tele-rehabilitation is integrated within the pathway by using digital communication technology to offer quick remote assessment and efficient therapy delivery to these patients. Tele-rehabilitation offers a quick and effective option to respond to the specialist rehabilitation needs of COVID-19 survivors following hospital discharge.;2020;4
A platform offering web technologies and interoperable components is proposed, allowing integration of different technologies into a robust system. Key modules are provided in home, to support integration of IoT devices, and in the cloud, offering centralised services and storage. Communication between the two is performed using the open FIWARE-Orion protocol. Data are not tied to methods and resources, so the platform can handle multiple types of requests and data formats. The platform is deployed in HOLOBALANCE, a tele-rehabilitation system for balance disorders, providing surrogate holographic physiotherapists, real time evaluations of task performance and cloud-based data analytics for personalised coaching.;2020;4
A testbed gaming interface operated through a hand-held mobile device is designed and developed for robot-assisted telerehabilitation. In the developed gaming interface, a patient needs to wear sensors (position and force/pressure sensors) at different body parts that measure kinematics and kinetics data during rehabilitation practices through some game-like activities. The extent of rehabilitation progress is reflected through the magnitudes, patterns and expressions (such as the graphical expressions) of the kinematics and kinetics data. To do so, the kinematics and kinetics raw data are processed in real-time, expressed in different ways and displayed through the interface (e.g., mobile phone) held in the patient's hand. The patient can monitor the rehabilitation progress through the graphical data expressions via the interface, interact with the display device and the rehabilitation results, and communicate the results to the healthcare providers and the patient community. To make the gaming interface human-friendly, prior knowledge of human factors involved in the interface is considered when the interface is designed. The assessment method for each human factor is developed, and the interface is implemented and evaluated in a pilot study. The evaluation results show that the hand-held gaming interface designed and developed through addressing the human factors is effective to satisfy the human factor requirements in the human-device interaction, and to make the interaction more human-friendly. The results can be used to optimize and benchmark the performance of the interface and of the rehabilitation system.;2020;4
According to the latest statistics, the proportion of the elderly (+65) is increasing and is expected to double within the European Union in a period of 50 years. This ageing is due to the improvement of quality of life and advances in medicine in the last decades. Gerontechnology is receiving a great deal of attention as a way of providing the elderly with sustainable products, environments, and services combining gerontology and technology. One of the most important aspects to consider by gerontechnology is the mobility/rehabilitation technologies, because there is an important relationship between mobility and the elderly's quality of life. Telerehabilitation systems have emerged to allow the elderly to perform their rehabilitation exercises remotely. However, in many cases, the proposed systems assist neither the patients nor the experts about the progress of the rehabilitation. To address this problem, we propose in this paper, a fuzzy-semantic system for evaluating patient's physical state during the rehabilitation process based on well-known standard for patients' evaluation. Moreover, a tool called FINE has been developed that facilitates the evaluation be accomplished in a semi-automatic way first asking patients to carry out a set of standard tests and then inferencing their state by means of a fuzzy-semantic approach using the data captured during the rehabilitation tasks.;2020;4
Adapting face-to-face physical therapy consultations in cancer care to a model of telerehabilitation has been necessary, given the imminent spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this respect, the current model of telerehabilitation for people with breast cancer can be described as a method of continuing physical therapy treatment, in a public hospital with limited resources.;2020;4
After a cerebral stroke, survivors need to follow a neurorehabilitation program including exercises to be executed under a therapist's supervision or autonomously. Technological solutions are needed to support the early discharge of the patients just after the primary hospital treatments, by still providing an adequate level of rehabilitation. The DoMoMEA Project proposes a fully-wearable m-health solution able to administer a neurorehabilitation therapy in the patient's home or every other place established by the patient for a rehabilitation session. The exploitation of magneto-inertial measurement units only, wirelessly connected to an Android-operated device, provides robustness to different operating conditions and immunity to optical occlusion problems, compared to RGB-D cameras. Patients' engagement is fostered by the exploitation of the exergame version of the ten rehabilitation exercises, implemented in Unity 3D. Store-and-forward telemonitoring features, supported by cloud-based storage and by a web application accessible from anywhere by medical personnel and patients, enable constant transparent monitoring of the rehabilitation progresses. The clinical trial of the DoMoMEA telerehabilitation system will involve 40 post-stroke patients with mild impairment and will start as soon as the restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic will allow to enroll patients.;2020;4
Aim The aim of this study was to explore the current and potential use of information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance coherent person-centred rehabilitation after stroke, from the perspectives of physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Method Five occupational therapists and four physiotherapists from different phases of the Danish stroke rehabilitation process were included and two focus group interviews were carried out. A grounded theory approach was used throughout the study and a constant comparative method was used in the analysis. Results Three subcategories were identified from the analysis of interviews with participants: 1) ICT and apps as meaningful and supportive in the rehabilitation process, 2) ICT as a tool in communication and documentation and 3) Barriers to the integration of ICT and apps in the rehabilitation process. From these categories one core category emerged: The potential of a personalized app solution to facilitate coherent person-centred rehabilitation. Conclusion ICT was perceived as important to integrate in stroke rehabilitation both for assessment, training and to compensate for remaining deficits. The development of a personalized app solution could accommodate stroke survivors' and significant others' need for insight into and overview over the rehabilitation process as well as access to relevant information, which would thereby empower them. Furthermore, a personalized app solution could also facilitate follow-up after discharge and was perceived to ease the communication and documentation within and between sectors, as well as communication with both stroke survivors and significant others.;2020;4
Aim: The aim of this review paper is to summarize recent developments and research in robotics, relevant to the field of ankle rehabilitation, to overview new findings and determine the actual state of the art.Method: The literature search was performed using scientific and medical databases (Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science) and other websites related to robots used in the area of ankle rehabilitation, analysing studies from 1950s to present. Information about the mechanical and kinematic specifications, actuation and stage of development was extracted from the selected literature.Results: Several types of rehabilitation robots have been considered, and they were classified depending on their architecture and design features. We we found that, regardless of the differences in architectures, only a few of them have been commercialized. The majority of rehabilitation robots designs allows plantarflexion-dorsiflexion movements. Unless some exceptions, most of the wearable robots do not allow the adduction-abduction movement. Neither the physical appearance of the robot nor the user's perception towards it has not regularly been taken into account in the design stage. This limits the possibility of successful commercialization.Conclusions: Up to the present moment, the main challenges in the field of robot rehabilitation are the lack of unique rehabilitation protocols capable to fulfil the needs of all types of patients and the additional resources to measure the effectiveness of proposals that have not yet been commercialized. Nonetheless, we have mentioned above three areas were the challenges in design are more pressing. The first one is the robot architecture, which still presents some incommodities nowadays to emulate the ankle joint movement in a natural way. Thus, the displacements experienced by the axes in the joint must be adaptable to each patient and a wide range of pathologies. Moreover, many proposals are not been conceived to the purpose of commercialization, and even less to become an object of personal use.Implications for rehabilitationThis review states that the use of robotic devices for ankle rehabilitation is a consolidated paradigm in the ankle's rehabilitation.Platform-based robots allow to do complex and specialized spatial movements and these architectures endow the device with high stiffness, a balanced force distribution and better adaptability to the mechanical properties of human ankle joints. Unless some exceptions, most of the wearable robots do not allow the adduction-abduction movement.For a full integration of these technologies in the ankle's rehabilitation field, more clinical evaluations are needed.Regardless of the potential of robotic devices in rehabilitation, only a few of them have been commercialized.;2020;4
Aim:The aim of this study was to explore significant others' perspectives on how information and communication technology can support the rehabilitation process after stroke and facilitate participation in everyday life. Method:Thirteen significant others were included in the study, and to capture their perspectives, two focus groups, and five individual interviews were carried out in Denmark and Sweden 6-12 months after the stroke incident. A grounded theory approach was used throughout the study and a constant comparative method was used in the analysis. Results:Five subcategories were identified from the analysis of the interviews: (1) Information and communication technology providing a sense of security, (2) Information and communication technology as a social mediator, (3) Information and communication technology as a compensator for deficits, (4) Information and communication technology as a way to reach information, and (5) Information and communication technology as a possibility to supplement the rehabilitation process. From these categories, one core category emerged: The potential of information and communication technology to facilitate participation in everyday life and thereby reduce the strains that significant others experience after stroke. Conclusion:Information and communication technology has the potential to facilitate participation in everyday life after stroke. It is important, therefore, to start using information and communication technology in the rehabilitation process after stroke, to bring meaning to everyday life and to support both the stroke survivors and their significant others.;2020;4
Aims and objectives To explore how satisfied patients are with the process of treatment and care and to identify the experiences that patients perceive during elective primary fast-track total hip and knee arthroplasty journey. Background Greater satisfaction with care has predicted better quality of recovery, and patient experience has been positively associated with patient safety and clinical effectiveness. However, a little is still known about how patients experience their treatment and care. Design A qualitative interview study. Methods The study was conducted among 20 patients in a single joint replacement centre during 2018. Patient satisfaction was measured using a numerical rating scale. Patients' experiences were identified through qualitative semi-structured interviews which were analysed using an inductive content analysis method. The COREQ checklist was used (Supporting Information). Results The mean numerical rating scale score for overall satisfaction was 9.0 (SD 1.1) on a scale from 0-10. The patients' experiences were grouped under eight main categories that were derived from the qualitative data in the analysis: (a) patient selection, (b) meeting the Health Care Guarantee, (c) patient flow, (d) postdischarge care, (e) patient counselling, (f) transparency of the journey, (g) communication and (h) feedback. Conclusions The findings suggest that patients are highly satisfied after an elective primary fast-track total hip and knee arthroplasty. However, closer analysis of the patients' experiences reveals challenges and suggestions on how they could be solved, often involving digital technologies. Relevance to clinical practice As the number of total joint arthroplasties grows, patients and their families need to take ever greater responsibility, for their own care from advance preparation to rehabilitation. The findings of the study can be used to organise work, improving patient-clinical communication, fostering engagement and improving patient centredness. In addition, the results pinpoint the issues on how the patient experience could be improved.;2020;4
Aims Prescribed exercise is effective in adults with coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic heart failure (CHF), intermittent claudication, body mass index (BMI) >= 25 kg/m(2), hypertension or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the evidence for its cost-effectiveness is limited, shows large variations and is partly contradictory. Using World Health Organization and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology value for money thresholds, we report the cost-effectiveness of exercise therapy, exercise training and exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. Methods Electronic databases were searched for incremental cost-effectiveness and incremental cost-utility ratios and/or the probability of cost-effectiveness of exercise prescribed as therapy in economic evaluations conducted alongside randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1 July 2008 and 28 October 2018. Results Of 19 incremental cost-utility ratios reported in 15 RCTs in patients with CHD, CHF, intermittent claudication or BMI >= 25 kg/m(2), 63% met both value for money thresholds as 'highly cost-effective' or 'high value', with 26% 'not cost-effective' or of 'low value'. The probability of intervention cost-effectiveness ranged from 23 to 100%, probably due to the different populations, interventions and comparators reported in the individual RCTs. Connfirmation with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting checklist varied widely across the included studies. Conclusions The findings of this review support the cost-effectiveness of exercise therapy in patients with CHD, CHF, BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) or intermittent claudication, but, with concerns about reporting standards, need further confirmation. No eligible economic evaluation based on RCTs was identified in patients with hypertension or T2DM.;2020;4
"Aims This pilot study examined the impact of an occupation based intervention using a telerehabilitation format with adolescents with myelomeningocele (MMC). Methods We conducted a nonrandomized pilot study including four adolescents ages 14-18 with MMC. The intervention program included 10-12 sessions of the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance remotely delivered via videoconferencing. Outcome measures included the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), Wee-Functional Independence Measure;(Wee-FIM), and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Assessments were administered at baseline, post intervention and at three-month follow-up. Results Following intervention, participants rated their performance as having improved 2 points on the COPM for 8 out of 12 trained goals and on 2 out of 8 untrained goals. At 3-month follow-up improvement was reported on 9 out of 12 trained goals and 3 out of 8 untrained goals All participants made clinically significant improvements on the Wee-FIM total score following intervention and improvements were maintained at 3-month follow-up. The intervention effect on the PedsQL was inconclusive. Feedback interviews suggested that participants experience high satisfaction from the results and implementation of the intervention. Conclusions Our results demonstrate potential efficacy of occupation based teleintervention for adolescents with MMC.";2020;4
Aims: The objective of this study was to introduce mobile telerehabilitation with tablet computers and to verify its practical effectiveness in improving physical function and health status. Methods: In this study, nine adults aged 76.3 +/- 3.3 years old participated in 13 exercise sessions led by a physical therapist each lasting 60 min every 2 weeks for a total of 6 months. A physical therapist performed exercises in front of a digital camera which was connected to a lab computer. In a community center, participants performed the exercises while watching the exercise performance on a screen. Intervention was delivered by video conferencing over high-speed mobile Internet. Results: All participants were satisfied with telerehabilitation. We found that patients experienced significant improvement in physical function following participation. Conclusion: Mobile telerehabilitation provides an alternative option for delivering physical exercise and supervision, especially for those with geographical restrictions and limited local professional resources.;2020;4
Background After discharge from a rehabilitation center the continuation of therapy is necessary to secure already achieved healing progress and sustain (re-)integration into working life. To this end, home-based exercise programs are frequently prescribed. However, many patients do not perform their exercises as frequently as prescribed or even with incorrect movements. The telerehabilitation system AGT-Reha was developed to support patients with shoulder diseases during their home-based aftercare rehabilitation. Objectives The presented pilot study AGT-Reha-P2 evaluates the technical feasibility and user acceptance of the home-based telerehabilitation system AGT-Reha. Methods A nonblinded, nonrandomized exploratory feasibility study was conducted over a 2-year period in patients' homes. Twelve patients completed a 3-month telerehabilitation exercise program with AGT-Reha. Primary outcome measures are the satisfying technical functionality and user acceptance assessed by technical parameters, structured interviews, and a four-dimensional questionnaire. Secondary endpoints are the medical rehabilitation success measured by the active range of motion and the shoulder function (pain and disability) assessed by employing the Neutral-0 Method and the standardized questionnaire Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), respectively. To prepare an efficacy trial, various standardized questionnaires were included in the study to measure ability to work, capacity to work, and subjective prognosis of work capacity. The participants have been assessed at three measurement points: prebaseline (admission to rehabilitation center), baseline (discharge from rehabilitation center), and posttherapy. Results Six participants used the first version of AGT-Reha, while six other patients used an improved version. Despite minor technical problems, all participants successfully trained on their own with AGT-Reha at home. On average, participants trained at least once per day during their training period. Five of the 12 participants showed clinically relevant improvements of shoulder function (improved SPADI score>11). The work-related parameters suggested a positive impact. All participants would recommend the system, ten participants would likely reuse it, and seven participants would have wanted to continue their use after 3 months. Conclusion The findings show that home-based training with AGT-Reha is feasible and well accepted. Outcomes of SPADI indicate the effectiveness of aftercare with AGT-Reha. A controlled clinical trial to test this hypothesis will be conducted with a larger number of participants.;2020;4
Background After stroke, sustained hand rehabilitation training is required for continuous improvement and maintenance of distal function. Methods In this paper, we present a system designed and implemented in our lab: the Home based Virtual Rehabilitation System (HoVRS). Fifteen subjects with chronic stroke were recruited to test the feasibility of the system as well as to refine the design and training protocol to prepare for a future efficacy study. HoVRS was placed in subjects' homes, and subjects were asked to use the system at least 15 min every weekday for 3 months (12 weeks) with limited technical support and remote clinical monitoring. Results All subjects completed the study without any adverse events. Subjects on average spent 13.5 h using the system. Clinical and kinematic data were collected pre and post study in the subject's home. Subjects demonstrated a mean increase of 5.2 (SEM = 0.69) on the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UEFMA). They also demonstrated improvements in six measurements of hand kinematics. In addition, a combination of these kinematic measures was able to predict a substantial portion of the variability in the subjects' UEFMA score. Conclusion Persons with chronic stroke were able to use the system safely and productively with minimal supervision resulting in measurable improvements in upper extremity function.;2020;4
Background Although education, exercise, and weight loss are recommended for management of knee osteoarthritis, the additional benefits of incorporating weight loss strategies into exercise interventions have not been well investigated. The aim of this study is to compare, in a private health insurance setting, the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of a remotely-delivered, evidence- and theory-informed, behaviour change intervention targeting exercise and self-management (Exercise intervention), with the same intervention plus active weight management (Exercise plus weight management intervention), and with an information-only control group for people with knee osteoarthritis who are overweight or obese. Methods Three-arm, pragmatic parallel-design randomised controlled trial involving 415 people aged >= 45 and <= 80 years, with body mass index >= 28 kg/m(2) and < 41 kg/m(2) and painful knee osteoarthritis. Recruitment is Australia-wide amongst Medibank private health insurance members. All three groups receive access to a bespoke website containing information about osteoarthritis and self-management. Participants in the Exercise group also receive six consultations with a physiotherapist via videoconferencing over 6 months, including prescription of a strengthening exercise and physical activity program, advice about management, and additional educational resources. The Exercise plus weight management group receive six consultations with a dietitian via videoconferencing over 6 months, which include a very low calorie ketogenic diet with meal replacements and resources to support behaviour change, in addition to the interventions of the Exercise group. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Primary outcomes are self-reported knee pain and physical function at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include weight, physical activity levels, quality of life, global rating of change, satisfaction with care, knee surgery and/or appointments with an orthopaedic surgeon, and willingness to undergo surgery. Additional measures include adherence, adverse events, self-efficacy, and perceived usefulness of intervention components. Cost-effectiveness of each intervention will also be assessed. Discussion This pragmatic study will determine whether a scalable remotely-delivered service combining weight management with exercise is more effective than a service with exercise alone, and with both compared to an information-only control group. Findings will inform development and implementation of future remotely-delivered services for people with knee osteoarthritis.;2020;4
Background and Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, with 19% of total confirmed patients classified as severe or critical experiencing complications such as dyspnea, hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or multiorgan failure. These complications require rehabilitative care. Considering the contagious nature of COVID-19 and the necessity to decrease the volume of health care professionals entering confirmed COVID-19 patient rooms and becoming a potential disease vector, can audiovisual technologies employed by telehealth and telerehabilitation help? Case Description: This case discusses the Baylor Scott and White Institute for Rehab (BSWIR) Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) department COVID-19 acute care therapy team's creation of a telehealth strategy to provide early rehabilitative intervention without increasing the odds of disease transmission. Outcomes: The COVID-19 therapy team created a simple process for identifying and triaging care for patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19. These patients were evaluated and treated by the dedicated team using telehealth strategies. A structured risk-benefit analysis was used to determine when in-room care was indicated. Discussion: Acute care physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology telehealth strategies can add value by mitigating COVID-19-related harm and influencing recovery, while not unnecessarily becoming additional disease vectors consuming personal protective equipment. COVID-19 is not only an aggressive respiratory illness similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome but also highly contagious and a risk for health care providers. Telehealth strategies allow therapists to intervene early, opening the possibility to maximize recovery and prevent harm or decompensation. Telehealth strategies can be more prevention-focused while the patient is experiencing relatively good health with goals to maximize strength and endurance before the disease process evolves to critical illness. As COVID-19 progresses, therapy can help mitigate potential complications associated with prolonged intensive care unit stay and ventilator management.;2020;4
Background and purpose: The increase in use of everyday information and communication technologies can lead to the need for health professionals to incorporate technology use competencies in practice. Information and communication technologies has the potential to improve participation in daily life among people with disability. The aim was to review and describe evidence of the use of information and communication technology, including mobile technology, for improving participation in everyday life. A secondary aim was to describe how study outcomes were related to participation. Materials and methods: A scoping review methodology was used to identify studies through databases as MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library. Thereafter, the studies were screened and assessed for inclusion. Results: Eleven studies were included. The most commonly used technology were videoconferencing and the telephone. Ten of the 11 studies reported a change in participation in everyday life. Participation was mainly described as involvement in a life situation or related to activities of daily living. Conclusion: Delivering an intervention to improve participation through information and communication technology can be a valid option in rehabilitation. There is a need to measure and describe the intervention and its outcomes in relation to a definition of participation in future studies.;2020;4
Background Chronic musculoskeletal pain is one of the main causes of years lived with disability and generates the highest cost of health care among chronic pain conditions. Internet-based treatments have been shown to be an alternative for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions, in addition to reducing barriers such as travel, high demands on the public health system, lack of time, lack of insurance coverage for private care, and high costs for long-term treatment. The aim of this clinical trial is to develop and test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of, an internet-based self-management program based on pain education and exercise for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Methods This is a prospectively registered, assessor-blinded, two-arm randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation comparing the Internet-based pain education and exercise intervention with a control group that will receive an online booklet. One hundred and sixty patients will be recruited from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Follow-ups will be conducted in post-treatment, 6 and 12 months after randomisation. The conduct of the study, as well as the evaluations and follow-ups will be carried out entirely remotely, through online platforms and telephone calls. The primary outcome will be pain intensity at post-treatment (8 weeks) measured using the 11-item Pain Numerical Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes will be biopsychosocial factors presents in the chronic musculoskeletal pain condition. Costs due to chronic musculoskeletal pain will be also measured, and cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective will performed. Discussion Our hypothesis is that internet-based pain education and exercise will be better than an online booklet in reducing pain and improving biopsychosocial outcomes in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. In addition, we believe that there will be good acceptance of patients for the internet-based intervention and that internet-based intervention will be more cost effective than the online booklet.;2020;4
Background Chronic musculoskeletal pain represents an enormous burden in society. Best-practice care for chronic musculoskeletal pain suggests adoption of self-management strategies. Telehealth interventions (e.g., videoconferencing) are a promising approach to promote self-management and have the potential to overcome geographical barriers between patient and care providers. Understanding patient perspectives will inform and identify practical challenges towards applying the self-management strategies delivered via telehealth to everyday lives. The aim of this study is to synthesize the perceptions of individuals with musculoskeletal pain with regards to enablers and barriers to engaging in telehealth interventions for chronic musculoskeletal pain self-management. Methods A systematic review of qualitative studies will be performed based on searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and PsycINFO databases. Screening of identified titles will be conducted by two independent investigators. Data extraction will retrieve detailed qualitative information from selected articles. The critical appraisal skills program (CASP) checklist will be used for critical appraisal of included studies, and the level of confidence in the findings will be assessed using the confidence in the evidence from reviews of qualitative research (GRADE-CERQual). A thematic synthesis approach will be used to derive analytical themes. Discussion This review will systematically identify, synthesize, and present enablers and barriers reported by people with musculoskeletal pain to engage in telehealth interventions. The review will provide information required to support the design and improvement of telehealth services. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42019136148;2020;4
"Background Home-based interventions might facilitate the lifelong uptake of a physically active lifestyle following completion of a supervised phase II exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. Yet, data on the long-term effectiveness of home-based exercise training on physical activity and exercise capacity are scarce. Objective The purpose of the TeleRehabilitation in Coronary Heart disease (TRiCH) study was to compare the long-term effects of a short home-based phase III exercise programme with telemonitoring guidance to a prolonged centre-based phase III programme in coronary artery disease patients. The primary outcome was exercise capacity. Secondary outcomes included physical activity behaviour, cardiovascular risk profile and health-related quality of life. Methods Ninety coronary artery disease patients (80 men) were randomly assigned to 3 months of home-based (30), centre-based (30) or a control group (30) on a 1:1:1 basis after completion of their phase II ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation programme. Outcome measures were assessed at discharge of the phase II programme and after one year. Results Eighty patients (72 (91%) men; mean age 62.6 years) completed the one-year follow-up measurements. Exercise capacity and secondary outcomes were preserved in all three groups (P-time > 0.05 for all), irrespective of the intervention (P-interaction > 0.05 for all). Eighty-five per cent of patients met the international guidelines for physical activity (P-time < 0.05). No interaction effect was found for physical activity. Conclusion Overall, exercise capacity remained stable during one year following phase II cardiac rehabilitation. Our home-based exercise intervention was as effective as centre-based and did not result in higher levels of exercise capacity and physical activity compared to the other two interventions.";2020;4
"Background In recent years, the potential usefulness of cognitive training procedures in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have received increased attention. Objective The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the face-to-face cognitive virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) and to compare it to that of face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual for individuals with MCI. Moreover, we assessed the possibility of prolonging the effects of treatment with a telerehabilitation system. Methods A total of 49 subjects with MCI were assigned to 1 of 3 study groups in a randomized controlled trial design: (a) those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS (12 sessions of individualized cognitive rehabilitation over 4 weeks) followed by telerehabilitation (36 sessions of home-based cognitive VRRS training, three sessions for week); (b) those who received face-to-face cognitive VRRS followed by at-home unstructured cognitive stimulation (36 sessions of home-based unstructured cognitive stimulation, three sessions for week); and (c) those who received face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual (12 sessions of face-to-face cognitive treatment as usual). Results An improvement in memory, language and visuo-constructional abilities was observed after the end of face-to-face VRRS treatment compared to face-to-face treatment as usual. The application of home-based cognitive VRRS telerehabilitation seems to induce more maintenance of the obtained gains than home-based unstructured stimulation. Discussion The present study provides preliminary evidence in support of individualized VRRS treatment and telerehabilitation delivery for cognitive rehabilitation and should pave the way for future studies aiming at identifying optimal cognitive treatment protocols in subjects with MCI.";2020;4
"Background Low vision affects over 300 million people worldwide and can compromise both activities of daily living and quality of life. Rehabilitative training and vision assistive equipment (VAE) may help, but some visually impaired people have limited resources to attend in-person visits at rehabilitation clinics to receive training to learn to use VAE. These people may be able to overcome barriers to care through remote, Internet-based consultation (i.e. telerehabilitation). Objectives To compare the effects of telerehabilitation with face-to-face (e.g. in-office or inpatient) vision rehabilitation services for improving vision-related quality of life and near reading ability in people with visual function loss due to any ocular condition. Secondary objectives were to evaluate compliance with scheduled rehabilitation sessions, abandonment rates for VAE devices, and patient satisfaction ratings. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any language restriction or study design filter in the electronic searches; however, we restricted the searches from 1980 onwards because the Internet was not introduced to the public until 1982. We last searched the electronic databases on 24 June 2019. Selection criteria We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which participants diagnosed with low vision were undergoing low vision rehabilitation using an Internet, web-based technology compared with an approach involving in-person consultations. @Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and then full-text articles against the eligibility criteria. We planned to have two review authors independently abstract data from the included studies. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Main results We identified two ongoing studies, but did not find any completed RCTs and CCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this review. We did not conduct a quantitative analysis. We discussed review articles on telemedicine for facilitating communication with elderly individuals or for providing remote ophthalmological care. Authors' conclusions We did not find any evidence from RCTs or CCTs on the efficacy of using telerehabilitation for remote delivery of rehabilitation services to individuals with low vision. Given the disease burden and the growing interest in telemedicine, the two ongoing studies, when completed, may provide evidence in understanding the potential for telerehabilitation as a platform for providing services to people with low vision.";2020;4
Background Many elderly people suffer from chronic health conditions and mobility limitations. Therefore, they may benefit from traditional rehabilitation or telerehabilitation interventions as an alternative for this type of services. Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of telerehabilitation interventions with traditional rehabilitation services for therapeutic purposes in the elderly. Methods This systematic review was conducted in 2018. The searched databases were Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and ProQuest. The search was conducted with no time or language limitation. The selected papers included the randomized clinical trial studies in which elderly people aged 60 and over used telerehabilitation services for treatment purposes. The quality of the studies was evaluated by using the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) scale. Data were extracted by using a data extraction form and findings were narratively synthesized. Results After screening the retrieved papers, eight articles were selected to be included in the study. According to the findings, telerehabilitation was used for the elderly after stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), total knee replacement, and in patients with the comorbidity of COPD and chronic heart failure. Overall, in most studies, there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups and the level of improvements was similar for most outcomes. Conclusion Telerehabilitation services can be regarded as an alternative to traditional rehabilitation approaches to reduce outpatient resource utilization and improve quality of life. However, more rigorous studies are suggested to investigate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation services for specific diseases or health conditions.;2020;4
Background Speech pathology students can experience low confidence when communicating with people with aphasia. Communication partner training (CPT) is one method to increase confidence and skills when communicating with people with aphasia. There is a paucity of research exploring the effects of delivering CPT to students via technology, such as telepractice. Aims To explore the feasibility (acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, limited efficacy) of a conversation with a person with aphasia via telepractice as part of a CPT programme with speech pathology students. A secondary aim was to explore the effects of feedback from the people with aphasia (i.e., patient feedback) on students' perceived confidence and proficiency in communicating with people with aphasia. Methods & Procedures A Phase II feasibility study design was used, where both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. A total of 33 speech pathology students attended a lecture about the strategies used to communicate effectively with people with aphasia. They then participated in a 10-min conversation via videoconferencing with a person with aphasia 1 week later. Students were randomly allocated to patient feedback or no patient feedback conditions. They completed a custom designed questionnaire pre- and post-conversation. Outcomes & Results The study had a low recruitment rate but good retention. The programme was delivered as intended. Students reported that they found the conversations to be a positive but challenging experience. Post-conversation, statistically significant increases were found in students' self-rated confidence communicating with people with aphasia, proficiency at engaging in an everyday conversation and proficiency obtaining a case history (all p < 0.001). There were no significant differences for these ratings between the groups according to feedback condition (all p > 0.01). Conclusions & Implications CPT involving a conversation with a person with aphasia via telepractice is feasible and can provide a valuable learning experience for students. Further research is required.;2020;4
Background Telehealth services may decrease costs, improve efficiency, and increase access for health care delivery. Telehealth has been used extensively in rehabilitation of various cardiopulmonary and neurological conditions with high clinical efficacy. However, there appears to be limited information regarding the provision of telehealth for managing musculoskeletal lower limb disorders and injuries. Objective To determine for which lower limb conditions telehealth has been used, and to describe the delivery mode and the content of that telehealth, when provided by physiotherapists. Design Scoping review. Methods A computerized search of Cochrane Library, PEDro, Medline, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, PubMed, and CINAHL was conducted up to the 5 April 2020. A search strategy was developed and adapted to each database. Studies were included if they investigated assessment or rehabilitation of a lower limb musculoskeletal disorder and utilized real-time telehealth physiotherapy sessions. We included primary studies, randomized controlled studies, nonrandomized clinical trials, and agreement studies. Results Ten studies were included in the review, categorized into two groups: assessment (five studies), and intervention or rehabilitation (five studies)viatelehealth. Seven of those studies included patients who had undergone hip or knee arthroplasty. Nine studies utilized synchronous internet-based videoconferencing and one study used phone interviews as the method of delivering assessment or rehabilitation information. Conclusion Telehealth was used as a means of assessment of a variety of lower limb conditions, while rehabilitationviatelehealth was limited to patients with hip or knee arthroplasty.;2020;4
"Background Telerehabilitation offers an alternate way of delivering rehabilitation services. Information and communication technologies are used to facilitate communication between the healthcare professional and the patient in a remote location. The use of telerehabilitation is becoming more viable as the speed and sophistication of communication technologies improve. However, it is currently unclear how effective this model of delivery is relative to rehabilitation delivered face-to-face or when added to usual care. Objectives To determine whether the use of telerehabilitation leads to improved ability to perform activities of daily living amongst stroke survivors when compared with (1) in-person rehabilitation (when the clinician and the patient are at the same physical location and rehabilitation is provided face-to-face); or (2) no rehabilitation or usual care. Secondary objectives were to determine whether use of telerehabilitation leads to greater independence in self-care and domestic life and improved mobility, balance, health-related quality of life, depression, upper limb function, cognitive function or functional communication when compared with in-person rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Additionally, we aimed to report on the presence of adverse events, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and levels of user satisfaction associated with telerehabilitation interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2019), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June 2019), Embase (1974 to June 2019), and eight additional databases. We searched trial registries and reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of telerehabilitation in stroke. We included studies that compared telerehabilitation with in-person rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. In addition, we synthesised and described the results of RCTs that compared two different methods of delivering telerehabilitation services without an alternative group. We included rehabilitation programmes that used a combination of telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation provided that the greater proportion of intervention was provided via telerehabilitation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified trials on the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated any disagreements. The review authors contacted investigators to ask for missing information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence and interpret findings. Main results We included 22 trials in the review involving a total of 1937 participants. The studies ranged in size from the inclusion of 10 participants to 536 participants, and reporting quality was often inadequate, particularly in relation to random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data were apparent in several studies. Study interventions and comparisons varied, meaning that, in many cases, it was inappropriate to pool studies. Intervention approaches included post-hospital discharge support programs, upper limb training, lower limb and mobility retraining and communication therapy for people with poststroke language disorders. Studies were either conducted upon discharge from hospital or with people in the subacute or chronic phases following stroke. Primary outcome: we found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference in activities of daily living between people who received a post-hospital discharge telerehabilitation intervention and those who received usual care (based on 2 studies with 661 participants (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.15)). We found low-quality evidence of no difference in effects on activities of daily living between telerehabilitation and in-person physical therapy programmes (based on 2 studies with 75 participants: SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.48). Secondary outcomes: we found a low quality of evidence that there was no difference between telerehabilitation and in-person rehabilitation for balance outcomes (based on 3 studies with 106 participants: SMD 0.08, 95%Cl -0.30 to 0.46). Pooling of three studies with 569 participants showed moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference between those who received post-discharge support interventions and those who received usual care on health-related quality of life (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.20). Similarly, pooling of six studies (with 1145 participants) found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference in depressive symptoms when comparing post-discharge tele-support programs with usual care (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.11). We found no difference between groups for upper limb function (based on 3 studies with 170 participants: mean difference (MD) 1.23, 95% CI -2.17 to 4.64, low-quality evidence) when a computer program was used to remotely retrain upper limb function in comparison to inperson therapy. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of telerehabilitation on mobility or participant satisfaction with the intervention. No studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation; however, five of the studies reported health service utilisation outcomes or costs of the interventions provided within the study. Two studies reported on adverse events, although no serious trial-related adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions While there is now an increasing number of RCTs testing the efficacy of telerehabilitation, it is hard to draw conclusions about the effects as interventions and comparators varied greatly across studies. In addition, there were few adequately powered studies and several studies included in this review were at risk of bias. At this point, there is only low or moderate-level evidence testing whether telerehabilitation is a more effective or similarly effective way to provide rehabilitation. Short-term post-hospital discharge telerehabilitation programmes have not been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality of life, or improve independence in activities of daily living when compared with usual care. Studies comparing telerehabilitation and in-person therapy have also not found significantly different outcomes between groups, suggesting that telerehabilitation is not inferior. Some studies reported that telerehabilitation was less expensive to provide but information was lacking about cost-effectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. The field is still emerging and more studies are needed to draw more definitive conclusions. In addition, while this review examined the efficacy of telerehabilitation when tested in randomised trials, studies that use mixed methods to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of telehealth interventions are incredibly valuable in measuring outcomes.";2020;4
"Background To improve the use of eRehabilitation after stroke, the identification of barriers and facilitators influencing this use in different healthcare contexts around the world is needed. Therefore, this study aims to investigate differences and similarities in factors influencing the use of eRehabilitation after stroke among Brazilian Healthcare Professionals (BHP) and Dutch Healthcare Professionals (DHP). Method A cross-sectional survey study including 88 statements about factors related to the use of eRehabilitation (4-point Likert scale; 1-4; unimportant-important/disagree-agree). The survey was conducted among BHP and DHP (physical therapists, rehabilitating physicians and psychologists). Descriptive statistics were used to analyse differences and similarities in factors influencing the use of eRehabilitation. Results ninety-nine (response rate 30%) BHP and 105 (response rate 37%) DHP participated. Differences were found in the top-10 most influencing statements between BHP and DHP BHP rated the following factors as most important: sufficient support from the organisation (e.g. the rehabilitation centre) concerning resources and time, and potential benefits of the use of eRehabilitation for the patient. DHP rated the feasibility of the use of eRehabilitation for the patient (e.g. a helpdesk and good instructions) as most important for effective uptake. Top-10 least important statements were mostly similar; both BHP and DHP rated problems caused by stroke (e.g. aphasia or cognitive problems) or problems with resources (e.g. hardware and software) as least important for the uptake of eRehabilitation. Conclusion The results indicate that the use of eRehabilitation after stroke by BHP and DHP is influenced by different factors. A tailored implementation strategy for both countries needs to be developed.";2020;4
Background. Coronary revascularization procedures often cause lowered exercise capacity and declining physical activity levels. These outcomes are paramount in predicting morbidity and mortality after these procedures. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) focuses on incrementing cardiovascular endurance, exercise capacity, muscle strength, levels of physical activity, and quality of life through health education and lifestyle modification in post-coronary revascularization patients. Objective. To review the impact of cardiac rehabilitation on functional capacity, levels of physical activity, and health related quality of life in patients following coronary revascularization. Methods. A structured literature search in PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and ProQuest for studies focused on CR and its effects on functional capacity, physical activity, and quality of life after coronary revascularization. Results. A total of 2,010 studies were retrieved. Deduplication and eligibility screening included 190 studies after the application of filters. A sum of 21 studies were considered for this review. Most studies reported that exercise and physical activity programs were centre-based and home-based and via telerehabilitation. Treadmill and cycle ergometry training with callisthenics and flexibility exercises in phase 2 CR exhibited significant improvement in functional capacity and physical activity levels in patients after coronary revascularization procedures. Conclusion. Although centre-based supervised CR programs do improve functional capacity after coronary revascularization, home-based or telerehabilitation-based CR programs are feasible, improve patient compliance in improving physical activity, and thereby increase functional capacity. Patient education improves levels of physical activity, health related quality of life, and adherence to home- and centre-based CR programs.;2020;4
"Background. Gait and mobility aid assessments are important components of rehabilitation. Given the increasing use of telehealth to meet rehabilitation needs, it is important to examine the feasibility of such assessments within the constraints of telerehabilitation. Objective. The objective of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment gait scale (POMA-G) and cane height assessment under various video and transmission settings to demonstrate the feasibility of teleassessment. Design. This repeated-measures study compared the test performances of in-person, slow motion (SM) review, and normal-speed (NS) video ratings at various fixed frame rates (8, 15, and 30 frames per second) and bandwidth (128, 384, and 768 kB/s) configurations. Methods. Overall bias, validity, and interrater reliability were assessed for in-person, SM video, and NS video ratings, with SM video rating as the gold standard, as well as for different frame rate and bandwidth configurations within NS videos. Results. There was moderate to good interrater reliability for the POMA-G (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.66-0.77 across all configurations) and moderate validity for in-person (beta = 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.37-0.87) and NS video (beta = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.67-0.80) ratings compared with the SM video rating. For cane height, interrater reliability was good (ICC = 0.66-0.77), although it was significantly lower at the lowest frame rate (8 frames per second) (ICC = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.54-0.76) and bandwidth (128 kB/s) (ICC = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.57-0.78) configurations. Validity for cane height was good for both in-person (beta = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.62-0.98) and NS video (beta = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.81-0.90) ratings compared with SM video rating. Limitations. Some lower frame rate and bandwidth configurations may limit the reliability of remote cane height assessments. Conclusions. Teleassessment for POMA-G and cane height using typically available internet and video quality is feasible, valid, and reliable.";2020;4
Background/Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has created the need for research on how to effectively rehabilitate patients who have been discharged from an intensive care unit. This study is a protocol for a mixed methods feasibility study addressing the research questions: 1) what are the needs of patients who have survived COVID-19? 2) is the use of technology feasible to support their recovery? Methods A multicentre, technology supported, rehabilitation intervention for survivors of critical illness caused by COVID-19 will be assessed. Survivors in the study population will be offered a smartwatch to monitor their activity levels and will have biopsychosocial outcome measures monitored at three time points: discharge from hospital, 2-3 months post discharge and 1 year post discharge. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted across eight hospital sites with survivors, their relatives and professionals to understand their recovery experiences. Conclusions Designed by frontline clinicians, this protocol outlines a feasibility study that will provide new knowledge on the process of recovery of critical illness caused by COVID-19.;2020;4
Background: Access to comprehensive exercise and rehabilitation services for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) remains a major challenge, especially in rural, low-income areas. Hence, the Tele-Exercise and Multiple Sclerosis (TEAMS) study aims to provide patient-centered, coordinated care by implementing a 12-week complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention for adults with MS. However, due to the societal impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in mid-March 2020, the University of Alabama at Birmingham announced a limited business model halting all nonessential research requiring on-site visits, which includes the TEAMS study. Objective: In compliance with the shelter-in-place policy and quarantine guidance, a modified testing and training protocol was developed to allow participants to continue the study. Methods: The modified protocol, which replaces on-site data collection and training procedures, includes a teleassessment package (computer tablet, blood pressure cuff, hand dynamometer, mini disc cone, measuring tape, an 8 step, and a large-print 8 x 11 paper with ruler metrics and wall-safe tape) and a virtual meeting platform for synchronous interactive training between the therapist and the participant. The teleassessment measures include resting blood pressure and heart rate, grip strength, Five Times Sit to Stand, Timed Up & Go, and the Berg Balance Scale. The teletraining component includes 20 sessions of synchronous training sessions of dual tasking, yoga, and Pilates exercises designed and customized for a range of functional levels. Teletraining lasts 12 weeks and participants are instructed to continue exercising for a posttraining period of 9 months. Results: The protocol modifications were supported with supplemental funding (from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) and approved by the University Institutional Review Board for Human Use. At the time nonessential research visits were halted by the university, there were 759 people enrolled and baseline tested, accounting for 92.5% of our baseline testing completion target (N=820). Specifically, 325 participants completed the 12-week intervention and follow-up testing visits, and 289 participants needed to complete either the intervention or follow-up assessments. A modified analysis plan will include sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of the study results in the presence of uncertainty and protocol deviations. Study results are projected to be published in 2021. Conclusions: This modified remote teleassessment/teletraining protocol will impact a large number of participants with MS who would otherwise have been discontinued from the study.;2020;4
Background: Adhesive capsulitis (AC) of the shoulder is a common disorder that painfully reduces the shoulder range of motion (ROM) among middle-aged individuals. Although physical therapy with home-based exercises is widely advised to restore ROM in the treatment of AC, clinical results vary owing to inconsistent patient compliance. Objective: In this study, we aimed to verify the feasibility of a treatment model that involves applying a wearable motion sensor device to assist patients conduct home based exercises to improve training compliance and the accuracy of exercises, with the ultimate goal of improving the functional recovery of patients with AC. Methods: The motion sensor device was comprised of inertial measurement unit-based sensors and mobile apps for patients and physicians, offering shoulder mobility tracing, home-based exercise support, and progress monitoring. The interrater reliability of shoulder mobility measurement using the motion sensor device on 10 healthy participants and 15 patients with AC was obtained using an intraclass correlation coefficient analysis and compared with the assessments performed by two highly experienced physicians. A pilot prospective control trial was then carried out to allocate the 15 patients with AC to two groups: home-based exercise group and motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group. Changes in active and passive shoulder ROM, pain and functional scores, and exercise completion rates were compared between the groups during a treatment period of 3 months. Results: Shoulder ROM, as measured using the motion sensor device, exhibited good to excellent reliability based on the comparison with the measurements of two physicians (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.771 to 0.979). Compared with patients with AC in the home-based exercise group, those in the motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group exhibited better shoulder mobility and functional recovery and a higher exercise completion rate during and after 3 months of rehabilitation. Conclusions: Motion sensor device-assisted home-based rehabilitation for the treatment of AC is a useful treatment model for telerehabilitation that enhances the compliance of patients through training, thus improving functional recovery. This helps overcome important obstacles in physiotherapy at home by providing comprehensible and easily accessible exercise instructions, enhancing compliance, ensuring the correctness of exercise, and monitoring the progress of patients.;2020;4
Background: Alternative evidence-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery models that overcome significant barriers to access and delivery are needed to address persistent low utilization. Models utilizing contemporary digital technologies could significantly improve reach and fidelity as complementary alternatives to traditional center-based programs. Objective: The aim of this study is to compare the effects and costs of the innovative Smartphone Cardiac Rehabilitation, Assisted self-Management (SCRAM) intervention with usual care CR. Methods: In this investigator-, assessor-, and statistician-blinded parallel 2-arm randomized controlled trial, 220 adults (18+ years) with coronary heart disease are being recruited from 3 hospitals in metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia. Participants are randomized (1:1) to receive advice to engage with usual care CR or the SCRAM intervention. SCRAM is a 24-week dual-phase intervention that includes 12 weeks of real-time remote exercise supervision and coaching from exercise physiologists, which is followed by 12 weeks of data-driven nonreal-time remote coaching via telephone. Both intervention phases include evidence- and theory-based multifactorial behavior change support delivered via smartphone push notifications. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks include maximal aerobic exercise capacity (primary outcome at 24 weeks), modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, exercise adherence, secondary prevention self-management behaviors, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. Economic and process evaluations will determine cost-effectiveness and participant perceptions of the treatment arms, respectively. Results: The trial was funded in November 2017 and received ethical approval in June 2018. Recruitment began in November 2018. As of September 2019, 54 participants have been randomized into the trial. Conclusions: The innovative multiphase SCRAM intervention delivers real-time remote exercise supervision and evidence-based self-management behavioral support to participants, regardless of their geographic proximity to traditional center-based CR facilities. Our trial will provide unique and valuable information about effects of SCRAM on outcomes associated with cardiac and all-cause mortality, as well as acceptability and cost-effectiveness. These findings will be important to inform health care providers about the potential for innovative program delivery models, such as SCRAM, to be implemented at scale, as a complement to existing CR programs. The inclusion of a cohort comprising metropolitan-, regional-, and rural-dwelling participants will help to understand the role of this delivery model across health care contexts with diverse needs.;2020;4
"Background: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery is one of the most common orthopedic procedures. One of the main factors that influence the outcome is regaining strength in the postoperative phase. Because anterior cmciate ligament reconstruction surgeries are often performed in young patients, we combined the concept of prehabilitation with an app-based serious gaming approach to improve maximal strength postoperatively. Objective: Our objective was to conduct a prospective randomized trial to evaluate whether an app based active muscle training program (GenuSport Knee Trainer) can improve postoperative strength by starting rehabilitation immediately after primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery. Methods: We designed a pilot study in which we randomly assigned patients receiving primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to either the serious gaming training (intervention) group or a conventional rehabilitation (control) group. Except for the serious gaming-based training, both groups followed the same postoperative treatment protocol. Outcome parameters were absolute and relative change in maximal strength, as well as the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee evaluation form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Lysholm Knee Score. Results: In total 26 patients agreed to participate (14 patients in the intervention group and 12 patients in the control group, 1 of whom was lost to follow-up). We noted a difference in absolute maximum strength between the exergaming intervention and the control groups. Mean maximum strength preoperatively was 155.1 (SD 79.2) N in the intervention group (n=14) and 157.0 (SD 40.8) N in the control group (n=11). Postoperative mean maximum strength was 212.8 (SD 78.5) N in the intervention group and 154.5 (SD 27.1) N in the control group. Mean absolute change in maximum strength was 57.7 (SD 95.2) N in the intervention group and -4.8 (22.2) N in the control group. The analysis of covariance model with absolute change as the dependent variable and treatment group and baseline maximum strength as covariates showed a relevant difference in relative change between treatment groups (intervention - control) of 59.7 N (95% CI 10.1-109.3; P=.02). Similarly to the absolute increase, the relative change in maximum strength was relevantly higher in the exergaming group. The mean relative change in maximum strength was 1.7 (SD 1.17) in the intervention group and 1 (SD 0.13) in the control group. No adverse events or problems were reported during the study period. Conclusions: Implementation of an app-based active muscle training program in the early postoperative therapy scheme was associated with an improvement in maximal strength. Therefore, we considered the use of GenuSport training after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to be a helpful complement to rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery to improve strength in the early postoperative phase. To our knowledge this was the first study to analyze immediate postoperative serious gaming-based training with the GenuSport device based on strength improvement.";2020;4
Background: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is characterized by joint contractures present in at least two body areas. In addition to these contractures, individuals with AMC can have decreased muscle mass, leading to limitations in activities of daily living. Exercise has the potential to maintain or improve the range of motion and muscle strength. However, this type of intervention necessitates frequent follow ups that are currently difficult to provide for youths with AMC because they often live far from a specialized hospital. To overcome this distance challenge, telecommunication technologies can be used to deliver rehabilitation remotely, which is called telerehabilitation. The study protocol for one such type of rehabilitation will be presented in this paper. Objective: This pilot study aims to (1) evaluate the feasibility of using telerehabilitation to provide a home exercise program for youths with AMC, and (2) assess the effectiveness of a home exercise program. Methods: A total of 10 youths aged 8-21 years with AMC will be recruited. The intervention consists of a 12-week individualized home-based exercise program delivered remotely using telerehabilitation. At baseline, youths will complete the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents and the Pediatrics Outcomes Data Collection Instrument to assess pain, function, and level of physical activity. During the first telerehabilitation meeting, the rehabilitation therapists will measure range of motion using a virtual goniometer and assess the youth's functional level. The therapists will then use the Goal Attainment Scale to set objectives and develop the individualized intervention. Follow ups will occur every 3 weeks to make sure exercises are performed safely and to progress the exercises when needed. At the end of the 12-week intervention, rehabilitation therapists will re-evaluate the youth using the same outcome measures as the initial evaluation. The youths will be asked to complete the same questionnaires, with the addition of questions about their satisfaction regarding the intervention. Nonparametric and descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness. Results: Ethics approval was obtained in October 2018. Recruitment and data collection started in January 2019 and was completed in May 2020. Conclusions: This pilot study will help us learn how a large-scale project may work in practice to improve outcomes in physical activity, pain, and function, and goal attainment among youths with AMC, thus informing a future clinical trial.;2020;4
BACKGROUND: As the number of patients with orthopaedic conditions has risen continuously, hospital-based healthcare resources have become limited. Delivery of additional services is needed to adapt to this trend. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the current literature of computer- and telephone-delivered interventions on patient outcomes and resource utilization in patients with orthopaedic conditions. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted in January 2019. The standardized checklist for randomized controlled trials was used to assess the quality of the relevant studies. A meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity in the included studies, and a narrative synthesis was conducted to draw informative conclusions relevant to current research, policy, and practice. RESULTS: A total of 1,173 articles were retrieved. Six randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, providing evidence from 434 individuals across four countries. Two studies reported findings of computer-delivered interventions and four reported findings of telephone-delivered interventions. The patients who received both computer- and telephone-delivered interventions showed improvements in patient outcomes that were similar or better to those of patients receiving conventional care. This was without any increase in adverse events or costs. CONCLUSION: Computer- and telephone-delivered interventions are promising and safe alternatives to conventional care. This review, however, identifies a gap in evidence of high-quality studies exploring the effects of computer- and telephone-delivered interventions on patient outcomes and resource utilization. In future, these interventions should be evaluated from the perspective of intervention content, self-management, and patient empowerment. In addition, they should consider the whole care journey and the development of the newest technological innovations. Additionally, future surgery studies should take into account the personalized needs of special, high-risk patient groups and focus on patient-centric care to reduce postdischarge health problems and resource utilization in this population.;2020;4
Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based therapy in chronic heart failure (CHF). There is still debate about the optimal training protocol in CHF. The use of high intensity interval training (HIIT) supplemented with peripheral (PRT) and inspiratory resistance training (IRT) might be more beneficial because of the higher impact on the peripheral and inspiratory muscles, with less symptoms of dyspnoea and lower amount of dropouts as a result. We compared our standard exercise-based CR programme, mainly consisting of moderate intensity interval training to a programme combining HIIT, PRT and IRT (resistance training supplemented HIIT (RHIIT) programme). Design: Randomised controlled pilot study. Methods: Twenty patients with CHF were randomised on a 1:1 basis to the standard or RHIIT programme. At baseline and after 3 months, peak exercise capacity (VO(2)peak), peripheral (QF) and inspiratory respiratory muscle strength (MIP), quality of life (QOL) and physical activity were measured. Results: The RHIIT programme resulted in a significantly larger improvement in QF (Delta QF RHIIT programme: 19.3 +/- 11.8 vs standard programme: -6.89 +/- 19.0 Nm (p < .01)) and MIP (Delta MIP RHIIT programme: -44.9 +/- 29.9 vs standard programme: 0.56 +/- 19.4 cmH(2)O (p < .01)). Both programmes equally improved in VO(2)peak (p = .91), whereas ventilatory efficiency and physical activity remained stable. Conclusion: HIIT supplemented with PRT and IRT might be applicable as standard protocol in CHF. Larger studies are warranted to confirm our findings. The RHIIT programme resulted in similar training effects in VO(2)peak in a shorter training period. This might be beneficial in a chronic patient population such as CHF, where adherence is difficult.;2020;4
"Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is highly effective as secondary prevention for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Uptake of CR remains suboptimal (30% of eligible patients), and long-term adherence to a physically active lifestyle is even lower. Innovative strategies are needed to counteract this phenomenon. Objective: The Physical Activity Toward Health (PATHway) system was developed to provide a comprehensive, remotely monitored, home-based CR program for CVD patients. The PATHway-I study aimed to investigate its feasibility and clinical efficacy during phase III CR. Methods: Participants were randomized on a 1:1 basis to the PATHway (PW) intervention group or usual care (UC) control group in a single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled pilot trial. Outcomes were assessed at completion of phase II CR and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was physical activity (PA; Actigraph GT9X link). Secondary outcomes included measures of physical fitness, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, endothelial function, intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery, and quality of life. System usability and patients' experiences were evaluated only in PW. A mixed-model analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment was used to analyze between-group effects over time. Missing values were handled by means of an intention-to-treat analysis. Statistical significance was set at a 2-sided alpha level of .05. Data are reported as mean (SD). Results: A convenience sample of 120 CVD patients (mean 61.4 years, SD 13.5 years; 22 women) was included. The PATHway system was deployed in the homes of 60 participants. System use decreased over time and system usability was average with a score of 65.7 (SD 19.7; range 5-100). Moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA increased in PW (PW: 127 [SD 58] min to 141 [SD 69] min, UC: 146 [SD 66] min to 143 [SD 71] min; P-interaction = 04; effect size of 0.42), while diastolic blood pressure (PW: 79 [SD 11] mmHg to 79 [SD 10] mmHg, UC: 78 [SD 9] mmHg to 83 [SD 10] mmHg; P-interaction =.004; effect size of -0.49) and cardiovascular risk score (PW: 15.9% [SD 10.4%] to 15.5% [SD 10.5%], UC: 14.5 [SD 9.7%] to 15.7% [SD 10.9%]; P-interaction =( ).004 ; effect size of -0.36) remained constant, but deteriorated in UC. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a technology-enabled, remotely monitored, home-based CR program. Although clinical effectiveness was demonstrated, several challenges were identified that could influence the adoption of PATHway.";2020;4
"Background: Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is associated with defective posture control and balance; thus, a proper assessment of these impairments is necessary for effective clinical decision-making. There is a need for portable, valid, and reliable methods to facilitate the easy collection of real-world data, such as mobile phones. Research question: Is the smartphone MyAnkle application valid and reliable in assessing balance in patients with CAI and healthy volunteers? Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Sixty-five participants completed two assessment sessions, including 31 patients (n = 41 ankles with CAI and 21 asymptomatic ankles) and 34 healthy volunteers (n = 68 ankles). In each session, dynamic single-leg stance balance was measured simultaneously using the MyAnkle application and the Biodex balance system (BBS) version 3. Testing was conducted at three levels of BBS difficulty-4 (D4, hard, loose platform), 6 (D6, moderate), and 8 (D8, easy, stiffer platform)-and repeated with opened and closed eyes. Both limbs were tested in a random order by two independent blinded assessors. Results: The two devices showed significant poor-to-moderate correlations when eyes were closed (p 0.05). For discriminant validity, the application did not distinguish the two study groups in all tested conditions (p 0.05), whereas the BBS weakly to moderately distinguished the dominant limbs in the two groups at all difficulty levels with eyes-open and at D8 with eyes-closed regardless to limb dominance. For reliability, a significantly poor to moderate inter-session reliability was noted for the two devices. Significance: MyAnkle application is valid in assessing balance in patients with CAI when the eyes are closed. However, similarly to BBS, its one-week test-retest reliability may be insufficient for accurate follow-up of balance changes and need to be interpreted with caution. Future studies need to establish its inter-tester reliability and its usefulness in telerehabilitation.";2020;4
Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain has a vast global prevalence and economic burden. Conservative therapies are universally recommended but require patient engagement and self-management to be effective. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a 12-week digital care program (DCP) in a large population of patients with chronic knee and back pain. Methods: A longitudinal observational study was conducted using a remote DCP available through a mobile app. Subjects participated in a 12-week multimodal DCP incorporating education, sensor-guided exercise therapy (ET), and behavioral health support with 1-on-1 remote health coaching. The primary outcome was pain measured by the visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary measures included engagement levels, program completion, program satisfaction, condition-specific pain measures, depression, anxiety, and work productivity. Results: A total of 10,264 adults with either knee (n=3796) or low back (n=6468) pain for at least three months were included in the study. Participants experienced a 68.45% average improvement in VAS pain between baseline intake and 12 weeks. In all, 73.04% (7497/10,264) participants completed the DCP into the final month. In total, 78.60% (5893/7497) of program completers (7144/10,264, 69.60% of all participants) achieved minimally important change in pain. Furthermore, the number of ET sessions and coaching interactions were both positively associated with improvement in pain, suggesting that the amount of engagement influenced outcomes. Secondary outcomes included a 57.9% and 58.3% decrease in depression and anxiety scores, respectively, and 61.5% improvement in work productivity. Finally, 3 distinct clusters of pain response trajectories were identified, which could be predicted with a mean 76% accuracy using baseline measures. Conclusions: These results support the efficacy and scalability of a DCP for chronic low back and knee pain in a large, diverse, real-world population. Participants demonstrated high completion and engagement rates and a significant positive relationship between engagement and pain reduction was identified, a finding that has not been previously demonstrated in a DCP. Furthermore, the large sample size allowed for the identification of distinct pain response subgroups, which may prove beneficial in predicting recovery and tailoring future interventions. This is the first longitudinal digital health study to analyze pain outcomes in a sample of this magnitude, and it supports the prospect for DCPs to serve the overwhelming number of musculoskeletal pain sufferers worldwide.;2020;4
"Background: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of disability and deaths worldwide. Secondary prevention, including cardiac rehabilitation (CR), is crucial to improve risk factors and to reduce disease burden and disability. Accessibility barriers contribute to underutilization of traditional center-based CR programs; therefore, alternative delivery models, including cardiac telerehabilitation (ie, delivery via mobile, smartphone, and/or web-based apps), have been tested. Experimental studies have shown cardiac telerehabilitation to be effective and cost-effective, but there is inadequate evidence about how to translate this research into routine clinical practice. Objective: This systematic review aimed to synthesize research evaluating the effectiveness of implementing cardiac telerehabilitation interventions at scale in routine clinical practice, including factors underlying successful implementation processes, and experimental research evaluating implementation-related outcomes. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Global Health databases were searched from 1990 through November 9, 2018, for studies evaluating the implementation of telerehabilitation for the self-management of CHD. Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were hand searched to identify additional studies. Implementation outcomes of interest included acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability. A narrative synthesis of results was carried out. Results: No included studies evaluated the implementation of cardiac telerehabilitation in routine clinical practice. A total of 10 studies of 2250 participants evaluated implementation outcomes, including acceptability (8/10, 80%), appropriateness (9/10, 90%), adoption (6/10, 60%), feasibility (6/10, 60%), fidelity (7/10, 70%), and implementation cost (4/10, 40%), predominantly from the participant perspective. Cardiac telerehabilitation interventions had high acceptance among the majority of participants, but technical challenges such as reliable broadband internet connectivity can impact acceptability and feasibility. Many participants considered telerehabilitation to be an appropriate alternative CR delivery model, as it was convenient, flexible, and easy to access. Participants valued interactive intervention components, such as real-time exercise monitoring and feedback as well as individualized support. The penetration and sustainability of cardiac telerehabilitation, as well as the perspectives of CR practitioners and health care organizations, have received little attention in existing cardiac telerehabilitation research. Conclusions: Experimental trials suggest that participants perceive cardiac telerehabilitation to be an acceptable and appropriate approach to improve the reach and utilization of CR, but pragmatic implementation studies are needed to understand how interventions can be sustainably translated from research into clinical practice. Addressing this gap could help realize the potential impact of telerehabilitation on CR accessibility and participation as well as person-centered, health, and economic outcomes.";2020;4
Background: COVID-19 presents a significant challenge to providing specialized rehabilitation and exercise for patients with breast cancer. Objective: The purpose of this report is to describe the implementation of telerehabilitation for one-on-one patient care and interactive, live, Web-based formats for group patient education, exercise, and support programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: This report describes the concept, materials, and methods used in a community-based clinical setting to serve patients' needs during COVID-19. Results: Telerehabilitation and interactive Web-based strategies may be useful in meeting the physical and emotional needs of patients with breast cancer. Brief patient cases summarize the process of one-on-one telerehabilitation implementation and provide patient and family perspectives. Challenges and benefits of telerehabilitation are described. Interactive Web-based strategies substantially increased the numbers of patients reached with survivorship education and support groups during the first 2 months of COVID-19. Limitations: This report is descriptive and does not include group outcomes. Further research is needed to compare outcomes of telerehabilitation versus in-person delivery of breast cancer rehabilitation care. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation and interactive Web-based education formats provide an alternative to in-person breast cancer rehabilitation care during COVID-19 and have potential application for improving delivery of care to underserved populations and in other types of cancer.;2020;4
Background: Digital technology has influenced many aspects of modern living, including health care. In the context of elective surgeries, there is a strong association between preoperative physical and psychological preparedness, and improved postoperative outcomes. Health behavior changes made in the pre- and postoperative periods can be fundamental in determining the outcomes and success of elective surgeries. Understanding the potential unmet needs of patients undergoing elective surgery is central to motivating health behavior change. Integrating digital and mobile health technologies within the elective surgical pathway could be a strategy to remotely deliver this support to patients. Objective: This meta-ethnographic systematic review explores digital interventions supporting patients undergoing elective surgery with health behavior changes, specifically physical activity, weight loss, dietary intake, and psychological support. Methods: A literature search was conducted in October 2019 across 6 electronic databases (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO]: CRD42020157813). Qualitative studies were included if they evaluated the use of digital technologies supporting behavior change in adult patients undergoing elective surgery during the pre- or postoperative period. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. A meta-ethnographic approach was used to synthesize existing qualitative data, using the 7 phases of meta-ethnography by Noblit and Hare. Using this approach, along with reciprocal translation, enabled the development of 4 themes from the data. Results: A total of 18 studies were included covering bariatric (n=2, 11%), cancer (n=13, 72%), and orthopedic (n=3, 17%) surgeries. The 4 overarching themes appear to be key in understanding and determining the effectiveness of digital and mobile interventions to support surgical patients. To successfully motivate health behavior change, technologies should provide motivation and support, enable patient engagement, facilitate peer networking, and meet individualized patient needs. Self-regulatory features such as goal setting heightened patient motivation. The personalization of difficulty levels in virtual reality-based rehabilitation was positively received. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy reduced depression and distress in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Peer networking provided emotional support beyond that of patient-provider relationships, improving quality of life and care satisfaction. Patients expressed the desire for digital interventions to be individually tailored according to their physical and psychological needs, before and after surgery. Conclusions: These findings have the potential to influence the future design of patient-centered digital and mobile health technologies and demonstrate a multipurpose role for digital technologies in the elective surgical pathway by motivating health behavior change and offering psychological support. Through the synthesis of patient suggestions, we highlight areas for digital technology optimization and emphasize the importance of content tailored to suit individual patients and surgical procedures. There is a significant rationale for involving patients in the cocreation of digital health technologies to enhance engagement, better support behavior change, and improve surgical outcomes.;2020;4
Background: Early rehabilitation has been proved very important for stroke patients. However, the effective model of transitioning from early in-hospital rehabilitation to discharge rehabilitation using the collaborative remote rehabilitation nursing model has not been thoroughly studied. Objective: To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of collaborative care model based telerehabilitation exercise training for acute stroke patients. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted. Patients were recruited and randomly divided into intervention and control group. Both groups were given regular treatment and acute rehabilitation nursing instructions during hospitalization. The control group was followed by regular telephone follow-up after discharge. The intervention group received Internet-based remote rehabilitation project after discharge. Motor function, balance ability and quality of life were measured at the day of discharge, the 4th week, 8th week and 12th week after patients were discharged. The CONSORT checklist was used to check the procedure. Results: A total of 61 patients completed the study, 30 cases in the intervention group and 31 cases in the control group. Both groups were significantly improved in terms of motor function and quality of life, but the intervention group showed greater improvement in Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Assessment (intervention group = 83.70 +/- 4.44, control group = 75.29 +/- 2.89), Berg Balance Scale (intervention group = 43.13 +/- 2.32, control group = 38.29 +/- 2.70) and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (intervention group = 190.57 +/- 5.09, control group = 175.90 +/- 5.78). Group-time interaction was significant in motor function and quality of life. Conclusion: Collaborative care model based telerehabilitation exercise training program can safely and effectively improve the recovery of motor function and improve the quality of life in patients with stroke.;2020;4
"BACKGROUND: Exercise-based rehabilitation improves physical function, fatigue and quality of life in patients with thoracic neoplasia. However, the implementation of this intervention is limited because of poor accessibility and adherence. Consequently, telerehabilitation is a promising strategy to improve access and adherence to rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility, adherence and satisfaction of a home-based telerehabilitation program (TELERP) with real-time physiological parameters acquisition in patients with unresectable thoracic neoplasia receiving chemotherapy and to explore its effects on patients' functional capacity. METHODS: Five patients receiving chemotherapy followed an 8-week TELERP using real-time monitoring combined with interactive exercises. The TELERP included supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions (3 sessions/week). The feasibility of the TELERP, adverse outcomes and adherence were analyzed. Six-minute walking test (6MWT) and timed stair test (TST) were done to assess functional capacity. RESULTS: Five patients with lung cancer (mean age of 62 +/- 7 yr; BMI of 24 +/- 3 Kg/m(2)) completed the TELERP. Patients completed 15 supervised and 8.6 +/- 2.97 unsupervised exercise sessions, representing 100 and 96% of the prescribed sessions, respectively. Patients trained at moderate and high intensity >= 50% of the time of the cardiopulmonary exercise session. No adverse event occurred. Following the TELERP, TST and 6MWT improved significantly (Delta -3.0 +/- 0.19 s, p = 0.05 and Delta 39.8 +/- 19.7 m, p = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results support the feasibility of a TELERP and suggest that such intervention may contribute to maintain or improve functional capacity for patients with thoracic neoplasia receiving chemotherapy.";2020;4
"Background: Exergames have the potential to provide an accessible, remote approach for poststroke upper extremity (UE) rehabilitation. However, the use of exergames without any follow-up by a health professional could lead to compensatory movements during the exercises, inadequate choice of difficulty level, exercises not being completed, and lack of motivation to pursue exercise programs, thereby decreasing their benefits. Combining telerehabilitation with exergames could allow continuous adjustment of the exercises and monitoring of the participant's completion and adherence. At present, there is limited evidence regarding the feasibility or efficacy of combining telerehabilitation and exergames for stroke rehabilitation. Objective: This study aims to (1) determine the preliminary efficacy of using telerehabilitation combined with exergames on UE motor recovery, function, quality of life, and motivation in participants with chronic stroke, compared with conventional therapy (the graded repetitive arm supplementary program; GRASP); (2) examine the feasibility of using the technology with participants diagnosed with stroke at home; and (3) identify the obstacles and facilitators for its use by participants diagnosed with stroke and stroke therapists and understand the shared decision-making process. Methods: A mixed methods study protocol is proposed, including a randomized, blinded feasibility trial with an embedded multiple case study. The intervention consists of the provision of a remote rehabilitation program, during which participants will use the Jintronix exergame for UE training and the Reacts Application to conduct videoconferenced sessions with the therapists (physical or occupational therapists). We plan to recruit 52 participants diagnosed with stroke, randomly assigned to a control group (n=26; 2-month on-paper home exercise program: the GRASP with no supervision) and an experimental group (n=26; 2-month home program using the technology). The primary outcome is the Fugl-Meyer UE Assessment, a performance-based measure of UE impairment. The secondary outcomes are self-reported questionnaires and include the Motor Activity Log-28 (quality and frequency of use of the UE), Stroke Impact Scale-16 (the quality of life), and Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (motivation). Feasibility data include process, resources, management, and scientific outcomes. Qualitative data will be collected by interviews with both participants and therapists. Results: At present, data collection was ongoing with one participant who had completed the exergame-telerehabilitation based intervention. We expect to collect preliminary efficacy data of this technology on the functional and motor recovery of the UE, following a stroke; collect feasibility data with users at home (adherence, safety, and technical difficulties); and identify the obstacles and facilitators for the technology use and understand the shared decision-making process. Conclusions: This paper describes the protocol underlying the study of a telerehabilitation-exergame technology to contribute to understanding its feasibility and preliminary efficacy for UE stroke rehabilitation.";2020;4
"Background: Facial nerve palsy leaves people unable to move muscles on the affected side of their face. Challenges exist in patients accessing facial neuromuscular retraining (NMR), a therapy used to strengthen muscle and improve nerve function. Access to therapy could potentially be improved through the use of digital technology. However, there is limited research available on patients'and clinicians' views about the potential benefits of such telerehabilitation based on their lived experiences of treatment pathways. Objective: This study aims to gather information about facial palsy treatment pathways in the United Kingdom, barriers to accessing NMR, factors influencing patient adherence, measures used to monitor recovery, and the potential value of emerging wearable digital technology. Methods: Separate surveys of patients with facial palsy and facial therapy specialists were conducted. Questionnaires explored treatment pathways and views on telerehabilitation, were co-designed with users, and followed a similar format to enable cross-referencing of responses. A follow-up survey of national specialists investigated methods used to monitor recovery in greater detail. Analysis of quantitative data was conducted allowing for data distribution. Open-text responses were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: A total of 216 patients with facial palsy and 25 specialist therapists completed the national surveys. Significant variations were observed in individual treatment pathways. Patients reported an average of 3.27 (SD 1.60) different treatments provided by various specialists, but multidisciplinary team reviews were rare. For patients diagnosed most recently, there was evidence of more rapid initial prescribing of corticosteroids (prednisolone) and earlier referral for NMR therapy. Barriers to NMR referral included difficulties accessing funding, shortage of specialist therapists, and limited awareness of NMR among general practitioners. Patients traveled long distances to reach an NMR specialist center; 9% (8/93) of adults reported traveling >= 115 miles. The thematic content analysis demonstrates positive attitudes to the introduction of digital technology, with similar incentives and barriers identified by both patients and clinicians. The follow-up survey of 28 specialists uncovered variations in the measures currently used to monitor recovery and no agreed definitions of a clinically significant change for any of these. The main barriers to NMR adherence identified by patients and therapists could all be addressed by using suitable real-time digital technology. Conclusions: The study findings provide valuable information on facial palsy treatment pathways and views on the future introduction of digital technology. Possible ways in which emerging sensor-based digital technology can improve rehabilitation and provide more rigorous evidence on effectiveness are described. It is suggested that one legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic will be lower organizational barriers to this introduction of digital technology to assist NMR delivery, especially if cost-effectiveness can be demonstrated.";2020;4
Background: Falls have implications for older adults' health and well-being. Strength and balance interventions significantly reduce the risk of falls. However, patients do not always perform the unsupervised home exercise needed for fall reduction. Objective: This study aims to develop motivational smartphone apps co-designed with health professionals and older adults to support patients to perform exercise proven to aid fall reduction and to explore the apps' usability and acceptability with both health professionals and patients. Methods: There were 3 phases of app development that included analysis, design, and implementation. For analysis, we examined the literature to establish key app components and had a consultation with 12 older adults attending a strength and balance class, exercise instructors, and 3 fall services. For design, we created prototype apps and conducted 2 patient and public involvement workshops, one with 5 health professionals and the second with 8 older adults from an exercise group. The apps were revised based on the feedback. For implementation, we tested them with one fall service and their patients for 3 weeks. Participatory evaluation was used through testing, semistructured interviews, and focus groups to explore acceptability and usability. Focus groups were conducted with the service that tested the apps and two other services. Qualitative data were analyzed using the framework approach. Results: On the basis of findings from the literature and consultations in the analysis phase, we selected Behavior Change Techniques, such as goal setting, action planning, and feedback on behavior, to be key parts of the app. We developed goals using familiar icons for patients to select and add while self-reporting exercise and decided to develop 2 apps, one for patients (My Activity Programme) and one for health professionals (Motivate Me). This enabled health professionals to guide patients through the goal-setting process, making it more accessible to nontechnology users. Storyboards were created during the design phase, leading to prototypes of Motivate Me and My Activity Programme. Key changes from the workshops included being able to add more details about the patients' exercise program and a wider selection of goals within Motivate Me. The overall app design was acceptable to health professionals and older adults. In total, 7 patients and 3 health professionals participated in testing in the implementation phase, with interviews conducted with 6 patients and focus groups, with 3 teams (11 health professionals). Barriers, facilitators, and further functionality were identified for both apps, with 2 cross-cutting themes around phone usability and confidence. Conclusions: The motivational apps were found to be acceptable for older adults taking part in the design stage and patients and health professionals testing the apps in a clinical setting. User-led design is important to ensure that the apps are usable and acceptable.;2020;4
"Background: Financial burden for patients, providers, and payers can reduce access to physical therapy (PT) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of a virtual PT program on health-care costs and clinical outcomes as compared with traditional care after TKA. Methods: At least 10 days before unilateral TKA, patients from 4 clinical sites were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to the virtual PT program (involving an avatar [digitally simulated] coach, in-home 3-dimensional biometrics, and telerehabilitation with remote clinician oversight by a physical therapist) or to traditional PT care in the home or outpatient clinic. The primary outcome was total health-care costs for the 12-week post-hospital period. Secondary (noninferiority) outcomes included 6 and 12-week Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS); 6-week knee extension, knee flexion, and gait speed; and 12-week safety measures (patient-reported falls, pain, and hospital readmissions). All outcomes were analyzed on a modified intent-to-treat basis. Results: Of 306 patients (mean age, 65 years; 62.5% women) who were randomized from November 2016 to November 2017, 290 had TKA and 287 (including 143 in the virtual PT group and 144 in the usual care group) completed the trial. Virtual PT had lower costs at 12 weeks after discharge than usual care (median, $1,050 compared with $2,805; p < 0.001). Mean costs were $2,745 lower for virtual PT patients. Virtual PT patients had fewer rehospitalizations than the usual care group (12 compared with 30; p = 0.007). Virtual PT was noninferior to usual PT in terms of the KOOS at 6 weeks (difference, 0.77; 90% confidence interval [CI], -1.68 to 3.23) and 12 weeks (difference, -2.33; 90% CI, -4.98 to 0.31). Virtual PT was also noninferior to usual care at 6 weeks in terms of knee extension, knee flexion, and gait speed and at 12 weeks in terms of pain and hospital readmissions. Falls were reported by 19.4% of virtual PT patients and 14.6% of usual care patients (difference, 4.83%; 90% CI, -2.60 to 12.25). Conclusions: Relative to traditional home or clinic PT, virtual PT with telerehabilitation for skilled clinical oversight significantly lowered 3-month health-care costs after TKA while providing similar effectiveness. These findings have important implications for patients, health systems, and payers. Virtual PT with clinical oversight should be considered for patients managed with TKA.";2020;4
"Background: Improvement of functional status with physiotherapy is an important goal for patients with postoperative complications and an increased length of hospital stay (LoS) after esophagectomy. Supervised physiotherapy with telerehabilitation instead of conventional face-to-face care could be an alternative to treat these patients in their home environment after hospital discharge (T0), but its feasibility has not yet been investigated in detail. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a 12-week supervised postoperative physiotherapy intervention with telerehabilitation for patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy and had postoperative complications or who had an increased LoS. The secondary objective was to investigate the preliminary effectiveness of telerehabilitation on functional recovery compared with usual care. Methods: A prospective feasibility study with a matched historical comparison group was performed. Feasibility outcomes included willingness and adherence to participate, refusal rate, treatment duration, occurrence of adverse events, and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcome measures were measurements of musculoskeletal and cardiovascular functions and activities according to the domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Results: A total of 22 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy and had postoperative complications or an increased LoS were included. The mean age at surgery was 64.55 (SD 6.72) years, and 77% (17/22) of patients were male. Moreover, 15 patients completed the intervention. Patient adherence was 99.8% in the first 6 weeks and dropped to 75.6% in the following 6 weeks, with a mean difference of -24.3% (95% CI 1.3 to 47.2; P=.04). At 3 months post operation, no differences in functional status were found between the intervention group and the matched historical comparison group. Conclusions: This study showed that a postoperative physiotherapeutic intervention with telerehabilitation is feasible for patients with postoperative complications or an increased LoS after esophageal cancer surgery up to 6 weeks after T0.";2020;4
Background: In the current technically advanced world, patients with various impairments of cognitive abilities can enjoy cognitive rehabilitation, cognitive education or remotely via accessible telerehabilitation carried out with the support of modern telecommunication technologies. The concept of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation involves training and correction of the cognitive deficit. A modern method for this is Virtual Reality, which creates an emotionally positive and stimulating environment for the patient in space and time. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation provides specific rehabilitation options for the return of cognitive abilities. It is carried out with the support of modern telecommunication technologies regardless of the location of the client/patient. Telerehabilitation can be delivered from any place using telecommunication networks and the Internet. In the current period of the Coronavirus pandemic, these rehabilitation methods constitute a huge benefit in preventing the spread of this virus. The use of various forms of virtual cognitive rehabilitation are more beneficial and popular in modern contemporary rehabilitation treatment activities. Further research into telerehabilitation is being carried out on the basis of non-invasive brain stimulation with the purpose of effective practical application of the results in the everyday practical life of patients.;2020;4
Background: Intensive, adaptable and engaging telerehabilitation is needed to enhance recovery and maximize outcomes. Such services may be provided under early supported discharge, or later for chronic populations. A novel virtual reality game-based telerehabilitation system was designed for individuals post-stroke to enhance their bimanual upper extremity motor function, cognition, and wellbeing. Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of novel therapeutic game controller and telerehabilitation system for home use. Methods: Individuals chronic post-stroke and their caregivers were recruited (n = 8 + 8) for this feasibility study. One was a screen failure and seven completed 4 weeks (20 sessions) of home-based therapy with or without remote monitoring. Standardized clinical outcome measures were taken pre- and post-therapy. Game performance outcomes were sampled at every session, while participant and caregiver subjective evaluations were done weekly. Results: There was a 96% rate of compliance to protocol, resulting in an average of 13,000 total arm repetitions/week/participant. Group analysis showed significant (p <.05) improvements in grasp strength (effect size [ES] = 0.15), depression (Beck Depression Inventory II, ES = 0.75), and cognition (Neuropsychological Assessment Battery for Executive Function, ES = 0.46). Among the 49 outcome variables, 36 variables (73.5%) improved significantly (p = .001, binomial sign test). Technology acceptance was very good with system rating by participants at 3.7/5 and by caregivers at 3.5/5. Conclusions: These findings indicate the feasibility and efficacy of the system in providing home-based telerehabilitation. The BrightBrainer system needs to be further evaluated in randomized control trials and with individuals early post-stroke.;2020;4
"Background: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a global problem that causes significant pain and physical dysfunction, substantially impacting on quality of life and imposing enormous cost to the healthcare system. Exercise is pivotal to OA management, yet uptake by people with knee OA is inadequate. Limited access to appropriately skilled health professionals, such as physiotherapists, for prescription of an exercise program and support with exercise is a major barrier to optimal care. Internet-enabled video consultations permit widespread reach. However, services offering video consultations with physiotherapists for musculoskeletal conditions are scant in Australia where there is typically no Government or private health insurer funding for such services. The paucity of robust evidence demonstrating video consultations with physiotherapists are clinically effective, safe and cost-effective for knee OA is hampering implementation of, and willingness of healthcare policymakers to pay for, these services. Methods: This is an assessor- and participant-blinded, two-arm, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Australia. We are recruiting 394 people from the community with chronic knee pain consistent with a clinical diagnosis of knee OA. Participants are randomly allocated to receive physiotherapy care via i) video-conferencing or; ii) face-to-face consultations. Participants are provided five consultations (30-45 min each) with a physiotherapist over 3 months for prescription of a home-based strengthening exercise program (to be conducted independently at home) and physical activity plan, as well as OA education. Participants in both groups are provided with educational booklets and simple exercise equipment via post. The co-primary outcomes are change in self-reported i) knee pain on walking; and ii) physical function, with a primary end-point of 3 months and a secondary end-point of 9 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in other clinical outcomes (health-related quality of life; therapeutic relationship; global ratings of change; satisfaction with care; self-efficacy; physical activity levels), time and financial costs of attending consultations, healthcare usage and convenience. Non-inferiority will be assessed using the per-protocol dataset. Discussion: Findings will determine if video consultations with physiotherapists are non-inferior to traditional face-to-face consultations for management of people with knee OA.";2020;4
"Background: Language and communication impairments are among the most frequently reported long-term behavioral consequences of brain tumor. Such deficits may persist long after a patient has been discharged from the hospital and can significantly impact return to work, resumption of prior social roles, and interpersonal relations, as well as full engagement in leisure activities. While considerable research has centered on identifying and describing communication impairments in brain tumor survivors, relatively little research has investigated language therapy for this population. Aims: This report (1) reviews the literature and describes the language and cognitive-communicative profile of a 35-year-old man 6 years post glioblastoma excision with subsequent chemo- and radiation therapies; (2) presents cognitive-communication outcome data for this individual following an integrated discourse therapy; and (3) assesses treatment feasibility in face-to-face (F2F) and tele-neurorehabilitation (TNR) contexts. Methods: A battery of tests and weekly conversation probes were administered to evaluate baseline performance and potential changes associated with F2F and TNR treatment delivery. Integrated Conversation Therapy (ICT) was administered across four alternating (F2F and TNR) treatment blocks over 2 months. ICT is a solution-focused discourse intervention that simultaneously targets word finding, sentence processing, and authentic patient-selected conversational interactions. Results: Although the participant presented with long term-language impairments that were clinically distinct from stroke-associated aphasia, statistically significant post-treatment gains (>2 SEM) were evident following F2F and TNR treatment delivery on standardized measures of apraxia, discourse production, verbal memory, and self-ratings of discourse production, communication, and living with aphasia. While objective measures of treatment effect size (probes of CIU discourse data) were consistent across F2F and TNR delivery models, results of a satisfaction survey indicated a slight but statistically significant participant preference for TNR treatment delivery. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary support for F2F and TNR delivery of ICT discourse intervention for glioblastoma survivors. It also highlights the need for more research specifically dedicated to language therapy for this population.";2020;4
"Background: Many people with Parkinson disease do not have access to exercise programs that are specifically tailored to their needs and capabilities. This mobile app allows people with Parkinson disease to access Parkinson disease-specific exercises that are individually tailored using in-app demographic questions and performance tests which are fed into an algorithm which in turn produces a video-guided exercise program. Objective: To test the feasibility, safety, and signal of efficacy of a mobile app that facilitates exercise for people with Parkinson disease. Methods: A prospective, single-cohort design of people with Parkinson disease who had downloaded the 9zest app for exercise was used for this 12-week pilot study. Participants, who were recruited online, were encouraged to exercise with the full automated app for >= 150 minutes each week. The primary endpoints were feasibility (app usage and usability questions) and safety (adverse events and falls). The primary endpoints for signal of efficacy were a comparison of the in-app baseline and 8-week outcomes on the 30-second Sit-To-Stand (STS) test, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 8 (PDQ8). Results: For feasibility, of the 28 participants that completed the study, 12 participants averaged 150 minutes of app usage per week (3 averaged 120-150, 4 averaged 90-120, and 9 averaged less than 90 minutes). A majority of participants (>74%) felt the exercise was of value (16/19; 9 nonrespondents), provided adequate instruction (14/19; 9 nonrespondents), and was appropriate for level of function (16/19; 9 nonrespondents). For safety, there were no serious adverse events that occurred during the app-guided exercise. There were 4 reports of strain/sprain injuries while using the app among 3 participants, none of which necessitated medical attention. For signal of efficacy, there was improvement for each of the primary endpoints: STS (P=.01), TUG (P<.001), and PDQ8 (P=.01). Conclusions: Independent, video-guided exercise using a mobile app designed for exercise in Parkinson disease was safe and feasible though there was variability in app usage. Despite this, the results provide evidence for a signal of efficacy as there were improvements in 3 of the 3 outcomes.";2020;4
Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps have the potential to facilitate convenient health care delivery and self-management of health. However, many users have concerns about their privacy when they use mHealth apps. Different apps provide different solutions for protecting users' privacy. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine user preferences among the several privacy protection methods used in current mHealth apps and the reasons behind their preferences. Methods: Five privacy protection methods currently used in mHealth apps were presented to a group of study participants who had mild or moderate depression and expressed concerns about privacy of information when they used mental health apps. After a demonstration of the methods, study participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire and indicate their perceived privacy protection level (PPPL) of each method, their preference rating for each method, and the privacy protection methods they had used in the past. A brief interview was then conducted to collect study participants' comments on these methods and elicit the reasons for their preference ratings. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the statistical significance of differences in participants' preference ratings and in the PPPLs obtained for the five methods. Study participants' comments on the privacy protection methods and suggestions were noted and summarized. Results: Forty (40) study participants were selected from a large candidate pool using the IRB approved selection criteria. All study participants viewed the app demonstration and understood the five privacy protection methods properly, which was indicated by their correct sorting of the PPPL of the five methods in their answers to the questionnaire. All study participants specified their preferences with respect to these methods and provided the rationale behind their selections on the questionnaire and during the brief interview. The results indicate that the users preferred privacy protection methods with customizable modules in multi-purpose apps because of their convenience and strong privacy protection, where the customization can be done either in the app or via a Web portal. Conclusions: This study identified user preferred privacy protection methods. These identified privacy protection methods may be used in many types of apps that perform sensitive health information management to better protect users' privacy and encourage more users to adopt these mHealth apps.;2020;4
Background: Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that requires a complex, differential, and lifelong treatment strategy, which involves high monitoring efforts and the accumulation of numerous medical data. A fast and broad availability of care, as well as patient-relevant data and a stronger integration of patients and participating care providers into the complex treatment process is desirable. The aim of the ERDF-funded project Integrated Care Portal Multiple Sclerosis (IBMS) was to develop a pathway-based care model and a corresponding patient portal for MS patients and health care professionals (HCPs) as a digital tool to deliver the care model. Methods: The patient portal was created according to a patient-centered design approach which involves both the patients' and the professionals' view. Buurmann's five iterative phases were integrated into a design science research process. A problem analysis focusing on functions and user interfaces was conducted through surveys and workshops with MS patients and HCPs. Based on this, the patient portal was refined and a prototype of the portal was implemented using an agile software development strategy. Results: HCPs and patients already use digital hardware and are open to new technologies. Nevertheless, they desire improved (digital) communication and coordination between care providers. Both groups require a number of functions for the patient portal, which were implemented in the prototype. Usability tests with patients and HCPs are planned to consider whether the portal is deemed as usable, acceptable as well as functional to prepare for any needed ameliorations. Discussion: After testing the patient portal for usability, acceptability, and functionality, it will most likely be a useful and high-quality electronic health (eHealth) tool for patient management from day care to telerehabilitation. It implements clinical pathways in a manner which is comprehensible for patients. Future developments of the patient portal modules could include additional diseases, the integration of quality management and privacy management tools, and the use of artificial intelligence to personalize treatment strategies.;2020;4
BACKGROUND: One of the most interesting emerging medical devices is the medical avatar - a digital representation of the patient that can be used toward myriad ends, the full potential of which remains to be explored. Medical avatars have been instantiated as telemedical tools used to establish a representation of the patient in tele-space, upon which data about the patient's health can be represented and goals and progress can be visually tracked. Manipulation of the medical avatar has also been explored as a means of increasing motivation and inducing neural plasticity. OBJECTIVE: The article reviews the literature on body representation, simulation, and action-observation and explores how these components of neurorehabilitation are engaged by an avatar-based self-representation. METHODS: Through a review of the literature on body representation, simulation, and action-observation and a review of how these components of neurorehabilitation can be engaged and manipulated with an avatar, the neuroplastic potential of the medical avatar is explored. Literature on the use of the medical avatar for neurorehabilitation is also reviewed. RESULTS: This review demonstrates that the medical avatar has vast potentialities in neurorehabilitation and that further research on its use and effect is needed.;2020;4
Background: Patellofemoral pain (PFP) impairs joint- and health-related quality of life and may be associated with knee osteoarthritis. We developed a novel, 2-phase, stepped-care approach for PFP, combining (1) self-directed web-based education and exercise therapy with (2) physiotherapist-supported education and exercise therapy. Physiotherapy sessions can be provided using 2 different modalities: face-to-face and telerehabilitation. Objective: This study aims to (1) determine the feasibility of our stepped-care approach, (2) explore patient-reported outcomes following self-directed web-based education and exercise therapy in people with PFP (phase 1), and (3) estimate the differences in treatment effects between face-to-face and telerehabilitation to support further education and exercise therapy (phase 2) in those who had not completely recovered following self-directed care. Methods: Phase 1 involved 6 weeks of self-directed web-based education and exercise therapy. Phase 2 involved random allocation to a further 12 weeks of physiotherapist-led (up to 8 sessions) education and exercise therapy delivered face-to-face or via telerehabilitation to participants who did not rate themselves as completely recovered following phase 1. Feasibility indicators of process, adherence, and participant retention were collected as primary outcomes alongside patient-reported outcomes on Global Rating of Change and knee pain, disability, knee-related quality of life, pain catastrophism, kinesiophobia, and knee self-efficacy. All participants were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks. Results: A total of 71 participants were screened to identify 35 participants with PFP to enter the study. Overall, 100% (35/35) and 88% (31/35) of the participants were followed up with at 6 and 18 weeks, respectively. In phase 1 of the study, participants accessed the My Knee Cap website for an average of 6 (7.5) days and performed the exercises for an average of 2.5 (3.6) times per week. A total of 20% (7/35) of the participants reported that they had completely recovered at 6 weeks. Furthermore, 93% (26/28) of the participants who were followed up and had not completely recovered at 6 weeks agreed to be enrolled in phase 2. No statistically significant differences were found between the face-to-face and telerehabilitation groups for any outcome. The novel stepped-care approach was associated with marked improvement or complete recovery in 40% (14/35) of the participants following phase 1 and 71% (25/35) of the participants following phase 2. Conclusions: Self-directed web-based education and exercise therapy for people with PFP is feasible, as noted by the high rate of participant retention and home exercise adherence achieved in this study. Furthermore, 20% (7/35) of people reported complete recovery at 6 weeks. Both face-to-face and telerehabilitation physiotherapy should be considered for those continuing to seek care, as there is no difference in outcomes between these delivery modes. Determining the efficacy of the stepped-care model may help guide more efficient health care for PFP.;2020;4
Background: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) are at a high risk of progressing to dementia. Recent guidelines indicate the importance of promoting multidimensional and multi-domain interventions to prevent further decline. Due to its growing effectiveness, comparable to conventional face-to-face interventions, the use of technology is gaining relevance. Tele-rehabilitation systems have the potential to engage patients in multi-dimensional activity programs and to guarantee a low-cost continuum of care through remote control. A possible limitation of such programs is represented by the lack of familiarization with technology and computers in elderly people. The purpose of this study is to describe the feasibility, adherence, and appreciation of the GOAL Tele-R system, administered by a web-application through remote control in patients with MCI/VCI. Methods: Feasibility of the Tele-R system was evaluated by means of distribution of patients' attrition along the study phases, controlling for potential systematic bias in drop-out rates due to the technological device. Adherence was evaluated analyzing drop-out rates and indexes of carried out activities. Patients' appreciation was analyzed through ad hoc satisfaction questionnaire items. Results: Out of 86 approached patients, 25 (29%) were not enrolled, 30 (35%) dropped-out after randomization, and 31 (36%) completed the study (standard care group n = 12, the tele-R group n = 19). Compared to the tele-R group, rates of drop-outs resulted significantly higher for the standard care group (34 vs. 62%, respectively, p = 0.029). Taking into account baseline characteristics, females resulted in a statistically significant higher rate of drop-outs compared to males (66 vs. 27%, respectively, p = 0.003). Overall adherence to the proposed activities was 84% (85% for cognitive module and 83% for physical activity module). Concerning satisfaction, participants provided a good mean level of appreciation (3.7 +/- 0.8, range 1-5), a positive feedback for usability, and a subjective perception of cognitive, emotional, and physical benefits due to the training. Conclusion: The GOAL Tele-R system seems a feasible technological rehabilitation program, reaching an acceptable level of adherence and appreciation in patients with an MCI/VCI condition.;2020;4
"Background: Persons with dementia tend to be vulnerable to mobility challenges and hence face a greater risk of fall and subsequent fractures, morbidity, and mortality. Motion-based technologies (MBTs), also called sensor-based technologies or virtual reality, have the potential for assisting physical exercise and training as a part of a disease management and rehabilitation program, but little is known about its' use for people with dementia. Objective: The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of MBT physical training at home for people with dementia. Methods: A 3-phase pilot study: (1) baseline start-up, (2) 15 weeks of group training at a local care center twice a week, and (3) 12 weeks of group training reduced to once a week, supplemented with individual MBT training twice a week at home. A total of 26 people with dementia from a municipality in Southern Denmark were eligible and agreed to participate in this study. Three withdrew from the study, leaving 23 participants for the final analysis. Feasibility was measured by the percentage of participants who trained with MBT at home, and their completion rate of total scheduled MBT sessions. Efficacy was evaluated by physical function, measured by Sit-to-Stand (STS), Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG), 6-minute Walk Test (6MW), and 10-meter Dual-task Walking Test (10MDW); cognitive function was measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q); and European Quality of Life 5 dimensions questionnaire (EQOL5) was used for measuring quality of life. Descriptive statistics were applied accordingly. Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests were applied to explore significant differences within and between the groups. Results: As much as 12 of 23 participants (52%) used the supplemental MBT training at home. Among them, 6 (50%) completed 75% or more scheduled sessions, 3 completed 25% or less, and 3 completed between 25% and 75% of scheduled sessions. For physical and cognitive function tests, supplementing with MBT training at home showed a tendency of overall stabilization of scores among the group of participants who actively trained with MBT; especially, the 10MDW test even showed a significant improvement from 9.2 to 7.1 seconds (P=.03). We found no positive effect on EQOL5 tests. Conclusions: More than half of the study population with dementia used MBT training at home, and among them, half had an overall high adherence to the home training activity. Physical function tended to remain stable or even improved among high-adherence MBT individuals. We conclude that MBT training at home may be feasible for some individuals with dementia. Further research is warranted.";2020;4
"Background: Presenting pictures accompanied by the corresponding spoken words to be repeated is a commonly used method for treating naming impairments in aphasic people. Aims: In this study, we investigated whether the presentation order of pictures and words in repetition training affects treatment outcome. Methods & Procedures: We administered a computer-based word repetition protocol at a distance to 12 individuals with chronic pure anomia. The words to be repeated were presented with the corresponding pictures. We manipulated the timing of word and picture presentation. In one condition Picture-Word condition (Pic-Wd), the picture onset preceded that of the corresponding spoken word; in the other condition Word-Picture (Wd-Pic), the presentation order was reversed. Data were analyzed at the group and the single subject level to determine the relative efficacy of the two experimental conditions and the cognitive features predicting therapy success. Outcomes & Results: The study demonstrates the substantial equivalence of the two presentation orders at the group level. At the single subject level in a minority of cases, there are hints of an asymmetrical response favoring either the Pic-Wd or the Wd-Pic treatment. Non-word repetition skills were the only feature in the participants' cognitive profile that was reliably linked to therapy outcome. Conclusions: When pictures are presented alongside the corresponding word in repetition training, stimuli presentation order seems to have only a minor effect on therapy outcome. Potential advantages of both treatments are discussed with reference to the cognitive profile of treated patients.";2020;4
BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, telehealth was an emerging occupational therapy (OT) service delivery model possessing many positive attributes. These include the potential to offset well-documented global occupational therapy practitioner (OTP) shortages. However, wide-spread adoption of telehealth as a delivery model in school-based practice is lacking in the OT evidence literature. While the COVID-19 global health emergency propelled many OTPs into the use of telehealth technologies, in some cases with minimal preparation, an investigation was conducted into the likelihood of telehealth adoption when comprehensive training was provided so that appropriateness of student fit for telehealth could be determined and essential planning could take place. OBJECTIVE: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, a comprehensive training program was developed incorporating detailed perceptions of OTPs experienced in and new to telehealth in school-based practice as measured via surveys with the goal of increasing adoption of telehealth technologies for the delivery of OT services. Following the completion of the online New to Telehealth Pre-training Survey, OTPs new to telehealth were invited to complete the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice training program. Analysis of pre- and post-training surveys yielded information about attitudinal changes experienced post-training. METHODS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, school-based occupational therapy practitioners (OTP) experienced in telehealth were invited to complete a survey exploring benefits and barriers encountered in the delivery of OT services using telehealth. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete a different survey intended to explore attitudes about the potential use of telehealth. Data collected from both surveys were used to develop a comprehensive training program, The OT Telehealth Primer for School-based Practice. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete the training program and a post-training survey. A descriptive data analysis was completed on responses from pre- to post-training surveys and the chi-square test of independence was used to evaluate difference in reported likelihood of adopting telehealth into practice before and after training. RESULTS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, the top benefits identified by the OTP Experienced Telehealth-User Survey included: 1) service access, 2) collaboration and carry-over with team members, 3) efficiency themes, and 4) student engagement and comfort. Top benefits identified by the OTP New to Telehealth Survey identified the same top benefits after participating in the training program. A significant decrease in perceived barriers was noted in scores from pre- to post-training by OTPs new to telehealth. The perceived barriers that did not significantly decrease post-training suggest the need for future education and future protocol development. These included: unreliable internet, lack of hands-on opportunity and e-helpers' (parent, caregiver or support system available to assist the student in person during a telehealth session) decreased comfort with technology. Of the participants who completed the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice, 80% reported being likely to add telehealth as a delivery model for future OT practice. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, completion of the comprehensive training program OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice program yielded improved perceived benefits and an increased likelihood of telehealth adoption into practice by OTPs. However, both OTPs and school administrators require ongoing education for successful widespread adoption to be achieved thus offsetting the global shortage of OTPs and increasing service access. Future research, particularly related to available training and support for the rapid adoption of telehealth technologies during the COVID-19 global health emergency, will yield helpful information about the likelihood of continued use of telehealth in practice.;2020;4
Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary patient-tailored intervention that aims to improve the physical and psychological condition of people with chronic respiratory diseases. Providing pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) services to the growing population of patients is challenging due to shortages in health care practitioners and pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Telerehabilitation has the potential to address this shortage in practitioners and PR programs as well as improve patients' participation and adherence. This study's purpose was to identify and evaluate the influences of intention of health care practitioners to use telerehabilitation. Methods: Data were collected through a self-administered Internet-based survey. Results: Surveys were completed by 222 health care practitioners working in pulmonary rehabilitation with 79% having a positive intention to use telerehabilitation. Specifically, perceived usefulness was a significant individual predictor of positive intentions to use telerehabilitation. Conclusion: Perceived usefulness may be an important factor associated with health care providers' intent to use telerehabilitation for pulmonary rehabilitation.;2020;4
"Background: Real-time video communication technology allows virtual face-to-face interactions between the provider and the user, and can be used to modify risk factors for smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and obesity. No systematic reviews have examined the effectiveness of individual real-time video counseling for addressing each of the risk factors for smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and obesity. Objective: This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of individually delivered real-time video counseling on risk factors for smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and obesity. Methods: The MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), PsycINFO, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus databases were searched for eligible studies published up to November 21, 2019. Eligible studies were randomized or cluster randomized trials that tested the effectiveness of individual real-time video communication interventions on smoking, nutrition, alcohol, physical activity, and obesity in any population or setting; the comparator was a no-intervention control group or any other mode of support (eg, telephone); and an English-language publication. Results: A total of 13 studies were eligible. Four studies targeted smoking, 3 alcohol, 3 physical activity, and 3 obesity. In 2 of the physical activity studies, real-time video counseling was found to significantly increase physical activity when compared with usual care at week 9 and after 5 years. Two obesity studies found a significant change in BMI between a video counseling and a documents group, with significantly greater weight loss in the video counseling group than the in-person as well as the control groups. One study found that those in the video counseling group were significantly more likely than those in the telephone counseling group to achieve smoking cessation. The remaining studies found no significant differences between video counseling and telephone counseling or face-to-face counseling for smoking cessation, video counseling and face-to-face treatment on alcohol consumption, video counseling and no counseling for physical activity, and video counseling and face-to-face treatment on BMI. The global methodological quality rating was moderate in 1 physical activity study, whereas 12 studies had a weak global rating. Conclusions: Video counseling is potentially more effective than a control group or other modes of support in addressing physical inactivity and obesity and is not less effective in modifying smoking and alcohol consumption. Further research is required to determine the relative benefits of video counseling in terms of other policy and practice decision-making factors such as costs and feasibility.";2020;4
Background: Remote virtual rehabilitation aroused growing interest in the last decades, and its role has gained importance following the recent spread of COVID19 pandemic. The advantages of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), gamification, and telerehabilitation have been demonstrated in several medical fields. In this review, we searched the literature for studies using these technologies for orthopedic rehabilitation and analyzed studies' quality, type and field of rehabilitation, patients' characteristics, and outcomes to describe the state of the art of VR, AR, gamification, and telerehabilitation for orthopedic rehabilitation. Methods: A comprehensive search on PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Embase databases was conducted. This review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies published between 2015 and 2020 about remote virtual rehabilitations for orthopedic patients were selected. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Cochrane Risk-of-Bias assessment tool were used for quality assessment. Results: 24 studies (9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 non-randomized studies) and 2472 patients were included. Studies mainly concern telerehabilitation (56%), and to a lesser extent VR (28%), AR (28%), and gamification (16%). Remote virtual technologies were used following knee and hip arthroplasty. The majority of included patients were between 40 and 60 years old and had a university degree. Remote virtual rehabilitation was not inferior to face-to-face therapy, and physical improvements were demonstrated by increased clinical scores. Orthopedic virtual remote rehabilitation decreased costs related to transports, hospitalizations, and readmissions. Conclusion: The heterogeneity of included studies prevented a meta-analysis of their results. Age and social context influence adaptability to technology, and this can modify compliance to treatment and outcomes. A good relationship between patient and physiotherapist is essential for treatment compliance and new technologies are useful to maintain clinical interactions remotely. Remote virtual technologies allow the delivery of high-quality care at reduced costs. This is a necessity given the growing demand for orthopedic rehabilitation and increasing costs related to it. Future studies need to develop specific and objective methods to evaluate the clinical quality of new technologies and definitively demonstrate advantages of VR, AR, gamification, and telerehabilitation compared to face-to face orthopedic rehabilitation.;2020;4
Background: Rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP) is a common and disabling musculoskeletal condition. Internet-based and telerehabilitation delivery of recommended care may improve access to care and improve adherence and outcomes. Objective: The primary aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to assess the feasibility of a 12-week internet-delivered intervention for RCRSP comparing advice only, recommended care, and recommended care with group-based telerehabilitation. Methods: Reporting was in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist for pilot and feasibility trials. People with a primary complaint of RCRSP for 3 months or longer were identified via a paid Facebook strategy. Screening involved an online questionnaire followed by a 20-minute telehealth assessment. Participants were randomly allocated (via a Zelen design) to receive (1) advice only, (2) recommended care (internet-delivered evidence-based exercise and education), or (3) recommended care and telerehabilitation (including a weekly group teleconference session). Progression criteria for a full-scale trial included (1) recruitment of 20% or greater of eligible participants, (2) acceptable adherence (two or more of the three prescribed weekly sessions) among 70% or greater of participants, (3) 80% or greater retention of participants, (4) absence of intervention-related serious adverse events, and (5) 80% or greater response rates to questionnaires. Secondary clinical and patient knowledge outcomes were collected (via email or text) at baseline, six weeks, and 12 weeks (for clinical and patient knowledge), and within-group change was reported descriptively. Results: We enrolled 36 of 38 (95%) eligible participants and all participants were recruited within a 3-week period. Of the 36 participants, 12 participants were allocated to each of the three trial arms. The mean age of participants was between 51 and 56 years, and 83% (10/12) to 92% (11/12) were female. Retention at the 12-week endpoint was 94% (34/36) and response to email questionnaires at other time points was 83% or greater. We found acceptable adherence (defined as greater than 70% of participants performing exercise 2 or 3 times/week) in the recommended care group with telerehabilitation but not in the recommended care group without telerehabilitation. There was a total of 24 adverse events over 108 person-months of observation. All adverse events were mild or moderate (mainly muscle and shoulder symptoms), with the exception of one instance of elective surgery (unrelated to the person's shoulder condition). Conclusions: Our prespecified success criteria were met or exceeded, but there was a gender imbalance toward women. It is feasible to progress to a fully powered trial, but strategies to address the gender imbalance need to be implemented.;2020;4
"Background: Serious gaming has increasingly gained attention as a potential new component in clinical practice. Specifically, its use in the rehabilitation of motor dysfunctions has been intensively researched during the past three decades. Objective: The aim of this scoping review was to evaluate the current role of serious games in upper extremity rehabilitation, and to identify common methods and practice as well as technology patterns. This objective was approached via the exploration of published research efforts over time. Methods: The literature search, using the PubMed and Scopus databases, included articles published from 1999 to 2019. The eligibility criteria were (i) any form of game-based arm rehabilitation; (ii) published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference; (iii) introduce a game in an electronic format; (iv) published in English; and (v) not a review, meta-analysis, or conference abstract. The search strategy identified 169 relevant articles. Results: The results indicated an increasing research trend in the domain of serious gaming deployment in upper extremity rehabilitation. Furthermore, differences regarding the number of publications and the game approach were noted between studies that used commercial devices in their rehabilitation systems and those that proposed a custom-made robotic arm, glove, or other devices for the connection and interaction with the game platform. A particularly relevant observation concerns the evaluation of the introduced systems. Although one-third of the studies evaluated their implementations with patients, in most cases, there is the need for a larger number of participants and better testing of the rehabilitation scheme efficiency over time. Most of the studies that included some form of assessment for the introduced rehabilitation game mentioned user experience as one of the factors considered for evaluation of the system. Besides user experience assessment, the most common evaluation method involving patients was the use of standard medical tests. Finally, a few studies attempted to extract game features to introduce quantitative measurements for the evaluation of patient improvement. Conclusions: This paper presents an overview of a significant research topic and highlights the current state of the field. Despite extensive attempts for the development of gamified rehabilitation systems, there is no definite answer as to whether a serious game is a favorable means for upper extremity functionality improvement; however, this certainly constitutes a supplementary means for motivation. The development of a unified performance quantification framework and more extensive experiments could generate richer evidence and contribute toward this direction.";2020;4
"Background: Stroke is an abrupt interruption of brain circulation that constitutes a neurological emergency. Aphasia is a language disorder caused by stroke. It can affect patients' reading, writing, comprehension and expression. The aim of the study is to find out if the use of the latest portable technologies such as tablets, computers and mobile phones can help to improve the rehabilitation of patients with aphasia. Methods: A literature review has been carried out on the main databases; Pubmed, Scopus and Cinahl, of articles in english and spanish published between june and december 2019 following the PRISMA methodology. Results: Sixty-two articles were included in which the use of technologies alongside traditional rehabilitation therapies showed that might improve the recovery of aphasic patients. Most studies have a sample size of less than fifty patients (21.7%), with only three publications having a sample size of more than 150 patients (1.86%). Conclusions: The review shows that the use of digital applications might improve aphasia rehabilitation in patients who have suffered a stroke, but more studies are needed due to the small sample size of those conducted so far and to explore whether that improvement hold up over time.";2020;4
"Background: Telerehabilitation (TR) in chronic stroke patients has emerged as a promising modality to deliver rehabilitative treatment-at-home. The primary objective of our methodical clinical study was to determine the efficacy of a novel rehabilitative device in terms of recovery of function in daily activities and patient satisfaction and acceptance of the medical device provided. Methods: A 12-week physiotherapy program (balance exercises, upper and lower limb exercises with specific motor tasks using a biofeedback system and exergaming) was administered using the WeReha device. Twenty-five (N = 25) chronic stroke outpatients were enrolled, and the data of 22 patients was analyzed. Clinical data and functional parameters were collected by Berg Balance scale (BBS), Barthel Index (BI), Fugl-Meyer scale (FM), Modified Rankin scale (mRS), and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire at baseline (T0), after treatment (T1), and at the 12-week follow-up (T2). Statistical tests were used to detect significant differences (P < .05), and Cohen's (Co) value was calculated. Results: BI scores improved significantly after treatment (P = .036; Co 0.776, medium), as well as BBS scores (P = .008; Co 1.260, high). The results in FM scale (P = .003) and mRS scores (P = .047) were significant post treatment. Follow-up scores remained stable across all scales, except the BI. The A and C sub-scales of the TAM correlated significantly to only a T2 to T1 difference for BI scores with P = .021 and P = .042. Conclusion: Currently, the WeReha program is not the conventional therapy for stroke patients, but it could be an integrative telerehabilitative resource for such patients as a conventional exercise program-at-home.";2020;4
Background: Telerehabilitation can facilitate multidisciplinary management for people with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP). It provides health care access to individuals who are physically and economically disadvantaged. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation compared with a clinic-based intervention for people with NCLBP in Nigeria. Methods: A cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial from a health care perspective was conducted. Patients with NCLBP were assigned to either telerehabilitation-based McKenzie therapy (TBMT) or clinic-based McKenzie therapy (CBMT). Interventions were carried out 3 times weekly for a period of 8 weeks. Patients' level of disability was measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at baseline, week 4, and week 8. To estimate the health-related quality of life of the patients, the ODI was mapped to the short-form six dimensions instrument to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Health care resource use and costs were assessed based on the McKenzie extension protocol in Nigeria in 2019. Descriptive and inferential data analyses were also performed to assess the clinical effectiveness of the interventions. Bootstrapping was conducted to generate the point estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results: A total of 47 patients (TBMT, n=21 and CBMT, n=26), with a mean age of 47 (SD 11.6) years for telerehabilitation and 50 (SD 10.7) years for the clinic-based intervention, participated in this study. The mean cost estimates of TBMT and CBMT interventions per person were 22,200 naira (US $61.7) and 38,200 naira (US $106), respectively. QALY gained was 0.085 for TBMT and 0.084 for CBMT. The TBMT arm was associated with an additional 0.001 QALY (95% CI 0.001 to 0.002) per participant compared with the CBMT arm. Thus, the ICER showed that the TBMT arm was less costly and more effective than the CBMT arm. Conclusions: The findings of the study suggested that telerehabilitation for people with NCLBP was cost saving. Given the small number of participants in this study, further examination of effects and costs of the interventions is needed within a larger sample size. In addition, future studies are required to assess the cost-effectiveness of this intervention in the long term from the patient and societal perspective.;2020;4
"Background: Telerehabilitation in cardiology has the potential to become the alternative to regular outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Our study focuses on the wrist heart rate monitor as a telerehabilitation device, defines detected limitations, and compares results between home-based and regular outpatient rehabilitation methods, related to physical fitness, quality of life, and training adherence. The study design was a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Eligible 56 cardiac rehabilitation patients were randomized into a 12-week regular outpatient training group (ROT) and interventional home-based telerehabilitation group (ITG). For both groups, the intensity of the training was prescribed to be performed at 70% to 80% of heart rate reserve for 60 minutes, 3 times a week. The ITG patients started their training with a wrist heart rate monitor in their home environment. These patients received feedback once a week, reflecting data uploaded on the internet application. The ROT patients performed their exercise under the direct supervision of a physical specialist in a regular outpatient clinic. Physical fitness and health-related quality of life were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Training adherence in both groups was determined and compared. Results: Fifty-one patients comleted the intervention (91%); no serious adverse events were recorded. Physical fitness expressed as peak oxygen uptake showed significant improvement (P < .001) in ROT group from 23.4 +/- 3.3 to 25.9 +/- 4.1 mL/kg/min and (P < .01) in ITG group from 23.7 +/- 4.1 to 26.5 +/- 5.7 mL/kg/min without significant between-group differences after 12 weeks of intervention. The training adherence between groups was similar. Conclusion: Our study shows that telerehabilitation via wrist heart rate monitor could become an alternative kind of cardiac rehabilitation which deserves attention and further analyzing.";2020;4
"BACKGROUND: Telerehabilitation is a promising approach for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), but uncertainties regarding patients' access and preferences remain. AIM: To investigate the access to telecommunication technologies and rehabilitation services of patients with MS, and their willingness to use these technologies for rehabilitation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Outpatient neurological facility. POPULATION: Patients with MS. METHODS: Patients with MS attending consultations in the Neurology department were asked to fill in a paper questionnaire. This anonymous z was designed to gain information about needs and access to rehabilitation and telecommunication technologies, as well as interests and perspectives of telerehabilitation among these patients. Descriptive statistics, Chi-squared tests and logistic regressions were used to describe the sample and survey answers. RESULTS: Two hundred patients completed the questionnaire. Mean age was 44.41(+/- 12.52) years. Seventy-one percent were women, and 49% were unemployed. Ninety-one percent of the patients regularly used internet and 73% used apps. Most patients were interested in using telecommunication technologies to receive a program of physical exercises (62%), for information and personalized advice about physical activity and MS (69%), and to communicate with caregivers (75%). Patients with EDSS>4 were less interested than patients with EDSS <= 4 in communicating with the caregivers via apps (33% vs. 52%,.19%[CI-36%;-2%],P=0.04) but expressed greater interest in receiving information and personal advice about physical activity and MS via the internet (70% vs. 51%,.19%[CI+2%;+36%],P=0.03). One third of the patients was not interested in receiving telerehabilitation interventions (32%), notably patients with EDSS>4 and non-workers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS are mainly interested in using telecommunication technologies for rehabilitation services, and most of these patients have access to the required technology. Being mildly disabled and having a professional activity are associated with a greater interest in telerehabilitation. In contrary, patients with moderate-to-severe disability and non-workers have reportedly less access and ease in using the required technologies. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Telerehabilitation is feasible and wished by patients with MS, specifically in patients with low EDSS scores and workers. Given the strong need for rehabilitation in more disabled patients, the barriers to its access, the lower access and ease of use of telecommunication technologies, a special effort is needed to facilitate their use in these patients.";2020;4
Background: The application of telehealth for surgical follow-up has gained recent exposure in orthopedic care. Although the results following joint arthroplasty are encouraging, the role of telemedicine for postoperative care following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair still needs to be defined. The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and socioeconomic benefits of telehealth as a platform for postoperative follow-up. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 66 patients who underwent follow-up in the office vs. via telemedicine for postoperative visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after surgery. Post-visit surveys were administered to patients and physicians via e-mail, and the Student t test and Fisher exact test were used to compare responses. Results: In total, 58 patients (88%) completed the study (28 telehealth vs. 30 control). Patients in each group demonstrated similar pain scores at each follow-up visit (P = .638, P = .124, and P = .951) and similar overall satisfaction scores (P = .304). Patients in the telehealth group expressed a stronger preference for telehealth than their control counterparts (P < .001). Telehealth visits were less time-consuming from both a patient (P < .001) and physician (P = .002) perspective. Telehealth visits also required less time off work for both patients (P = .001) and caregivers (P < .001). Conclusion: Patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery were able to receive safe and effective early postoperative follow-up care using telemedicine. The preference for telehealth increased for both surgeons and patients following first-hand experience. The use of a telehealth platform is a reasonable follow-up model to consider for patients seeking convenient and efficient care following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Background: The demand for total hip arthroplasty (THA) is quickly rising given the escalating global incidence of hip osteoarthritis, and it is widely accepted that the post-surgery rehabilitation is key to optimize outcomes. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new telerehabilitation solution, ReHub, for the physical function and clinical outcome improvement following THA. The specific aims of this manuscript are to describe the study design, protocol, content of interventions, and primary and secondary outcomes and to discuss the clinical rehabilitation impact of the expected experimental results. Methods/design: This prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial will include 56 patients who had undergone primary THA. Patients are randomized to a control group (standard rehabilitation during the 2-week stay in the rehabilitation clinic followed by 3 weeks of unsupervised home-based rehabilitation) or an experimental group (standard rehabilitation during the 2-week stay in the rehabilitation clinic followed by 3 weeks of home-based ReHub-assisted telerehabilitation). The primary outcome is physical performance assessed through the Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test. Secondary outcomes include independence level, pain intensity, hip disability, hip range of motion, muscle strength, and patient's perception of clinical improvement. Discussion: Proving the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a home-based telerehabilitation program for physical and muscle function following THA could support its systematic incorporation in post-surgical rehabilitation protocols, which should be tailored to the individual and collective needs.;2020;4
Background: The effectiveness of telerehabilitation for a patient with knee osteoarthritis may depend upon the person's adherence to intervention. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether people with knee osteoarthritis would adhere to exercise-therapy facilitated via multiple media in Brazil, a newly industrialized country. Method: This is a feasibility study, pre-post intervention. Middle aged (40-50 years) and elderly (>= 70 years) people with knee osteoarthritis received inperson exercise-therapy instructions on the first day, along with a booklet and DVD (videos) to take home. Participants also received six motivational phone calls throughout the 12-week treatment. Satisfaction and adherence were assessed one week after intervention with the Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS), sections B and C. Preference on the method used to adhere to exercises was recorded. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation was well accepted by middle-aged and elderly Brazilians with knee osteoarthritis. The preferred media to enhance adherence, was a booklet with descriptions of the exercises, especially for the elderly cohort.;2020;4
Background: The evaluation and management of outcomes risk has become an essential element of a modern total joint replacement program. Our multidisciplinary team designed an evidence-based tool to address modifiable risk factors for adverse outcomes after primary hip and knee arthroplasty surgery. Methods: Our protocols were designed to identify, intervene, and mitigate risk through evidence-based patient optimization. Nurse navigators screened patients preoperatively, identified and treated risk factors, and followed patients for 90 days postoperatively. We compared patients participating in our optimization program (N = 104) to both a historical cohort (N = 193) and a contemporary cohort (N = 166). Results: Risk factor identification and optimization resulted in lower hospital length of stay (LOS) and postoperative emergency department (ED) visits. Patients in the optimization cohort had a statistically significant decrease in mean LOS as compared to both the historical cohort (2.55 vs 1.81 days, P < .001) and contemporary cohort (2.56 vs 1.81 days, P < .001). Patients in the optimization cohort had a statistically significant decrease in 30- and 90-day ED visits compared to the historical cohort ( P30-day = .042, P90-day = .003). When compared with the contemporary cohort, the optimization cohort had a statistically significant decrease in 90-day ED visits (21.08% vs 10.58%, P = .025). The optimization cohort had a statistically significant increase in the percentage of patients discharged home. We noted nonsignificant reductions in readmission rate, transfusion rate, and surgical site infections. Conclusion: Optimization of patients before elective primary total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty reduced average LOS, ED visits, and drove telerehabilitation use. Our results add to the limited body of literature supporting this patient-centered approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2020;4
"Background: The impact of cardiac rehabilitation on the number of alerts in patients with remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is unknown. We compared alerts in RM and outcomes in patients with CIEDs undergoing hybrid comprehensive telerehabilitation (HCTR) versus usual care (UC). Methods: Patients with heart failure (HF) after a hospitalization due to worsening HF within the last 6 months (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-III and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <= 40%) were enrolled in the TELEREH-HF study and randomised 1:1 to HCTR or UC. Patients with HCTR and CIEDs received RM (HCTR-RM). Patients with UC and CIEDs were offered RM optionally (UC-RM). Data from the initial 9 weeks of the study were analysed. Results: Of 850 enrolled patients, 208 were in the HCTR-RM group and 62 in the UC-RM group. The HCTR-RM group was less likely to have alerts of intrathoracic impedance (TI) decrease (p < 0.001), atrial fibrillation (AF) occurrence (p = 0.031) and lower mean number of alerts per patient associated with TI decrease (p < 0.0001) and AF (p = 0.019) than the UC-RM group. HCTR significantly decreased the occurrence of alerts in RM of CIEDs, 0.360 (95%CI, 0.189-0.686; p = 0.002), in multivariable regression analysis. There were two deaths in the HCTR-RM group (0.96%) and no deaths in the UC-RM group (p = 1.0). There were no differences in the number of hospitalised patients between the HCTR-RM and UC-RM group (p = 1.0). Conclusions: HCTR significantly reduced the number of patients with RM alerts of CIEDs related to TI decrease and AF occurrence. There were no differences in mortality or hospitalisation rates between HCTR-RM and UC-RM groups.";2020;4
"Background: The integration of digital applications within health care is called blended care. Introduction: Despite its potential, physiotherapists experience difficulty in determining which patients are suitable for blended care. This study aimed to develop a checklist to support physiotherapists while setting up a blended treatment. Therefore, we aimed to investigate which patient characteristics predict patients' suitability for blended physiotherapy and which patient characteristics need to be taken into account while determining the ratio between therapeutic guidance and a digital application. Methods: A scoping review was conducted consisting of (1) literature search in PubMed and PEDro up to December 2017: studies were eligible if they focused on blended physiotherapy consisting of contact at least twice with a physiotherapist complemented by a digital application, and characteristics related to patients' suitability for blended physiotherapy were extracted and categorized in themes; (2) a checklist item for each theme formulated by the authors, which resulted in a first version of the Dutch Blended Physiotherapy Checklist; and (3) expert opinion and feedback on clinical relevance by six experts. The checklist was adapted accordingly. Results: The final Dutch Blended Physiotherapy Checklist consists of eight items: motivation, safety, equipment, digital skills, health literacy, self-management, time, and financial factors. Discussion: The next step is to investigate the feasibility and predictive validity of the checklist, that is, whether this checklist is actually able to predict patients' suitability for blended physiotherapy. Conclusions: This study provides the final version of the Dutch Blended Physiotherapy Checklist, which is supposed to guide physiotherapists in their clinical reasoning process while setting up a personalized, blended physiotherapy treatment.";2020;4
Background: The primary goals of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) are to relieve pain, improve range of motion, and restore function. Physical therapy is commonly used to help achieve these goals. Recent evidence has pointed to the success and safety of a purely physician-guided, home-based or internet-based, program versus the traditional therapist guided program. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of TSA in patients using a web-based, home therapy program. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of TSA patients who were given the option of using a web-based, home therapy program. Functional outcomes were collected preoperatively, 6-month, and 12-month post-operative examinations. Physical examination parameters were recorded at preoperative, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month time-points. Results: Forty-seven patients used the web-based, home therapy program and had complete follow-up data at all time intervals. All mean range of motion parameters and functional scores improved significantly from preoperatively to postoperatively. There was one reported complication in a patient who sustained a subscapularis rupture and underwent subsequent open repair at 10 months postoperatively. Conclusion: This study demonstrates successful improvements in range of motion and functional outcomes in a subset of patients who utilized an online therapy program after TSA. Future study will be necessary to directly compare results in patients enrolled in formal, outpatient therapy programs and to determine barriers to utilization of web-based therapy programs.;2020;4
Background: The uptake of traditional pulmonary rehabilitation classes by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is poor because of personal factors that prevent accessibility to the venue. Therefore, there is a need for innovative methods of pulmonary rehabilitation, and virtual reality (VR) could be a promising technology for patients with COPD to access services remotely. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether VR improves compliance with pulmonary rehabilitation among patients with COPD, a particularly vulnerable patient group (Medical Research Council [MRC] 4 or 5), and whether VR provides a credible alternative to traditional pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Methods: This was an 8-week patient trial using an innovative VR pulmonary rehabilitation program. A purposive sample of 10 patients with COPD graded MRC 4 or 5 and registered at a selected health care center and a hospital in Cumbria, United Kingdom, were included. Qualitative (focus groups and interviews) data were collected, and to further support the qualitative findings, quantitative data (self-report patient surveys) were gathered before and after the 8-week trial. The 5 self-reported surveys included the Patient Activation Measure, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Short Physical Performance Battery, and the Edmonton Frail Scale. Results: In a thematic analysis of the qualitative data, 11 themes emerged specific to delivering pulmonary rehabilitation using VR. The quantitative data further support the qualitative findings by revealing significant improvements in all physical measures. Conclusions: Overall, this study demonstrates how remotely supervised VR-based pulmonary rehabilitation could help to overcome current issues and limitations associated with providing this service to patients with COPD at scale.;2020;4
Background: Visual field defects are a common consequence of stroke, and compensatory eye movement strategies have been identified as the most promising rehabilitation option. There has been a move toward compensatory telerehabilitation options, such as the Durham Reading and Exploration (DREX) training app, which significantly improves visual exploration, reading, and self-reported quality of life. Objective: This study details an iterative process of liaising with stroke survivors, carers, and health care professionals to identify barriers and facilitators to using rehabilitation tools, as well as elements of good practice in telerehabilitation, with a focus on how the DREX package can be maximized. Methods: Survey data from 75 stroke survivors informed 12 semistructured engagement activities (7 focus groups and 5 interviews) with 32 stroke survivors, 10 carers, and 24 occupational therapists. Results: Thematic analysis identified key themes within the data. Themes identified problems associated with poststroke health care from both patients'and occupational therapists' perspectives that need to be addressed to improve uptake of this rehabilitation tool and telerehabilitation options generally. This included identifying additional materials or assistance that were required to boost the impact of training packages. The acute rehabilitation setting was an identified barrier, and perceptions of technology were considered a barrier by some but a facilitator by others. In addition, 4 key features of telerehabilitation were identified: additional materials, the importance of goal setting, repetition, and feedback. Conclusions: The data were used to try to overcome some barriers to the DREX training and are further discussed as considerations for telerehabilitation in general moving forward.;2020;4
Background: Web-based physical therapy (WBPT) is a potential means to reduce costs following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Although outcomes data support the use of self-directed therapy after TKA, there is a paucity of literature evaluating its cost-effectiveness. This study aimed to determine utilization trends of either outpatient physical therapy (OPPT) or WBPT after TKA, assess the outcomes of patients based on their use of WBPT, OPPT, or both, and evaluate OPPT costs based on the amount of WBPT used. Methods: A retrospective review of 701 patients (731 TKAs) was performed. Patients were given a prescription for OPPT and access to a self-directed WBPT program. Functional scores were obtained preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively, and the rate of manipulation under anesthesia (MUA), range of motion, and PT costs were recorded. Results: About 49.8% of patients utilized WBPT, 34.7% of patients utilized WBPT and OPPT, and 23% of patients utilized neither source of therapy. Patients that utilized both WBPT and OPPT demonstrated the lowest rates of MUA. There were no differences in postoperative outcomes based on the number of WBPT logins. Overall, PT cost was 3.4 x higher for those that underwent MUA. Subgroup analysis of patients that utilized WBPT revealed that the cost and number of PT visits decreased as the number of logins increased. Patients younger than 65 utilized more WBPT and OPPT while demonstrating worse outcomes (lower Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement postoperative scores and more MUAs). Conclusion: WBPT can be an effective option to offset costs associated with OPPT, without compromising outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2020;4
Background: While COVID-19 outbreak has had adverse psychological effects in children with special needs, the mental state and burden on their caregivers during this pandemic has yet to be reported. Aims: The objectives of this study were to describe the mental health status and the change in perceived strain among caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and procedures: Two hundred sixty four caregivers completed an online survey that assessed demographics, use and perspective on tele-rehabilitation, homecare therapy, caregiver's strain and mental health. Outcomes and results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were found to be 62.5 %, 20.5 % and 36.4 % respectively. A significant difference in caregiver strain (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.93) was observed during the outbreak compared to levels pre-outbreak (pre outbreak strain was measured retrospectively). Caregivers not using tele-rehabilitation along with a perception of it being a poor medium for rehabilitation were at greater risks for poor mental health whereas a negative perception on homecare therapy were strongly associated with higher psychological symptoms and strain. Conclusions and implications: This study identified a high prevalence of depression and significant change in strain displayed by caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We identified several factors associated with poor mental health and perceived strain that can be used to help safeguard caregivers.;2020;4
Background:Despite being known abroad as a viable alternative to face-to-face consultation and therapy, telerehabilitation has not fully emerged in developing countries like the Philippines. In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, wherein social distancing disrupted the in-clinic delivery of rehabilitation services, Filipinos attempted to explore telerehabilitation. However, several hindrances were observed especially during the pre-implementation phase of telerehabilitation, necessitating a review of existing local evidences. Objective:We aimed to determine the challenges faced by telerehabilitation in the Philippines. Method:We searched until March 2020 through PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and HeRDIN for telerehabilitation-related publications wherein Filipinos were involved as investigator or population. Because of the hypothesized low number of scientific outputs on telerehabilitation locally, we performed handsearching through gray literature and included relevant papers from different rehabilitation-related professional organizations in the Philippines. We analyzed the papers and extracted the human, organizational, and technical challenges to telerehabilitation or telehealth in general. Results:We analyzed 21 published and 4 unpublished papers, which were mostly reviews (8), feasibility studies (6), or case reports/series (4). Twelve out of 25 studies engaged patients and physicians in remote teleconsultation, teletherapy, telementoring, or telemonitoring. Patients sought telemedicine or telerehabilitation for general medical conditions (in 3 studies), chronic diseases (2), mental health issues (2), orthopedic problems (2), neurologic conditions (1), communication disorders (1), and cardiac conditions (1). Outcomes in aforementioned studies mostly included telehealth acceptance, facilitators, barriers, and satisfaction. Other studies were related to telehealth governance, legalities, and ethical issues. We identified 18 human, 17 organizational, and 18 technical unique challenges related to telerehabilitation in the Philippines. The most common challenges were slow internet speed (in 10 studies), legal concerns (9), and skepticism (9). Conclusion:There is paucity of data on telerehabilitation in the Philippines. Local efforts can focus on exploring or addressing the most pressing human, organizational, and technical challenges to the emergence of telerehabilitation in the country.;2020;4
"Background:Post-stroke aphasia is a communication disorder where existing evidence favors intensive therapy methods. Telerehabilitation represents a service model for geographically remote settings, or other barriers to clinic attendance or to facilitate an augmentation of therapy across a continuum of care. Evidence to support efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability is however still scarce. Appraising aphasia telerehabilitation in controlled trials beyond its effectiveness, by investigating feasibility and acceptability, may facilitate implementation into clinical practice. Methods:In our pilot randomized controlled trial, we investigated the feasibility and acceptability of speech and language therapy by videoconference, in addition to usual care, in people with aphasia following stroke. To improve functional, expressive language, a tailored intervention was given 1 h per day, five times per week over four consecutive weeks. Feasibility measures included evaluation of technical setup using diary logs. Acceptability was investigated by examining adherence and satisfaction with therapy alongside evaluation of data safety and privacy. Results:Feasibility and acceptability data were collected in relation to 556.5 h of telerehabilitation delivered to 30 participants over a 2-years intervention period by three speech-language pathologists. Protocol adherence was high, with a tolerable technical fault rate; 86 faults were registered over 541 video sessions. Most (80%; n = 30) of the participants experienced zero to three faults. The main cause of technical failures was flawed internet connection, causing delayed or interrupted therapy. Total satisfaction with telerehabilitation was rated good or very good by 93.1% (n = 29) of participants and two of three speech-language pathologists. Within a moderate variance of technical failure, participants experiencing more faults were more satisfied. No serious events regarding security and privacy were reported. Our model is feasibly and ready to be implemented across a range of clinical settings and contexts. Conclusions:Synchronous telerehabilitation for post-stroke aphasia is feasible and acceptable and shows tolerable technical fault rates with high satisfaction among patients and pathologists. Within a low rate of faults, satisfaction was not negatively influenced by fault frequency. Access to clinical and technical expertise is needed when developing telerehabilitation services. Telerehabilitation may be a viable service delivery model for aphasia rehabilitation.";2020;4
Background:Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising treatment approach in rehabilitation for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) due to its potential to increase patient motivation and rehabilitation adherence. One of the key features for rehabilitation adherence is patient satisfaction with the VR rehabilitation (VRR) program, and information on user satisfaction and not only effectiveness is required to systematically include VRR in routine clinical practice. Given that information on patient satisfaction with VRR is scarce, the primary objective of this study is to assess long-term patient satisfaction with a novel VRR program. This program has been specifically designed for MS patients by a multidisciplinary team of specialists, based on an effective conventional rehabilitation (CR) program. Secondarily, discomfort with VRR will be evaluated, and therapy adherence and changes in a variety of domains typically affected by MS will be compared between patients receiving VRR and patients receiving CR. Methods:In this prospective single-center 6-months follow-up study, 32 and 16 MS patients will receive VRR or CR, respectively. Patients will attend twice weekly rehabilitation sessions on site during 4 weeks, and they will continue with rehabilitation at home for five additional months. Satisfaction, assessed by the User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire (USEQ), at 6 months of the VRR program initiation will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include adherence, disability, spasms and spasticity, balance, fatigue, activities of daily living (ADLs), depression, anxiety, work status, cognition, demographic, and clinical characteristics (in the VRR and CR groups), and discomfort (in the VRR group). Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, and at 1 and 6 months of rehabilitation initiation. Discussion:The study is intended to provide a better understanding of long-term patient satisfaction with a VRR program specifically designed for MS patients. Additionally, the study will provide information on long-term adherence, changes in motor symptoms, cognitive functions and patient-reported outcomes after the rehabilitation program. The results from this study will help to gather valuable knowledge on the use of rehabilitation with a new VR tool in MS patients.;2020;4
Background:Virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation is a promising approach for improving recovery in many conditions to optimize functional results, enhancing the clinical and social benefits of surgery.Objective:To assess the efficacy of an early rehabilitation performed by the VR-based rehabilitation versus the traditional rehabilitation provided by physical therapists after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).Methods:In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 85 subjects met the inclusion criteria and were randomized 3 to 4 days after TKA to an inpatient VR-based rehabilitation and a traditional rehabilitation. Participants in both groups received 60minutes/day sessions until discharge (around 10 days after surgery). The primary outcome was the pain intensity. The secondary outcomes were: the disability knee, the health related quality of life, the global perceived effect, the functional independent measure, the drugs assumption, the isometric strength of quadriceps and hamstrings, the flexion range of motion, and the ability to perform proprioception exercises. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (3-4 days after TKA) and at discharge.Results:VR-based or traditional rehabilitation, with 13% of dropout rate, shown no statistically significant pain reduction between groups (P=.2660) as well as in all other outcomes, whereas a statistically significant improvement was present in the global proprioception (P=.0020), in favor of the VR-based rehabilitation group.Conclusions:VR-based rehabilitation is not superior to traditional rehabilitation in terms of pain relief, drugs assumptions and other functional outcomes but seems to improve the global proprioception for patients received TKA.Level of evidence: Therapy, level 1b. CONSORT-compliant.Trial registration: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02413996.;2020;4
Background:Web-based exercise and physical activity interventions are being developed as a potential way to help people with multiple sclerosis achieve and maintain increased physical activity levels. Seeking feedback from people who have used such interventions will help guide the development process. Methods:In-depth interviews were used to explore the experiences of participants who used a web-based physiotherapy intervention as part of a feasibility randomized controlled trial. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results:Eleven people (age 28-68) were interviewed. Most perceived that their physical activity had increased, primarily due to completing twice-weekly web-based physiotherapy sessions. Three key themes were identified. 'It's all in one place' encompasses the value of having a convenient and portable program. 'Keeping an eye' captures people's thoughts regarding the supervision offered by the physiotherapist, through the website, and 'Hopes and expectations' reflects the importance of having opportunity to discuss what may be gained from using such a program. Conclusions:This intervention offered a convenient, flexible and portable physiotherapy program which most people perceived helped them achieve and sustain increased levels of physical activity. Talking with people about expectations is important, particularly if a person's condition is deteriorating.;2020;4
BackgroundApproximately 60% of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) suffer from upper limb dysfunction. Our primary goal is to implement a single-blind, randomized control trial (RCT) designed to compare the effectiveness of an 8-week home-based telerehab virtual reality (VR) program with conventional therapy in PwMS with manual dexterity difficulties. Secondary aims include (a) evaluating the impact of the programs on quality of life after the intervention and a follow-up 1month later and (b) evaluating the impact of the programs on adherence and satisfaction.MethodsTwenty-four PwMS will be recruited to the study which will be conducted at two established MS centers: (1) The Regional Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, Binaghi Hospital, Cagliari, Italy, and (2) The Multiple Sclerosis Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. Participants will complete a total of three assessments focusing on upper limb functions. Both groups will receive 16 training sessions focusing on functional upper limb activities. The home-based telerehab VR intervention will comprise a custom-made software program running on a private computer or laptop. PwMS will perform several activities of daily living (ADL) functions associated with self-care, dressing, and meal preparation. Conventional therapy will focus on task-related upper-limb treatments while in a sitting position, indicative of the standard care in MS. Following 8 weeks of training, participants will complete a further outcome assessment. The same tests will be conducted 1month (as a follow-up) after completion of the intervention.DiscussionThe outcomes of this study have tremendous potential to improve the quality of evidence and informed decisions of functional upper limb activities in PwMS. If comparable results are found between the treatments in improving upper limb outcomes, this would suggest that PwMS can choose the program that best meets their personal needs, e.g., financial concerns, transportation, or accessibility issues. Secondly, this information can be used by healthcare providers and medical professionals in developing upper limb exercise programs that will most likely succeed in PwMS.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04032431.

BackgroundIn December 2019, 27 cases of pneumonia, of unknown cause, were identified in the province of Hubei (China). The WHO declared the situation as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and it was finally declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The Spanish Government obliges the entire population to remain confined to their homes, with the exception of essential basic services, to stop the spread of COVID-19. Home isolation implies a notable physical deconditioning. Telerehabilitation methods have reported positive experiences, and we propose to study in affected patients of COVID-19, due to the general house confinement of the entire Spanish population.MethodsPatients will be recruited in the regions of Andalusia, Murcia, and Valencia (Spain). Patients will remain confined to their homes, and there, they will carry out their assigned exercise program, which will be controlled telematically. Evaluators will attend to carry out all measurements at the beginning, during, and end of the study, telematically controlled. The patients will be randomly divided into three groups, two of them will perform a home exercise program (breathing exercises or non-specific exercises for muscle toning) and the third group will perform sedentary activities, using mental activation techniques, and will act as a sham group. We will evaluate respiratory variables and other variables of the physical state through physical tests, effort, and perceived fatigue. The data will be statistically analyzed, and the hypotheses will be tested between the groups, using the SPSS software, v.24, considering a 95% confidence interval.DiscussionWe will analyze the results, in terms of the level of fatigue and perceived exertion, physical health, and maintenance of respiratory activity of two types of exercise programs, toning and respiratory, applied in patients affected by COVID-19 during the period of home confinement. We intend to investigate a field not previously studied, such as the repercussion of carrying out a toning and respiratory exercise program in these patients, in historical circumstances that no one had previously observed in Spain, since the general population has never been forced to remain confined in their homes, due to a pandemic infection, by a coronavirus (COVID-19). Observing the effects that these two home exercise programs could produce in patients infected with COVID-19, we will try to better analyze and understand the mechanisms that are associated with the worsening of breathing in this type of patient.Trial registrationBrazilian Clinical Trial Registry RBR-6m69fc.

Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, many cardiac rehabilitation (CR) services and programs are stopped. Because CR is a class I level A recommendation with clinical benefits that are now well documented, the cessation of CR programs can lead to dramatic consequences in terms of public health. We propose here a viewpoint of significant interest about the sudden need to develop remote home-based CR programs both in clinical research and in clinical care routine. This last decade, the literature on remote home-based CR programs has been increasing, but to date only clinical research experiences have been implemented. Benefits are numerous and the relevance of this approach has obviously increased with the actual health emergency. The COVID-19 crisis, the important prevalence of smartphones, and high-speed Internet during confinement should be viewed as an opportunity to promote a major shift in CR programs with the use of telemedicine to advance the health of a larger number of individuals with cardiac disease.

Blood pressure monitoring have been shown to improve management of chronic health conditions. However, devices used for automated monitoring of blood pressure at home provide reliable measurements only at rest and cannot be used during exercise for continuous blood pressure monitoring. Image-based analysis of skin color changes has been introduced to capture pulse transit time which correlates with blood pressure. In this project we assess feasibility of using infrared imaging to support continuous contactless blood pressure monitoring at rest and during exercise. In order to utilize image-based photoplethysmogram (iPPG) and image-based pulse transit time (iPTT) without blinding effect of high intensity visible light source, a light source outside visible spectrum had to be employed. Thus, we introduced a high-speed camera to measure iPPG and iPTT with the infrared light source. The feasibility of this approach that was unclear at the beginning of the study was fully supported by our initial analysis.;2020;4
Cardiac rehabilitation through center-based programs is an effective multicomponent intervention for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the benefits it brings, patients' participation in rehabilitation programs remains low. In this work, the latest relevant literature regarding remotely monitored cardiac telerehabilitation (TR) was reviewed considering its efficiency and utilization. The main objective was to assess whether TR has the potential to be an appropriate alternative form of rehabilitation. A total of 105 publications on this topic were screened out of 747 full-text articles that were read and evaluated, of which 12 were considered suitable for inclusion in the final review. Feasibility, efficiency, and safety were assessed for each TR intervention. The results of our evaluation indicate that TR seems to be a usable, effective, and safe alternative rehabilitation for patients with heart disease. Most of the currently published articles have studied remotely monitored TR intervention offering a comprehensive approach, which indicates the significant development and steps forward in this field of study. Our research evidence supports the implementation of TR, which could positively influence barriers in participating in cardiac rehabilitation programs.;2020;4
Cardiovascular disease is one of the major causes of mortality in the world, with high human and financial burdens on communities. Telemedicine is a tool for providing services for patients that are difficult to access or in need of immediate care. The aim of this study was to systematically review economic evaluation studies that compared telemedicine with usual care for cardiovascular patients. A systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and related articles published up to December 2018 were searched in different databases (PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS, Global Health, Google Scholar, Magiran, SID). The articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards statement checklist was used to qualitatively evaluate the papers. Overall, 20 articles were included in the study. The studies used quality-adjusted life years to measure outcomes. The highest and lowest values of Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio were $515,082 and $2099 that had been reported in the UK and New Zealand, respectively. Most of the items of the checklist were reported and the quality of most of the studies was excellent and very good. According to the results, telemedicine improves the clinical outcomes and results in considerable saving in costs. Utilizing telemedicine concurrent with the usual care for service delivery is more cost-effective. The reviewed studies had been conducted in high-income countries, hence, it is essential to be cautious when generalizing the results and applying them in health systems policymaking.;2020;4
Clinical patient evaluations are important in determining motor performance. Commonly, these evaluations are performed by physiotherapists and include the pain assessment, range of motion, muscle strength and functionality. Recent studies have shown to be effective in quantifying the patients and the healthy subjects' motor performance. Several telerehabilitation assessments may be conducted with or without devices in order to aid in diagnosis, to determine treatment goals and to evaluate treatment outcomes. On the other hand, the clinical assessment is thought to be highly variable affecting the reliability. This work presents several reflections about the differences between the assessments performed by physiotherapists and the evaluation carried out by a web-based telerehabilitation platform. We analyze the human factors that could have affected the assessments performed by physiotherapists.;2020;4
Context: Telemedicine is the delivery of medical care from a distance using technology. The integration of telemedicine as a supplement to musculoskeletal-based patient encounters may be feasible in sports medicine. Objective: To investigate health care professionals' perceptions of and experiences with telemedicine. Design: Cross-sectional explanatory sequential mixed-methods study. Patients or Other Participants: A purposeful sample of 17 athletic trainers from a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I institution and 5 orthopaedic physicians from a sports medicine clinic located 92 miles from the campus. Intervention(s): Participants were trained on the telemedicine platform and used it over 5 months for initial, follow-up, and discharge patient encounters. Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed a preintervention survey containing the Theory of Planned Behavior and Technology Acceptance Model tool. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and an independent-samples t test. After the intervention period, participants completed individual semistructured interviews that we coded using the consensual qualitative research tradition. Results: From the interviews, the clinicians were characterized as telemedicine adopters (n = 14) or nonadopters (n =8). The adopters reported higher levels of agreement on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Technology Acceptance Model tool as compared with nonadopters for all constructs. When comparing adoption status, we identified a difference (P < .01), with nonadopters reporting a low level of agreement for the subjective norm construct. The interviews revealed 5 domains: integration challenges, integration opportunities, collaborative practice, anticipatory socialization to future use, and benefits of integration. The participants indicated that integration challenges centered on buy in, whereas opportunities aligned with the patient's condition and technology ease of use. They reflected that the telemedicine encounters required more preparation and yet allowed for cooperative behaviors between clinicians. The benefits of telemedicine included convenience and scheduling preferences that encouraged future use. Conclusions: The integration of telemedicine in sports medicine brought about both challenges and opportunities for collaboration among athletic trainers and physicians that were heavily predetermined by the social pressures of colleagues.;2020;4
COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and carries a huge and growing economic and social burden. Telemedicine might allow the care of patients with limited access to health services and improve their self-management. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patient's safety represents one of the main reasons why we might use these tools to manage our patients. The authors conducted a literature search in MEDLINE database. The retrieval form of the Medical Subject Headings (Mesh) was ((Telemedicine OR Tele-rehabilitation OR Telemonitoring OR mHealth OR Ehealth OR Telehealth) AND COPD). We only included systematic reviews, reviews, meta-analysis, clinical trials and randomized-control trials, in the English language, with the selected search items in title or abstract, and published from January 1st 2015 to 31st May 2020 (n = 56). There was a positive tendency toward benefits in tele-rehabilitation, health-education and self-management, early detection of COPD exacerbations, psychosocial support and smoking cessation, but the heterogeneity of clinical trials and reviews limits the extent to which this value can be understood. Telemonitoring interventions and cost-effectiveness had contradictory results. The literature on teleconsultation was scarce during this period. The non-inferiority tendency of telemedicine programmes comparing to conventional COPD management seems an opportunity to deliver quality healthcare to COPD patients, with a guarantee of patient's safety, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak.;2020;4
Coronavirus disease in 2019, also called COVID-19 which has spread worldwide has given rise to a pandemic situation. The aetiological agent is the (SARS-CoV-2) the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. The COVID-19 pandemic has an unusual way of striking the entire world. Crises has spread rapidly. Disease load and casualties are still on the rise, and crisis influence is spreading across developing countries. Around the globe, the reactions, perceptions, and outcomes were distinct. The outbreak has reflected unfavourable mental health impacts and symptoms. This pandemic has also affected the healthcare department that is treating the patients suffering from diseases other than corona. The power and severity of slowdown varying from being temporary to a long-term recession, they are unanimous about the fact that the slowdown would have an intense impact amongst various sectors of the economy. Most importantly, some panic among consumers and firms has disfigured normal patterns of consumption and caused market inconsistency. Digitalization and automation have proved to be the solution in this challenging phase. Telemedicine and Tele physiotherapy for online consultancy have changed the time in a positive way. Conducting live sessions reduces the psychological risks to the patients and also is beneficial for the motivation of the therapy. Tele-rehabilitation increases the level of treatment for people with disorders in both physical and mental wellbeing, lowers hospital expenses, and strengthens conventional face-to-face practice. This article would give the overall idea of how the social, economic, cultural, and psychological aspects are influenced by the pandemic.;2020;4
COVID-19 has proven to be pandemic and affecting the day to day life of normal individuals. However, individuals with disability especially with hearing impairment face even more difficulty. They are unable to get their routine evaluation and therapy, the maintenance of their hearing restoration devices has also found to be cumbersome. The strategy that they can use during this lockdown period has been discussed.;2020;4
Current guidelines against spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) interrupt non-essential rehabilitation services. Thus, individuals with physical disabilities such as children with cerebral palsy can no longer benefit from physical rehabilitation during this undetermined period. Using either a synchronous or asynchronous format, in collaboration with a therapist via telerehabilitation, we suggest that active video games and low-cost virtual reality are a promising delivery mode for at-home rehabilitation in the context of a global pandemic. This therapeutic modality, incorporated into an at-home individualized treatment plan, provides a means to lessen the impact of an interruption in rehabilitation services while not loosing the pre-pandemic, in-person physical activity gains. Growing evidence supports active video games and low-cost virtual reality as viable therapeutic interventions for children with physical disabilities. These technologies are especially well-accepted by pediatric populations for the ludic and motivating features that lend themselves to nearly seamless incorporation into telerehabilitation. Advantages for rehabilitation of active video games and low-cost virtual reality include a rich, challenging, multi-modal training environment in which high numbers of movement repetitions can be accomplished, and a unique opportunity to foster engaged practice actions that go beyond household activities. We offer suggestions for the clinician about how to adopt active video games and low-cost virtual reality into your practice during a global pandemic.;2020;4
"Current research suggests that the management of neurological diseases, both in adults and children, requires an ever increasing commitment of resources for the national healthcare system (NHS). In Italy, due to the aging of the population, increase in chronicity and morbidity of pathologies, and presence of islands and rural areas, health needs to be supported by innovative technologies. Telemedicine is a method of providing healthcare services at distance, remotely connecting health professionals and patients (or two professionals). In Italy, telemedicine is under development, and the NHS has not yet exploited and independently developed all the possibilities that telemedicine offers. Tele-rehabilitation consists in the use of information and communication technologies for the remote support of rehabilitation services. By allowing home care, it represents a valid support during the home rehabilitation process. This review is aimed at evaluating the role of telerehabilitation in Italy, with regard to the motor and cognitive rehabilitation programs applied to neurological pathologies, in both pediatric and adult patients. We screened the studies published between 2010 and 2019 on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Sciences databases. Using the PICO model, the search combined the terms telerehabilitation; neurological disorders; neurodegenerative disease, motor telerehabilitation; cognitive rehabilitation. This review showed that telerehabilitation is a promising healthcare tool, as it guarantees continuity of care over time (after discharge) and in space (from hospital to patient's home), especially in patients with stroke. Furthermore, it allows to increase the frequency and intensity of rehabilitation programs, provide individualized rehabilitation treatment in comfortable and familiar environment for patient, monitor and evaluate patients' needs and progress, stimulate patient motivation and achieve better patient satisfaction, verify the results achieved by the patients, and potentially reduce the service costs. Unfortunately, almost all neurorehabilitation studies are characterized by small samples and wide variability of results, and would benefit from standardized procedures, aims and targets. Future telerehabilitation trials should include cost-effectiveness analysis associated with clinical outcomes to better assess the validity of this promising tool.";2020;4
Currently, the accelerated evolution of technology and the adoption of new platforms in the field of telerehabilitation pose considerable challenges in the field of web accessibility. Web accessibility aims to make web pages usable by the maximum number of people, regardless of their knowledge, personal abilities or the technical characteristics of the equipment used to access the Web. This paper presents the accessibility evaluation of ePHoRt, a web platform that aims to improve the rehabilitation of patients after a total or partial hip replacement operation known as arthroplasty. The accessibility method is based on the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology 1.0 that considers the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. We evaluate first the accessibility of ePHoRt using the WAVE automatic tool. Then, manual inspection was performed. Based on the results, we present recommendations to ensure that the application is accessible and inclusive. The results can serve for future work related to web accessibility in telerehabilitation platforms.;2020;4
Diabetes has become an increasingly important health problem worldwide due to its prevalence. Although effective treatments for diabetes management have been developed, many patients have difficulty in achieving their therapeutic goals. Regular exercise training is suggested to prevent or delay the symptoms and complications of type 2 diabetes along with other medical treatments. It has become necessary to develop new rehabilitation models and practices in order to cope with the changing needs of the population. Treatment models using technology can be effective in disease management. Telerehabilitation may be effective as part of the rehabilitation program in the home environment, especially for patients who are unable to participate in conventional center-based rehabilitation due to transport difficulties or work resumption. Telerehabilitation is defined as the delivery of rehabilitation servicesviatelecommunication technology, including phone, internet, and videoconference communications between the patient and health care provider. It is possible that telerehabilitation may benefit people with type 2 diabetes in similar ways with telemonitoring and interactive health communication systems. Although the applicability of telehealth methods has been proven in previous studies, telerehabi-litation studies in type 2 diabetes are inadequate in the literature. With larger, multi-centered randomized controlled studies, established clinical guidelines can be developed that will ultimately improve patient outcomes.;2020;4
"Disabling events such as stroke affect millions of people worldwide, causing a need for efficient and functional rehabilitation therapies in order for patients to regain motor function for reintegration back into their normal lives. Rehabilitation regimes often involve performing exercises that mimic the movements used in activities of daily living and are intended to promote recovery from the physical aspects of an injury. However, alongside physical disability, some patients (e.g., stroke patients) develop cognitive deficiencies that affect their ability to think, plan, and carry out tasks. It is a necessity then to consider rehabilitation techniques that can also accommodate patients with cognitive deficiencies alongside those without. Rehabilitation systems that provide haptic interaction to patients practicing therapy tasks work towards both of these ends; physical interaction can provide strength and coordination training for improving physical condition, and providing additional tactile sensory feedback can make tasks more intuitive for patients with cognitive deficiencies. This chapter introduces novel techniques to incorporate robotics, machine learning, and augmented reality for the purposes of enhancing the haptic interactions provided by therapists to assist patients in their rehabilitation process.";2020;4
During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 worldwide pandemic, patients with heart failure are a high-risk group with potential higher mortality if infected. Although lockdown represents a solution to prevent viral spreading, it endangers regular follow-up visits and precludes direct medical assessment in order to detect heart failure progression and optimize treatment. Furthermore, lifestyle changes during quarantine may trigger heart failure decompensations. During the pandemic, a paradoxical reduction of heart failure hospitalization rates was observed, supposedly caused by patient reluctance to visit emergency departments and hospitals. This may result in an increased patient mortality and/or in more complicated heart failure admissions in the future. In this scenario, different telemedicine strategies can be implemented to ensure continuity of care to patients with heart failure. Patients at home can be monitored through dedicated apps, telephone calls, or devices. Virtual visits and forward triage screen the patients with signs or symptoms of decompensated heart failure. In-hospital care may benefit from remote communication platforms. After discharge, patients may undergo remote follow-up or telerehabilitation to prevent early readmissions. This review provides a comprehensive appraisal of the many possible applications of telemedicine for patients with heart failure during Coronavirus disease 2019 and elucidates practical limitations and challenges regarding specific telemedicine modalities.;2020;4
"During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, healthcare professionals worldwide abruptly shifted from an in-person to a telehealth service delivery model. Many did so without advanced training or preparation. This cross-sectional study explored how occupational therapy practitioners (OTPs) used telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether they found it to be an effective service delivery model that should be a permanent option for providing occupational therapy services. An online survey was disseminated; it included Likert scale questions, multiple option questions, and open-ended questions regarding telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 230 respondents, 176 (77%) support telehealth as a substitute for in-person services; 179 (78%) support telehealth as a permanent option for occupational therapy service delivery. This information lends support to the uninterrupted use of telehealth by OTPs when government emergency orders in response to COVID-19 expire.";2020;4
E-rehabilitation is the term used to define medical rehabilitation programs that are implemented at home with the use of information and communication technologies. The aim was to test whether sensor position and the sitting position of the patient influence the accuracy of knee range of movement (ROM) data displayed by the BPMpathway e-rehabilitation system. A preliminary study was conducted in a laboratory setting with healthy adults. Knee ROM data was measured with the BPMpathway e-rehabilitation system and simultaneously with a BIOPAC twin-axis digital goniometer. The main outcome was the root mean squared error (RMSE). A 20% increase or reduction in sitting height led to a RMSE increase. A ventral shift of the BPMpathway sensor by 45 degrees and 90 degrees caused significant measurement errors. A vertical shift was associated with a diminution of the measurement errors. The lowest RMSE (2.4 degrees) was achieved when the sensor was placed below the knee. The knee ROM data measured by the BPMpathway system is comparable to the data of the concurrent system, provided the instructions of the manufacturer are respected concerning the sitting position of the subject for knee exercises, and disregarding the same instructions for sensor positioning, by placing the sensor directly below the knee.;2020;4
Exercise is critical for health maintenance in late life. The COVID-19 shelter in place and social distancing orders resulted in wide-scale interruptions of exercise therapies, placing older adults at risk for the consequences of decreased mobilization. The purpose of this paper is to describe rapid transition of the Gerofit facility-based group exercise program to telehealth delivery. This Gerofit-to-Home (GTH) program continued with group-based synchronous exercise classes that ranged from 1 to 24 Veterans per class and 1 to 9 classes offered per week in the different locations. Three hundred and eight of 1149 (27%) Veterans active in the Gerofit facility-based programs made the transition to the telehealth delivered classes. Participants' physical performance testing continued remotely as scheduled with comparisons between most recent facility-based and remote testing suggesting that participants retained physical function. Detailed protocols for remote physical performance testing and sample exercise routines are described. Translation to remote delivery of exercise programs for older adults could mitigate negative health effects.;2020;4
Family caregivers are vital to telehealth-delivered dementia care. The objective of this mixed methods descriptive study conducted in the VA Bedford Healthcare System was to examine caregiver satisfaction with a video telehealth dementia home safety occupational therapy evaluation. Ten caregivers of Veterans with dementia participated. Ratings of caregiver satisfaction, measured by nine Likert scale items including ability to see and hear, were examined in relation to person and visit-related contextual factors extracted from research assistants' field notes, to develop an in-depth understanding of caregiver experience. Person factors included caregiver age and gender and Veteran cognitive status. Visit-related contextual factors included occurrence of technical glitches. Caregiver visit satisfaction was overall positive, with exceptions related to technological glitches and the presence of the person with dementia during the visit. Veteran cognitive status appeared to influence caregiver satisfaction. Implications of the study are that proactively addressing technical glitches and incorporating dementia stage-specific approaches may optimize caregivers' telehealth experience.;2020;4
Featured Application This work analyzes the current state of the physical rehabilitation field focused on the techniques, devices, and methods used with children and adolescents. Moreover, we present improvements of a gamification-based software prototype for home rehabilitation of young patients, based on this study and a previous experiment. Physical rehabilitation of people who suffer from some motor disability involves an intensive treatment to reduce pain and improve quality of life. Research studies have proven the benefits of technologies based on home-rehabilitation, which complement regular therapy in hospitals. Although there is a significant number of studies that face this challenge when dealing with adults, it has not been explored with young people. In this research article, we focus on this population, since the repetition of physical exercises decreases the youth's motivation, which entails a high risk of dropping out of therapy. That is why we present a systematic mapping study of the techniques, devices, and methods used to address home rehabilitation for children and teenagers. The conclusions indicate that it is essential to use gamification techniques to adopt a plug-and-play metaphor, based on natural interaction mechanisms and on the use of non-intrusive devices, and to customize the rehabilitation process for each individual along with a methodology. We also present the improvements applied to an existing gamification-based software prototype for home rehabilitation. In this system, physical exercises can be customized, laying the foundations to promote precision rehabilitation within the context of young people.;2020;4
Focal damage of the brain leads to cognitive impairments, which sufficiently limit the person's functional capabilities, which, in turn, can lead to secondary disorders of the emotional and personal sphere and social maladjustment. The need to include cognitive rehabilitation in the system of complex treatment methods for patients with focal brain lesions is generally recognized. The article describes methods of neurorehabilitation based on high technologies and indicates their place in the general rehabilitation process. Data yielded by domestic and foreign studies on the effectiveness of digital technologies in the cognitive rehabilitation of patients with focal brain lesions is presented.;2020;4
"Given the escalating unmet demand for physical rehabilitation due to the growing global aging population and the effects of the coronavirus COVID-19 including increased incidents of stroke, hospital bed shortages, and clinics closures, robotic telerehabilitation is an emerging, timely, and crucial technology. Rehabilitating the upper limbs of affected patients is of upmost importance for restoring physical function and lighten the societal burden due to disabilities. So far, the majority of the research in robotic telerehabilitation for upper limbs has been performed with end-effector-type assistive robots; however, the use of robotic exoskeletons has significant and distinctive benefits. Although there are surveys written about control methods for upper limb robotic exoskeletons and other surveys written about bilateral teleoperation control methods, there are no surveys written specifically about telerehabilitation control methods for upper limbs using robotic exoskeletons. As a result, this article reviews the state-of-the-art control strategies including various advanced linear and nonlinear control approaches for upper limb rehabilitation robotic exoskeletons, bilateral teleoperation, and several state-of-the-art telerehabilitation applications with upper limb robotic exoskeletons. The benefits, drawbacks, challenges, and future directions of existing methodologies are extensively discussed. This article offers a comprehensive overview and insight for new researchers in the area of telerehabilitation robotic exoskeletons.";2020;4
Hand therapy is a time-sensitive and essential postoperative service for patients undergoing reparative or corrective procedures in the hand and plays an important role in achieving best functional outcomes. In the United States, therapy is an independent service from a payer's standpoint. Access is affected by global and distinct factors in health care. This article presents views on certain aspects of health care that aide in and those that impede access to hand therapy for patients in the United States, and concludes with a brief glimpse into some ongoing efforts to improve access for patients.;2020;4
Home health care agencies are restructuring service delivery models to address quality of care and client satisfaction while containing costs. New regulatory changes and the public health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated an immediate need for alternative care models. Telehealth has been recognized as a feasible delivery model to provide health care. This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study examined the feasibility of performing occupational therapy telehealth visits as an adjunct to on-site visits for homebound clients (N=9). The Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) data collection set, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), and a survey were used to collect data. This combination of visits resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements in client perception of performance and satisfaction with activities of daily living. Findings showed that participants favorably perceived this service delivery model met their therapy needs and they would recommend it to others. Results of this study warrant a larger study involving physical and speech therapy services.;2020;4
"Improvements in technology and a push toward value-based health care have poised the telemedicine industry for growth; however, despite the benefits of virtual care, widespread implementation had not occurred until the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Powerful barriers have hindered the widespread adoption of telemedicine, including lack of awareness, implementation costs, inefficiencies introduced, difficulty performing physical examinations, overall lack of perceived benefit of virtual care, negative financial implications, concern for medicolegal liability, and regulatory restrictions. Some of these challenges have been addressed with temporary state and federal mandates in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, continued investment in systems and technology as well as refinement of regulations around telemedicine are needed to sustain widespread adoption by patients and providers.";2020;4
In a pandemic situation such as that we are living at the time of writing of this paper due to the Covid-19 virus, the need of tele-healthcare service becomes dramatically fundamental to reduce the movement of patients, thence reducing the risk of infection. Leveraging the recent Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, this paper aims at proposing a tele-medical laboratory service where clinical exams are performed on patients directly in a hospital by technicians through IoT medical devices and results are automatically sent via the hospital Cloud to doctors of federated hospitals for validation and/or consultation. In particular, we discuss a distributed scenario where nurses, technicians and medical doctors belonging to different hospitals cooperate through their federated hospital Clouds to form a virtual health team able to carry out a healthcare workflow in secure fashion leveraging the intrinsic security features of the Blockchain technology. In particular, both public and hybrid Blockchain scenarios are discussed and assessed using the Ethereum platform.;2020;4
In home-based rehabilitation, one possible approach is haptic teleoperation in which a hospital-based therapist is haptically linked and tele-presented to a home-based patient to effectively simulate traditional in-hospital therapies over a distance. In this context, this article proposes a learn-and-replay (LAR) paradigm that consists of two phases: a therapist-in-loop (interactive) phase where the therapist interacts through the haptic teleoperation loop with the patient to perform the cooperative therapy task, and a therapist-out-of-loop (standalone) phase where the therapist's task is played by the patient-side robot in future repetitions. During the interactive phase, the therapist demonstrates impedance during cooperating with the patient. During the standalone phase, the patient-side robot is automatically controlled to mimic the therapist's demonstrated impedance which is learned in the interactive phase. The direct force reflection (DFR) architecture is utilized as the control method for the bilateral telerehabilitation system. Case studies involving 1-degree-of-freedom and 2-degree-of-freedom cooperative manipulation tasks are tested for proof of concept. The results show that the impedance of the therapist's arm can be replicated by the patient-side robot for both tasks and proposed LAR telerehabilitation paradigm that assists the therapist in the rehabilitation procedure to take care of other tasks or attend to other patients.;2020;4
In recent years, we have witnessed a growing adoption of serious games in telerehabilitation by taking advantage of advanced multimedia technologies such as motion capture and virtual reality devices. Current serious game solutions for telerehabilitation suffer form lack of personalization and adaptiveness to patients' needs and performance. This paper introduces RehaBot, a framework for adaptive generation of personalized serious games in the context of remote rehabilitation, using 3D motion tracking and virtual reality environments. A personalized and versatile gaming platform with embedded virtual assistants, called Rehab bots, is created. Utilizing these rehab bots, all workout session scenes will include a guide with various sets of motions to direct patients towards performing the prescribed exercises correctly. Furthermore, the rehab bots employ a robust technique to adjust the workout difficulty level in real-time to match the patients' performance. This technique correlates and matches the patterns of the precalculated motions with patients' motions to produce a highly engaging gamified workout experience. Moreover, multimodal insights are passed to the users pointing out the joints that did not perform as anticipated along with suggestions to improve the current performance. A clinical study was conducted on patients dealing with chronic neck pain to prove the usability and effectiveness of our adjunctive online physiotherapy solution. Ten participants used the serious gaming platform, while four participants performed the traditional procedure with an active program for neck pain relief, for two weeks (10 min, 10 sessions/2 weeks). Feasibility and user experience measures were collected, and the results of experiments show that patients found our game-based adaptive solution engaging and effective, and most of them could achieve high accuracy in performing the personalized prescribed therapies.;2020;4
In the attempt to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 lockdown, most countries have recently authorized and promoted the adoption of e-learning and remote teaching technologies, often with the support of teleconferencing platforms. Unfortunately, not all students can benefit from the adoption of such a surrogate of their usual school. We were asked to devise a way to allow a community of children affected by the Rett genetic syndrome, and thus unable to communicate verbally, in writing or by gestures, to actively participate in remote rehabilitation and special education sessions by exploiting eye-gaze tracking. As not all subjects can access commercial eye-tracking devices, we investigated new ways to facilitate the access to eye gaze-based interaction for this specific case. The adopted communication platform is a videoconferencing software, so all we had at our disposal was a live video stream of the child. As a solution to the problem, we developed a software (named SWYG) that only runs at the operator side of the communication, at the side of the videoconferencing software, and does not require to install other software in the child's computer. The preliminary results obtained are very promising and the software is ready to be deployed on a larger base. While this paper is being written, several children are finally able to communicate with their caregivers from home, without relying on expensive and cumbersome devices.;2020;4
In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, physiotherapists (PTs) across the globe were required to rapidly adapt clinical practice to provide safe and effective care for people with HIV/AIDS and cancer and those in hospice and palliative care. These rapid decisions included developing criteria for in-person versus remote care and developing equitable platforms for telehealth and telerehabilitation. Most decisions were made with limited guidelines or evidence for practice related to the pandemic. The purpose of this perspective was to provide a synopsis of the experiences of 25 PTs from 16 countries regarding their clinical decisions for (1) rapid adaptation of patient care delivery, (2) evaluation criteria to treat in-person or remotely, (3) utilization decisions for telerehabilitation, (4) determinations for future practice and research needs, and (5) promotion of health equity in an environment rapidly transformed by a highly infectious and deadly disease.;2020;4
In the Republic of Korea, 90.5% of those living with spinal cord injury (SCI) are faced with medical complications that require chronic care. Some of the more common ones include urinary tract infections, pressure sores, and pain symptomatology. These and other morbidities have been recognized to deteriorate the individual's health, eventually restricting their community participation. Telerehabilitation, using information and communication technology, has propelled a modern-day movement in providing comprehensive medical services to patients who have difficulty in mobilizing themselves to medical care facilities. This study aims to verify the effectiveness of health care and management in the SCI population by providing ICT-based health care services. We visited eight individuals living with chronic SCI in the community, and provided ICT-based health management services. After using respiratory and urinary care devices with the provision of home visit occupational therapy, data acquisition was achieved and subsequently entered into a smart device. The entered information was readily accessible to the necessary clinicians and researchers. The clients were notified if there were any concerning results from the acquired data. Subsequently, they were advised to follow up with their providers for any immediate medical care requirements. Digital hand-bike ergometers and specialized seating system cushions are currently in development. The ICT-based health care management service for individuals with SCI resulted in a favorable expected level of outcome. Based on the results of this study, we have proposed and are now in preparation for a randomized clinical trial.;2020;4
In the setting of shortened hospitalization periods, periods of confinement and social isolation, limited resources, and accessibility, technology can be leveraged to enhance opportunities for rehabilitative care (1). In the current manuscript, we focus on the use of tablet-based rehabilitation for individuals with aphasia, a language disorder that frequently arises post-stroke. Aphasia treatment that targets naming through effortful and errorful instances of lexical retrieval, where corrective feedback is generated on every trial, may enhance retention and generalizability of gains (2, 3). This pilot evaluation explored how six individuals with aphasia interacted with a tablet-based therapy application that targeted lexical retrieval. Participants with aphasia either (1) autonomously engaged with the therapy tasks or (2) received systematic encouragement to effortfully retrieve words. Behaviors of response latency and cue use were examined to gain insights into the behavioral patterns of both groups, as well as analyses of task accuracy and outcomes on standardized cognitive-linguistic assessments. Despite some variability, initial observations suggest that participants who received systematic training refrained from using cues to complete tasks and spent longer on each trial, which ultimately co-occurred with increased independent engagement with therapy and improved standardized outcomes. Preliminary results present an alternative means of leveraging technology to implement best-practice recommendations in the context of aphasia telerehabilitation.;2020;4
In this paper a new, easy-to-use algorithm is presented to support telerehabilitation of people with movement disabilities. This algorithm can adapt to the needs of the patients as it combines the cognitive property of intelligent decision-making systems with the human-computer interaction-based movement therapy. This algorithm is built upon the earlier work of the authors and it uses six various mean techniques to classify gesture descriptors. The preliminary results and a plan of evaluating the algorithm are presented in this paper.;2020;4
In this paper, a new impedance-based teleoperation strategy is proposed for assist-as-needed tele-rehabilitation via a multi-DOF telerobotic system having patient-master and therapist-slave interactions. Unlike a regular teleoperation system and as the main contribution of this work to minimize the therapist's movements, the therapist's hand only follows the patient's deviation from the target trajectory. Also it provides a better perception of the patient's problems in motor control to the therapist The admissible deviation of the patient's limb from a reference target trajectory is governed by an impedance model responding to both patient's and therapist's interaction forces. As the other benefit of this framework, two sources of assistance to the patient are delivered through the master robot (1) the adjustable impedance model, and (2) the force applied by the therapist to the slave robot. The assistive impedance model is beneficial to reduce magnitudes of the required force from the therapist and decrease his/her intervention. This results in delaying and declining the therapist's muscle fatigue in time-consuming movement therapies. Bilateral nonlinear control laws with two types of adaptation laws are designed for the nonlinear teleoperation system. The Lyapunov stability proof of the teleoperation system and the stability of the impedance model enhance the patient's and therapist's safety even in the presence of modeling uncertainties of the multi-DOF telerobotic system. The performance of the proposed bilateral impedance-based strategy is experimentally investigated using different impedance parameters adjusted based on the patient's characteristics (e.g., involuntary tremor) and disabilities (e.g., insufficient actuation force). The experiments are performed by a healthy person (as the therapist), a mechanical test bed and a volunteer (simulating the patients' characteristics). A new force-position mapping from Cartesian to Normal-Tangential (N-T) coordinates is utilized between the master and slave workspaces and compared with typical Cartesian to Cartesian projection.;2020;4
"In this paper, a new scheme for multi-lateral remote rehabilitation is proposed. There exist one therapist, one patient, and several trainees, who are participating in the process of telerehabilitation (TR) in this scheme. This kind of strategy helps the therapist to facilitate the neurorehabilitation remotely. Thus, the patients can stay in their homes, resulting in safer and less expensive costs. Meanwhile, several trainees in medical education centers can be trained by participating partially in the rehabilitation process. The trainees participate in a hands-on manner; so, they feel like they are rehabilitating the patient directly. For implementing such a scheme, a novel theoretical method is proposed using the power of multi-agent systems (MAS) theory into the multi-lateral teleoperation, based on the self-intelligence in the MAS. In the previous related works, changing the number of participants in the multi-lateral teleoperation tasks required redesigning the controllers; while, in this paper using both of the decentralized control and the self-intelligence of the MAS, avoids the need for redesigning the controller in the proposed structure. Moreover, in this research, uncertainties in the operators' dynamics, as well as time-varying delays in the communication channels, are taken into account. It is shown that the proposed structure has two tuning matrices (L and D) that can be used for different scenarios of multi-lateral teleoperation. By choosing proper tuning matrices, many related works about the multi-lateral teleoperation/telerehabilitation process can be implemented. In the final section of the paper, several scenarios were introduced to achieve Simultaneous Training and Therapy in TR and are implemented with the proposed structure. The results confirmed the stability and performance of the proposed framework.";2020;4
In this paper, we follow up on research dealing with body tracking and motor rehabilitation. We describe the current situation in telerehabilitation in the home environment. Existing solutions do not allow wide adoption due to hardware requirements and complicated setup. We come with the possibility of telerehabilitation using only laptop or mobile web camera. Together with physiotherapists, we have compiled a set of complex motor exercises to show that the system can be practically used.;2020;4
"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemics has challenged the provision of health care worldwide, highlighting the main flaws of some national health systems with respect to their capacity to cope with the needs of frail subjects. People experiencing disability due to COVID-19 express specific rehabilitation needs that deserve a systematic evidence-based approach. The aim of this article is to provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19. The first rapid living review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st. 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search in PubMed, Pedro, and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: COVID-19, Coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, rehabilitation, physical therapy modalities, exercise, occupational therapy, and late complications. Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English. were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, nine were included in the present review. Four of them are calls for action, three provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, two address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and one provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current COVID-19 pandemic. Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with COVID-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home. Further updates are warranted in order to characterize the emerging disability in COVID-19 survivors and the adverse effects on the health of chronically disabled people.";2020;4
"INTRODUCTION: This paper adds to the series of systematic rapid living reviews, started in April 2020, to provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a systematic scientific literature search performed on papers published from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, Web of Science and the main international guideline databases for articles published (including Epub), in English, from April la to April 30th, 2020. Papers were included if they reported on one of the following: 1) prevalence and features of the emerging disability after COVID-19; 2) rehabilitation strategies applied for COVID-19 patients, regardless of setting or stage; 3) information about rehabilitation services after COVID-19; 4) impact on diseases of rehabilitative interest; 5) complications of rehabilitative interest. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Out of 445 articles retrieved for the time frame, 50 were finally included for qualitative analysis. They consist of seven guidelines, one scoping review, one randomized controlled trial, four descriptive studies (qualitative), one case series, one case report. and 35 expert opinions. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic rapid living review showed an increasing evidence on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 outbreak during April 2020. The main novelties include: 1) the first appearance of epidemiological data on the likely high incidence of neurological complications/disabling sequelae in patients hospitalized for COVID-19; 2) rapid guidelines on the management of chronically disabled patients in the COVID-19 era; 3) advises to provide COVID-19 patients with early respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase, and with telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in the post-acute phase. Although the overall quality of studies has increased, prospective cohort studies on disability course in COVID-19 pandemic and experimental studies on the effects of rehabilitation are still warranted.";2020;4
Introduction and hypothesis The objective was to appraise the current use of mobile technologies for the conservative self-management of urinary incontinence (UI). Moreover, we aimed to explore whether they integrate recommended features for the use of mobile technologies in healthcare and recognized parameters for optimal conservative UI treatment. Methods We conducted a literature search on Medline, Embase, CINAHL, REHABDATA, Cochrane Library and PEDro databases. Eligible articles included people with UI of any type and use of a mobile technology for the conservative self-management of UI. Two reviewers independently screened, reviewed, and extracted data on study design, type of mobile technologies, valuable features, and outcomes related to UI. Results Twelve articles (level of evidence II to V) were retained. Technologies used were a mobile app alone (n = 2), a Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) device and app (n = 2), a PFMT device and telerehabilitation (n = 1), a smartphone messaging system (n = 1), and an internet-based program (n = 1). PFMT programs prescribed a daily frequency for at least 8 weeks. Between 1 and 4 valuable features were reported out of 6 identified. After intervention, at least 1 outcome on UI severity was reported improved in 6/7 studies, satisfaction was high in 3/3 studies and adherence was high (daily usage) in 4/5 studies. Conclusion There is level 2 evidence that there are benefits of using mobile technologies in terms of improvements in UI, satisfaction, adherence, and costs. Mobile technologies reviewed seem to follow optimal PFMT parameters, but users could benefit further from more built-in features that may optimize rehabilitation outcomes.;2020;4
Introduction Aphasia is a common language disorder acquired after stroke that reduces the quality of life of affected patients. The impairment is frequently accompanied by a deficit in cognitive functions. The state-of-the-art therapy is speech and language therapy but recent findings highlight positive effects of high-frequency therapy. Telerehabilitation has the potential to enable high-frequency therapy for patients at home. This study investigates the effects of high-frequency telerehabilitation speech and language therapy (teleSLT) on language functions in outpatients with aphasia compared with telerehabilitative cognitive training. We hypothesise that patients training with high-frequency teleSLT will show higher improvement in language functions and quality of life compared with patients with high-frequency tele-rehabilitative cognitive training (teleCT). Methods and analysis This study is a randomised controlled, evaluator-blinded multicentre superiority trial comparing the outcomes following either high-frequency teleSLT or teleCT. A total of 100 outpatients with aphasia will be recruited and assigned in a 1:1 ratio stratified by trial site and severity of impairment to one of two parallel groups. Both groups will train over a period of 4 weeks for 2 hours per day. Patients in the experimental condition will devote 80% of their training time to teleSLT and the remaining 20% (24 min/day) to teleCT, vice versa for patients in the control condition. The primary outcome measure is the understandability of verbal communication on the Amsterdam Nijmegen Everyday Language Test and secondary outcome measures are intelligibility of the verbal communication, impairment of receptive and expressive language functions, confrontation naming. Other outcomes measures are quality of life and acceptance (usability and subjective experience) of the teleSLT system. Ethics and dissemination This study is approved by the Ethics Committee Bern (ID 2016-01577). Results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.;2020;4
Introduction As the number of patients undergoing primary lower-limb joint replacement has risen continuously, hospital-based healthcare resources have become limited. Delivery of any ongoing rehabilitation needs to adapt to this trend. This systematic literature aimed to examine the effects and safety of telerehabilitation in patients with lower-limb joint replacement. Methods A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted according to procedures by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Studies published prior to February 2020 were identified from Medline Ovid, Scopus, Ebsco Databases and Web of Science. Reference lists of relevant studies were also manually checked to find additional studies. Two researchers conducted study selection separately. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials was used to evaluate the quality of the relevant studies published. A narrative synthesis was used to report the results whereas effect sizes were estimated for different outcomes. Results Nine studies with 1266 patients were included. Study quality was predominantly affected by the lack of blinding. The patients who completed telerehabilitation showed an improvement in physical functioning that was similar to that of patients completing conventional in-person outpatient physical therapy without an increase in adverse events or resource utilization. The effect of telerehabilitation on physical functioning, however, was assessed as heterogeneous and moderate- to low-quality evidence. Discussion Telerehabilitation is a practical alternative to conventional in-person outpatient physical therapy in patients with lower-limb joint replacement. However, more robust studies are needed to build evidence about telerehabilitation.;2020;4
"Introduction Geographical barriers and impaired physical mobility among people with Parkinson's disease (PD) hinder their timely access to speech pathology services. We compared the costs of delivering a speech treatment via in-person consultation versus telerehabilitation. Methods We used data from a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial delivering the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD (R)), where patients with dysarthria associated with PD were assigned to either the urban in-person group (N = 16) or the urban online group (N = 15), supplemented with a non-randomised group (regional online;N = 21). We compared costs over a one-month treatment period from a health-system perspective and a patient perspective. Results The mean treatment costs of both urban online ($1076) and regional ($1206) treatments tended to be slightly higher than urban in-person ($1020) from a health-system perspective. From a patient perspective, the mean treatment cost was $831 in the urban in-person group, $247 in the urban online group and $200 in the regional group. Discussion LSVT LOUD (R) may be delivered via telerehabilitation at a slightly higher cost than in-person delivery from a health-system perspective, but it is cost saving from a patient perspective. Telerehabilitation is an economically beneficial alternative for the delivery of the LSVT LOUD (R) programme in PD patients with speech disorders.";2020;4
"Introduction Individuals with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) often have persistent impairments upon discharge home. In rural communities, specialized rehabilitation services to address impairments can be difficult to access. The purpose of this scoping review is to examine how remote supervision is currently being used in TBI rehabilitation to identify gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed to facilitate access to and implementation of these services. Methods The main objective for this review is to identify the methods being used to deliver remote supervision for rehabilitation in a moderate or severe TBI population. The aim of this review was to document the implementation characteristics of remote supervision used including: (1) type of supervision such as synchronous, asynchronous supervision or mixed; (2) frequency and intensity of remote supervision; and (3) outcomes used to measure intervention delivery as well as effectiveness within this population. This scoping review follows EQUATOR Network recommendations for screening and extracting data. Results Twenty-six studies using a variety of remote supervision technology and outcome measures were included. Supervision frequency and intensity are poorly reported with no standardization. One hundred and six outcome measures were reported in this review showing large diversity in the areas being explored. Discussion Different types of remote supervision have been used with this population; however, there are no clear guidelines on clinical implementation. Future studies must better define implementation parameters of remote supervision. Benefit on physical activity, balance and mobility outcomes also need to be further explored.";2020;4
Introduction It is important to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of alternative services to traditional cardiac rehabilitation while the economic credentials of the Smartphone Cardiac Rehabilitation, Assisted self-Management (SCRAM) programme among people with coronary heart disease (CHD) are unknown. This economic protocol outlines the methods for undertaking a trial-based economic evaluation of SCRAM in the real-world setting in Australia. Methods and analysis The within-trial economic evaluation will be undertaken alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to determine the effectiveness of SCRAM in comparison with the usual care cardiac rehabilitation (UC) alone in people with CHD. Pathway analysis will be performed to identify all the costs related to the delivery of SCRAM and UC. Both a healthcare system and a limited societal perspective will be adopted to gauge all costs associated with health resource utilisation and productivity loss. Healthcare resource use over the 6-month participation period will be extracted from administrative databases (ie, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Medical Benefits Schedule). Productivity loss will be measured by absenteeism from work (valued by human capital approach). The primary outcomes for the economic evaluation are maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max, mL/kg/min, primary RCT outcome) and quality-adjusted life years estimated from health-related quality of life as assessed by the Assessment of Quality of Life-8D instrument. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated using the differences in costs and benefits (ie, primary and secondary outcomes) between the two randomised groups from both perspectives with no discounting. All costs will be valued in Australian dollars for year 2020. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been approved under Australia's National Mutual Acceptance agreement by the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/18/MH/119). It is anticipated that SCRAM is a cost-effective cardiac telerehabilitation programme for people with CHD from both a healthcare and a limited societal perspective in Australia. The evaluation will provide evidence to underpin national scale-up of the programme to a wider population. The results of the economic analysis will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.;2020;4
Introduction Motor imagery training delivered at home via telerehabilitation is a novel rehabilitation concept. The aim was to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation-based motor imaging training (Tele-MIT) on gait, balance and cognitive and psychosocial outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Methods This randomized, controlled pilot trial included pwMS and healthy individuals. pwMS were randomly divided into two groups, intervention and control. The intervention group received Tele-MIT twice a week for 8 weeks. The control group was a wait-list group without any additional specific treatment. Healthy participants served as a baseline comparison. The Dynamic Gait Index, used to assess dynamic balance during walking, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included assessments of walking speed, endurance and perceived ability, balance performance assessed by a computerized posturography device, balance confidence, cognitive functions, fatigue, anxiety, depression and quality of life. Results Baseline comparisons with healthy individuals revealed that motor imagery abilities were preserved in pwMS (p > 0.05). The intervention group exhibited significant improvements in dynamic balance during walking (p = 0.002), walking speed (p = 0.007), perceived walking ability (p = 0.008), balance confidence (p = 0.002), most cognitive functions (p = 0.001-0.008), fatigue (p = 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.001), depression (p = 0.005) and quality of life (p = 0.002). No significant changes were observed in the control group in any of the outcome measures (p > 0.05). Discussion Tele-MIT is a novel method that proved feasible and effective in improving dynamic balance during walking, walking speed and perceived walking ability, balance confidence, cognitive functions, fatigue, anxiety, depression and quality of life in pwMS.;2020;4
"Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system and a major cause of disability in young adults. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the development of innovative ways to deliver rehabilitation care outside of a hospital setting. The aim was to conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the efficacy of an integrated telerehabilitation approach (ITA) on motor, cognitive and participation outcomes delivered to people with MS (pwMS). Methods We systematically searched for original manuscripts regarding ITA in pwMS. Efficacy on motor, cognitive and participation outcomes was measured as the standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) of pre and post training. Results Nine studies encompassing 716 pwMS diagnosis were included. The overall effect of ITA was: large for motor outcomes (g = 1.05;p = 0.013); small for cognitive performance outcomes (g = 0.16;p = 0.237); and small for participation outcomes (g = 0.15;p = 0.259). Domain-specific results showed that the effect on motor disability was large (g = 1.18), while on gait and balance was medium (g = 0.32 andg = 0.48, respectively). Moreover, all effects on single cognitive domains were small. Finally, among the single participation outcomes considered (depression, fatigue, daily functioning, quality of life and self-efficacy) only depression showed a nearly medium effect (g = 0.30). Conclusions PwMS can benefit from ITA in the treatment of motor symptoms according to the current model of continuity of care. However, the low efficacy of ITA on cognition and participation domains suggests the necessity to develop intervention models that include a broader spectrum of needs and objectives.";2020;4
Introduction Occupational rehabilitation often involves functional capacity evaluations (FCE) that use simulated work tasks to assess work ability. Currently, there exists no single, streamlined solution to simulate all or a large number of standard work tasks. Such a system would improve FCE and functional rehabilitation through simulating reaching maneuvers and more dexterous functional tasks that are typical of workplace activities. This paper reviews efforts to develop robotic FCE solutions that incorporate machine learning algorithms. Methods We reviewed the literature regarding rehabilitation robotics, with an emphasis on novel techniques incorporating robotics and machine learning into FCE. Results Rehabilitation robotics aims to improve the assessment and rehabilitation of injured workers by providing methods for easily simulating workplace tasks using intelligent robotic systems. Machine learning-based approaches combine the benefits of robotic systems with the expertise and experience of human therapists. These innovations have the potential to improve the quantification of function as well as learn the haptic interactions provided by therapists to assist patients during assessment and rehabilitation. This is done by allowing a robot to learn based on a therapist's motions (demonstrations) what the desired workplace activity (task) is and how to recreate it for a worker with an injury (patient). Through Telerehabilitation and internet connectivity, these robotic assessment techniques can be used over a distance to reach rural and remote locations. Conclusions While the research is in the early stages, robotics with integrated machine learning algorithms have great potential for improving traditional FCE practice.;2020;4
"Introduction Patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) face barriers accessing specialty care for evaluation and treatment. Telemedicine, the practice of clinical care at a distance with the aid of technology, may be a potential bridge to close the access gap for pwMS separated by distance or disability. The objective of this review was to investigate the types of telemedicine being utilized and overall outcomes for pwMS and their providers. Methods A Boolean search of the medical literature was conducted between January 2000 and January 31, 2018. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane databases, were used to identify all relevant citations. Two reviewers independently appraised the articles for meeting study criteria and for study quality using the CASP system. Financial costs of the telemedicine applications were assessed. Results A total of 28 studies involving 3252 participants met criteria for inclusion. Telemedicine interventions were classified, and outcomes were assessed systematically by the following categories: general MS care; rehabilitation and exercise; and neuropsychology/mental health. Studies showed a range of outcomes with variable quality. Overall, remote clinical examinations, long-term telemedicine management interventions and telerehabilitation were shown to be beneficial, cost-effective and satisfactory for patients and providers. Discussion Telemedicine is a viable platform for delivering specialty MS care. Remote neurological assessments and several forms of therapy have been shown to be technically feasible. Optimal implementation and barriers to the use of telemedicine in the current healthcare system should be explored.";2020;4
Introduction Persons with disability (PWD) in the Philippines find it difficult to attend regular face-to-face rehabilitation due to distance, transportation and food expenses, disability, and time constraints. Being a developing country, Filipino rehabilitation doctors have to be resourceful to overcome these barriers and try alternative ways to reach out to their patients, such as through telemedicine, specifically telerehabilitation. Case presentation After receiving free wheelchairs, two patients with paraplegia secondary to spinal cord disease were unable to report for in-clinic wheelchair reassessment. Telerehabilitation was attempted for the first time to conduct wheelchair follow-up using a commonly available social media application through synchronous and asynchronous methods. During the teleconsultation, the rehabilitation doctors used the wheelchair follow-up form from the World Health Organization translated into Filipino. There were apprehensions at first, especially from the side of the patients, regarding the method, effectiveness, and safety of telerehabilitation. In the end, the patients found telerehabilitation easy, safe, and convenient, and were satisfied with the practical wheelchair modifications and exercise recommendations. Discussion Telerehabilitation is a viable alternative to provide universal access to rehabilitation care and overcome the barriers to in-clinic visits among indigent PWD in a resource-limited country. Unlike in developed countries, we do not have readily available customized telemedicine platforms and telemonitoring equipment to conduct telerehabilitation. Nonetheless, we can make use of what is locally available, affordable, and convenient to our patients.;2020;4
Introduction Rehabilitation and physical therapy have been adapting to the telehealth era, increasing accessibility and improving the continuity of attention in geographically remote populations with disabilities. Due to the spread of infection by SARS-CoV-2, many professionals have had to adapt their work to telerehabilitation practices, which require the best evidence at short notice and in summarized form. In this context, this protocol has been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation as a care strategy in physical therapy for different conditions, populations, and contexts. Method and analysis An overview will be carried out in the format of a rapid review. It will include systematic reviews of different conditions, populations, and contexts, where the intervention to be evaluated is telerehabilitation by physical therapy. The outcomes considered will be clinical effectiveness depending on the specific condition, functionality, quality of life, satisfaction, adherence, and safety. A search will be carried out of the MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies will be selected in duplicate with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be carried out by a reviewer with non-independent verification by a second reviewer. The findings will be reported qualitatively by tables and figures. Ethics and dissemination The principles of the value of the research question, the methodological rigor, scientifically qualified investigators, an independent evaluation of the protocol, and timely and accurate publication of the results will be complied with. The complete review will lead to the publication of at least one article, and the results will be widely disseminated at various levels of decision-making. Register This protocol has been registered in PROSPERO with the number CRD42020185640.;2020;4
"Introduction Shoulder lesions rank among the top 15 diagnoses accounting for days of incapacity to work. Inpatient or full-day outpatient rehabilitation are some of the standard therapies. For sustainable rehabilitation, continuation of rehabilitation after discharge from a rehabilitation centre is vital. Besides medical exercise therapy (MET), home-based physical exercise programmes are used. To monitor exercise quantity and quality, AGT-Reha, a health-enabling technology for home rehabilitation, has been developed and evaluated in a pilot study for technical feasibility and acceptance. To integrate the digital therapeutic AGT-Reha into regular healthcare processes, an efficacy evaluation is required. Methods and analysis AGT-Reha-WK is a prospective, monocentric, non-randomised, unblinded non-inferiority trial. Primary objective is to investigate whether AGT-Reha enhanced home-based exercise training is non-inferior to MET as standard aftercare. Secondary objective is to compare the costs of both therapies. Efficacy as medical success (primary outcome) is examined with regard to ability to work, return to work and sustainability of training (secondary outcomes). The outcome measure for non-inferiority is shoulder function (pain and disability) assessed by the standardised Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). The non-inferiority margin is set to 10 points on SPADI score using a 95% CI. Subjects will be recruited at the Rehabilitation Center Bad Pyrmont, Germany. The total number of subjects should be 84 (42 per group). Treatment takes 6 months per patient. Subjects will be assessed at four time points: pre-baseline (admission to rehabilitation centre), baseline (discharge from rehabilitation centre), post-therapy and follow-up (3 months post-therapy). Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of Hannover Medical School (ethics approval no: 7313). Results of the trial are planned to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Protocol version V2.0, 23 May 2018, Amendment 01: improved risk analysis, clarification of exclusion criteria to increase reproducibility, additional documentation with OpenClinica; these changes have no effect on structural equality.";2020;4
Introduction Telerehabilitation may be effective on average but is not equally effective among all people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, the purpose of this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial was to explore whether baseline characteristics of participants with MS influence fatigue and physical activity outcomes of three telerehabilitation interventions. Methods Participants were randomized to contact-control intervention (CC), physical activity-only intervention (PA-only), and physical activity plus fatigue self-management intervention (FM+). The 12-week interventions were delivered over the phone. Sociodemographic (age and income), clinical (comorbidities, mental function and physical function), psychosocial (self-efficacy, outcome expectations and goal-setting), and behavioural baseline characteristics (step count and fatigue self-management behaviors) were used in a moderated regression analysis and a responder analysis to examine their influence on the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) at post-test (i.e. immediately post-interventions). Results No interactions terms were statistically significant in the moderation analysis. However, the responder analysis showed that baseline psychosocial characteristics and mental function were significantly different (p < 0.05) between responders and non-responders. Specifically, non-responders on the FIS at post-test in the PA-only intervention had significantly lower baseline scores in goal setting for engaging in fatigue self-management behaviours. Also, non-responders on the GLTEQ at post-test in the FM+ intervention had significantly worse baseline scores in mental function. Discussion Further research is needed to understand the complex relationship among baseline characteristics, telerehabilitation and response heterogeneity. We discuss how research on examining response heterogeneity may be advanced by conducting mega-clinical trials, secondary analyses of big data, meta-analyses and employing non-traditional research designs.;2020;4
Introduction The science supporting the application of exercise training and physical activity in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) has expanded considerably in strength and scope over the past 25+ years. Exercise training is now a strategy that is commonly recommended for management of MS in clinical practice. Yet, there are still many opportunities for expanding the breadth and strength of research on exercise training in MS. Areas covered This paper provides the authors' perspective on eight emerging areas of research involving exercise and physical activity behavior in persons living with MS. Those areas include behavior change interventions, research across the activity continuum, telerehabilitation, neuroplasticity, heterogeneity of outcomes, inclusion of targeted samples, combined interventions involving exercise training, and multi-site trials. Expert opinion Additional research addressing those areas will greatly expand the opportunity for translation of exercise and physical activity into the clinical care of persons with MS.;2020;4
Introduction This study explores a novel smartphone application for postoperative care following carpal tunnel release (CTR). We hypothesized that a software-based 'virtual visit' for CTR could be safe, effective and convenient for the patient. Methods Our group developed the software application utilized in this study. Interactive steps with video instructions enabled patients to complete dressing and suture removal, capture a wound photo, answer a question about median nerve symptoms and capture a video of finger range of motion. Adult patients undergoing endoscopic or open CTR were enrolled. Prior to their scheduled postoperative visit, patients received and completed the module using their smartphone. Agreement between findings of the virtual visit and the corresponding in-person clinical visit was assessed using kappa values. Results Twenty-two patients were contacted regarding study enrolment and 17 patients were enrolled (ages 23-63, mean 48.2, 6M, 11F). Of 16 patients who participated, all completed dressing removal. Ten of 16 patients removed their sutures successfully. Fourteen patients captured a clinically adequate wound photo and 15 patients answered a question about median nerve symptoms. Fourteen patients captured a range of motion video. Software assessments of surgical wounds, nerve symptoms and physical exams agreed strongly with clinical assessments. Discussion Most patients were able to respond to a question about their symptoms, provide clinical assessment of their wound via a photo and record a video of their range of motion. Suture removal was the most difficult task. More investigation is needed to determine which patients can reliably remove their sutures.;2020;4
Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases are the world's most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the population, including Central Europe. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an effective preventive approach that includes several core components. Physical training is identified as an integral and essential part of CR. Training can positively influence several cardiovascular risk factors in people diagnosed with coronary heart disease and prevent them from clinical events. Our study aims to research the method of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in a home environment using telerehabilitation. We assume that the HIIT form of telerehabilitation, using a heart rate monitor as a tool for backing up training data, can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and lead to higher peak oxygen uptake than the traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). Methods: This study is designed as a monocentral randomized controlled trial at University Hospital Brno in the Czech Republic. After the coronary heart event, the suitable patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) and separated into 2 groups: the experimental HIIT group and the control MICT group. Both groups undergo a 12-week telerehabilitation with a 1-year follow-up period. Study participants will be telemonitored during physical training in their home environment via a heart rate monitor and a web platform. Once a week, the patients will give their feedback and motivation by a telephone call. The primary outcome observed will be the effect of intervention expressed by changes in cardiorespiratory fitness. Secondary outcomes will be the health-related quality of life, anxiety, training adherence, body composition, safety, and satisfaction. Discussion: The HIIT is widely researched predominantly in a center-based supervised form. Our study differs from others by the use of telemedicine and smart technologies in home-based settings. Previous home-based cardiac telerehabilitation studies have focused primarily on MICT, which has demonstrated feasibility, and results have shown similar improvements as center-based CR. There is a presumption that HIIT may be superior to MICT. However, it can be complicated to self-dose the method in the home environment. Investigators expect that HIIT research will provide insight into the possibilities of telemedicine feasibility, effect, and limitations of coronary heart disease patients' use at low to moderate cardiovascular risk.;2020;4
Introduction: Human joint moment is a critical parameter to rehabilitation assessment and human-robot interaction, which can be predicted using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. However, challenge remains as lack of an effective approach to determining the input variables for the ANN model in joint moment prediction, which determines the number of input sensors and the complexity of prediction. Methods: To address this research gap, this study develops a mathematical model based on the Hill muscle model to determining the online input variables of the ANN for the prediction of joint moments. In this method, the muscle activation, muscle-tendon moment velocity and length in the Hill muscle model and muscle-tendon moment arm are translated to the online measurable variables, i.e., muscle electromyography (EMG), joint angles and angular velocities of the muscle span. To test the predictive ability of these input variables, an ANN model is designed and trained to predict joint moments. The ANN model with the online measurable input variables is tested on the experimental data collected from ten healthy subjects running with the speeds of 2, 3, 4 and 5 m/s on a treadmill. The variance accounted for (VAF) between the predicted and inverse dynamics moment is used to evaluate the prediction accuracy. Results: The results suggested that the method can predict joint moments with a higher accuracy (mean VAF = 89.67 +/- 5.56 %) than those obtained by using other joint angles and angular velocities as inputs (mean VAF = 86.27 +/- 6.6%) evaluated by jack-knife cross-validation. Conclusions: The proposed method provides us with a powerful tool to predict joint moment based on online measurable variables, which establishes the theoretical basis for optimizing the input sensors and detection complexity of the prediction system. It may facilitate the research on exoskeleton robot control and real-time gait analysis in motor rehabilitation.;2020;4
"Introduction: Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is critical to patient outcome. Despite its importance; however, hospital-based rehabilitation is limited, with barriers, including distance and cost. With recent technological advancements, wearable devices have actively been used to address these barriers. In this study, we propose a randomized controlled trial protocol investigating the efficacy and feasibility of home-based rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction using a smart wearable device providing electrical stimulation that allows knee exercise. Methods and analysis: This is a protocol proposal for a prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study. We plan to recruit adults discharged after ACL reconstruction; the recruited subjects will be randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups, using a computer-generated randomization method: the intervention (n = 20) or control group (n = 20). The intervention group will receive a 6-week home-based rehabilitation program using smart wearable device. The control group will undergo a 6-week self-exercise program as normal. The following outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks post the 6-week intervention program: quadriceps strength of the affect side as measured by a dynamometer (primary outcome); range of motion; root mean square of quadriceps muscle using surface electromyography; knee function using questionnaire; quality of life; subject's satisfaction score using questionnaire; frequency and duration of exercise; and knee pain. An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted for the primary outcome. Discussion: This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study. This study aims to research the feasibility and efficacy of a 6-week, structured home-based rehabilitation program for patients after ACL reconstruction using a smart wearable device. The findings of this study will help to establish a home-based rehabilitation program to better recovery in patients with ACL reconstruction.";2020;4
"Introduction: Telerehabilitation has been promoted as a more efficient means of delivering rehabilitation services to stroke patients while also providing care options to those unable to attend conventional therapy. However, the application of telerehabilitation interventions in stroke populations has proven to be more challenging than anticipated, with many studies showing mixed results in terms of its efficacy. Six different clinical trials examining stroke telerehabilitation were initiated across Canada as part of the Heart and Stroke Foundation's 2013 Tele-Rehabilitation for Stroke Initiative, with interventions ranging from lifestyle coaching to delivering memory, speech, or physical training. The purpose of this article was to summarize the over-arching findings from this initiative, particularly the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of telerehabilitation services within a research context. Methods: Details of the projects were obtained directly from the study investigators and from materials published by each group. Qualitative open-ended questions were posed to each group for the discussion of lessons learned. Results: Important lessons learned from this initiative included: (1) the efficacy and cost of telerehabilitation is similar to that of traditional face-to-face management; (2) patients are satisfied with telerehabilitation services when trained appropriately and some social interaction occurs; (3) clinicians prefer face-to-face interactions but will use telerehabilitation when face-to-face is not feasible; and (4) technology should be selected based on ease of use and targeted to the skills and abilities of the users. Conclusions: Overall, results from these studies suggest that telerehabilitation services work best to augment face-to-face rehabilitation or when no other options are available.";2020;4
Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of video-based virtual reality exercises performed using the LeapMotion (R) device and Fizyosoft (R) software on the hand and upper extremity functions of patients with hemiplegia. Materials and Method: The mean age of the patients in the study group was 63.6 +/- 7.1 years and the duration of the disease was 13 +/- 10.74 months. The mean age of the patients in the control group was 63.6 +/- 9.2 years and the duration of the disease was 10 +/- 9.89 months. This study was a randomized, controlled, single-blind study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group and a control group. Both groups were arranged to undergo a combination of a neurophysiological and a conventional exercise program and physical therapy. In addition, virtual reality training therapy was administered in the experimental group using the LeapMotion. device. The patients' range-of-motion (ROM) was measured using the Fizyosoft (R) software, which operates with the LeapMotion (R) device, and their upper extremity and general function status was evaluated using the Fugl-Meyer assessment of upper extremity motor impairment (FMA-UE) scale, the Brunnstrom recovery stage (BRS) scale, the Barthel Index (Bl), and the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) scale at the beginning and end of treatment. Results: Significant improvements were noted after treatment in the upper extremity range-of-motion values as well as in FMA-U E, BRS, Bl, and FAC scores in the experimental and control groups. Additionally, there were significant differences in the ROM measurements of the hand and wrist joints between the groups. However, no significant differences in clinical test results were observed between the groups. Conclusion: Virtual reality exercises have a positive effect on range-of-motion measurements in stroke patients. Studies with a larger number of participants are needed to demonstrate results more clearly using other scales.;2020;4
"Key PointsQuestionDoes a 9-week hybrid comprehensive cardiac telerehabilitation program, compared with usual care, improve the percentage of days that patients with heart failure spend alive and out of the hospital during long-term follow-up? FindingsThis multisite randomized clinical trial of 850 patients assigned to hybrid comprehensive telerehabilitation or usual care did not meet its primary outcome of extending the percentage of days alive and out of the hospital during 14 to 26 months of follow-up. MeaningIn this trial, a 9-week hybrid comprehensive telerehabilitation program in patients with heart failure did not increase the percentage of days alive and out of the hospital during 14 to 26 months of follow-up. This randomized clinical trial assesses whether potential improvements in function and quality-of-life outcomes occur after a 9-week program of hybrid, comprehensive telerehabilitation vs usual care in patients with heart failure. ImportanceGuidelines recommend exercise training as a component of heart failure management. There are large disparities in access to rehabilitation, and introducing hybrid comprehensive telerehabilitation (HCTR) consisting of remote monitoring of training at patients' homes might be an appealing alternative. ObjectiveTo assess whether potential improvements in quality-of-life outcomes after a 9-week HCTR intervention in patients with heart failure translate into improvement in clinical outcomes during extended 12 to 24 months of follow-up, compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe Telerehabilitation in Heart Failure Patients (TELEREH-HF) trial is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, parallel-group randomized clinical trial that enrolled 850 patients with heart failure up to 6 months after a cardiovascular hospitalization with New York Heart Association levels I, II, or III and left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less. Patients from 5 centers in Poland were randomized 1:1 to HCTR plus usual care or usual care only and followed up for 14 to 26 months after randomization. InterventionsDuring the first 9 weeks, patients underwent either an HCTR program (1 week in hospital and 8 weeks at home) or usual care with observation. The HCTR intervention encompassed telecare, telerehabilitation, and remote monitoring of implantable devices. No intervention occurred in the remaining study period. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe percentage of days alive and out of the hospital from randomization through the end of follow-up at 14 to 26 months. ResultsA total of 850 patients were enrolled, with 425 randomized to the HCTR group (377 male patients [88.7%]; mean [SD] age, 62.6 [10.8] years) and 425 randomized to usual care (376 male patients [88.5%]; mean [SD] age, 62.2 [10.2] years). The HCTR intervention did not extend the percentage of days alive and out of the hospital. The mean (SD) days were 91.9 (19.3) days in the HCTR group vs 92.8 (18.3) days in the usual-care group, with the probability that HCTR extends days alive and out of the hospital equal to 0.49 (95% CI, 0.46-0.53; P=.74) vs usual care. During follow-up, 54 patients died in the HCTR arm and 52 in the usual-care arm, with mortality rates at 26 months of 12.5% vs 12.4%, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.70-1.51]). There were also no differences in hospitalization rates (hazard ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.79-1.13]). The HCTR intervention was effective at 9 weeks, significantly improving peak oxygen consumption (0.95 [95% CI, 0.65-1.26] mL/kg/min vs 0.00 [95% CI, -0.31 to 0.30] mL/kg/min; P<.001) and quality of life (Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 questionnaire score, 1.58 [95% CI, 0.74-2.42] vs 0.00 [95% CI, -0.84 to 0.84]; P=.008), and it was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events during exercise. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this trial, the positive effects of a 9-week program of HCTR in patients with heart failure did not lead to the increase in percentage of days alive and out of the hospital and did not reduce mortality and hospitalization over a follow-up period of 14 to 26 months.

Lack of specialist beds, inadequate finance and shortage of skilled staff make it difficult for Spinal Cord Injury Centres (SCICs) in the United Kingdom (UK) to admit all newly injured individuals. Length of stay of those admitted can be too brief. At discharge, follow-up care is sparse and inadequate. We therefore propose that specialist spinal units redefine their roles and act as catalysts to build capacity by enhancing expertise in the wider community. SCICs can devolve certain tasks locally to less specialised units with their support, training, and guidance. This Commentary further proposes that use of Digital Health Technologies, (i.e., to deploy telemedicine, telehealth, and telerehabilitation), can enhance rehabilitation opportunities. The authors set-forth their vision for a comprehensive web portal that will serve as a primary resource for evidence-based practice, information on guidelines, care pathways, and protocols of SCI management. At any stage during the acute management of SCI and following discharge, rehabilitation specialists could conduct remote consultation with persons with SCI and acute care specialists via the web portal, allowing timely access to specialist input and better clinical outcomes. The proposed portal would also provide information, advice and support to persons with SCI and their family members. The strategic use of digital health technologies has been shown to result in cost and time savings and increase positive outcomes.;2020;4
Maintaining appropriate home rehabilitation programs after stroke, with proper adherence and remote monitoring is a challenging task. Virtual reality (VR) - based serious games could be a strategy used in telerehabilitation (TR) to engage patients in an enjoyable and therapeutic approach. The aim of this review was to analyze the background and quality of clinical research on this matter to guide future research. The review was based on research material obtained from PubMed and Cochrane up to April 2020 using the PRISMA approach. The use of VR serious games has shown evidence of efficacy on upper limb TR after stroke, but the evidence strength is still low due to a limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCT), a small number of participants involved, and heterogeneous samples. Although this is a promising strategy to complement conventional rehabilitation, further investigation is needed to strengthen the evidence of effectiveness and support the dissemination of the developed solutions.;2020;4
"Maintaining social skills such as Theory of Mind (ToM) competences is important to counteract the conversion into dementia in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Multidimensional nonpharmacological interventions demonstrated their potential in improving cognitive and behavioral abilities; however, little is known about the long-term effect of such interventions on social skills in people with MCI. The aim of this longitudinal study was to monitor ToM competences considering both cognitive and affective domains in an amnestic MCI (aMCI) sample involved in a home-based multistimulation treatment (MST@H). 30 aMCI subjects (M:F=15:15; mean age +/- SD=77.00 +/- 4.60) were enrolled, and three steps of evaluation with neuropsychological tests and ToM tasks have been implemented. 21 healthy controls (HC) were also included (M:F=9:12; mean age +/- SD=74.95 +/- 3.88) to characterize the aMCI sample regarding differences in ToM performance compared to HC at the baseline evaluation. Our results show that the aMCI group statistically significantly underperformed the HC group only in the advanced ToM tasks, confirming an initial decline of high-level ToM competences in this population. The longitudinal evaluation revealed time changes not only in some subcognitive domains of MoCA (memory and executive functions) but also in cognitive and affective ToM dimensions in aMCI subjects. Our findings suggest that cognitive and affective ToM can be considered useful outcome measures to test the long-term effect of treatment over time.";2020;4
Multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reduces morbidity and mortality and increases quality of life in cardiac patients. However, CR utilisation rates are low, and targets for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease are not met in the majority of patients, indicating that secondary prevention programmes such as CR leave room for improvement. Cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) may resolve several barriers that impede CR utilisation and sustainability of its effects. In CTR, one or more modules of CR are delivered outside the environment of the hospital or CR centre, using monitoring devices and remote communication with patients. Multidisciplinary CTR is a safe and at least equally (cost-)effective alternative to centre-based CR, and is therefore recommended in a recent addendum to the Dutch multidisciplinary CR guidelines. In this article, we describe the background and core components of this addendum on CTR, and discuss its implications for clinical practice and future perspectives.;2020;4
Muscle strength and force production are important measures of patient progress during physical rehabilitation. Reliable and objective measurements are important to ascertain throughout rehabilitation. Current methods-manual muscle testing, electromechanical dynamometer, and hand-held dynamometer- are accurate and reliable, but have limitations that prevent wide implementation. As healthcare systems adapt to more patient-centered outcome models, changes to the delivery of rehabilitation, whether at-home or in the clinic, must also change to become more cost effective and accessible and provide quantifiable information regarding patient progress. We developed a novel Force Sensing (FoSe) device to quantify either tensile or compressive isometric muscle strength. The device was tested in a laboratory setting with healthy participants (n = 32) and compared to the commonly used hand-held dynamometer (HHD). Participants used both devices to perform several common isometric muscle tests including: hip abduction, knee extension, knee flexion, shoulder external rotation, and shoulder internal rotation. Compared to the HHD, FoSe was found to be an accurate and reliable measurement of force production. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranged from 0.58 to 0.89 without a magnitude dependent variation in force measurement. A second round of clinical testing with a patient population is warranted to determine FoSe's ability to measure clinically relevant asymmetry and progress over time. Further usability testing also needs to be conducted to determine the adequacy of FoSe for at-home use by both patients and clinicians. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2020;4
Neuromuscular impairment requires adherence to a rehabilitation regimen for maximum recovery of motor function. Consumer-grade game controllers have emerged as a viable means to relay supervised physical therapy to patients' homes, thereby increasing their accessibility to healthcare. These controllers allow patients to perform exercise frequently and improve their rehabilitation outcomes. However, the non-universal design of game controllers targets healthy people and does not always accommodate people with disability. Consequently, many patients experience considerable difficulty assuming certain hand postures and performing the prescribed exercise correctly. Here, we explore the feasibility of improving rehabilitation outcomes through a 3D printing approach that enhances off-the-shelf game controllers in home therapy. Specifically, a custom attachment was 3D printed for a commercial haptic device that mediates fine motor rehabilitation. In an experimental study, 25 healthy subjects performed a navigation task, with the retrofit attachment and without it, while simulating disability of the upper limb. When using the attachment, subjects extended their wrist range of motion, yet maintained their level of compensation. The subjects also showed higher motivation to repeat the exercise with the enhanced device. The results bring forward evidence for the potential of this approach in transforming game controllers toward targeted interventions in home therapy.;2020;4
Neuro-rehabilitation is a key treatment for motor skills recovery after a cerebrovascular stroke. Based on the level and size of the brain lesion, different degrees of motor impairment could arise. A typical problem of post-stroke patients is an alteration in the upright stance balance on the feet. For patients with mild to moderate impairment, home rehabilitation could provide substantial benefits in terms of functional recovery, without the discomfort and costs associated with a conventional rehabilitation in a care center. This work presents the development of a wearable m-health solution for biofeedback provisioning to the patient in balance recovery exercises. By exploiting two FSR-sensorized insoles and a custom readout electronics, an Android app can provide visual biofeedback and simple exergame to help the patient in the recovery of a correct distribution of plantar pressure. A test performed on ten healthy subjects reveals that the proposed system provides a reasonable distribution of the plantar pressure according to the current knowledge in the field. The proposed solution can be easily integrated into a software framework for home telerehabilitation.;2020;4
Nowadays, Healthcare Social Networks (HSNs) offer the possibility to enhance patient care and education. However, they also present potential risks for patients due to the possible distribution of poor-quality or wrong information along with their bad interpretation. On one hand doctors and practitioners want to promote the exchange of information among patients about a specific disease, but on the other hand they do not have enough time to read patients' posts and moderate them when required. In this paper, we investigate and compare different supervised learning classifiers that we adopted for the classification of critical patients' posts who can trigger the intervention of the medical personnel. In particular, by considering different Bayesian, Linear and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers we analyze their accuracy considering different n-grams datasets preparation approaches in order to identify the best approach for the identification of critical patients' posts in a Healthcare Social Network.

Nowadays, recent advancements in ICT have sped up the development of new services for smart cities in different application domains. One of these is definitely healthcare. In this context, remote patient monitoring and rehabilitation activities can take place either in satellite hospital centres or directly in citizens' homes. Specifically, using a combination of Cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data analytics technologies, patients with motor disabilities can be remotely assisted avoiding stressful waiting times and overcoming geographical barriers. This paper focuses on the Tele-Rehabilitation as a Service (TRaaS) concept. Such a service generates healthcare big data coming from remote rehabilitation devices used by patients that need to be processed in the hospital Cloud. Specifically, after a feasibility analysis, by using a Lokomat dataset as sample, we measured and compared the performances of four of the major NoSQL DBMS(s) demonstrating that the document approach well suits our case study.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the research was to verify the possibilities of using virtual reality in combination with classical approaches to the rehabilitation of patients after stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As part of rehabilitation, we examined the possibilities of rehabilitation of the upper, lower limbs and fine mobility of the upper limbs in a selected group of patients that met the criteria for inclusion in a combined rehabilitation program using virtual reality with a focus on testing different approaches, devices and applications. At the same time, we tried to identify quantitative and qualitative parameters that could be objectively measured and based on them to evaluate the progress of patients in rehabilitation or in personalizing individual rehabilitation scenarios. RESULTS: In patients who underwent a combined method of rehabilitation, we observed progress in the development of their ability to improve motor skills. We identified various categories of parameters that can be evaluated by artificial intelligence methods, and we also identified that the key elements in the use of virtual reality as a rehabilitation method are the so-called WOW effect and the creation of an emotional change in the patient that motivates him to rehabilitate. CONCLUSION: We have shown that virtual reality methods have the potential to accelerate rehabilitation and increase the motivation of selected groups of patients after stroke.;2020;4
Objective To determine the effects of a 12-week home-based motor training telerehabilitation program in patients with subcortical stroke by combining motor function assessments and multimodality MRI analysis methods. Methods Fifty-two patients with stroke and hemiplegia were randomly assigned to either a home-based motor training telerehabilitation (TR) group or a conventional rehabilitation (CR) group for 12 weeks. The Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) for upper and lower extremities and the modified Barthel Index were used as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes included resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the bilateral M1 areas, gray matter volumes of the primary motor cortex (M1) areas, and white matter integrity of the corticospinal tract. Analysis of covariance was applied to examine the effects of the home-based motor training TR program on neural function recovery and brain plasticity. Results Compared with the CR group, the TR group showed significant improvement in the FMA (p = 0.011) and significantly increased M1-M1 rsFC (p = 0.031) at the end of the rehabilitation. The M1-M1 rsFC change was significantly positively correlated with the FMA change in the TR group (p = 0.018). Conclusion This study showed a beneficial effect of the home-based motor training telerehabilitation program on motor function in patients with stroke, which was accompanied by enhanced interhemispheric functional connectivity of the M1 areas. We inferred that it is feasible, safe, and efficacious for patients with stroke to receive professional rehabilitation training at home. The combined use of imaging biomarkers should be encouraged in motor training clinical studies in patients with stroke. Classification of evidence This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with stroke with hemiplegia, home-based telerehabilitation compared to conventional rehabilitation significantly improves some motor function tests.;2020;4
Objective To determine the feasibility of conducting a single videoconferencing session (telerehabilitation) instead of a face-to-face home visit for a review appointment in a community rehabilitation program. Design A feasibility study based on Bowen's framework was used to determine demand, acceptability, limited efficacy and practicality of telerehabilitation. The study involved qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Setting Two Victorian community rehabilitation programs providing services to large geographical catchment zones in the outer fringe of a metropolitan area. Participants Ten adult clients receiving home-based therapy and 5 allied health clinicians working in the program. Interventions Clients participated in a single review therapy appointment (telerehabilitation) from physiotherapy, dietetics or speech pathology using the health network's videoconferencing platfrom and the client's own electronic device. Main outcome measures Demand was assessed by calculating the percentage of eligible clients able to participate compared to total number of home-based clients. Acceptability, practicality and limited efficacy were explored through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews. Results Nearly one quarter of clients screened met eligibility criteria, indicating a large potential demand for telerehabilitation. Telerehabilitation was highly acceptable for clinicians and clients participating in speech pathology and dietitian sessions as these contain targeted education and talking-based therapy. It was less accepted in physiotherapy, where there is a more hands-on approach. Telerehabilitation was practical and efficient for both clinicians and clients, especially when time was allowed for training and initial troubleshooting. Conclusion Telerehabilitation is a feasible modality for review sessions in community rehabilitation and helps improve efficient use of clinician and client time. It is more appropriate for disciplines that use education and talking-based therapy compared with hands-on therapy. Older clients are accepting of new technology with support and education.;2020;4
"Objective: Pilot a definitive randomized controlled trial of speech-language telerehabilitation in poststroke aphasia in addition to usual care with regard to recruitment, drop-outs, and language effects. Design: Pilot single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Setting: Telerehabilitation delivered from tertiary rehabilitation center to participants at their home or admitted to secondary rehabilitation centers. Subjects: People with naming impairment due to aphasia following stroke. Intervention: Sixty-two participants randomly allocated to 5 hours of speech and language telerehabilitation by videoconference per week over four consecutive weeks together with usual care or usual care alone. The telerehabilitation targeted functional, expressive language. Main measures: Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment: naming (primary outcome), repetition, and auditory comprehension subtests; Verb and Sentence Test sentence production subtest and the Communicative Effectiveness Index at baseline, four weeks, and four months postrandomization. Data were analyzed by intention to treat. Results: No significant between-group differences were seen in naming or auditory comprehension in the Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment at four weeks and four months post randomization. The telerehabilitation group (n = 29) achieved a Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment repetition score of 8.9 points higher (P = 0.026) and a Verb and Sentence Test score 3 points higher (P = 0.002) than the control group (n = 27) four months postrandomization. Communicative Effectiveness Index was not significantly different between groups, but increased significantly within both groups. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Augmented telerehabilitation via videoconference may be a viable rehabilitation model for aphasia affecting language outcomes poststroke. A definitive trial with 230 participants is needed to confirm results.";2020;4
Objective: Rehabilitation of memory after stroke remains an unmet need. Telehealth delivery may overcome barriers to accessing rehabilitation services. Method: We conducted a non-randomized intervention trial to investigate feasibility and effectiveness of individual telehealth (internet videoconferencing) and face-to-face delivery methods for a six-week compensatory memory rehabilitation program. Supplementary analyses investigated non-inferiority to an existing group-based intervention, and the role of booster sessions in maintaining functional gains. The primary outcome measure was functional attainment of participants' goals. Secondary measures included subjective reports of lapses in everyday memory and prospective memory, reported use of internal and external memory strategies, and objective measures of memory functioning. Results: Forty-six stroke survivors were allocated to telehealth and face-to-face intervention delivery conditions. Feasibility of delivery methods was supported, and participants in both conditions demonstrated treatment-related improvements in goal attainment, and key subjective outcomes of everyday memory, and prospective memory. Gains on these measures were maintained at six-week follow-up. Short-term gains in use of internal strategies were also seen. Non-inferiority to group-based delivery was established only on the primary measure for the telehealth delivery condition. Booster sessions were associated with greater maintenance of gains on subjective measures of everyday memory and prospective memory. Conclusions: This exploratory study supports the feasibility and potential effectiveness of telehealth options for remote delivery of compensatory memory skills training after a stroke. These results are also encouraging of a role for booster sessions in prolonging functional gains over time.;2020;4
"Objective: Telerehabilitation has long been recognized as a promising means of providing pediatric services; however, significant barriers such as cost, payor reimbursement, and access prevented widespread use. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid adoption of telerehabilitation into clinical practice to provide access to care while maintaining social distancing. The purpose of this study is to present clinical data on the feasibility and acceptability of speech-language pathology, developmental occupational and physical therapies, and sports and orthopedic therapies telerehabilitation delivered in a pediatric hospital setting. Methods: Telerehabilitation services were rapidly implemented in three stages: building the foundation, implementing, and refining this service delivery model. Paper patient satisfaction surveys were administered as part of ongoing quality improvement efforts throughout 2019 and were adapted for online administration in 2020 for telerehabilitation patients. Outpatient visit counts by type (in-person, phone, and video) were extracted from the electronic medical record using data warehousing techniques. Results: Historical patient satisfaction rates from 2019 indicated high patient satisfaction (98.97% positive responses); these results were maintained for telerehabilitation visits (97.73%), indicating that families found telerehabilitation services acceptable. Patient volume returned to 73.5% of prepandemic volume after the implementation of telerehabilitation services. Conclusions: Pediatric telerehabilitation is feasible to provide in clinical settings, and the services are acceptable to patient families. Future work is needed to evaluate the impact of telerehabilitation services on patient care and applications for ongoing use of this delivery model.";2020;4
Objective: The purpose of this paper is to describe the rapid deployment of telehealth, particularly real time video conference, for chiropractic services as a response to COVID-19. Methods: Two health centers at 2 campuses of a large California corporation have chiropractic care integrated into physical medicine services. Care was suspended beginning on March 17, 2020 to prevent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among patients and staff. On March 19, the Governor of California issued a stay at home order. With musculoskeletal problems being common in the employee patient population, telehealth services were quickly developed to continue chiropractic care for patients. Using existing infrastructure, several members of the health center team developed chiropractic telehealth operations within 2 days. Results: Musculoskeletal telehealth services included examinations, risk assessment, advice, and rehabilitative exercises. These telehealth visits facilitated care that would have otherwise been unavailable to employees. Patients reported that the appointments were helpful, addressed their concerns, and provided a safe method to see their doctor. Regular interprofessional teamwork and relations between the clinic operator and client company were key contributors to operationalizing this service in our integrated healthcare environment. Conclusion: We were able to quickly implement real time video conferencing and other forms of telehealth for chiropractic services at 2 worksite health centers. This paper includes information and insights to providers about setting up similar telehealth systems so they may also provide this benefit for patients in their communities during pandemics or disasters.;2020;4
Objective: This paper reports a qualitative study of a home-based stroke telerehabilitation system. The telerehabilitation system delivers treatment sessions in the form of daily guided rehabilitation games, exercises, and stroke education in the patient's home. The aims of the current report are to investigate patient perceived benefits of and barriers to using the telerehabilitation system at home. Methods: We used a qualitative study design that involved in-depth semi-structured interviews with 13 participants who were patients in the subacute phase after stroke and had completed a six-week intervention using the home-based telerehabilitation system. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyze the data. Results: Participants mostly reported positive experiences with the telerehabilitation system. Benefits included observed improvements in limb functions, cognitive abilities, and emotional well-being. They also perceived the system easy to use due to the engaging experience and the convenience of conducting sessions at home. Meanwhile, participants pointed out the importance of considering technical support and physical environment at home. Further, family members' support helped them sustain in their rehabilitation. Finally, adjusting difficulty levels and visualizing patients' rehabilitation progress might help them in continued use of the telerehabilitation system. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation systems can be used as an efficient and user-friendly tool to deliver home-based stroke rehabilitation that enhance patients' physical recovery and mental and social-emotional wellbeing. Such systems need to be designed to offer engaging experience, display of recovery progress, and flexibility of schedule and location, with consideration of facilitating and social factors.;2020;4
Objective: This study was designed to explore the perceptions of Nigerian physiotherapists about tele-physiotherapy. Methods: Focus group discussions (FGDs) were used to collect data. Two FGDs, involving six purposively selected physiotherapists from health institutions in Ibadan, Nigeria were conducted. The FGD was moderated using a focus guide and probes were used until data reached a point of saturation. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: Four themes (Knowledge, sources of information, feedback and usability and benefits) were generated. Participants reported that tele-physiotherapy is similar to telemedicine and it involves the use of modern communication facilities. Their sources of information were majorly from seminars, colleagues and published scientific articles. They reported that tele-physiotherapy helps to improve access to healthcare services especially in circumstances where physical access to health care facilities is limited and it is effective. Inadequate infrastructures, internet fraud, quackery, lack of confidentiality could limit the use of tele-physiotherapy in Nigeria. Conclusion: Physiotherapists in Nigeria have a positive perception about the practice of physiotherapy at a distance. It is hoped that this translates to the implementation of tele-physiotherapy in Nigeria clinical practice. However, investment in critical infrastructure is needed to transform its potential into a credible source of physiotherapy service.;2020;4
"Objective: To compare participation and subjective experience of participants in both home-based multiuser virtual reality (VR) therapy and home-based single-user (SU) VR therapy. Design: Crossover, randomized trial. Setting: Initial training and evaluations occurred in a rehabilitation hospital; the interventions took place in participants' homes. Participants: Survivors of stroke with chronic upper extremity impairment (N=20). Interventions: Four weeks of in-home treatment using a custom, multiuser virtual reality system (VERGE): 2 weeks of both multiuser (MU) and SU versions of VERGE. The order of presentation of SU and MU versions was randomized such that participants were divided into 2 groups, First MU and First SU. Main Outcome Measures: We measured arm displacement during each session (m) as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include time participants spent using each MU and SU VERGE and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scores. Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery After Stroke Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) score and compliance with prescribed training were also evaluated. Measures were recorded before, midway, and after the treatment. Activity and movement were measured during each training session. Results: Arm displacement during a session was significantly affected the mode of therapy (MU: 414.6m, SU: 327.0m, P = .019). Compliance was very high (99% compliance for MU mode and 89% for SU mode). Within a given session, participants spent significantly more time training in the MU mode than in the SU mode (P= .04). FMA-UE score improved significantly across all participants (Delta 3.2, P=.001). Conclusions: Multiuser VR exercises may provide an effective means of extending clinical therapy into the home.

"Objectives Determine if outpatient physiotherapy care via telerehabilitation is as effective as in-person physiotherapy care after total hip replacement. Design Randomised, single-blind, controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial. Setting QEII Jubilee Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Participants Seventy patients receiving a total hip replacement entered the study, sixty-nine completed the study. Interventions The control group (n = 35; (x) over bar age 67; female 60%) received in-person outpatient physiotherapy and a paper-based home exercise programme. The intervention group (n = 35; (x) over bar age 62; female 66%) received remotely delivered telerehabilitation directly into their homes and a technology-based home exercise program using an iPad application. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the quality of life subscale of the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score measured at six weeks post-operatively. Secondary outcomes included objective strength and balance outcomes, self-reported function and satisfaction outcomes, and home exercise program compliance. Results No between group difference was detected in the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score quality of life subscale at the primary end point of six weeks (P = 0 .970). Strength, balance and self-reported function showed no between group differences. Overall satisfaction was high across both groups, with the intervention group scoring higher for ease of attending appointments (intervention 95 (10), control 86 (18), mean difference 9 (95% CI 2 to 16), P= 0.017. The intervention group were more compliant with their home exercise programme (intervention 86% (20%), control 74% (26%), mean difference 12% (95% CI 1% to 23%), P = 0.048). Conclusions Telerehabilitation programmes can be delivered to total hip replacement patients in their own homes, using readily available technology while maintaining high levels of satisfaction. More importantly, telerehabilitation patients appear to achieve non-inferior physical and functional outcomes as those receiving in-person rehabilitation programmes.

Objectives In the past decade, with the ever-increasing growth of information and communication technologies, telerehabilitation, especially home-based rehabilitation (HBR), has been widely considered by researchers. Many software systems are developed to address HBR programs, which includes various functionalities. The aim of this study is to review the functional features of these systems designed for remote supervising of HBR programs. Methods Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and ProQuest databases were searched for English-language articles published between January 2008 and February 2018 to retrieve studies reported an home-based telerehabilitation software system aiming to remotely supervise HBR program. Results A total of fifty studies that reported twenty-two unique systems met the inclusion criteria. Various functional features were identified including but not limited to exercise plan management, report/statistics generating, patient education, and task scheduling. Disorders or diseases addressed by these systems could mainly be grouped into five categories: musculoskeletal, neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, and other health-related problems. Usability and acceptability, and clinical/patient outcomes were the most reported outcomes and data analysis was used by the majority of included studies to measure the outcomes. Conclusions Systems developed for supervising of HBR program are diverse. However, preliminary results of this review revealed that these systems share more or less common functionalities. However, further research is needed to determine the requirements, structure, and effectiveness of these systems in real-life settings.;2020;4
Objectives To systematically review qualitative studies reporting the use of virtual consultations within an orthopaedic rehabilitation setting and to understand how its use changes the work required of patients. Methods Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement, we conducted a systematic review of papers to answer the research question 'How do changes in the work of being a patient when using communication technology influence patient preferences?' Electronic databases were searched for studies meeting the inclusion criteria in April 2020. Results The search strategy identified 2057 research articles from the database search. A review of titles and abstracts using the inclusion criteria yielded 21 articles for full-text review. Nine studies were included in the final analysis. Six studies explored real-time video conferencing and three explored telephone consultations. The use of communication technology changes the work required of patients. Such changes will impact on expectations for care, resources required of patients, the environment of receiving care and patient-clinician interactions. This adjustment of the work required of patients who access orthopaedic rehabilitation using communication technology will impact on their experience of receiving care. It is proposed that changes in the work of being a patient will influence preferences for or against the use of communication technology consultations for orthopaedic rehabilitation. Conclusion We found that the use of communication technology changes the work of being a patient. The change in work required of patients can be both burdensome (it makes it harder for patients to access their care) and beneficial (it makes it easier for patients to access their care). This change will likely to influence preferences. Keeping the concept of patient work at the heart of pathway redesign is likely to be a key consideration to ensure successful implementation.

Objectives: EHealth interventions are increasingly being applied in perioperative care but have not been adequately studied for older surgical patients who could potentially benefit from them. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility of perioperative eHealth interventions for this population. Design: A systematic review of prospective observational and interventional studies was conducted. Three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL) were searched between January 1999 and July 2019. Study quality was assessed by Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) with and without control group. Setting and Participants: Studies of surgical patients with an average age >= 65 years undergoing any perioperative eHealth intervention with active patient participation (with the exception of telerehabilitation following orthopedic surgery) were included. Measures: The main outcome measure was feasibility, defined as a patient's perceptions of usability, satisfaction, and/or acceptability of the intervention. Other outcomes included compliance and study completion rate. Results: Screening of 1569 titles and abstracts yielded 7 single-center prospective studies with 223 patients (range n = 9-69 per study, average age 66-74 years) undergoing oncological, cardiovascular, or orthopedic surgery. The median MINORS scores were 13.5 of 16 for 6 studies without control group, and 14 of 24 for 1 study with a control group. Telemonitoring interventions were rated as easy to use by 89% to 95% of participants in 3 studies. Patients in 3 studies were satisfied with the eHealth intervention and would recommend it to others. Acceptability (derived from consent rate) ranged from 71% to 89%, compliance from 53% to 86%, and completion of study follow-up from 54% to 95%. Conclusions and Implications: Results of 7 studies involving perioperative eHealth interventions suggest their feasibility and encourage further development of technologies for older surgical patients. Future feasibility studies require clear definitions of appropriate feasibility outcome measures and a comprehensive description of patient characteristics such as functional performance, level of education, and socioeconomic status.

"Objectives: Telephone use correlates with quality of life, and is one of the most important expectations of cochlear implant candidates. The aim of the present study was to assess the benefit of a progressive intensive 18-session training program, conducted by telephone in cochlear implant recipients. Material and methods: Nine cochlear-implanted adults underwent telerehabilitation focused on telephone use, with before-and-after assessment of: auditory performance, on Lafon monosyllabic words and MBAA sentences in quiet, cocktail-party noise and by phone; telephone use, on ad-hoc surveys and number of calls per week; and quality of life on ERSA and APHAB questionnaires. Results: Before training, monosyllabic word comprehension was poorer by telephone than by direct voice (64 +/- 5.7% vs. 26 +/- 5.3%; P< 0.05). After the 6-week training, there was improvement in the note taking telephone message task (85.0 +/- 3.7 vs. 50.0 +/- 9.0 out of 100; P< 0.001), daily phone use (57.0 +/- 4.3 vs. 29 +/- 5.4 out of 100; P < 0.0001), and number of calls in the week before assessment (0.0 +/- 0.0 vs. 11.0 +/- 3.0; P<0.0001). Conclusions: A progressive intensive training program by telephone improved phone use in the daily life of cochlear-implanted adults. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

"Objectives: There is limited research on the use of telerehabilitation platforms in service delivery for people with acquired brain injury (ABI), especially technologies that support delivery of services into the home. This qualitative study aimed to explore the perspectives of rehabilitation coordinators, individuals with ABI, and family caregivers on the usability and acceptability of videoconferencing (VC) in community-based rehabilitation. Participants' experiences and perceptions of telerehabilitation and their impressions of a particular VC system were investigated. Methods: Guided by a theory on technology acceptance, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 participants from a community-based ABI service, including 13 multidisciplinary rehabilitation coordinators, 9 individuals with ABI, and 8 family caregivers. During the interview, they were shown a paper prototype of a telehealth portal for VC that was available for use. Interview transcripts were coded by two researchers and analysed thematically. Results: The VC was used on average for 2% of client consultations. Four major themes depicted factors influencing the uptake of VC platforms; namely, the context or impetus for use, perceived benefits, potential problems and parameters around use, and balancing the service and user needs. Participants identified beneficial uses of VC in service delivery and strategies for promoting a positive user experience. Conclusions: Perceptions of the usability of VC to provide services in the home were largely positive; however, consideration of use on a case-by-case basis and a trial implementation was recommended to enhance successful uptake into service delivery.";2020;4
"Objectives: To investigate the feasibility and acceptability of telemedicine as a substitute for outpatient services in emergency situations such as the sudden surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Design: Observational cohort study with historical control. Setting: Tertiary referral outpatient institute. Participants: Consecutive services provided to patients with spinal disorders (N=1207). Interventions: Telemedicine services included teleconsultations and telephysiotherapy, and lasted as long as usual interventions. They were delivered using free teleconference apps, caregivers were actively involved, and interviews and counseling were performed as usual. Teleconsultations included standard, but adapted, measurements and evaluations by video and from photographs and videos sent in advance according to specific tutorials. During telephysiotherapy, new sets of exercises were defined and recorded as usual. Main Outcome Measures: We compared the number of services provided in 3 phases, including corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. During the control (30 working d) and COVID-19 surge (13d) only usual consultations and physiotherapy were provided; during the telemed phase (15d), only teleconsultations and telephysiotherapy were provided. If a reliable medical decision was not possible during teleconsultations, usual face-to-face interventions were prescribed. Continuous quality improvement questionnaires were also evaluated. Results: During telemed, 325 teleconsulations and 882 telephysiotherapy sessions were provided in 15 days. We found a rapid decrease (-39%) of outpatient services from the control to the COVID- 19 phase (R-2=0.85), which partially recovered in the telemed phase for telephysiotherapy (from -37% to -21%; P<.05) and stabilized for teleconsultation (from -55% to -60%) interventions. Usual face-to-face interventions were required for 0.5% of patients. Patients' satisfaction with telemedicine was very high (2.8 out of 3). Conclusions: Telemedicine is feasible and allows medical professionals to continue providing outpatient services with a high level of patient satisfaction. During the current pandemic, this experience can provide a viable alternative for many outpatient services while reducing the need for travel and face-to-face contact to a minimum.

"One of the major consequences of stroke impairments is hemiparesis, which affects activities of daily living and contributes sedentary lifestyle. The purpose of this study was evaluation of the effectiveness of home-based exercise rehabilitation incentive on daily living activities and functional capacity among acute ischemic patients. This randomized controlled trial was done from August 2017 to September 2018. Iranian subjects with unilateral ischemic stroke were recruited from inpatient wards at educational hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to the home-based rehabilitation program (intervention group) or usual care (control group). National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index Score (BI), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), and Fugl-Meyer Upper and Lower Extremity Sensorimotor Score were evaluated in both groups at baseline and 3 months later. Intervention group received home-based rehabilitation exercise program for 3 months. Control group did not receive home-based rehabilitation program and incentive telephone call. All data were collected and analyzed by SPSS software (Version 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois) using chi-square test to compare demographic variables, and independent and paired t-tests to between- and within-group assessment, respectively. Forty ischemic stroke patients (20 intervention group and 20 control group) were examined. Results showed BI, Fugl-Meyer Upper and Lower Extremity Score, and MRS score in the interventional group were significantly higher than the control group after 3-month home-based exercise rehabilitation (p < .001). Providing a home rehabilitation program in this study resulted in a motor recovery on ischemic stroke survivors in the acute phase of recovery. This was assumed to be cost-effective intervention in low-income countries";2020;4
"Owing to the population aging and a change in life patterns, the number of stroke incidents in China has increased dramatically with three million new occurrences every year. While the demand for rehabilitation services in China is enormous, the existing rehabilitation resources are not only disparately distributed but also unable to cope with the ever-increasing number of patients. In this paper, we present a study that focuses on a long-term limb function recovery program that uses a wearable body area network (WBAN) for in-home people with stroke discharged from hospital. The investigation lasted for 60 weeks and involved 12 people with stroke sparsely located in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province, China. These patients, who were all within their first 3 months from stroke event, were evenly and randomly split into the experiment group and the control group. The Brunnstrom Stage (BS) and the Mobility Index (MI) were used to monitor the patients' recovery processes. The results demonstrated that the patients from the experimental group had experienced a steady increase in MI throughout the program. They also had improved BS by at least one stage, which outperformed the control group in average. This longitudinal efficacy investigation indicates that the supported in-home rehabilitation system has the potential to reduce the cost and the effort for patients and doctors while still maintaining the quality and effectiveness of rehabilitation; hence could be a possible solution in alleviating the great stress that the healthcare system is currently experiencing in China nationwide.";2020;4
"Parkinson's disease (PD) often leads to multifactorial motor and non-motor disabilities with resultant social restrictions. Continuity of care in this pathology, including a tailored home rehabilitation, is crucial to improve or maintain the quality of life for patients. The aim of this multicenter study was to test in a pilot sample of PD patients the efficiency and efficacy of the Human Empowerment Aging and Disability (HEAD) program. The virtual reality HEAD program was administered in two consecutive phases: (1) in clinic (ClinicHEAD, 12 45-minutes sessions, 3 sessions/week); (2) at home (HomeHEAD, 60 45-minutes sessions, 5 sessions/week). Thirty-one PD outpatients were enrolled [mean age (SD) = 66.84 (9.13)]. All patients performed ClinicHEAD, and after allocation (ratio 1:2) were assigned to the HomeHEAD or the Usual Care (UC) group. Motor, cognitive and behavioral outcome measures were assessed at enrollment (T0), at hospital discharge (T1), at 4 (T2) and 7 (T3) months after baseline. After ClinicHEAD (T1 vs. T0 comparison) a significant (p< 0.05) improvement in functional mobility, balance, upper limb mobility, global cognitive function, memory, quality of life and psychological well-being was observed. After the HomeHEAD intervention there was an additional enhancement for upper limb mobility. At T3 follow-up, the UC group that did not continue the HEAD program at home showed a worsening with respect to the HomeHEAD group in balance and functional mobility. Furthermore, in the HomeHEAD group, a positive association was observed between adherence, mental and physical health (SF-12). A trend was also registered between adherence and positive affect. The digital health patient-tailored rehabilitation program resulted in improving motor and non-motor abilities and quality of life in clinical setting, enhancing the motor function in telerehabilitation at home, and maintaining the non-motor abilities and quality of life at follow-up. In the near future, people with PD can be supported also at home with individualized rehabilitation strategies for a better quality of life and wellbeing along with lower costs for society.";2020;4
Parkinson's disease is incurable and progressive impairment of movement. The physical activity combined with adequate exercises may improve motor capacity and delay the onset of activity limitation. European Physiotherapy Guideline for Parkinson's Disease recommend strategies aimed to change behavior by facilitating intrinsic motivation. Telerehabilitation system which combines self-management of people with Parkinson's disease (PWP) with ongoing supervision by a physiotherapist and/or neurologist can improve the quality of treatment of PWP and promote the individual approach of the therapist to the patient. In this paper, we describe the idea and realization of the core of such system, termed Patient Station, i.e. the platform to communicate between PWP and physiotherapist and/or neurologist. The system allows: (a) the assessment of the patient's health state, (b) scheduling exercises, (c) assisting the patient when performing prescribed exercises, (d) controlling the execution of the schedule by PWP, (e) assessment the effectiveness of the rehabilitation, (f) supplying the documentation. The patient's side of the system is based on smartphone application and inertial measurement units, communicating with a smartphone via Bluetooth connected with the therapist's side by the internet-based database.;2020;4
"Patient portals (PPs) foster engagement and self-management of chronic disease and are emerging as extensions of the care continuum. Utilisation from a health service delivery perspective is growing; however, it is a relatively new model of care in the field of rehabilitation. This pilot, within a larger randomised controlled stroke rehabilitation trial, explored the feasibility and acceptance of secure messaging using an established nationwide PP system for e-visits. Fifteen participants with stroke-related arm disability were randomised to 6 weeks of home arm telerehabilitation. All were over the age of 60 and 73% lived with a spouse or significant other. Mean intervention time was 6.8 weeks, and participants sent 2.3 +/- 1.4 messages per week to complete 15.1 h of reported therapy (prescribed therapy = 18 h). Portal use improved therapist efficiency and resulted in a 1:6 therapist to patient exercise time ratio compared with the conventional 1:1 ratio for in-person therapy. Low initial electronic health literacy, self-efficacy or cognitive scores did not prohibit utilisation, and satisfaction with secure messaging for patient-therapist communication was 3.5 +/- 1.2 out of 5. Overall, PP-supported e-visits were a feasible and acceptable telerehabilitation care delivery method for this chronic stroke population.";2020;4
"Patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) increasingly use online services for managing their healthcare. The objective of this study was to investigate web log data (weblogs) generated by PwMS in the process of web-based telerehabilitation and correlate them with rehabilitation progress. The weblogs from 17 patients (female: 15, male 2; mean age: 60.1 +/- 11.4 years) were tracked for an average period of 153.6 +/- 38.3 days with the total number of log events and page visit records of 1,457 and 37,030, respectively. The time and frequency of patients' web visits were investigated as well as their adherence to prescribed exercise regimen. Rehabilitation progress was gauged by changes in quality of life, mobility, and sleep ascertained by measuring MSQOL, 2MWT and PSQI respectively. The changes in these metrics were correlated with system usage patterns. On average, PwMS visited 30 pages a day for 26.5 minutes, with a single login amounting for 27 pages in duration of 22.0 minutes. The average exercise program comprised 6.9 sets and 29.1 repetitions with average set and repetition completion rates of 46.5% and 72.6% respectively. A statistically significant association has been found between time spent in the online exercise mode and clinical improvements. The results of the study demonstrate that the patients had more pronounced outcome improvements when they increased the time of using the telerehabilitation system for home-based exercise. The results of this study could contribute to the development of more efficient home-based telerehabilitation systems.";2020;4
"People who survive a stroke usually suffer movement disorders resulting in involuntary abnormal movements. Intensive and repetitive physiotherapy is often a key to functional restoration of movements. Rehabilitation centers have recently offered balance training supported by exergames in addition to conventional therapy. The primary objective was to investigate different types of balance training (multi-exergaming and conventional) in addition to a conventional 6-week physiotherapy program. Furthermore, we examined the choice of an appropriate exergame to target balance training. We designed a randomized pilot trial. Hospital inpatients with stroke aged 33-65 were recruited and randomized into 2 groups by drawing lots; a control group receiving 1 week of conventional balance training and an exergaming group 1 week of multiple-game exergaming, comprising single leg exercises, weight shifting, balancing and standing up. Center of pressure was monitored for the exergaming group and clinical data were collected (non-blinded assessment) using Four Square Step Test, Timed Up and Go, 10 m Walk Test, Romberg, Sharpened Romberg, Clinical Test for Sensory Interaction in Balance in both groups. Statistical tests were used to find significant (p < 0.05) differences and Cohen's U3 for effect sizes. Recruited participants (20/30) met the inclusion criteria and were randomized; 10 per group. 1 participant of the exergaming group was excluded from center of pressure analysis. Both groups demonstrated substantively and statistically significant improvements of functional balance, in particular the exergaming group (FSST p = 0.009, U3 = 0.9 and 10 MWT p = 0.008, U3 = 0.9). However, significant differences between the groups were found in tests with eyes closed, Sharpened Romberg test (p = 0.05) and standing on the right leg (p = 0.035). The center of pressure area decreased up to 20% for the exergaming group. Both types of additional balance training demonstrated comparable outcomes, however, the multi-exergaming could target specific motor control disorders by the selection of exergames according to Gentile's taxonomy. We may not prioritize exergaming due to the low statistical power of clinical outcomes. However, exergaming enables independent balance training, which is feasible without strenuous physiotherapy and may thus be crucial for future home or telerehabilitation services.";2020;4
Pervasive health technologies can increase the effectiveness of personal health monitoring and training, but more user studies are necessary to understand the interest for these technologies, and how they should be designed and implemented. In the present study, we evaluated eWALL, a user-centered pervasive health technology consisting of a platform that monitors users' physical and cognitive behavior, providing feedback and motivation via an easy-to-use, touch-based user interface. The eWALL was placed for one month in the home of 48 subjects with a chronic condition (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-COPD or mild cognitive impairment-MCI) or with an age-related impairment. User acceptance, platform use, and potential clinical effects were evaluated using surveys, data logs, and clinical scales. Although some features of the platform need to be improved before reaching technical maturity and making a difference in patients' lives, the real-life evaluation of eWALL has shown how some features may influence patients' intention to use this promising technology. Furthermore, this study made it clear how the free use of different health apps is modulated by the real needs of the patient and by their usefulness in the context of the patient's clinical status.;2020;4
Physiotherapy is a labor-intensive process that has become increasingly inaccessible. Existing telehealth solutions overcome many of the logistical problems, but they are cumbersome to re-calibrate for the various exercises involved. To facilitate self-exercise efficiently, we developed a framework for personalized physiotherapy exercises. Our approach eliminates the need to re-calibrate for different exercises, using only few user-specific demonstrations available during collocated therapy. Two types of augmented feedback are available to the user for self-correction. The framework's utility was demonstrated for the sit-to-stand task, an important activity of daily living. Although further testing is necessary, our results suggest that the framework can be generalized to the learning of arbitrary motor behaviors.</p>;2020;4
Purpose of Review The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), is rising as the global population ages. Access to specialist care, which improves outcomes, is insufficient and disease-related disability makes in-person physician visits burdensome. Telehealth is one potential means for improving access to care. The purpose of this manuscript is to review recent publications on telemedicine in AD and PD. Recent Findings Telemedicine is feasible in AD and PD and acceptable to patients and their caregivers. Compared with in-person visits, telemedicine reduces visit-associated travel and time. Telemedicine can be used for rehabilitative therapies, to administer cognitive tests, and to support caregivers. Access to telemedicine results in changes in patient care including medication adjustments and referrals for therapies and supports. The use of telemedicine in AD and PD stands to decrease burden on patients and increases access to specialty care. Barriers to the expansion of telemedicine care include lack of widespread broadband access, state licensure requirements, and inconsistent reimbursement. More outcome-based prospective telemedicine studies are needed.;2020;4
Purpose of Review The purpose of this review is to contextualize the topic of patient engagement in orthopedic surgery. There will be a specific focus on patient engagement platforms and the impact on outcomes and orthopedic clinical workflows. Recent Findings In an attempt to engage patients and optimize the orthopedic perioperative surgical home, patient engagement platforms have emerged in the form of portals, mobile health applications, and chatbots. Collectively, these platforms have improved patient satisfaction scores and outcomes. Patient portals, mobile health applications, and chatbots can engage orthopedic patients and improve the effectiveness of the perioperative orthopedic surgical home. There are specific differences in these applications that should be noted and accounted for. When deciding to incorporate one of these systems into your practice, it is paramount to identify what you are looking to improve upon within your health system and choose a platform accordingly.;2020;4
Purpose of review To outline recent applications of e-health data and digital tools for improving the care and management of healthcare for people with multiple sclerosis. Recent findings The digitization of most clinical data, along with developments in communication technologies, miniaturization of sensors and computational advances are enabling aggregation and clinically meaningful analyses of real-world data from patient registries, digital patient-reported outcomes and electronic health records (EHR). These data are allowing more confident descriptions of prognoses for multiple sclerosis patients and the long-term relative benefits and safety of disease-modifying treatments (DMT). Registries allow detailed, multiple sclerosis-specific data to be shared between clinicians more easily, provide data needed to improve the impact of DMT and, with EHR, characterize clinically relevant interactions between multiple sclerosis and other diseases. Wearable sensors provide continuous, long-term measures of performance dynamics in relevant ecological settings. In conjunction with telemedicine and online apps, they promise a major expansion of the scope for patients to manage aspects of their own care. Advances in disease understanding, decision support and self-management using these Big Data are being accelerated by machine learning and artificial intelligence. Both health professionals and patients can employ e-health approaches and tools for development of a more patient-centred learning health system.;2020;4
Purpose Since the state of alarm was decreed in Spain on 14 March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an extraordinary impact in paediatric hospitals. This study shows the effect of the pandemic on our practice in paediatric orthopaedics in a referral third level paediatric hospital. Methods We performed a single-centre retrospective review of the official census from a third level paediatric hospital from 14 March to 14 April for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Results The patients seen in our clinic during this period in 2020 decreased in by 82% (p < 0.001) compared with 2018 and 2019, however, the number of telemedicine consultations increased by 90.21% (p < 0.001). The total number of patients attending the clinic (including onsite and virtual) was reduced by 54.25% (p < 0.001). The total surgeries performed plummeted by 81% in this period in 2020 (p < 0.001) due to a reduction in elective cases of 94.6% (p < 0.001). No significant decrease was found in the number of urgent surgical cases per day in 2020 (p = 0.34). Finally, the number of orthopaedic patients admitted to our emergency department dropped by 78.6% during the state of alarm (p < 0.001). Conclusion According to our results, the pandemic has significantly affected our daily practice by decreasing elective surgeries and onsite clinics, but other activities have increased. As we have implemented telemedicine and new technologies to adapt to this setback, we should take advantage of the situation to change our practice in the future to better allocate our health resources and to anticipate outbreaks.

Purpose: Prolonged wait times for total hip and knee arthroplasty have deleterious effects on functional status for the awaiting patients. Telerehabilitation interventions can optimize the delivery of perioperative care. This pilot single-blind randomized controlled trial evaluates the feasibility and the potential impact on pain and disability of a telerehabilitation prehabilitation program, compared to in-person prehabilitation or usual care. Material and methods: Thirty-four patients awaiting a total hip or knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to (1) an in-person 12-week prehabilitation program, (2) a tele-prehabilitation program or (3) usual care. Outcomes were feasibility, patients' acceptance and compliance to the program, the LEFS, the WOMAC, SF-36, the Self-Pace Walk, the Stair Test, the Timed Up and Go, and a Global Rating of Change scale. Outcomes were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks. Results: Participants reported excellent satisfaction toward tele-prehabilitation. Compliance with the programs was high. No significant differences between groups were found for self-reported outcomes after the prehabilitation program (p >= 0.05). Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that tele-prehabilitation can be feasible using commercially available mobile technologies with patients awaiting total hip or knee arthroplasty, and can generate good satisfaction with this population. Further evaluation is warranted through a formal fully powered randomized controlled trial.;2020;4
"Purpose: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is often used for biofeedback during swallowing rehabilitation. However, commercially available sEMG electrodes are not optimized for the head and neck area, have rigid form, and are mostly available in large medical centers. We developed an ultrathin, soft, and flexible sEMG patch, specifically designed to conform to the submental anatomy and which will be ultimately incorporated into a telehealth system. To validate this first-generation sEMG patch, we compared its safety, efficiency, and signal quality in monitoring submental muscle activity with that of widely used conventional sEMG electrodes. Method: A randomized crossover design was used to compare the experimental sEMG patch with conventional (snap-on) sEMG electrodes. Participants completed the same experimental protocol with both electrodes in counterbalanced order. Swallow trials included five trials of 5- and 10-ml water. Comparisons were made on (a) signal-related factors: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), baseline amplitude, normalized mean amplitude, and sEMG burst duration and (b) safety/preclinical factors: safety/adverse effects, efficiency of electrode placement, and satisfaction/comfort. Noninferiority and equivalence tests were used to examine signal-related factors. Paired t tests and descriptive statistics were used to examine safety/preclinical factors. Results: Forty healthy adults participated (24 women, M-age = 67.5 years). Signal-related factors: SNR of the experimental patch was not inferior to the SNR of the conventional electrodes (p < .0056). Similarly, baseline amplitude obtained with the experimental patch was not inferior to that obtained with conventional electrodes (p < .0001). Finally, normalized amplitude values were equivalent across swallows (5 ml: p < .025; 10 ml: p < .0012), and sEMG burst duration was also equivalent (5 ml: p < .0001; 10 ml: p < .0001). Safety/preclinical factors: The experimental patch resulted in fewer mild adverse effects. Participant satisfaction was higher with the experimental patch (p = .0476, d = 0.226). Conclusions: Our new wearable sEMG patch is equivalent with widely used conventional sEMG electrodes in terms of technical performance. In addition, our patch is safe, and healthy older adults are satisfied with it. With lessons learned from the current COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to develop optimal swallowing telerehabilitation devices are more urgent than ever. Upon further validation, this new technology has the potential to improve rehabilitation and telerehabilitation efforts for patients with dysphagia.

Purpose: Telerehabilitation (TR) is increasingly being used to meet the rehabilitation needs of individuals living in rural areas. Nevertheless, reports on TR implementation for rural patients remain limited. As part of a broader evaluation, this study investigated barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a national TR program to meet the needs of rural Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients. Methods: This study applied a qualitative approach to the RE-AIM framework to investigate barriers and facilitators impacting TR implementation. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with ten program managers and medical directors within the VHA at three time points during the first 18 months of implementation. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were identified describing key cultural, infrastructural and logistical, and environmental barriers impacting the reach, adoption, and implementation of TR. Within the themes, facilitators for TR were also identified to include, allowing providers flexibility in implementing TR, mentorship and development of creative approaches to TR training, overcoming infrastructural and logistical TR barriers through championing, and continuous sharing of lessons learned in a community of practice. Discussion: This study explicates salient barriers and facilitators encountered during the first 18 months of implementation of a TR program within a national healthcare system in the United States. Implementing TR to meet the rehabilitation needs of Veterans in resource-limited rural environments requires creative approaches and flexibility, as well as perseverance and consistent championing in order to overcome cultural challenges. This, in combination with infrastructural challenges, such as lack of broadband, adds greater complexity to meeting the needs of rural patients. This study provides new and in-depth understanding of the processes by which TR is implemented in a large healthcare system and points to practical real-world lessons in implementing TR for rural patients.;2020;4
"Purpose: There is a rapid growth of telepractice in both clinical and research settings; however, the literature validating translation of traditional methods of assessments and interventions to valid remote videoconference administrations is limited. This is especially true in the field of speech-language pathology where assessments of language and communication can be easily conducted via remote administration. The aim of this study was to validate videoconference administration of the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R). Method: Twenty adults with chronic aphasia completed the assessment both in person and via videoconference with the order counterbalanced across administrations. Specific modifications to select WAB-R subtests were made to accommodate interaction by computer and Internet. Results: Results revealed that the two methods of administration were highly correlated and showed no difference in domain scores. Additionally, most participants endorsed being mostly or very satisfied with the videoconference administration. Conclusion: These findings suggest that administration of the WAB-R in person and via videoconference may be used interchangeably in this patient population. Modifications and guidelines are provided to ensure reproducibility and access to other clinicians and scientists interested in remote administration of the WAB-R.";2020;4
Purpose: This scoping review synthesizes research on the effects and processes of telehealth wheelchair and seating assessment and the perceptions of wheelchair users and healthcare providers of telehealth use for this purpose. Materials and Methods: A systematic search and scoping review of peer-reviewed publications and theses was undertaken on telehealth AND wheelchair assessment. Five databases were searched. Data extraction and synthesis followed the process outlined by Arksey and O'Malley for scoping reviews. Results: From an initial 1801 publications, nine studies published in 13 documents met the inclusion criteria. Study quality and study design varied considerably. The effect of telehealth compared to in-person assessment was insignificant (n = 2) indicating equivocal effectiveness. Telehealth assessment improved accessibility for some wheelchair users (n = 1). However, the process of telehealth that was applied to wheelchair assessment was inadequately described in all studies. It appeared that each stakeholder group appraised telehealth based on different criteria including accessibility, professional supportiveness and technical accuracy. No studies examined funder views. Conclusions: Preliminary research suggests telehealth wheelchair assessment may be as effective as in-person assessment, is viewed favorably by wheelchair users and nonspecialist assessors, while expert assessors have some hesitations. However the strength of evidence is weak indicating the need for further research.;2020;4
"Purpose: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Howz smart home system for stroke survivors. Materials: Howz uses smart home technology to monitor users' activity in the home and machine learning algorithms to detect when their activity changes. This information made available to the user and a named contact (usually a family member) via the Howz app. If activity changes, an alert is then sent to the user and the named contact. Methods: Howz was installed in the homes of 19 stroke survivors who lived alone. The sensors installed; the number and nature of alerts; adverse events; any technical difficulties and how Howz was used were recorded. We also interviewed participants and their named contacts about their views and experiences of using Howz eight weeks after installation. Results: Installation was effective; no technological problems or adverse events were reported. All participants chose alerts regarding getting up and activity during the day and at night. There was a mean of 1.1 (sd 1.2) alerts/person. Participants found the system unobtrusive and were positive about it. They found it easy to use and would recommend it to others with stroke. The most frequently reported benefit was that Howz gave peace of mind for the users and/or the family/named contact that help would be at hand if needed. Conclusions: The Howz system was feasible and acceptable for stroke survivors. It gave users and their family an enhanced sense of security and peace of mind that help would be at hand if needed. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Although most stroke survivors are elderly and often suffer physical, visual and cognitive disabilities which are often considered as barriers to using smart home technology, this project has demonstrated the well-developed smart home technology is feasible and acceptable. Users were able and willing to engage with the technology (to varying degrees) and had no concerns about invasion of privacy. The main benefit of the Howz system is an enhanced sense of security for the user and their family that help is at hand if needed.";2020;4
Purpose: To describe the characteristics and effectiveness of pediatric telerehabilitation interventions offered to children 0-12 years old or to their families. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on randomized control trials published between 2007 and 2018 involving at least one rehabilitation professional who provided services remotely. Information was extracted about key study, participants and intervention characteristics. The percentage of outcomes that improved were computed per study, and per intervention characteristic. Results: Out of 4472 screened articles, 23 were included. Most studies were published after 2016 and evaluated outcomes related to the child's behavior (n = 12, 52.2%) or to the parent (n = 10, 43.5%), such as parental skills or stress. Overall, 56.1% (SD: 38.5%) of evaluated outcomes improved following telerehabilitation. A great diversity of population and teleintervention characteristics was observed. Effective interventions tended to target parents, centered around an exercise program, used a coaching approach, focused on improving children's behavioral functioning, lasted >8 weeks and were offered at least once a week. Conclusions: Intervention characteristics that appear to yield better outcomes should inform the development of future telerehabilitation studies, especially in populations for whom telerehabilitation is currently understudied (e.g., children's with physical functioning difficulties). Future trials should compare telerehabilitation interventions to well-described evidence-based face-to-face interventions, and document their cost-effectiveness.;2020;4
"Purpose: Upper limb hemiparesis is the most common impairment in stroke survivors, and adequate assessment is crucial for setting the rehabilitation strategy and monitoring the effect of treatment. However, adequate timely assessments are difficult due to the limited accessibility to clinics for stroke survivors. We designed this study to investigate whether teleassessments for motor impairments of the spastic elbow (i.e., passive range of motion (PROM), muscle strength, and spasticity) are feasible in stroke survivors. Methods: To implement a telerobotic system for remote assessment with physical interaction, we constructed a system with a master robot interacting with a doctor (assessor) and a slave robot interacting with the elbow of a subject with stroke. The master robot is operated by the doctor, where the torque and the speed are transferred to the slave robot via the Internet, and the reaction of the patient's elbow to the slave robot's movement is measured with a torque sensor, then finally transferred back to the master robot. An intercontinental remote assessment, which is considered one of the worst possible scenarios, was used as a clinical test to strictly check the feasibility. For the clinical tests, the examiner for the teleassessment was located at a lab in the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) while the stroke patients were located at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Bundang, Kyeonggido, South Korea). Results: In total, 12 stroke patients' elbows (age range, 28-74; M:F = 6:6) were tested. For the PROM, the absolute difference between two assessments (in-person vs. remote) was 5.98 +/- 3.51 degrees on average (range, 0-11.2). The agreements for the strength and the spasticity of elbow flexor between in-person and remote assessments were substantial (k = 0.643) and fair (k = 0.308), respectively. No adverse events were observed during or immediately after the telerobotic assessment. Conclusions: Internet-based telerobotic remote assessment for motor impairment of spastic elbow in stroke using our system is feasible even in the worst setting, with too long of a distance and a delayed communication network.";2020;4
"Question: In people with bone and soft tissue injuries of the wrist, hand and/or fingers, do feedback-guided exercises performed on a tablet touchscreen hasten return to work, reduce healthcare usage and improve clinical recovery more than a home exercise program prescribed on paper? Design: Randomised, parallel-group trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: Seventy-four workers with limited functional ability due to bone and soft tissue injuries of the wrist, hand and/or fingers. Intervention: Participants in the experimental and control groups received the same in-patient physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Participants in the experimental group received a home exercise program using the ReHand tablet application, which guides exercises performed on a tablet touchscreen with feedback, monitoring and progression. Participants in the control group were prescribed an evidence-based home exercise program on paper. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was the time taken to return to work. Secondary outcomes included: healthcare usage (number of clinical appointments); and functional ability, pain intensity, and grip and pinch strength 2 and 4 weeks after randomisation. Results: Compared with the control group, the experimental group: returned to work sooner (MD -18 days, 95% CI -33 to -3); required fewer physiotherapy sessions (MD -7.4, 95% CI -13.1 to -1.6), rehabilitation consultations (MD -1.9, 95% CI -3.6 to 0.3) and plastic surgery consultations (MD -3.6, 95% CI -6.3 to -0.9); and had better short-term recovery of functional ability and pinch strength. Conclusion: In people with bone and soft-tissue injuries of the wrist, hand and/or fingers, prescribing a feedback-guided home exercise program using a tablet-based application instead of a conventional program on paper hastened return to work and improved the short-term recovery of functional ability and pinch strength, while reducing the number of required healthcare appointments.

"Rationale Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective, key standard treatment for people with COPD. Nevertheless, low participant uptake, insufficient attendance and high drop-out rates are reported. Investigation is warranted of the benefits achieved through alternative approaches, such as pulmonary tele-rehabilitation (PTR). Objective To investigate whether PTR is superior to conventional PR on 6 min walk distance (6MWD) and secondarily on respiratory symptoms, quality of life, physical activity and lower limb muscle function in patients with COPD and FEV1 <50% eligible for routine hospital-based, outpatient PR. Methods In this single-blinded, multicentre, superiority randomised controlled trial, patients were assigned 1:1 to 10 weeks of groups-based PTR (60 min, three times weekly) or conventional PR (90 min, two times weekly). Assessments were performed by blinded assessors at baseline, end of intervention and at 22 weeks' follow-up from baseline. The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. Measurements and main results The primary outcome was change in 6MWD from baseline to 10 weeks; 134 participants (74 females, mean +/- SD age 68 +/- 9 years, FEV1 33%+/- 9% predicted, 6MWD 327 +/- 103 metres) were included and randomised. The analysis showed no between-group differences for changes in 6MWD after intervention (9.2 metres (95% CI: -6.6 to 24.9)) or at 22 weeks' follow-up (-5.3 metres (95% CI: -28.9 to 18.3)). More participants completed the PTR intervention (n=57) than conventional PR (n=43) (chi(2) test p<0.01). Conclusion PTR was not superior to conventional PR on the 6MWD and we found no differences between groups. As more participants completed PTR, supervised PTR would be relevant to compare with conventional PR in a non-inferiority design.

Recent advancements in ICT have sped up the development of new services in healthcare. In this context, remote patient monitoring and rehabilitation activities can take place either in satellite hospital centers or directly in patients' homes. Specifically, using a combination of Cloud/Edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, patients with motor disabilities can be remotely assisted avoiding stressful waiting times and overcoming geographical barriers. This is possible by applying the Tele-Rehabilitation as a Service (TRaaS) concept. The objective of this paper is twofold: i) studying how Machine Learning can improve the TRaaS, and ii) demonstrating how a NoSQL graph database approach can enhance the performance because it works directly at the database layer instead of at application one. In particular, the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm is studied in order to identify the best therapy, i.e., rehabilitation training, for a new remote patient with motor impairment. Experiments compare two system prototypes, that are respectively based on Python and Neo4j, showing that the latter presents better performance in terms of processing time guaranteeing the same accuracy.;2020;4
Recently, a novel virus has spread worldwide causing the disease called COVID-19. In addition to putting people's lives at risk and causing mortality, various problems have occurred due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarantine, social distancing, and the obligation to use protective tools have led to sometimes long term closing of various jobs and services, including rehabilitation services. For instance, the disease has interrupted the provision of Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) services to children due to the need for face-to-face communication between Speech and Language Pathologists (SLPs) and children during the evaluation and treatment processes. Therefore, here, we described the quality of providing SLP services during the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative effects of the disease on the provision of SLP services. In addition, we made an attempt to explain concerns and problems raised by the families, the importance of providing SLP services during the critical period of speech and language development, telepractice services, the roles of speech-language-hearing related scientific associations, and the roles of SLPs during the outbreak of COVID-19.;2020;4
Recovering from a traumatic incident (e.g, a stroke) implies rigorous and demanding therapies to ensure recovery of the lost capabilities. Due to the lack of short-term visible results, stroke patients tend to lose interest in their recovery process and frequently do not follow their therapists' suggestions to continue performing their training at home, between physiotherapy sessions. This article explores the extent to which common computer games or specifically crafted games can serve as a rehabilitation practice, but also how conventional therapeutic devices might be transformed to be incorporated into games. Furthermore, we propose a platform that follows the opportunity of creating serious games that are designed for stroke patients with reduced upper limb mobility while following the same principles of common therapeutic procedures. This platform was carefully built with the purpose of allowing patients to comply tele-rehabilitation and promoting the execution of the recommended training at home. Following these ideas, we integrated two carefully designed games that have been tested and validated in our previous works, and we added a top-layer characterized by an online back-end application for therapists that allows them to observe their patients' progress over time and draw different conclusions.;2020;4
Reduced cost and increased proliferation of sensors has resulted in the generation of a large amount of data. To make use of this data effectively, efficient techniques for collecting, storing and managing data are needed. In this paper, we present a health big data indexing technique that allows for the efficient storage, querying and management of tele-rehabilitation related big data collected via health sensors connected to client machines accessing web-based e-Health frameworks. Our novel scheme is based on indexing of rehabilitation data based on the human body joint model. We further index the data based on other parameters that may be of interest to researchers such as ethnicity and geographical location. We have described all components of the system in brief.;2020;4
Rehabilitation has been shown to improve functional outcomes following total knee replacement (TKR). However, its delivery and associated costs are highly variable. The authors have developed and previously validated the accuracy of a remote (wearable) rehabilitation monitoring platform (interACTION). The present study's objective was to assess the feasibility of utilizing interACTION for the remote management of rehabilitation after TKR and to determine a preliminary estimate of the effects of the interACTION system on the value of rehabilitation. Specifically, we tested post-operative outpatient rehabilitation supplemented with interACTION (n = 13) by comparing it to a standard post-operative outpatient rehabilitation program (n = 12) using a randomized design. Attrition rates were relatively low and not significantly different between groups, indicating that participants found both interventions acceptable. A small (not statistically significant) decrease in the number of physical therapy visits was observed in the interACTION Group, therefore no significant difference in total cost could be observed. All patients and physical therapists in the interACTION Group indicated that they would use the system again in the future. Therefore, the next steps are to address the concerns identified in this pilot study and to expand the platform to include behavioral change strategies prior to conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial.

Rehabilitation of the upper limb is an important aspect of the therapy for people affected by neuromotor diseases for the recovery of the capability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Nonetheless, the costs associated with the administration of rehabilitation therapy and the increasing number of patients highlight the need for new solutions. Technology-based solutions and, in particular, telerehabilitation could strongly impact in this field. In this paper, a new system based on radiofrequency (RF) technology is presented which is able to effectively provide home-based telerehabilitation and extract meaningful information on the therapy execution performance. The technology has been tuned to the needs of the rehabilitation system, optimizing the hardware, the communication protocol and the software control. A methodology for extracting the execution time of the rehabilitation tasks, the distance covered by the patient's hand in each subtask and the velocity profile is presented. The results show that a highly usable system for the rehabilitation of the upper limb has been developed using the RF technology and that performance metrics can be reliably extracted by the acquired signals.;2020;4
Rehabilitation requires repetitive and coordinated movements for effective treatment, which are contingent on patient compliance and motivation. However, the monotony, intensity, and expense of most therapy routines do not promote engagement. Gesture-controlled rehabilitation has the potential to quantify performance and provide engaging, cost-effective treatment, leading to better compliance and mobility. We present the design and testing of a gesture-controlled rehabilitation robot (GC-Rebot) to assess its potential for monitoring user performance and providing entertainment while conducting physical therapy. Healthy participants (n= 11) completed a maze with GC-Rebot for six trials. User performance was evaluated through quantitative metrics of movement quality and quantity, and participants rated the system usability with a validated survey. For participants with self-reported video-game experience (n= 10), wrist active range of motion across trials (mean +/- standard deviation) was 41.6 +/- 13 degrees and 76.8 +/- 16 degrees for pitch and roll, respectively. In the course of conducting a single trial with a time duration of 68.3 +/- 19 s, these participants performed 27 +/- 8 full wrist motion repetitions (i.e., flexion/extension), with a dose-rate of 24.2 +/- 5(reps)/(min). These participants also rated system usability as excellent (score: 86.3 +/- 12). Gesture-controlled therapy using the GC-Rebot demonstrated the potential to be an evidence-based rehabilitation tool based on excellent user ratings and the ability to monitor at-home compliance and performance.;2020;4
Robotic devices can be used as effective tools to provide rehabilitation supports to stroke patients. Such robotic rehabilitation practices can replace therapists providing rehabilitation therapy to patients. Patients can independently practice rehabilitation with robotic rehabilitation devices for longer hours. These advantages are now motivating patients to use rehabilitation robots. However, contemporary rehabilitation practices are expensive, and patients need to travel to rehabilitation centers for rehabilitation, which is time consuming and burdensome. This is why, the concepts of telerehabilitation are becoming more and more popular where the patients can practice rehabilitation at homes, and the therapists can remotely monitor the rehabilitation practices and communicate with the patients if necessary. However, such rehabilitation practices, real-time monitoring of patients by therapists from distant places and communication of patients with therapists may be more intuitive and human-friendly if the patients can operate the rehabilitation system and communicate with the therapists using a hand-held interface. Again, the hand-held interface may be more intuitive and engaging if the rehabilitation performance can be expressed through some game-like activities. To do so, a clear understanding of human factors involved in the gaming interface is necessary. However, such knowledge is not available in the literature. To address this knowledge gap, in this paper, the human factors associated with the operation of a hand-held gaming interface for robot-assisted full-body smart telerehabilitation of stroke patients are investigated. At first, potential human factors associated with the operation are identified through surveys conducted with healthcare professionals, researchers and patients. The identified human factors are then analyzed and divided into different categories, e.g. physical and cognitive human factors. The role of each human factor in the interface operation is explained. The findings can be utilized to design and develop hand-held gaming interfaces for robot-assisted telerehabilitation that may be more human-friendly and intuitive.;2020;4
Several cases are reported every year where the prescribed therapy results incompatible with the patient's medical history, leading to worsening of clinical condition or death. Some technologies and processes to prevent this misbehaviour already exist, but a concrete solution is not available in hospitals yet. This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) that can be easily integrated into a typical health workflow at hospitals and provides feedback on the possible prescription of drugs at a patient with specific diseases. The DSS is based on a Big Data analysis algorithm able to check drugs and diseases relationships and detect possible failures in drugs prescriptions. We developed a prototype of the proposed solution, implementing the DSS system and setting up the necessary Big Data management tools for the effective adoption of the DSS system. We performed some evaluations to assess the efficacy and the response time of the DSS algorithm.;2020;4
Since the rise in popularity of video-sharing platforms such as Youtube, learning new skills from the comfort of one's own home has become more accessible than ever. Though such independent learning methods are useful, they lack the real-time feedback component of being in the same room with an expert, which is why expensive private coaching sessions remain desirable. Accordingly, we propose Limb-O (orbs for limb movement visualization), a real-time quantitative virtual coach application for learning lower-limb motions through motion comparison. The proposed application turns the practice of things like sports motions into a game that highlights imperfections and allows for tracking of progress over time. A user validation study was run which confirmed that Limb-O outperforms traditional video learning methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, by providing objective feedback that keeps users engaged.;2020;4
Small Island Developing States (SIDS), a subgroup of Majority world countries, face complex challenges providing equitable access to speech-language therapy (SLT) services. Increasing use of information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance SLT services is seen in the Minority world. This study explored the potential of using ICT to provide sustainable SLT services in one SIDS, the Maldives. A mixed method approach was used integrating data from (a) 21 online documents, (b) interview with an ICT official, and (c) surveys of 13 island councillors and 73 parents of children with communication difficulties. Almost 100% of the population had access to mobile phones and mobile broadband Internet. Most parents were active and frequent ICT users. The government provided financial aid for people with disabilities which could be utilised to access ICT for services. Asynchronous service delivery using accessible ICT and parents as agents of service delivery can potentially enhance SLT services.;2020;4
Smart textile applications have garnered enormous interest in recent years for digital health monitoring. Here, we propose a soft fabric data glove that can be mapped into a gaming controller. The data glove comprises stretchable microfiber sensors woven seamlessly into textiles for strain sensing. By integrating the microfiber sensor imperceptibly unto the finger gloves and a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) unto the wrist, we devise a fabric glove controller that can interpret finger and wrist movements. Using the open-source Unity3D platform, we demonstrate the gaming controller translating to movement and actions of an avatar in a customized game. Importantly, the gamification of wrist movements motivates the user to exercise the wrist in a simulated rehabilitation regime. The digitization of the finger and wrist movements are also ideal for therapists to monitor and assess the rehabilitation progress remotely. Overall, the portable and lightweight data glove presents its potential in unobtrusive continuous health monitoring, through gaming applications.;2020;4
"Spasticity is a frequently observed symptom in patients with neurological impairments. Spastic movements of their upper and lower limbs are periodically measured to evaluate functional outcomes of physical rehabilitation, and they are quantified by clinical outcome measures such as the modified Ashworth scale (MAS). This study proposes a method to determine the severity of elbow spasticity, by analyzing the acceleration and rotation attributes collected from the elbow of the affected side of patients and machine-learning algorithms to classify the degree of spastic movement; this approach is comparable to assigning an MAS score. We collected inertial data from participants using a wearable device incorporating inertial measurement units during a passive stretch test. Machine-learning algorithms-including decision tree, random forests (RFs), support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, and multilayer perceptrons-were evaluated in combinations of two segmentation techniques and feature sets. A RF performed well, achieving up to 95.4% accuracy. This work not only successfully demonstrates how wearable technology and machine learning can be used to generate a clinically meaningful index but also offers rehabilitation patients an opportunity to monitor the degree of spasticity, even in nonhealthcare institutions where the help of clinical professionals is unavailable.";2020;4
Spatial neglect is a common and severe cognitive consequence of stroke, yet there is currently no effective rehabilitation tool. Virtual Reality (VR) telerehabilitation tools have the potential to provide multisensory and enjoyable therapies and remotely monitor adherence without the presence of a therapist at all times. Researchers and industry need to better understand end-user perspectives about these technologies to ensure these are acceptable and, ultimately, optimize adherence and efficacy. This study aims to explore end-user perspectives on the use of self-administered VR for spatial neglect in a university environment to identify barriers and facilitators prior to extending its use remotely as a telerehabilitation tool. We used a mixed-method design including focus groups, self-administered questionnaires and interviews with stroke survivors (N = 7), their carers (N = 3) and stroke clinicians (N = 6). End-user perspectives identified clarity of instructions, equipment (cost, available resources) and for some, level of experience with technology as barriers of use. Perceived facilitators were performance feedback, engagement and enjoyment, and psychological benefits associated with self-administered VR telerehabilitation. Overall, end-users were positive and interested in using VR telerehabilitation for spatial neglect. These perspectives enabled us to produce practical recommendations to inform development, enhance engagement and uptake of VR telerehabilitation and inform future studies.;2020;4
"Stroke is currently the world's second cause of disability. It can cause deficits such as postural control, and telerehabilitation could improve the therapeutic dose as well as functional results. The aim of this work is to determine the effectiveness and usability of a low-cost telerehabilitation system in patients with stroke. We developed a telerehabilitation system based on exergames on smartphones, inertial sensors, and a cloud database. We trained the balance of six participants (three men and three women) in early subacute stroke (seven weeks of progress). In addition to their conventional treatment, these participants trained for a total of nine sessions of 30 min per week, for four weeks. The telerehabilitation group was compared with a control group of four clinically similar participants (three men and one woman). Clinical and usability measurements were made before and after the training. The results show a significant improvement of 11.3 +/- 3.5 points in the Berg Balance Scale, 8.3 +/- 3.01 points in the Mini-BESTest, and 17.5 +/- 9.87 points in the Barthel scale for the telerehabilitation group. However, only the improvements of Berg and Barthel scales were statistically higher for the telerehabilitation group compared to the control group. The proposed system achieved excellent usability on the System Usability Scale (87.5 +/- 11.61). Our results demonstrate that a complementary low-cost telemedicine approach is feasible, and that it can significantly improve the balance of stroke patients; therefore, the proposed clinical strategy could potentially improve dosage and overall treatment effectiveness.";2020;4
Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide, with 70 percent of survivors exhibiting residual impairments of the upper limb that require frequent in-person visits to rehabilitation clinic over several months. This study explored rehabilitation clinician's preferences for design features to be included in an mHealth-enabled app for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation. Data were collected via online survey, sampling participants from Ethiopia (n = 69) and the United States (n = 75). Survey results indicated that Ethiopian and US rehabilitation clinicians have different opinions about the importance of design features that should be included in a stroke tele-rehabilitation system which are likely due to differences in culture, the availability of human and physical resources, and how the field of rehabilitation is organized and managed. Our results, thus, indicate that mHealth technologies must be tailored to the geographical and cultural context of the end users.;2020;4
Study Design: Scoping review. Introduction: With the recent advances in technologies, interactive wearable technologies including inertial motion sensors and e-textiles are emerging in the field of rehabilitation to monitor and provide feedback and therapy remotely. Purpose of the Study: This review article focuses on inertial measurement unit motion sensor and e-textiles ebased technologies and proposes approaches to augment these interactive wearable technologies. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant electronic databases (eg, PubMed, the Cu-mulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database). The scoping review included all study designs. Results: Currently, there are a numerous research groups and companies investigating inertial motion sensors and e-textilesebased interactive wearable technologies. However, translation of these technologies to the clinic would need further research to increase ease of use and improve clinical validity of the outcomes of these technologies. Discussion: The current review discusses the limitations of the interactive wearable technologies such as, limited clinical utility, bulky equipment, difficulty in setting up equipment inertial motion sensors and e-textiles. Conclusion: There is tremendous potential for interactive wearable technologies in rehabilitation. With the evolution of cloud computing, interactive wearable systems can remotely provide intervention and monitor patient progress using models of telerehabilitation. This will revolutionize the delivery of rehabilitation and make rehabilitation more accessible and affordable to millions of individuals. (C) 2020 Hanley & Belfus, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

"Study design: Secondary analysis of a multi-site parallel evaluator-masked randomized control trial. Objective: Examine usage of an in-home exergame, compared to control, unsupervised after supervised training by older persons with lower-limb amputation. Methods: WiiNWalk uses the WiiFit and teleconferencing for in-home group-based exergame therapy with clinical supervision. Participants engaged in a 4-week supervised training phase followed by a 4-week unsupervised phase in experimental (WiiNWalk) and attention control groups. Usage between phases and between groups was compared using unsupervised/supervised ratio of session count (over 4 weeks) and session time (mean min/session over 4 weeks) for each phase. Results: Participants: n=36 experimental, n=28 control, unilateral lower-limb amputation, age > 50 years, prosthesis usage >= 2 hours/day. Session count ratio unsupervised/supervised, median and interquartile range (IQR), was less than parity (p<0.01) for experimental (0.25, IQR 0.00 -0.68) and control (0.18, IQR 0.00 -0.67) groups, with no different between groups (p=0.92). Experimental session time unsupervised/supervised showed consistency (1.12, IQR 0.80 -1.41) between phases (p=0.24); control showed lower (0.76, IQR 0.57 -1.08) ratios compared to experimental (p=0.027). Conclusions: Unsupervised exercise duration remained consistent with supervised, but frequency was reduced. Social and clinical guidance features may remain necessary for sustained lower-limb amputation exergame engagement at home.";2020;4
Study Design: This was a prospective cohort study. Objective: The objective of this study was to design and test a novel spine neurological examination adapted for telemedicine. Summary of Background Data: Telemedicine is a rapidly evolving technology associated with numerous potential benefits for health care, especially in the modern era of value-based care. To date, no studies have assessed whether. Methods: Twenty-one healthy controls and 20 patients with cervical or lumbar spinal disease (D) were prospectively enrolled. Each patient underwent a telemedicine neurological examination as well as a traditional in-person neurological examination administered by a fellowship trained spine surgeon and a physiatrist. Both the telemedicine and in-person tests consisted of motor, sensory, and special test components. Scores were compared via univariate analysis and secondary qualitative outcomes, including responses from a satisfaction survey, were obtained upon completion of the trial. Results: Of the 20 patients in the D group, 9 patients had cervical disease and 11 patients had lumbar disease. Comparing healthy control with the D group, there were no significant differences with respect to all motor scores, most sensory scores, and all special tests. There was a high rate of satisfaction among the cohort with 92.7% of participants feeling very satisfied with the overall experience. Conclusions: This study presents the development of a viable neurological spine examination adapted for telemedicine. The findings in this study suggest that patients have comparable motor, sensory, and special test scores with telemedicine as with a traditional in-person examination administered by an experienced clinician, as well as reporting a high rate of satisfaction among participants. To our knowledge, this is the first telemedicine neurological examination for spine surgery. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings.;2020;4
"Technology developments and demand for flexibility in health care and in contact with the health care system are two factors leading to increased use of eHealth solutions. The use of eHealth has been shown to have positive effects in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the full potential for this group needs to be explored. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate the feasibility of an eHealth tool used for exercise training and online contacts for people with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The 10-week intervention included an eHealth tool for exercise training in home environment and regular online contacts, as well as weekly e-rounds for health care professionals. Seven of the nine participants completed the study. The eHealth tool was found to be feasible for e-rounds, exercise training and online contacts. Participants could manage the tool and adhere to training; positive effects were shown, and no adverse events occurred. Technical functions need to be improved.";2020;4
Technology has acted as a great enabler of patient continuity through remote consultation, ongoing monitoring, and patient education using telephone and videoconferencing in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era. The devastating impact of COVID-19 is bound to prevail beyond its current reign. The vulnerable sections of our community, including the elderly, those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, those with multiple comorbidities, and immunocompromised patients, endure a relatively higher burden of a pandemic such as COVID-19. The rapid adoption of different technologies across countries, driven by the need to provide continued medical care in the era of social distancing, has catalyzed the penetration of telemedicine. Limiting the exposure of patients, healthcare workers, and systems is critical in controlling the viral spread. Telemedicine offers an opportunity to improve health systems delivery, access, and efficiency. This article critically examines the current telemedicine landscape and challenges in its adoption, toward remote/tele-delivery of care, across various medical specialties. The current consortium provides a roadmap and/or framework, along with recommendations, for telemedicine uptake and implementation in clinical practice during and beyond COVID-19.;2020;4
Telehealth provides health care services to clients through telecommunications. Rehabilitation services such as occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech-language therapy can be delivered via telehealth. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients' reports of their satisfaction with telehealth compared to standard in-person therapy for patients living in rural areas. Four databases were utilized for this systematic review. The following words were searched: telehealth, rural, and patient satisfaction. Abstract searches identified 251 articles, and 55 were read in full text. Four articles met inclusion criteria. There was high satisfaction for patients in all studies regarding the use of telehealth. Findings showed that overall, telehealth supported increased rates of patient satisfaction for OT, PT, and SLP services delivered to rural communities.;2020;4
Telehealth use allows improved access to services and results in potential cost savings. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a combined modified Constrained Induced Movement Therapy (mCIMT) program using telehealth and in-person sessions, for participants with higher (Group 1) and lower (Group 2) functional ability of the hemiparetic upper extremity. Using a pre-experimental design with a 6-week intervention, 28 participants were assessed twice on use of upper extremity via subjective and objective measures. For the Motor Activity Log, the amount of use and quality of use were significant for Groups 1 and 2. Significant improvements were shown on the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Fugl-Meyer UE, and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) for both groups except for the strength subtest on the WMFT and the timed portion for Group 1. Percentages of attendance for telehealth and in-person sessions were also compared. Telehealth sessions had a higher attendance rate (84.5%) than in-person sessions (75.3%) (p=.004). The combined mCIMT program of telerehabilitation and in-person group sessions was effective in improving functional ability after a stroke.;2020;4
Telehealth utilizes information technologies and communication networks to deliver healthcare and education with lower costs and improved access, quality, and efficiency of healthcare services. This report describes the application of telehealth for medical screening, clinical decision making, and medical referral in a physical therapy practice. The patient described was a 50-year old man who contacted his physical therapist via telephone for a chief complaint of worsening left sided numbness and tingling that began insidiously 2 days prior. Further questioning revealed that the patient also complained of left ankle weakness, and slight unsteadiness with walking. He had not been feeling well and had been experiencing increasing bouts of unexplained fatigue over the previous two months that were now interfering with his work and recreational activities. The patient was evaluated by his physician the next day. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a large (4 cm) falcine meningiorna in the right parietal region. The patient was immediately referred to a neurosurgeon and underwent a craniotomy and tumor resection ten days later and subsequent gamma knife radiosurgery of the residual tumor bed two months after craniotomy and tumor resection. Follow-up imaging one year later revealed no evidence of recurrence or residual tumor. This patient case underscores the importance of recognizing signs and symptoms of serious disease, and how referral following telehealth via telephone can inform diagnosis.;2020;4
Telemedicine is witnessing a rebirth due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuing need for limited-contact or contactless care in medicine. Telerehabilitation, an offshoot of telemedicine, is a valuable yet underexplored tool in the therapeutic armamentarium of patients with neurological conditions, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). Although there is evidence in literature reporting the use of telerehabilitation and virtual reality-based services in providing rehabilitation to improve speech, swallowing, gait, and postural instability among persons with PD, the evidence is limited due to small patient numbers. Teleneurorehabilitation (TNR) is an underutilized strategy that may be as effective and perhaps more feasible and affordable among Indian PD patients and also allows sustained rehabilitation. In this article, we encapsulate the evidence on the utility and efficacy of TNR among persons with PD and call upon the neurology community to recognize and utilize the valuable asset that TNR may be for PD patients.;2020;4
Telemedicine uses modern telecommunication technology to exchange medical information and provide clinical care to individuals at a distance. Initially intended to improve health care for patients in remote settings, telemedicine now has a broad clinical scope with the general purpose of providing convenient, safe, and time-and cost-efficient care. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has created marked nationwide changes in health care access and delivery. Elective appointments and procedures have been canceled or delayed, and multiple states still have some degree of shelter-in-place orders. Many institutions are now relying more heavily on telehealth services to continue to provide medical care to individuals while also preserving the safety of health care professionals and patients. Telemedicine can also help reduce the surge in health care needs and visits as restrictions are lifted. In recent weeks, there has been a significant amount of information and advice on how to best approach telemedicine visits. Given the frequent presentation of individuals with musculoskeletal complaints to the medical practitioner, it is important to have a framework for the virtual musculoskeletal physical examination. This will be of importance as telemedicine continues to evolve, even after coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions are lifted. This article will provide the medical practitioner performing a virtual musculoskeletal examination with a specific set of guidelines, both written and visual, to enhance the information obtained when evaluating the shoulder, hip, knee, ankle, and cervical and lumbar spine. In addition to photographs, accompanying videos are included to facilitate and demonstrate specific physical examination techniques that the patient can self-perform.

Tele-neurorehabilitation has the potential to reduce accessibility barriers and enhance patient outcomes through a more seamless continuum of care. A growing number of studies have found that tele-neurorehabilitation produces equivalent results to usual care for a variety of outcomes including activities of daily living and health related quality of life. Despite the potential of tele-neurorehabilitation, this model of care has failed to achieve mainstream adoption. Little is known about feasibility and acceptability of tele-neurorehabilitation and most published studies do not use a validated model to guide and evaluate implementation. The technology acceptance model (TAM) was developed 20 years ago and is one of the most widely used theoretical frameworks for predicting an individual's likelihood to adopt and use new technology. The TAM3 further built on the original model by incorporating additional elements from human decision making such as computer anxiety. In this perspective, we utilize the TAM3 to systematically map the findings from existing published studies, in order to explore the determinants of adoption of tele-neurorehabilitation by both stroke survivors and prescribing clinicians. We present evidence suggesting that computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety are significant predictors of an individual's likelihood to use tele-neurorehabilitation. Understanding what factors support or hinder uptake of tele-neurorehabilitation can assist in translatability and sustainable adoption of this technology. If we are to shift tele-neurorehabilitation from the research domain to become a mainstream health sector activity, key stakeholders must address the barriers that have consistently hindered adoption.;2020;4
"Tele-physiotherapy has been shown to be valuable to improve clinical outcomes after stroke. Yet, home-based interventions for stroke survivors (SSVs) who speak indigenous African languages are sparse. This study developed a video-based home exercise programme (VHEP) for SSV speakers of Yoruba. A qualitative descriptive pilot study was conducted in two phases: development and feasibility testing. VHEP development followed the American Stroke Association's recommendations to include demonstrations of task-specific mobility-task and postural training; trunk exercises, and overground walking. The exercise instructions were presented in the Yoruba language. Each exercise was demonstrated for five minutes on video for a total of 30 minutes. The feasibility testing involved ten consenting chronic SSVs. Each imitated the VHEP twice per week for two weeks and thereafter completed a feasibility questionnaire. Criteria for feasibility were: cost of using VHEP, recruitment rate, retention of participants, adherence to the exercises, and intervention delivery. The ten SSVs were recruited within one week, had prior home access to a video player at no-cost, adhered to the exercises as recorded, completed the 30 minute-duration for two weeks, and confirmed intervention delivery of VHEP. Most participants liked the novel use of Yoruba as the language of instruction on VHEP. The VHEP was feasible and acceptable among the studied sample of SSVs. Video based home telerehabilitation for SSVs therefore has the potential to meet the growing need for tele-physiotherapy in resource limited settings.";2020;4
Telepractice facilitates services in exceptional settings and situations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is certainly such a situation. Due to pandemic-related restrictions, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) needed to adopt new approaches to their professional functioning. The aim of the paper is to examine SLP professionals' perceptions and application of telepractice in SLP settings in Croatia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two hundred and fifty-five SLPs completed an online survey. The results demonstrated that most SLPs had provided direct online therapy, mainly those employed in health care and private practice. The chief reasons for clients' refusal of therapy delivered via telepractice included the lack of equipment, insufficient independence, and doubts on the effectiveness of telepractice. Although only 3% of SLPs had acquired some formal knowledge of telepractice before the pandemic, over 70% expressed satisfaction with telepractice because it allowed them to provide undisturbed clinical services in an exceptional situation.;2020;4
Telerehabilitation (TR) has been proven to be an effective tool in improving the adaptive skills of children and young adults with Multiple Disabilities (MDs). The application of a comprehensive set of new technologies reveals new opportunities for both physical and cognitive telerehabilitation, but there is no holistic approach in the case of genetic syndromes. In this paper we present reflections and early results of the TCTRS project that aims at implementing a telerehabilitation system capable of offering complete coverage of rehabilitation needs for people with Rett Syndrome, from both the physical and cognitive points of view. Moreover, the data acquired through the system can also represent a basis for machine learning applications to remotely support therapists and physicians. Our first tests on the system application show the great potential of our approach, in terms of feasibility and applicability, for both rehabilitation centers and families.;2020;4
Telerehabilitation (TR) uses technology to deliver physical and cognitive rehabilitation. TR supports many clinical categories pertaining to geriatric patients. Benefits from TR include reduced travel demands, longer consultation durations, and greater access to specialists for older patients. Despite these advantages many older adult patients and clinicians are reluctant to select TR as part of their care. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence supporting the use of TR in the care of older adult patients.;2020;4
Tele-Rehabilitation as a Service (TRaaS) has recently emerged as a technique allowing remote patients with motor impairments to be monitored and treated directly in their homes. The objective of this paper is twofold: i) studying how Machine Learning (ML) can improve the TRaaS, and ii) demonstrating how a NoSQL graph database approach can enhance the performance because it works directly at the database layer instead of at the application one. In particular, the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm is studied in order to improve a robotic rehabilitation therapy using the Lokomat device as case of study. Experiments compare two system prototypes, that are respectively based on Python and Neo4j, showing that the latter presents better performance in terms of processing time guaranteeing the same accuracy.;2020;4
Telerehabilitation is the application of telecommunications technology for the delivery of speech language pathology and audiology services at a distance by linking clinician to client or clinician to clinician for assessment, intervention, and/or consultation. It is an emerging field, but due to the lack of trained professionals, the number of professionals providing telerehabilitation in Kerala is few in number. The outbreak of the pandemic COVID 19 has forced the speech language pathologists (SLPs) to shift from the traditional face to face therapy to telerehabilitation which was a new experience for most of the speech language pathologists. The present study aimed to understand the challenges faced by the speech language pathologists to provide telerehabilitation services to the clients during the outbreak of pandemic COVID-19 and how they overcome those barriers using a self- rated questionnaire developed. The questionnaire was sent to speech language pathologists through mail and WhatsApp. 105 speech language pathologists responded. Among them, 77 speech language pathologists provided telerehabilitation and served clients of all ages and different disorders with language disorder being the most common and dysphagia and apraxia being the least served client population. Telerehabilitation was found to be a viable form of service delivery in the field of speech language Pathology. All possibilities of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) were utilized by the SLPs to provide the best services despite the lack of training and non-availability of resources. This survey depicts the need for publishing standard guidelines for providing telerehabilitation services and also it emphasizes the need for improved infrastructure and training to professionals to ensure quality services to their clients.;2020;4
Telerehabilitation programs can be employed to establish communication between patients and healthcare professionals and empower patients performing their training remotely. This study aimed to identify patients' requirements after a total knee replacement following a self-training rehabilitation program, leading to the design and development of a telerehabilitation program that can meet the stakeholders' actual needs. System design, development, and testing were conducted in five iterations based on a participatory design approach. Data collection was performed using interviews, observations, prototyping, and questionnaires. It was found that the main barriers facing the existing rehabilitation program were a lack of clear communication, lack of relevant information, and healthcare professional's feedback. The participants emphasized the main themes of communication, information, training, and motivation in the process of design and development. In using the telerehabilitation program, the patients reported a high level of user-friendliness, flexibility, and a sense of security. This study has identified obstacles in the current rehabilitation program and revealed the potential effectiveness of using asynchronous communication and sensor-based technologies by employing participatory design and development. A higher level of portability and flexibility were observed. However, future studies and development are required to investigate the overall usability and reliability of the telerehabilitation program.;2020;4
Telerehabilitation systems provide some advantages against the classic rehabilitation methods. The ability of the shoulders depends on active motion range of them to do activities in daily life and to do sports. To evaluate the shoulder motions, range of motion (ROM) measurement is a basic method. Clinical goniometer and digital goniometer are the most commonly used measurement tools. However, these measurement tools have some deficiencies and difficulties. In this paper, we consider a Kinect One Sensor (Kinect V2) based measurement system for shoulder motions as an alternative method. The aim of this study is to examine the reliability and validity analyzes of the proposed shoulder measurement system. Three systems were used to evaluate validity of the Kinect V2 to measure shoulder motions: Kinect V2 based system, clinical goniometer and digital goniometer. One expert physical therapist measured shoulder abduction, flexion, external rotation, internal rotation and extension ROM values using a clinical goniometer and a digital goniometer in 40 healthy volunteers (22 males, 18 females, and 19-33 years old). All poses for each shoulder motion were captured with the Kinect V2 based system again and the ROM values were calculated. These procedures were carried out with all of the volunteer participants in three repetitions. In reliability for Kinect V2 based shoulder motion measurement system, we used the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of the measure (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC). The validity test includes the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) and mean difference between the Kinect V2 based system and the both of the goniometer systems for measuring shoulder motions. The high ICC values show that the Kinect V2 based shoulder motion measurement system has very good intra-rater reliability for abduction, flexion, external rotation, internal rotation shoulder poses. For extension pose, it has good reliability result according to the ICC value. The validity analysis gives good results for all shoulder poses except internal rotation between Kinect V2 and clinical/digital goniometer. As a result, Kinect V2 based measurement system is a reliable and valid alternative telerehabilitation tool for shoulder motions. (C) 2019 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Telerehabilitation with Robotic Exoskeletons is an emerging technology aimed at assisting to restore patients' mobility using a master and slave robotic system. Some of the main challenges for achieving good tracking performance, stability and transparency in telerehabilitation are nonlinearities, uncertain and time-varying parameters in the robot and human models, and communication delays. Additionally, a paramount challenge for this technology is ensuring safe and compliant interaction between the robots and the human operators. This paper presents a novel control approach utilized during unilateral and bilateral teleoperation which address these challenges. An Adaptive Impedance Controller is designed using Lyapunov-based methods for the master exoskeleton while a Proportional-Derivative Impedance Controller is implemented on the slave exoskeleton. Subsequently, a torque limiter technique was implemented on the master side to ensure stability in the presence of time delays. The advantages of these controllers are that they address unknown dynamics, incorporate designed impedance response for rehabilitation applications, and are simple to implement. Simulations for two two-degree-of-freedom robotic exoskeletons are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in both passive and assistive telerehabilitation modes, and with time delays.;2020;4
"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of telemonitored exercise rehabilitation on patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) in China. Ninety-six patients with stable CHD were included and analyzed (48 in telemonitored group and 48 in control group). All patients received routine follow-up, and patients in telemonitored group participated in smartphone-based telemonitored cardiac rehabilitation. Patients' demographic information, medical history, diagnosis and treatment of CHD, and laboratory results were collected. The difference of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), blood test, and echocardiographic parameters; exercise habits; control rate of blood lipid and blood glucose; and incidence of adverse events between the two groups during 6 months of follow-up was analyzed. After intervention, the subjects in the telemonitored group performed significantly better in VO2peak, exercise compliance, and some other parameters than those in the control group. Telemonitored exercise rehabilitation is an effective rehabilitation mode for CHD patients in China.";2020;4
The autonomous completion of the everyday activities of human beings with motor function problems improves significantly when evaluation and treatment processes are included in physical rehabilitation. These processes demand time, constant accompaniment and appropriate decisions made by the health professional, as well as a fundamental aspect, which is the motivation of the patient. This work presents a proposal for the development of a telerehabilitation platform which involves the use of serious video games, a motion capture system and a web application in order to support the recovery process of the musculoskeletal system. To begin with, this work presents a review of the literature that addresses aspects related to the rehabilitation of the upper limbs, using videogames and motion capture systems. The review identified that the use of video games continues to represent a significant contribution to motor rehabilitation processes, and that the main motion capture systems used are Kinect, some commercial systems, and other proposals that explore the advantages of the units of inertial measurement. Then, the methodological process leading to the development of a platform is put forward. Finally, there is a description of the basic characteristics of the functioning and the structure of the telerehabilitation platform proposed in order to offer a precise and motivating alternative as treatment.;2020;4
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered governments worldwide to implement severe restrictions on physical therapy protocols in order to better control the spread of the virus. One of the mechanisms of providing physical therapy patient care during this era is via telemedicine. Telerehabilitation or telerehab is a technological visual-audio system that serves patients, including those with a spine injury, ailment, or postoperatively, with neurological deficits. In this scoping review, we discuss the development of telerehab, the technological advances in the field, and the usage of telerehab specifically pertaining to spine patients, and comment on the advancement of telerehab in the time of COVID-19. There is preliminary evidence that suggests that the adoption of telerehab in lieu of face-to-face interventions is beneficial for reducing pain and improving physical function in patients afflicted with chronic nonmalignant musculoskeletal pain from low back pain, lumbar stenosis, neck pain, and osteoarthritis. Availability is important, as the necessary technology should be accessible to all participants. Safety and security should be addressed, as the passage of patient data over the Internet requires secure confidentiality. Ease-of-use is crucial to promote practicality, user-friendly operation, and adherence to therapy. The combination of evidence-based methodologies with cost-effective services will serve as a basis for the further expansion of vital telerehab services and increases reimbursement by health insurance providers.;2020;4
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound effect on the provision of medical care. As the curve progresses and patients are discharged, the rehabilitation wave brings a high number of postacute COVID-19 patients suffering from physical, mental, and cognitive impairments threatening their return to normal life. The complexity and severity of disease in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 infection require an approach that is implemented as early in the recovery phase as possible, in a concerted and systematic way. To address the rehabilitation wave, we describe a spectrum of interventions that start in the intensive care unit and continue through all the appropriate levels of care. This approach requires organized rehabilitation teams including physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, rehabilitation psychologists or neuropsychologists, and physiatrists collaborating with acute medical teams. Here, we also discuss administrative factors that influence the provision of care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The services that can be provided are described in detail to allow the reader to understand what services may be appropriate locally. We have been learning and adapting real time during this crisis and hope that sharing our experience facilitates the work of others as the pandemic evolves. It is our goal to help reduce the potentially longlasting challenges faced by COVID-19 survivors. (C) 2020 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine;2020;4
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated many changes in medicine including the transition from providing care in person to providing care via technology enabled telemedicine. The benefits of telemedicine visits with a Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) provider, also known as telerehabilitation medicine visits, are numerous. Telerehabilitation medicine provides an opportunity to deliver timely, patient and family-centric rehabilitation care while maintaining physical distance and reducing potential COVID-19 exposure for our patients, their caregivers and medical providers. Telerehabilitation medicine also allows for access to PRM care in rural areas or areas without medical specialty, virtual in-home equipment evaluation, and reduced travel burden. Because of these and many other benefits, telerehabilitation medicine will likely become part of our ongoing model of care if barriers to telemedicine continue to be lowered or removed. This paper is intended to establish a foundation for pediatric telerehabilitation medicine visit efficiency and effectiveness in our current environment and into the future.;2020;4
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a rapid adoption of telemedicine over traditional in-person visits due to social restrictions. While telemedicine improves access and reduces barriers to healthcare access for many, several barriers and challenges remain for persons with disabilities, and novel challenges have been exposed, many of which may persist long-term. The challenges and barriers that need to be systematically addressed include: Infrastructure and access barriers, operational challenges, regulatory barriers, communication barriers and legislative barriers. Persons with disabilities are a vulnerable population and little attention has been placed on their healthcare access during the pandemic. Access and communication during a healthcare encounter are important mediators of outcomes for persons with disabilities. Significant, long-term changes in technological, regulatory, and legislative infrastructure and custom solutions to unique patient and health system needs are required to address these barriers going forward in order to improve healthcare access and outcomes for persons with disabilities.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted the usual mechanisms of healthcare delivery and exacerbated symptoms of mental illnesses. Telemedicine has morphed from niche service to essential platform, with newly released guidelines that cover various aspects of tele-mental health delivery. Rehabilitation services, which incorporate a range of psychosocial interventions and liaison services, have been significantly impacted too. They are currently more institute-based than community-based in India. However, recent legislation has mandated that community-based rehabilitation options be available. While a large treatment gap for mental health issues has always existed, telemedicine provides an opportunity to scale services up to minimize this gap. Community-based rehabilitation can be delivered over various platforms, from text to phone to videoconferencing, and various devices. Telemedicine is cost-effective, and enables delivery of services where existing services are inadequate. The recent guidelines allow other healthcare workers to be involved in mental health service delivery. Hence, in addition to direct delivery of services, telerehabilitation can facilitate task-shifting, with mental health professionals mentoring and supervising existing human resources, such as ASHA workers, VRWs, DMHP programme staff, and others. Tele-rehabilitation also poses challenges - not all needs can be met; access and privacy can be a problem in resource-scarce settings; liaison with existing services is required; and organisations need to plan appropriately and re-allocate resources. Digital access to welfare benefits and interventions must be expanded without disadvantaging those without internet access. Yet, many rehabilitation interventions can be adapted to telemedicine platforms smoothly, and task-shifting can broaden access to care for persons with disability.";2020;4
The COVID-19 pandemic transformed health care delivery, including rapid expansion of telehealth. Telerehabilitation, defined as therapy provided by physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language pathology, was rapidly adopted with goals to provide access to care and limit contagion. The purpose of this brief report was to describe the feasibility of and satisfaction with telerehabilitation. A total of 205 participants completed online surveys after a telerehabilitation visit. Most commonly, participants were women (53.7%), 35-64 yrs old, and completed physical therapy (53.7%) for established visits of 30-44 mins in duration for primary impairments in sports, lower limb injuries, and pediatric neurology. Overall, high ratings (excellent or very good responses) were observed for all patient-centered outcome metrics (range, 93.7%-99%) and value in future telehealth visit (86.8%) across telerehabilitation visits. Women participated more frequently and provided higher ratings than male participants did. Other benefits included eliminating travel time, incorporating other health care advocates, and convenience delivering care in familiar environment to pediatric patients. Technology and elements of hands-on aspects of care were observed limitations. Recognizing reduced indirect costs of care that telerehabilitation may provide along with high patient satisfaction are reasons policy makers should adopt these services into future health care delivery models.;2020;4
"The current COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented new challenges to public health and medical care delivery. To control viral transmission, social distancing measures have been implemented all over the world, interrupting the access to routine medical care for many individuals with neurological diseases. Cognitive disorders are common in many neurological conditions, e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and other types of dementia, Parkinson's disease and parkinsonian syndromes, and multiple sclerosis, and should be addressed by cognitive rehabilitation interventions. To be effective, cognitive rehabilitation programs must be intensive and prolonged over time; however, the current virus containment measures are hampering their implementation. Moreover, the reduced access to cognitive rehabilitation might worsen the relationship between the patient and the healthcare professional. Urgent measures to address issues connected to COVID-19 pandemic are, therefore, needed. Remote communication technologies are increasingly regarded as potential effective options to support health care interventions, including neurorehabilitation and cognitive rehabilitation. Among them, telemedicine, virtual reality, augmented reality, and serious games could be in the forefront of these efforts. We will briefly review current evidence-based recommendations on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation and offer a perspective on the role of tele- and virtual rehabilitation to achieve adequate cognitive stimulation in the era of social distancing related to COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we will discuss issues related to their diffusion and propose a roadmap to address them. Methodological and technological improvements might lead to a paradigm shift to promote the delivery of cognitive rehabilitation to people with reduced mobility and in remote regions.";2020;4
The elderly population is increasing globally, putting more pressure on aged care and public health systems. To address this issue and help increase the independence of older people, different digital technologies, including the Internet of things (IoT), can play an important role. Although there has been an increase in the number of studies in this field, most of them concentrate on IoT applications in elderly care from a technology perspective, with very little contribution from the clinical side. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate and identify the available IoT applications and their clinical utility for common diseases in elderly people. The results of this study could be useful for information technology professionals in developing and understanding the clinical requirements for IoT applications in healthcare for older people. Clinicians will also be informed about the clinical possibilities of using IoT devices in this area. Based on our findings, future research should focus on enhancing the clinical utility of current IoT applications in different settings and on developing new applications to support practitioners and older people.;2020;4
The emergency we are experiencing due to the coronavirus infection is changing the role of technologies in our daily life. In particular, movements of persons need to be monitored or driven for avoiding gathering of people, especially in small environments. In this paper, we present an efficient and cost-effective indoor navigation system for driving people inside large smart buildings. Our solution takes advantage of an emerging short-range wireless communication technology - IoT-based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and exploits BLE Beacons across the environment to provide mobile users equipped with a smartphone hints on how to arrive at the destination. The main scientific contribution of our work is a new proximity-based navigation system that identifies the user position according to information sent by Beacons, processes the best path for indoor navigation at the edge computing infrastructure, and provides it to the user through the smartphone. We provide some experimental results to test the communication system considering both the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS).;2020;4
The enormous progress made in recent years in the field of information and communication technology and also in sensor and computer technology has affected numerous fields of medicine and is capable of inducing even radical changes in diagnostic and therapeutic processes. This is particularly true for cardiology, where, for example, telemetric monitoring of cardiac and circulatory functions has been in use for many years. Nevertheless, broad application of newer telemedical processes has not yet been achieved to the extent one would expect from the encouraging results of numerous clinical studies in this field and the state of the art of the underlying technology. In the present paper, the Working Group on Rhythmology of the Austrian Cardiological Society aims to provoke a critical discussion of the digital change in cardiology and to make recommendations for the implementation of those telemedical processes that have been shown to exert positive effects on a wide variety of medical and economic parameters. The greatest benefit of telecardiological applications is certainly to be found in the long-term care of patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. Accordingly, follow-up care of patients with cardiological rhythm implants, management of chronic heart failure and secondary prevention following an acute cardiac event during rehabilitation are currently the most important fields of application. Telemedicine is intended to enable high-quality and cost-efficient care for an increasing number of patients, whose care poses one of the greatest challenges to our healthcare system. Not least of all, telemedicine should make a decisive contribution to improving the quality of life of this segment of the population by favorably influencing mortality, morbidity and hospitalization as well as the patient's contribution to treatment.;2020;4
The global Covid-19 pandemic requires us to rethink the practices of dealing with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD). The present work, based on the analysis of the scientific literature, provides food for thought on the modalities of using remote intervention and diagnostic tools with children with SLD. At the moment, in fact, a telepsychology approach can be well adopted in the rehabilitation field, while it seems difficult to use for diagnostic purposes, due to the lack of shared tools and procedures. The challenges of this time push us to think and create new on-line assessment diagnostic tools for SLD.;2020;4
The growing understanding of the importance of involving patients with neurological diseases in their healthcare routine either for at-home management of their chronic conditions or after the hospitalization period has opened the research for new rehabilitation strategies to enhance patient engagement in neurorehabilitation. In addition, the use of new digital technologies in the neurorehabilitation field enables the implementation of telerehabilitation systems such as virtual reality interventions, video games, web-based interventions, mobile applications, web-based or telephonic telecoach programs, in order to facilitate the relationship between clinicians and patients, and to motivate and activate patients to continue with the rehabilitation process at home. Here we present a systematic review that aims at reviewing the effectiveness of different engagement strategies and the different engagement assessments while using telerehabilitation systems in patients with neurological disorders. We used PICO's format to define the question of the review, and the systematic review protocol was designed following the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Bibliographical data was collected by using the following bibliographic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eighteen studies were included in this systematic review for full-text analyses. Overall, the reviewed studies using engagement strategies through telerehabilitation systems in patients with neurological disorders were mainly focused on patient self-management and self-awareness, patient motivation, and patient adherence subcomponents of engagement, that are involved in by the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dimensions of engagement. Conclusion: The studies commented throughout this systematic review pave the way for the design of new telerehabilitation protocols, not only focusing on measuring quantitative or qualitative measures but measuring both of them through a mixed model intervention design (1). The future clinical studies with a mixed model design will provide more abundant data regarding the role of engagement in telerehabilitation, leading to a possibly greater understanding of its underlying components.;2020;4
The novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic primarily affects the respiratory system. Elderly individuals with comorbidity are severely affected. Survivors weaned from mechanical ventilation are at a higher risk of developing post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This scoping review, based on 40 recent publications, highlights pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in COVID-19. There is a paucity of high-quality research on this topic. However, rehabilitation societies including the Turkish Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation have issued PR recommendations in COVID-19 pneumonia with productive cough can benefit from diaphragmatic breathing, pursed-lip breathing, and resistance-breathing training. Besides, those in mechanical ventilation and post-PICS COVID-19 cases, oxygen therapy, early mobilization, airway clearance, aerobic exercise, gradual-graded limb muscle resistance exercise, nutritional and psychological interventions should be consideration. During PR, careful evaluation of vital signs and exercise-induced symptoms is also required. When in-person PR is not possible, telerehabilitation should be explored. However, the long-term effects of PR in COVID-19 need further evaluation.;2020;4
The objective of this project was to measure Veteran and provider satisfaction with a home-based telerehabilitation assessment for wheelchair seating and mobility. Forty-three Veterans were seen remotely at their place of residence by a provider, using a VA Video Connect synchronous videoconferencing system. Veteran and provider satisfaction were collected using the Telerehabilitation Questionnaire (TRQ). Mean individual TRQ scores for both Veterans and providers were significantly higher than the scale midpoint of 3.5. Veterans had higher scores than providers for five individual items on the TRQ. Higher scores by Veterans on the technology and quality and clarity of the video and audio likely correspond to the differences in environmental settings in which the visit occurred for the Veteran compared with the provider. High satisfaction scores with the telerehabilitation assessments are likely attributed to the positive working relationship between the provider and the rehabilitation technician, who provided in-person technical support to the Veteran in the home during the wheeled mobility evaluation. Overall, the results indicate a high level of Veteran and provider satisfaction using telerehabilitation for wheelchair seating and mobility evaluations.;2020;4
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis is having a large impact on acute and chronic cardiac care. Due to public health measures and the reorganisation of outpatient cardiac care, traditional centre-based cardiac rehabilitation is currently almost impossible. In addition, public health measures are having a potentially negative impact on lifestyle behaviour and general well-being. Therefore, the Working Group of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation of the Dutch Society of Cardiology has formulated practical recommendations for the provision of cardiac rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic, by using telerehabilitation programmes without face-to-face contact based on current guidelines supplemented with new insights and experiences.;2020;4
The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has spread across the world, causing causalities and inflicting chronic complications in those who survive the infection. Disruptions in the immune system and lowered physical levels caused by quarantine protocols are the major causes of chronic dysfunction and impaired life independency, especially in elderly patients. Multiple exercise suggestions and novel program delivery methods, including telerehabilitation/tele-exercise programs, home-gym strategies, and exergames, have emerged. Patients with underlying obesity, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, or binge-eating problems are at a high risk of serious infection and sequela. Adequate education and coping strategies can lessen the potential infection complications and improve the quality of life. Acknowledging the possible benefits and risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage in chronic pain patients, and the supplementation of vitamin D may also aid in treating post-infected patients.;2020;4
The paper aims to develop a new technological solution to support Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) of patients, thus to optimize benefits of the action plan for remote health treatments. We investigate an innovative Mathematical Model (MM) in the area of SRL to exhaustively describe the main aspects concerning the nature of human thought and cognition. Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) adopted in remote Healthcare Systems (RHS) can improve self-learning capabilities of patients. However, the impact of technologies in remote therapies depends on several factors, such as technical skill levels of patients and the type of target to reach. The proposed MM is the basis for a post-processing performed with Machine Learning tools useful to identify cross-relations among key factors in SRL, such as digital skills, personal motivations of patients and therapy targets, and to investigate the impact of technological tools in RHS where technologies are used to training SRL.;2020;4
The present study investigated factors that influenced home care physiotherapy (HCP) services and profile of the practitioners in Nigeria. It also investigated if the service was registered with the Regulatory Agency. Three hundred and thirty conveniently sampled physiotherapists in Nigeria participated in the cross-sectional survey. A newly developed, nine-part, content-validated questionnaire was used to obtain information about the demographics, sources of referral, case types, frequency of treatment, costing, benefits, and challenges of the HCP, job satisfaction, and registration status. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. All the respondents (100%) were involved in HCP irrespective of their professional profile. The mean duration of practice experience was 9.09 +/- 7.34 years. Stroke (41.8%) was the most prevalent case treated. Poor working environment (M = 4.16, R = 1-5), transportation cost (M = 4.16, R = 1-5) and intrusion by impostors (M = 3.66, R = 1-5), were some of the factors that had impact on the HCP services. A preponderance of HCP services was not registered with the Regulatory Agency in Nigeria.;2020;4
The purpose of this study was to compare telehealth and in-person service delivery models for wheeled mobility devices in terms of functional outcomes. We hypothesized that clinically significant improvements in functional mobility measured by the Functional Mobility Assessment (FMA) will occur in individuals receiving both telehealth and in-person clinic evaluations. A total of 27 Veterans receiving telehealth visits were compared to 27 individuals seen in clinic, selected from a database, matching for age, gender, and primary diagnosis. All mean individual item and total FMA scores in both groups increased from Time 1 to Time 2. Within the telehealth group, all changes in individual item and total FMA scores were statistically significant, with changes in 8 of 10 items meeting threshold for clinical significance (change >1.85 points). Within the clinic group, changes in 7 of 10 individual items and total FMA scores were statistically significant, and these same 7 items met threshold for clinical significance. Change scores for individual item and total FMA scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. A larger and clinically significant change in transfer score was seen in the telehealth group, suggesting telehealth visits may confer an advantage in being able to assess and address transfer issues in the home.;2020;4
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a telerehabilitation system on the quality of sleep in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Fifteen females and two males (60.1 +/- 11.4 years) who used the system for three months completed the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at the baseline and end of follow-up. Total System Usage (TSU) and Total Exercise Time (TET) were elucidated from the system web logs for each PwMS. A significant association (p<0.05) was found between PSQI sleep efficiency (SE) and TSU (0.76) and between SE and TET (0.81). The association between PSQI total score (TS) and TSU and between TS and TET were -0.507 and -0.702 respectively (p<0.05). Our results uncovered an association between amount of exercise time spent by PwMS and positive effects on both the efficiency and quality of sleep. Thus, further development of approaches promoting continuous participation of PwMS in telerehabilitation is warranted.;2020;4
The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to global pandemic affecting mental and physical well-being of people around the world. Given the highly contagious nature of COVID-19, public authorities in order to restrict the escalation of the virus ordered social lockdown and asked people to self-quarantine at homes if they develop any symptoms. As a result, these new social regulations have changed how individuals live and carry out everyday tasks in the general society. Reduced physical activity during lockdown has enhanced vulnerability to develop infections and non-communicable diseases. While on the other side, due to absence of routine medical surveillance, the condition of people with existing chronic conditions has deteriorated. Re-allocation of health care resources to treat COVID-19 patients put forward unprecedented challenge for the healthcare system in terms of providing medical support to non-infected out-patients. Extended social lockdowns are also causing adverse repercussions for physiotherapy and rehabilitation out-patient services. COVID-19 restrictions have hampered the in-person interaction of therapists and patients for in-person consultations and therapy sessions. Thus, leading to overall delay in the management and recovery of patients, especially those who are at a critical stage of treatment. During these unprecedented times of COVID-19 pandemic, provision of telehealth appeared to be the guiding light to tackle these evolving challenges of public health. Focusing on the out-patients who need close supervision for therapies and counselling, in this piece, I am arguing that methods of telemedicine and tele-rehabilitation should be actively adopted in the healthcare services to bridge the gap caused due to COVID-19.;2020;4
The use of videogames and motion capture systems in rehabilitation contributes to the recovery of the patient. This systematic review aimed to explore the works related to these technologies. The PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) was used to search the databases Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science, taking into consideration four aspects: physical rehabilitation, the use of videogames, motion capture technologies, and upper limb rehabilitation. The literature selection was limited to open access works published between 2015 and 2020, obtaining 19 articles that met the inclusion criteria. The works reported the use of inertial measurement units (37%), a Kinect sensor (48%), and other technologies (15%). It was identified that 26% used commercial products, while 74% were developed independently. Another finding was that 47% of the works focus on post-stroke motor recovery. Finally, diverse studies sought to support physical rehabilitation using motion capture systems incorporating inertial units, which offer precision and accessibility at a low cost. There is a clear need to continue generating proposals that confront the challenges of rehabilitation with technologies which offer precision and healthcare coverage, and which, additionally, integrate elements that foster the patient's motivation and participation.;2020;4
This article presents a new wearable platform, SeisMote, for the monitoring of cardiovascular function in controlled conditions and daily life. It consists of a wireless network of sensorized nodes providing simultaneous multiple measures of electrocardiogram (ECG), acceleration, rotational velocity, and photoplethysmogram (PPG) from different body areas. A custom low-power transmission protocol was developed to allow the concomitant real-time monitoring of 32 signals (16 bit @200 Hz) from up to 12 nodes with a jitter in the among-node time synchronization lower than 0.2 ms. The BluetoothLE protocol may be used when only a single node is needed. Data can also be collected in the off-line mode. Seismocardiogram and pulse transit times can be derived from the collected data to obtain additional information on cardiac mechanics and vascular characteristics. The employment of the system in the field showed recordings without data gaps caused by transmission errors, and the duration of each battery charge exceeded 16 h. The system is currently used to investigate strategies of hemodynamic regulation in different vascular districts (through a multisite assessment of ECG and PPG) and to study the propagation of precordial vibrations along the thorax. The single-node version is presently exploited to monitor cardiac patients during telerehabilitation.;2020;4
This paper describes the effects of a smartphone-based wearable telerehabilitation system (called Smarter Balance System, SBS) intended for in-home dynamic weight-shifting balance exercises (WSBEs) by individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Two individuals with idiopathic PD performed in-home dynamic WSBEs in anterior-posterior (A/P) and medial-lateral (M/L) directions, using the SBS 3 days per week for 6 weeks. Exercise performance was quantified by cross-correlation (XCORR) and position error (PE) analyses. Balance and gait performance and level of fear of falling were assessed by limit of stability (LOS), Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC), and Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) at the pre-(beginning of week 1), post-(end of week 6), and retention-(1 month after week 6) assessments. Regression analyses found that exponential trends of the XCORR and PE described exercise performance more effectively than linear trends. Range of LOS in both A/P and M/L directions improved at the post-assessment compared to the pre-assessment, and was retained at the retention assessment. The preliminary findings emphasize the advantages of wearable balance telerehabilitation technologies when performing in-home balance rehabilitation exercises.;2020;4
"This paper presents the design and development of an exergame for the wearable inertial sensor (WIS) system for performing range of motion (ROM) exercises. The salient features of the exergame include: (i) a sensor calibration user-interface (UI); (ii) a sensor mounting UI, (iii) a patient gaming UI; (iv) an instructor playback UI; and (v) an instructor exercise development UI. Along with the WIS system, the developed exergame UIs enable a user to perform ROM exercises in clinical and home-based environments. The exergame UIs can also be employed in a telerehabilitation setting for remote monitoring and assessment. Preliminary results on the efficacy of using the exergame environment is documented with: (i) sensor calibration time; (ii) sensor mounting and alignment time on the human body; and (iii) examination of user adherence to instructor programmed exercise routines.";2020;4
This study describes the understanding, experiences and expectations of families living in rural and remote Australia regarding core concepts relating to disability service provision, including person-centred practice (PCP), family-centred practice (FCP), transdisciplinary practice (TDP), choice, control, inclusion, and equity. Thirteen parents or carers, each with a child with an intellectual disability aged between 6 and 16 years, living in rural and remote areas as described by the Australian Standard Geographical Classification - Remoteness Area (ASGC-RA) and Modified Monash Model (MMM) - were recruited through distribution of flyers (hard copies or by email) to clinicians, schools, and advocacy agencies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants either in-person or via telephone between July and October 2015. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Participants reported that their understanding of many of the disability principles (PCP, FCP, choice, control, inclusion, and equity) was different from providers, and that many providers struggled to understand families, and therefore they did not share meaning of the principles of best practice disability supports. Families did not identify transdisciplinary practice as a core issue or tenet of effective service delivery. Families also reported experiences of missing out on services, feeling a sense of isolation in their communities, struggling to access skilled therapists, and difficulty finding supports and goals that were relevant to their child. The quality of supports that these families accessed was often below the standard that they expected. They did not expect that support standards will change in rural and remote Australia, so many have very low expectations of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) in the future. Although more data will need to be collected as the NDIS and its markets mature, these data show that many rural and remote participants and their supporters have a variety of concerns about how they will access quality allied health services through the Scheme.;2020;4
Toward reducing the effect of delay on motion transmission to a remote place, methods of forecasting human motion with subsecond preceding time have been studied. In this paper, we verified whether the prediction of single joint motion could be improved by using surface electromyography (EMG) signals. We used a recurrent neural network to predict the flexion and extension movement of a thigh, and compared the results between the prediction using only the angle and that using both the angle and EMG signals of two muscles. As a result, in the prediction of motion of about 0.5 Hz, the accuracy and delay of the prediction tended to be improved by using the EMG signals (e.g., in 0.3 s ahead prediction, the mean of the root-mean-square error between participants and trials is improved by 0.7 degrees, and that of the prediction delay is reduced by 0.045 s). Such motion forecasting using EMG signals may be useful for improving the operability and stability of medical robots in telerehabilitation and telesurgery.;2020;4
"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the most common cause of long-term disability and death among young adults. Innovation technology, with regard to telerehabilitation, may be of help in managing these frail patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether TBI patients and caregivers are able to properly use a Tele-rehabilitation device during hospitalization. Ten TBI subjects (5 males and 5 females; mean age of 45.7 +/- 14.4 years), and their caregivers (6 males and 4 females; mean age of 43.7 +/- 13.5 years) were consecutively recruited in this preliminary study. After 3 meetings with the telemedicine operators aimed to provide both patients and caregivers with the basic information for the proper use of the device, patients were submitted to 6 training sessions, provided 3 times per week for two weeks, each session lasting about one hour. The telerehabilitation simulation was carried out using the tele-cockpit station and the VRRS-Tablet, used either in the patient's room or in the institute's Family Room. The motivation during training was positive, as per the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory score: 202.6 for patients and 216 for caregivers. Participants also presented positive usability scores, as per the System Usability Scale score: 68 for patients and 69 for caregivers. Our feasibility and usability study supports the idea that in-patients with severe TBI could benefit from cognitive telerehabilitation performed in the pre-discharge phase, in order to get a higher level of adherence to the home tele-treatment and potentially better outcomes.

"Unilateral Cerebral Palsy (UCP), the most frequent form of Cerebral Palsy, usually affects more the upper limb (UL) than the lower limb. Rehabilitation programs are addressed to improve manual abilities and UL use. In recent years, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been introduced in rehabilitation to increase treatment opportunities for patients, and also in home-based intervention. Moreover, the discovery of the Mirror Neuron System allowed to insert a new paradigm of treatment that is the Action Observation Training (AOT). The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of a new rehabilitative home-based approach, called Tele-UPCAT (Tele-monitored UPper Limb Children Action Observation Training), based on the principles of AOT, in a group of Italian children and adolescents with UCP. This investigation was to provide information about the possibility of introducing ICT in telerehabilitation field. Twenty-nine children aged 11.73 +/- 3.65 years (range 6.00-18.75) with a diagnosis of UCP participated in the study. They carried out 15 days of training based on the AOT paradigm with Tele-UPCAT system while wearing Actigraphs on both wrists. The feasibility of both training and study design and procedures was assessed through nine criteria taken from existent literature and from a questionnaire designed and realized ad hoc for the purpose, based on standard items of usability and acceptability. All feasibility criteria were met: 80% of training sessions were completed in the planned time and no significant technical issues were found. From the questionnaire, total scores were all above 82.15%, while the four sections obtained the following scores: (i) customization of exercises 80.00%; (ii) acceptability at home, 77.50%; (iii) required effort 80.00%; and (iv) suitability of manual and software 95.00%. No differences were found for age and sex. Tele-UPCAT demonstrated to be feasible as a home-based AOT for children and adolescents with UCP. Trial registration NCT03094455.";2020;4
We describe the development and three case reports of a home-based intervention for children with hand hemiplegia that integrates custom video games with contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES). With CCFES, stimulated opening of the more-affected hand is modulated by volitional opening of the less-affected hand. Video games that solicit goal-oriented, skill-requiring movement have shown promise for treating hemiplegia, but they have not previously been combined with electrical stimulation in children. Three children ages 8, 9, and 11 with moderate-to-severe hand hemiplegia were assigned six weeks of therapy in lab and at home. The goal was to determine if children could tolerate 9 lab treatment sessions and administer up to 7.5 hrs/wk of CCFES video game therapy at home. The feasibility of this intervention for home use was assessed by device logs, end-of-treatment interviews, and motor function/impairment assessments. With caregiver help, the children were all able to attend 9 lab sessions and built up to 7.5 hrs/wk of therapy by week 3. They averaged 5-7 hrs/wk of home intervention overall. Motor outcomes improved for all three participants at treatment end, but mostly regressed at 4-weeks follow-up. Individual improvements at treatment end exceeded minimum detectable or clinically important thresholds for Assisting Hands Assessment, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and Melbourne Motor Assessment 2. We found preliminary indications that CCFES-integrated video game therapy can provide a high dose of hand motor control therapy at home and in the lab. Improvements in motor outcomes were also observed, but more development and study is needed.;2020;4
We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a probable COVID-19 infection in a 28-year-old man with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The diagnosis was established through a remote interaction with the patient after early discharge from outpatient therapy due to upcoming traveling restrictions. The COVID-19 disease appeared mild, without major respiratory problems, and no obvious neuromuscular deterioration was reported or observed. Telerehabilitation provided an opportunity to continue with hand rehabilitation after tendon transfer surgery, perform an ad-hoc online evaluation, and advise the patient how to prevent the spread of infection and cope with restrictions limiting outpatient visits. This experience seems valuable for further development of telerehabilitation in anticipation of future pandemics or adversarial events since it allows reaching out to patients unable to travel and overcomes the need for regular outpatient visits.;2020;4
"With a lot of uncertainty, unclear, and frequently changing management protocols, COVID-19 has significantly impacted the orthopaedic surgical practice during this pandemic crisis. Surgeons around the world needed closed introspection, contemplation, and prospective consensual recommendations for safe surgical practice and prevention of viral contamination. One hundred orthopaedic surgeons from 50 countries were sent a Google online form with a questionnaire explicating protocols for admission, surgeries, discharge, follow-up, relevant information affecting their surgical practices, difficulties faced, and many more important issues that happened during and after the lockdown. Ten surgeons critically construed and interpreted the data to form rationale guidelines and recommendations. Of the total, hand and microsurgery surgeons (52%), trauma surgeons (32%), joint replacement surgeons (20%), and arthroscopy surgeons (14%) actively participated in the survey. Surgeons from national public health care/government college hospitals (44%) and private/semiprivate practitioners (54%) were involved in the study. Countries had lockdown started as early as January 3, 2020 with the implementation of partial or complete lifting of lockdown in few countries while writing this article. Surgeons (58%) did not stop their surgical practice or clinics but preferred only emergency cases during the lockdown. Most of the surgeons (49%) had three-fourths reduction in their total patients turn-up and the remaining cases were managed by conservative (54%) methods. There was a 50 to 75% reduction in the number of surgeries. Surgeons did perform emergency procedures without COVID-19 tests but preferred reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; 77%) and computed tomography (CT) scan chest (12%) tests for all elective surgical cases. Open fracture and emergency procedures (60%) and distal radius (55%) fractures were the most commonly performed surgeries. Surgeons preferred full personal protection equipment kits (69%) with a respirator (N95/FFP3), but in the case of unavailability, they used surgical masks and normal gowns. Regional/local anesthesia (70%) remained their choice for surgery to prevent the aerosolized risk of contaminations. Essential surgical follow-up with limited persons and visits was encouraged by 70% of the surgeons, whereas teleconsultation and telerehabilitation by 30% of the surgeons. Despite the protective equipment, one-third of the surgeons were afraid of getting infected and 56% feared of infecting their near and dear ones. Orthopaedic surgeons in private practice did face 50 to 75% financial loss and have to furlough 25% staff and 50% paramedical persons. Orthopaedics meetings were cancelled, and virtual meetings have become the preferred mode of sharing the knowledge and experiences avoiding human contacts. Staying at home, reading, and writing manuscripts became more interesting and an interesting lifestyle change is seen among the surgeons. Unanimously and without any doubt all accepted the fact that COVID-19 pandemic has reached an unprecedented level where personal hygiene, hand washing, social distancing, and safe surgical practices are the viable antidotes, and they have all slowly integrated these practices into their lives. Strict adherence to local authority recommendations and guidelines, uniform and standardized norms for admission, inpatient, and discharge, mandatory RT-PCR tests before surgery and in selective cases with CT scan chest, optimizing and regularizing the surgeries, avoiding and delaying nonemergency surgeries and follow-up protocols, use of teleconsultations cautiously, and working in close association with the World Health Organization and national health care systems will provide a conducive and safe working environment for orthopaedic surgeons and their fraternity and also will prevent the resurgence of COVID-19.";2020;4
Within rheumatology, telehealth is essential to modern rehabilitation due to the demographic development with more and more elderly people. At present, telehealth solutions are used as part of the rehabilitation process in assessment, interventions and evaluation. Telehealth interventions are as effective as conventional follow-ups or self-management assessments, but the evidence on the effect is still sparse. Telehealth interventions seem to support a physically active lifestyle in the short term. In general, telehealth solutions are well received by patients, but the development must be based on user involvement, behaviour theory and the World Health Organisation principles of creating health literate organisations in order to ensure usability, effectiveness and further implementation.

(1) Background: Due to the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, rehabilitation centres have become less available for neurological patients. This is the result of efforts to physically distance society, to try to slow the spread of the pathogen. Health care facilities were mainly restricted to urgent cases, while most physiotherapy treatments, mainly for patients with chronic conditions, were suspended. Some countries have seen a reduction in acute stroke hospital admissions of from 50% to 80%. One solution to the above problem is the use of telerehabilitation in the home environment as an alternative to inpatient rehabilitation. (2) Aim of the study: The purpose of this review is to analyse the benefits and limitations of teletherapy in relation to the functional condition of post-stroke patients. (3) Methods: Selected publications from 2019 to 2021 on the telerehabilitation of stroke patients were reviewed. The review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. (4) Results: Studies have proven that teletherapy significantly improves the functional condition of post-stroke patients, resulting in improved quality of life and faster return to independence (while maintaining maximum possible precautions related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic). (5) Conclusions: Analysis of the study results showed comparable effectiveness of rehabilitation in the tele system to inpatient therapy. However, it should be emphasised that patients undergoing telerehabilitation must meet strict conditions to be eligible for this type of treatment program. However, the strength of the evidence itself supporting the effectiveness of this method ranks low due to the limited number of randomised control trials (RCT), small number of participants, and heterogeneous trials.;2021;4
(1) Background: Using new technologies to manage home exercise programmes is an approach that allows more patients to benefit from therapy. The objective of this study is to explore physical therapists' opinions of the efficacy and disadvantages of implementing a web-based telerehabilitation programme for treating chronic low back pain (CLBP). (2) Methods: Nineteen physical therapists from academic and healthcare fields in both the public and private sector participated in the qualitative study. Texts extracted from a transcript of semi-structured, individual, in-depth interviews with each consenting participant were analysed to obtain the participants' prevailing opinions. The interviews lasted approximately 40 min each. The participants' responses were recorded. (3) Results: The results suggest that telerehabilitation can only be successful if patients become actively involved in their own treatment. However, exercise programmes for LBP are not always adapted to patient preferences. New technologies allow physical therapists to provide their patients with the follow-up and remote contact they demand, but long-term adherence to treatment stems from knowledge of the exercises and the correct techniques employed by the patients themselves. (4) Conclusions: Physical therapists treating patients with chronic non-specific low back pain believe that new technologies can provide highly effective means of reaching a greater number of patients and achieving significant savings in healthcare costs, despite the limitations of a telerehabilitation approach in developing an appropriate and effective patient-based physiotherapy programme.;2021;4
>> Telemedicine and remote care administered through technology are among the fastest growing sectors in health care. The utilization and implementation of virtual-care technologies have further been accelerated with the recent COVID-19 pandemic. >> Remote, technology-based patient care is not a one-size-fits-all solution for all medical and surgical conditions, as each condition presents unique hurdles, and no true consensus exists regarding the efficacy of telemedicine across surgical fields. >> When implementing virtual care in orthopaedics, as with standard in-person care, it is important to have a well-defined team structure with a deliberate team selection process. As always, a team with a shared vision for the care they provide as well as a supportive and incentivized environment are integral for the success of the virtual-care mechanism. >> Future studies should assess the impact of primarily virtual, integrated, and multidisciplinary team-based approaches and systems of care on patient outcomes, health-care expenditure, and patient satisfaction in the orthopaedic population.;2021;4
A formal unsupervised activity program should be recommended to all patients recovering from total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). In a subset of all patients undergoing TKA or THA, studies have found that an unsupervised activity programmay be as efficacious as supervised physical therapy (PT) after surgery. Certain patients with inadequate independent function may continue to benefit from supervised PT. For TKA, supervised telerehabilitation has also been proven to be an effective modality, with studies suggesting equivalent efficacy compared with supervised in-person PT. Following TKA, there is no benefit to the use of continuous passive motion or cryotherapy devices, but there are promising benefits from the use of pedaling exercises, weight training, and balance and/or sensorimotor training as adjuncts to a multidisciplinary program after TKA. No standardized postoperative limitations exist following TKA, and the return to preoperative activities should be dictated by an individual's competency and should consist of methods to minimize high impact stress on the joint. Despite traditional postoperative protocols recommending range-of-motion restrictions after THA, it is reasonable to recommend that hip precautions may not be needed routinely following elective primary THA.;2021;4
A large body of research supports the use of exercise to improve symptoms, quality of life, and physical function in patients with chronic heart failure. Previous reviews have focused on reporting outcomes of exercise interventions such as cardiorespiratory fitness. However, none have critically examined exercise prescription. The aim of this review was to evaluate the reporting and application of exercise principles in randomised control trials of exercise training in patients with chronic heart failure. A systematic review of exercise intervention RCTs in patients with CHF, using the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT), was undertaken. The Ovid Medline/PubMed, Embase, Scopus/Web of Science, and Cochrane Library and Health Technology Assessment Databases were searched from 2000 to June 2020. Prospective RCTs in which patients with CHF were randomized to a structured exercise programme were included. No limits were placed on the type or duration of exercise structured exercise programme or type of CHF (i.e. preserved or reduced ejection fraction). We included 143 studies, comprising of 181 different exercise interventions. The mean CERT score was 10 out of 19, with no study achieving a score of 19. Primarily, details were missing regarding motivational strategies, home-based exercise components, and adherence/fidelity to the intervention. Exercise intensity was the most common principle of exercise prescription missing from intervention reporting. There was no improvement in the reporting of exercise interventions with time (R-2 = 0.003). Most RCTs of exercise training in CHF are reported with insufficient detail to allow for replication, limiting the translation of evidence to clinical practice. We encourage authors to provide adequate details when reporting future interventions. Where journal word counts are restrictive, we recommend using supplementary material or publishing trial protocols prior to beginning the study.;2021;4
Adherence to home exercise programs (HEPs) during physical rehabilitation is usually unmonitored and is thought to be low from self-reports. This article describes exploratory implementation of a Sensor Enhanced Activity Management (SEAM) system that combines HEP management software with a movement sensor for monitoring and motivating HEP adherence. The article also presents results from attempting to gain reimbursement for home use of the system with therapist oversight using Remote Physiologic Monitoring (RPM) codes. Four therapists used the system in their regular practice during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therapists filled out surveys, kept notes, and participated in interviews. Billing and reimbursement data were obtained from the treatment facility. Exercise data from the SEAM system were used to understand HEP adherence. Patients were active for a mean of 40% (26% SD) of prescribed days and completed a mean of 25% (25% SD) of prescribed exercises. The therapists billed 23 RPM codes (USD 2353), and payers reimbursed eight of those instances (USD 649.21). The therapists reported that remote monitoring and the use of a physical movement sensor was motivating to their patients and increased adherence. Sustained technical support for therapists will likely improve implementation of new remote monitoring and treatment systems. RPM codes may enable reimbursement for review and program management activities, but, despite COVID-19 CMS waivers, organizations may have more success if these services are billed under supervision of a physician.</p>;2021;4
After the appearance of COVID-19, the clinical and professional activities of private clinics and public health systems were challenged. Tele rehabilitation system is required to provide rehabilitation services during the COVID 19 pandemic. Tele-rehabilitation services are available for many years, for which necessary infrastructure, laws, and instructions have been considered, but in Iran, there are no regulations or instructions for telerehabilitation services. Professional associations and boards can play an important role in drafting these rules. The COVID-19 can be a good opportunity to start telerehabilitation in Iran.;2021;4
"Aims Overweight increases the risk of recurrence and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF). This study assesses the knowledge of overweight AF patients about the relation between their weight and AF, to gauge their motivation losing weight and/or following weight reduction programs. Methods A multicenter cross-sectional descriptive study was performed at three Belgian hospitals. A validated self-developed questionnaire was presented to AF patients with a body mass index (BMI) >27 kg/m(2) and it addressed: motivation to reduce weight and its related factors; knowledge about the relation between weight and AF; and interest in weight reduction programs. Results One hundred and forty-three patients completed the questionnaire. 75.5% was currently motivated to reduce weight. Multivariate regression analysis showed that a higher BMI, a college/university degree, male gender, without hypertension, previous weight loss attempt(s) and living with a partner, were significantly associated with greater motivation for weight reduction. Only 69.9% of the patients was aware of the positive effect of weight reduction on the progression of AF. A completely home-based/telerehabilitation program was the preferred approach for 57.9% of the patients. Conclusions AF patients with overweight need to be better informed about overweight as a risk factor for AF. Female AF patients with a lower degree of education, hypertension, living alone, who have never attempted to reduce weight and with a lower but still elevated BMI need more external motivation to lose weight. A tailored weight reduction program (home-based) is the preferred option for patients. This will require further development and validation of telecoaching programs for this patient group.";2021;4
"Aims The aim of our study was to analyse the benefits of a 9 week hybrid comprehensive telerehabilitation (HCTR) programme in heart failure (HF) patients according to aetiology, as a subanalysis of the Telerehabilitation in Heart Failure Patients (TELEREH-HF) trial. Methods and results Overall, 555 (65.3%) patients with ischaemic (IS) and 295 (34.7%) patients with non-ischaemic (NIS) HF aetiology were randomized. There were no differences between the effect of HCTR and usual care (UC) on the primary outcome of number of days alive and out of the hospital in 26 months from the time of randomization in either aetiology (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test), and no heterogeneity of effect between the aetiologies was noted (van Elteren test, P = 0.746). In Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, treatment was not independently associated with the secondary outcomes. For all-cause mortality, the adjusted hazard ratio for HCTR vs. UC was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.51) in IS and 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-2.94) in NIS (P interaction = 0.316). Differences between HCTR and UC in terms of change in the 6 min walk test distance and cardiopulmonary exercise test time after 9 weeks reached statistical significance in the IS arm (P = 0.015 and P < 0.001, respectively), but not in the NIS arm; however, tests of heterogeneity indicated no statistically significant differences. Conclusions The trial showed no difference between HCTR and UC in the primary outcome of percentage of days alive and out of the hospital for either IS or NIS aetiology. Moreover, the magnitude of changes in the clinical and functional statuses of the HF patients did not differ by aetiology. HCTR might have had beneficial effects on the 6 min walk test distance and cardiopulmonary exercise test time after 9 weeks in the IS patients; however, the effect was not statistically significantly different from that observed in the NIS patients.";2021;4
"Aims The purpose is to determine the non-inferiority of a smartphone-based exercise educational care management system after primary knee arthroplasty compared with a traditional in-person physiotherapy rehabilitation model. Methods A multicentre prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted evaluating the use of a smartphone-based care management system for primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and partial knee arthroplasty (PKA). Patients in the control group (n = 244) received the respective institution's standard of care with formal physiotherapy. The treatment group (n = 208) were provided a smartwatch and smartphone application. Early outcomes assessed included 90-day knee range of movement, EuroQoL five-dimension five-level score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS JR) score, 30-day single leg stance (SLS) time, Time up and Go (TUG) time, and need for manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA). Results Overall, 90-day mean flexion was not significantly different between the control (121 degrees (SD 11.7 degrees)) and treatment groups (121 degrees; p = 0.559); 90-day mean SLS was 22.7 seconds (SD 9.8) in controls and 24.3 seconds (SD 20.8) in treatment (p = 0.519); 90-day mean TUG times were 10.1 seconds (SD 4.8) in control and 9.3 seconds (SD 3.3) in treatment (p = 0.139). Mean KOOS JR scores were significantly different between control group (73.6 (SD 13.4)) and treatment group (70.4 (SD 12.6); p = 0.026). MUAs were performed in nine (3.7%) patients in the control group and four (1.9%) in the treatment group (p = 0.398). Physiotherapy was performed by 230 (94.4%) of control group and 123 (59.3%) of treatment group (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between groups in postoperative urgent care visits, or readmissions within 90 days, with significantly fewer emergency department visits in the treatment group (16 (8.2%) vs five (2.5%), p = 0.014). Conclusion The use of the smartwatch/smartphone care platform demonstrated non-inferiority of clinically significant outcomes to traditional care models, while requiring significantly less postoperative physiotherapy and fewer emergency department visits. This platform could aid in decreasing postoperative costs, while improving patient engagement and communication with the healthcare team.";2021;4
"Aims: We aimed to identify the significant predictors of ecological memory amelioration after the Human Empowerment Aging and Disability (HEAD) rehabilitation program, a multidimensional treatment for chronic neurological diseases. Materials and Methods: Ninety-three patients with Parkinson disease (n = 29), multiple sclerosis (n = 26), and stroke (n = 38) underwent a multidimensional rehabilitation. We focused on changes after treatment on ecological memory (outcome measure) evaluated by Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test, Third Edition (RBMT-3). Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) after treatment were calculated for RBMT-3. The change score on RBMT-3 was categorized in positive effect, stabilization, or no effect of the treatment. Random forest classification identified who significantly benefited from treatment against who did not in terms of ecological memory functioning. Accordingly, logistic regression models were created to identify the best predictors of the treatment effect. A predicted probability value was derived, and the profile of the ideal candidate of HEAD protocol was shown by combining different ranks of significant predictors in a 3 x 3 matrix for each pair of predictors. Results: A significant number of cases reported positive effect of the treatment on ecological memory, with an amelioration over the MCID or a stabilization. The random forest analysis highlighted a discrete accuracy of prediction (>0.60) for all the variables considered at baseline for identifying participants who significantly benefited and who did not from the treatment. Significant logistic regression model (Wald method) showed a predictive role of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; p = 0.007), 2-Minute Walk Test (2MWT; p = 0.038), and RBMT-3 (p < 0.001) at baseline on HEAD treatment effect. Finally, we observed a high probability of success in people with higher residual cognitive functioning (MoCA; odds ratio = 1.306) or functional mobility (2MWT; odds ratio = 1.013). Discussion: The HEAD program is a rehabilitation with effects on multiple domains, including ecological memory. Residual level of cognitive and/or motor functioning is a significant predictor of the treatment success. These findings confirm the intrinsic relationship subsisting between motor and cognitive functions and suggest the beneficial effects of physical activity on cognitive functions and vice versa.";2021;4
Aphasia is one of the most common clinical features of functional impairment after a stroke. Approximately 21-40% of stroke patients sustain permanent aphasia, which progressively worsens one's quality of life and rehabilitation outcomes. Post-stroke aphasia treatment strategies include speech language therapies, cognitive neurorehabilitation, telerehabilitation, computer-based management, experimental pharmacotherapy, and physical medicine. This review focuses on current evidence of the effectiveness of impairment-based aphasia therapies and communication-based therapies (as well as the timing and optimal treatment intensities for these interventions). Moreover, we present specific interventions, such as constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) and melodic intonation therapy (MIT). Accumulated data suggest that using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is safe and can be used to modulate cortical excitability. Therefore, we review clinical studies that present TMS and tDCS as (possible) promising therapies in speech and language recovery, stimulating neuroplasticity. Several drugs have been used in aphasia pharmacotherapy, but evidence from clinical studies suggest that only nootropic agents, donepezil and memantine, may improve the prognosis of aphasia. This article is an overview on the current state of knowledge related to post-stroke aphasia pharmacology, rehabilitation, and future trends.;2021;4
As the number of stroke survivors is continuously growing, with an important number suffering from consequent functional deficits, the rehabilitation field is facing more complex demands. Technological progress gives us the opportunity to remotely assist patients while they exercise at home through telerehabilitation (TR), addressing the problems of limited medical resources and staff, difficult transportation, or living a long distance from rehabilitation centers. In addition, TR is a way to provide continuity in long-term post-stroke recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic, which limits traveling and human interaction. While the implementation of TR is increasing, the biggest challenges are to raise patients' acceptability of the new method and their motivation and engagement during the program. In this review, we aimed to find methods to address these challenges by identifying the patients who benefit the most from this therapy and efficiently organizing the space and technology used for telerehabilitation. User-friendly technologies and devices along with therapists' constant support and feedback are some of the most important aspects that make TR an efficient intervention and an alternative to conventional therapy.</p>;2021;4
"Background and Objective Explosion in information technology knowledge and utilization among young people, referred to as digital natives, seems less explored in the health sector and training. This study was aimed to assess awareness, attitude and expectations of physiotherapy students on telerehabilitation. Methods This cross-sectional survey employed systematic probability sampling technique to recruit 200 physiotherapy students. A self-developed questionnaire which was tested for its face and content validity was used to obtain data. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at p < 0.05. Results The mean age of the respondents was 21.2 +/- 2.04 years. There was higher prevalence of moderate awareness (43%) and positive attitude towards telerehabilitation (39%). Majority of the respondents (62%) had high expectation towards future telerehabilitation products and services. There was significant association between level of awareness of telerehabilitation and age (X-2 = 7.119; p = 0.001). Discussion The responding students in this study are by age in the class of digital natives, who should be conversant with technology. This could account for the higher moderate level of awareness of telerehabilitation. However, the higher rates of negative attitude towards telerehabilitation could be attributed to prevailing barriers to its utilization in Nigeria. Nonetheless, a large percentage of the students had high expectations for the future of telerehabilitation. Conclusion Nigerian physiotherapy students have moderate awareness and high expectation for future telerehabilitation applications. However, a larger number of them hold negative attitude towards it use.";2021;4
Background and objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a challenge for health systems and, specifically, to physical therapists obligated to adapt their job and stop face-to-face consultations. In this situation, therapeutic exercise has been implemented in different COVID-19 patients. This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel therapeutic exercise program through telerehabilitation tools in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptomatology in the acute stage. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 subjects were randomized an experimental group, based on muscle conditioning, and in a control group, who did not perform physical activity. Thirty-six subjects, 18 in each group, completed the one-week intervention. We measured the six-minute walking test, multidimensional dyspnoea-12, thirty seconds sit-to-stand test, and Borg Scale. Results: Both groups were comparable at baseline. Statistically significant improvement between groups (p < 0.05) in favor of the experimental group was obtained. No differences between gender were found (p > 0.05). Ninety percent adherence was found in our program. Conclusion: A one-week telerehabilitation program based on muscle toning exercise is effective, safe, and feasible in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptomatology in the acute stage.;2021;4
"Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic required the adoption of new technologies to improve access to healthcare at an unprecedented speed, as social distancing became mandatory. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the effectiveness of using new technologies in the rehabilitation of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and discuss their potential role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: The studies were identified by searching two online databases-PUBMED and Web of Science. Combinations of the key words Multiple sclerosis and e-health; Multiple sclerosis and virtual reality; Multiple sclerosis and telerehabilitation; Multiple sclerosis and new technologies; Multiple sclerosis and tele-exercise were used to find suitable publications. Results: A total of 17 studies were included. Although the overall number of participants in all the studies was 904, two of the studies were conducted on the same group. Thus, a total of 854 participants were involved in the studies included. All participants were diagnosed with MS. In 10 studies, participants had to be diagnosed according to the McDonald criteria. Of the included studies: five involved intervention at participants' home, six were conducted using Xbox Kinect, and seven studies reported no adverse outcomes. Conclusion: The review proves telerehabilitation to be an effective motivational tool to restore and maintain both physical and cognitive function in patients with MS. Remote communication technologies seem to be measures of high effectiveness in rehabilitating and supporting MS patients especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the traditional rehabilitation option is less accessible or in some cases inaccessible for these patients.";2021;4
Background Aphasia negatively impacts face-to-face social participation and the difficulties that people experience using the phone exacerbate these challenges in staying in touch with family and friends. Videoconferencing enables multimodal communication, and teamed with supported conversation, could facilitate access to conversation and thereby increase social participation for people with chronic aphasia. Aims This pilot study examined whether supported conversation provided over Skype could improve people's social participation. It reports on preliminary outcomes of this intervention on people's social network, communication confidence, aphasia-related quality of life, and mood. Methods & Procedures 29 participants with chronic aphasia received an initial 2-h technology training session followed by 16 h of online-supportedThe intervention was personalised by individualising goals in technology, communication, and participation. An observational prospective cohort study design was used with baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 8-week follow-up assessments. Measures of social network and communication confidence (primary outcome measures), and aphasia-related quality of life, life participation, and mood (secondary outcome measures) were undertaken. Shapiro-Wilk tests were conducted to examine normality of distribution of each variable. Where data were normally distributed, one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to examine the effect of time. Where data were not normally distributed, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used. Outcomes & Results: 27 participants completed the intervention. As a group, participants reported significantly more social contacts, more life participation, and higher aphasia-related quality of life post-intervention, which were maintained. There was a group gain on the measure of communication confidence post-intervention, although this was not maintained. As a group, the participants' mood did not significantly change through intervention and follow-up. Individual variability was noted across all outcome measures. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that relatively low dose and non-intensive online supported conversation for participation intervention delivered by qualified or student speech and language therapists improved social participation in some people with aphasia and improved their quality of life. Communication confidence also improved for some, although benefits were short term. Findings make novel contributions to the existing supported conversation evidence base with positive social participation and quality of life outcomes, likely achieved by the explicit participation focus. Whilst preliminary findings are positive, study limitations need addressing. Further investigations are merited to refine the intervention and outcome measure choice and capture feasibility data. Finally, a definitive controlled trial is needed to explore the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.;2021;4
"Background Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are conditions characterized by a variable progression. Some individuals experience longer asymptomatic periods while others acute worsening periods and/or exacerbations triggered by symptom multiplication factors. Medications are adjusted to the patients' respiratory function, self-assessment of health and emerging certain physical changes. A more effective treatment may be applied by real-time data registered during the patient's everyday life. Aim and methods Introducing new modern digital technology in pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) to help tracking the patients' medication, thus we systematically reviewed the latest publications on telemedicine and pulmonary telerehabilitation. Conclusion The use of the latest digital technologies in PR is very exciting and offers great opportunities while treating patients affected by specific conditions. On the one hand, adherence to medication can be improved in patients with chronic respiratory diseases by using these new state of the art devices; on the other hand, digital devices will also be able to monitor various physiological parameters of patients during their usual everyday activities. Data can be stored on a smartphone and shared with the provider. Relying on this information, physicians will be able to tailor medications and dosage to the specific needs of individual patients. Telerehabilitation may be a sustainable solution to the growing burden of chronic respiratory disease worldwide. However, PR must keep its cornerstones, such as education and motivations, which are most successful when conducted in person. Many issues remain to be resolved in the future, e.g. cybersecurity while using smart devices since they offer unique opportunities for PR.";2021;4
Background Balance disorders are common in patients with neurological or vestibular diseases. Telerehabilitation program is a treatment to be as safe as conventional treatment. One of the most used methods to perform telerehabilitation is the incorporation of Virtual Reality. In general, rehabilitation programs train predictive postural control, so the patient does not always acquire the necessary autonomy to react to situations of instability. On the other hand, the objective and systematic supervision and measurement of these programs is limited, making it necessary to create clinical protocols with precise and measurable rehabilitation objectives. This study present the training selection methodology and clinical protocol for patients with balance disorders inserted in a Telerehabilitation Program based on Virtual Reality. Methods Descriptive study where physiotherapists were trained to use RehaMetrics (R). To evaluate their level of agreement in the selection of the exercise clusters developed, the Interobserver Reliability was measured through the kappa statistic. Subsequently, the exercises were applied to a group of patients recruited with sedentary trunk control (Berg Balance Scale = 3 points in item 3), mild or normal cognitive level (Montreal Cognitive Assessment> 21 points), and prescribed for tele-rehabilitation by a doctor. Results The agreement among the expert physiotherapists irrespective of the cluster exceeds 80%, which indicates a very good strength of agreement, while the novices reached a level of agreement of 45%, which suggests a moderate strength of agreement. All clinical outcomes showed statistically significant differences between the median times, as did the Maximum Width Left Side (MWLS) (cm). The average number of minutes of training was 485.81 (SD 246.49 min), and the number of sessions performed during the 4 weeks of intervention was 17 (SD 7.15 sessions). Conclusions This analysis what had excellent interobserver reliability with trained physiotherapists. Regarding the second phase of the study, the results show a statistically significant difference between the initial and final evaluation of the clinical tests, which could result in better performance in aspects such as: balance, gait functionality, meter walked and cognition. Telerehabilitation Program based on Virtual Reality is an excellent alternative to provide continuity of treatment to patients with balance disorders.;2021;4
Background By examining the health needs of the general population and utilising the potential of digitalisation as a driving force, new internet-based services need to be developed in occupational therapy. However, existing guidelines for the development of complex interventions provide scant information on how to develop internet-based interventions. Aim The aim of this paper is to share experiences and illustrate important key actions and new perspectives to consider during the innovation process of developing and designing an internet-based occupational therapy intervention. Method and Materials International guidelines for intervention development was reviewed to add important perspectives in the innovation process. Results The illustration focuses on five key actions in the development phase to highlight new perspectives and questions important to consider when designing new internet-based occupational therapy interventions. Conclusion The new perspectives can complement existing guidelines to enhance the development of more effective and sustainable internet-based interventions. Significance The illustration provided has potential to improve the sustainability in innovation processes of new internet-based occupational therapy interventions.;2021;4
Background Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disease characterized by gradual loss of motor function, respiratory failure and cardiomyopathy. During the time of the global coronavirus pandemic, maintenance of social distancing and self-isolation might complicate regular multidisciplinary care of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy but on the other hand may lead to new medical care telehealth solutions. The aim of the study was to investigate patients' situation regarding rehabilitation in the pandemic, to establish an online rehabilitation program and motor assessment and to determine the needs of telerehabilitation in this group. Methods The project involved 69 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The rehabilitation program was presented during online workshops for patients and caregivers. The same program was recorded on video and published in the internet. The online motor assessment tool consisted of six motor tests, caregivers were asked to perform the tasks and share a photograph of the patient's posture using a designed app. Results In the nonambulant group the emphasis was placed on chest physiotherapy, stretching of upper extremities, positioning and wheelchair ergonomics. The program for the ambulant group focused on lower extremities stretching and full body exercises. Response rate for the workshops for ambulant patients was 29.7%, and only 9.0% for nonambulant patients. Videos showing exercises were displayed 132 times within a month. Conclusion With the physiotherapist guidance (online communication or video) patients with caregivers' help can continue home based rehabilitation. Online videos/instructions/video guidelines are more acceptable by parents/caregivers of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy than live workshops.;2021;4
Background Exercise training in heart failure (HF) patients should be monitored to ensure patients' safety. Electrocardiographic (ECG) telemonitoring was used to assess the safety of hybrid comprehensive telerehabilitation (HCTR). Objective Analysis of ECG recorded during HCTR in HF patients. Methods The TELEREH-HF multicenter, randomized, controlled trial enrolled 850 HF patients with New York Heart Association class I-III and left ventricular ejection fraction of <= 40%. This subanalysis focuses on 386 patients (aged 62 +/- 11 years, LVEF 31 +/- 7%) randomized to HCTR. HCTR was telemonitored with a device allowing to record 16-s fragments of ECG and to transmit the data via mobile phone network to the monitoring center. ResultsIn 386 patients, 16,622 HCTR sessions were recorded and 66,488 ECGs fragments were evaluated. Sinus rhythm was present in 320 (83%) and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) in 66 (17%) patients, respectively. The most common arrhythmias were ventricular and atrial premature beats, recorded in 76.4% and 27.7% of the patients, respectively. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (21 episodes in 8 patients) and paroxysmal AF episodes (6 in 4 patients) were rare. None of the analyzed demographic and clinical characteristics was predictive for onset of the new arrhythmias on exercise. Conclusion Telerehabilitation in HF patients was safe without the evidence for symptomatic arrhythmias requiring discontinuation of telerehabilitation. Only one mildly symptomatic paroxysmal AF episode led to the short-term suspension of the training program. The most common arrhythmias were atrial and ventricular premature beats. These arrhythmias did not result in any changes in rehabilitation and therapy regimens.;2021;4
"Background Manual treadmill training is used for rehabilitating locomotor impairments but can be physically demanding for trainers. This has been addressed by enlisting robots, but in doing so, the ability of trainers to use their experience and judgment to modulate locomotor assistance on the fly has been lost. This paper explores the feasibility of a telerobotics approach for locomotor training that allows patients to receive remote physical assistance from trainers. Methods In the approach, a trainer holds a small robotic manipulandum that shadows the motion of a large robotic arm magnetically attached to a locomoting patient's leg. When the trainer deflects the manipulandum, the robotic arm applies a proportional force to the patient. An initial evaluation of the telerobotic system's transparency (ability to follow the leg during unassisted locomotion) was performed with two unimpaired participants. Transparency was quantified by the magnitude of unwanted robot interaction forces. In a small six-session feasibility study, six individuals who had prior strokes telerobotically interacted with two trainers (separately), who assisted in altering a targeted gait feature: an increase in the affected leg's swing length. Results During unassisted walking, unwanted robot interaction forces averaged 3-4 N (swing-stance) for unimpaired individuals and 2-3 N for the patients who survived strokes. Transients averaging about 10 N were sometimes present at heel-strike/toe-off. For five of six patients, these forces increased with treadmill speed during stance (R-2 = .99; p < 0.001) and increased with patient height during swing (R-2 = .71; p = 0.073). During assisted walking, the trainers applied 3.0 +/- 2.8 N (mean +/- standard deviation across patients) and 14.1 +/- 3.4 N of force anteriorly and upwards, respectively. The patients exhibited a 20 +/- 21% increase in unassisted swing length between Days 1-6 (p = 0.058). Conclusions The results support the feasibility of locomotor assistance with a telerobotics approach. Simultaneous measurement of trainer manipulative actions, patient motor responses, and the forces associated with these interactions may prove useful for testing sensorimotor rehabilitation hypotheses. Further research with clinicians as operators and randomized controlled trials are needed before conclusions regarding efficacy can be made.";2021;4
"Background Most stroke survivors have sustained upper limb impairment in their distal joints. An electromyography (EMG)-driven wrist/hand exoneuromusculoskeleton (WH-ENMS) was developed previously. The present study investigated the feasibility of a home-based self-help telerehabilitation program assisted by the aforementioned EMG-driven WH-ENMS and its rehabilitation effects after stroke. Methods Persons with chronic stroke (n = 11) were recruited in a single-group trial. The training progress, including the training frequency and duration, was telemonitored. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Improvement in muscle coordination was investigated in terms of the EMG activation level and the Co-contraction Index (CI) of the target muscles, including the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), flexor carpi radialis-flexor digitorum (FCR-FD), extensor carpi ulnaris-extensor digitorum (ECU-ED), biceps brachii (BIC), and triceps brachii (TRI). The movement smoothness and compensatory trunk movement were evaluated in terms of the following two kinematic parameters: number of movement units (NMUs) and maximal trunk displacement (MTD). The above evaluations were conducted before and after the training. Results All of the participants completed the home-based program with an intensity of 63.0 +/- 1.90 (mean +/- SD) min/session and 3.73 +/- 0.75 (mean +/- SD) sessions/week. After the training, motor improvements in the entire upper limb were found, as indicated by the significant improvements (P < 0.05) in the FMA, ARAT, WMFT, and MAS; significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the EMG activation levels of the APB and FCR-FD; significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the CI of the ECU-ED/FCR-FD, ECU-ED/BIC, FCR-FD/APB, FCR-FD/BIC, FCR-FD/TRI, APB/BIC and BIC/TRI muscle pairs; and significant reductions (P < 0.05) in the NMUs and MTD. Conclusions The results suggested that the home-based self-help telerehabilitation program assisted by EMG-driven WH-ENMS is feasible and effective for improving the motor function of the paretic upper limb after stroke.

Background Patient interest and demand may have an impact on dictating the scope of orthopedic telehealth utilization beyond the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The purpose of this study was to assess whether current interest in orthopedic telehealth services is higher than pre-pandemic levels. Specific trends in interest, subspecialty differences, and regional differences were secondarily assessed. Methodology A Google Trends search was performed to assess orthopedic telehealth search interest over the last five years using the terms Orthopedic surgeon/doctor/injury/pain + Telehealth as well as subspecialty-specific terms. The results were formulated into combined search interest values (CSIVs), with a maximum possible value of 400, and compared between the pre-pandemic period, pre-vaccine period during the pandemic, and post-vaccine period. Results The pre-pandemic period mean CSIV was 40.3 (SD = 6.3), compared to 134.7 (SD = 72.1) during the pre-vaccine period, and 96.3 (SD = 4.4) during the post-vaccine period (p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between CSIV and time (increasing weeks) during the pre-pandemic period (r(s) = .77, p < 0.001) and no significant correlation between CSIV and time during the post-vaccine period (r(s) = -.12, p = 0.610). Using the slope of the interest line during the post-vaccine period (y = 97.06 - 0.08x) it would take an additional 13.3 years beyond the study period to reach the mean pre-pandemic CSIV level of 40.3. Hand surgery was the subspecialty with the highest mean CSIV over the study period and general search interest was highest in Northeastern and Southeastern states during the post-vaccine period. Conclusions Orthopedic telehealth interest was growing before the COVID-19 pandemic and remains significantly elevated beyond pre-pandemic levels despite the reopening of clinical offices and vaccine availability across the country. It appears that a subset of patients will continue to seek telehealth services beyond the pandemic.;2021;4
"Background Poor gait and static balance performance may be associated with trunk muscles in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Aim The study aims at evaluating the effects of a home-based trunk exercise program on gait and balance performance in Parkinson's disease. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 28 individuals with Parkinson's disease with Hoehn & Yahr stage II-IV. The control group (n = 14) performed upper and lower limb exercises, while the experimental group (n = 14) engaged in a trunk exercise program. Both groups performed home-based exercises three times daily for 3 weeks. At the end of interventions (post-training) and 4 weeks after post-training (follow-up), static balance (force plate) and gait (motion capture system) were evaluated. Mixed analysis of variance compared time x group interaction (alpha = 5%). Results No time x group interaction was observed in the center of pressure displacement, center of pressure mean velocity, and anteroposterior and mediolateral center of pressure range during bipedal support with eyes opened and closed; and gait speed, hip, knee, and ankle range of motion during gait analysis. No intragroup differences were found. Conclusion Trunk strengthening exercises did not improve gait and balance compared with upper and lower limb exercises. The non-adherence rate (33%) to the remote intervention may have also hindered our results.";2021;4
"Background Pulmonary rehabilitation benefits patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but gains are not maintained over time. Maintenance pulmonary rehabilitation has been defined as ongoing supervised exercise at a lower frequency than the initial pulmonary rehabilitation programme. It is not yet known whether a maintenance programme can preserve the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation over time. Studies of maintenance programmes following pulmonary rehabilitation are heterogeneous, especially regarding supervision frequency. Furthermore, new maintenance models (remote and home-based) are emerging. Objectives To determine whether supervised pulmonary rehabilitation maintenance programmes improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL), exercise performance, and health care utilisation in COPD patients compared with usual care. Secondly, to examine in subgroup analyses the impact of supervision frequency and model (remote or in-person) during the supervised maintenance programme. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, and two additional trial registries platforms up to 31 March 2020, without restriction by language or type of publication. We screened the reference lists of all primary studies for additional references. We also hand-searched conference abstracts and grey literature through the Cochrane Airways Trials Register and CENTRAL. Selection criteria We included only randomised trials comparing pulmonary rehabilitation maintenance for COPD with attention control or usual care. The primary outcomes were HRQoL, exercise capacity and hospitalisation; the secondary outcomes were exacerbation rate, mortality, direct costs of care, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Results data that were similar enough to be pooled were meta-analysed using a random-effects model, and those that could not be pooled were reported in narrative form. Subgroup analyses were undertaken for frequency of supervision (programmes offered monthly or less frequently, versus more frequently) and those using remote supervision (e.g. telerehabilitation versus face-to-face supervision). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results We included 21 studies (39 reports) with 1799 COPD patients. Participants ranged in age from 52 years to 88 years. Disease severity ranged from 24% to 88% of the predicted forced expiratory volume in one second. Programme duration ranged from four weeks to 36 months. In-person supervision was provided in 12 studies, and remote supervision was provided in six studies (telephone or web platform). Four studies provided a combination of in-person and remote supervision. Most studies had a high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of participants, and high risk of detection, attrition, and reporting bias. Low- to moderate-certainty evidence showed that supervised maintenance programmes may improve health-related quality of life at six to 12 months following pulmonary rehabilitation compared to usual care (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire total score mean difference (MD) 0.54 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 1.03, 258 participants, four studies), with a mean difference that exceeded the minimal important difference of 0.5 points for this outcome. It is possible that supervised maintenance could improve six-minute walk distance, but this is uncertain (MD 26 metres (m), 95% CI -1.04 to 52.84, 639 participants, 10 studies). There was little to no difference between the maintenance programme and the usual care group in exacerbations or all-cause hospitalizations, or the chance of death (odds ratio (OR) for mortality 0.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.51, 755 participants, six studies). Insufficient data were available to understand the impact of the frequency of supervision, or of remote versus in-person supervision. No adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions This review suggests that supervised maintenance programmes for COPD patients after pulmonary rehabilitation are not associated with increased adverse events, may improve health-related quality of life, and could possibly improve exercise capacity at six to 12 months. Effects on exacerbations, hospitalisation and mortality are similar to those of usual care. However, the strength of evidence was limited because most included studies had a high risk of bias and small sample size. The optimal supervision frequency and models for supervised maintenance programmes are still unclear.";2021;4
"Background Pulmonary rehabilitation is a proven, effective intervention for people with chronic respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD) and bronchiectasis. However, relatively few people attend or complete a program, due to factors including a tack of programs, issues associated with travel and transport, and other health issues. Traditionally, pulmonary rehabilitation is delivered in-person on an outpatient basis at a hospital or other healthcare facility (referred to as centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation). Newer, alternative modes of pulmonary rehabilitation delivery include home-based models and the use of telehealth. Teterehabilitation is the delivery of rehabilitation services at a distance, using information and communication technology. To date, there has not been a comprehensive assessment of the clinical efficacy or safety of telerehabi litation, or its ability to improve uptake and access to rehabilitation services, for people with chronic respiratory disease. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of telerehabilitation for people with chronic respiratory disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; six databases including MEDLINE and Embase; and three trials registries, up to 30 November 2020. We checked reference lists of all included studies for additional references, and handsearched relevant respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials of telerehabilitation for the delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation were eligible for inclusion. The telerehabilitation intervention was required to include exercise training, with at least 50% of the rehabilitation intervention being delivered by telerehabititation. Data collection and analysis We used standard methods recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias for all studies, and used the ROBINS-I tool to assess bias in non-randomised controlled clinical trials. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. Comparisons were telerehabilitation compared to traditional in-person (centre-based) pulmonary rehabilitation, and telerehabilitation compared to no rehabilitation. We analysed studies of telerehabilitation for maintenance rehabilitation separately from trials of telerehabilitation for initial primary pulmonary rehabilitation. Main results We included a total of 15 studies (32 reports) with 1904 participants, using five different models of telerehabilitation. Almost all (99%) participants had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Three studies were controlled clinical trials. For primary pulmonary rehabilitation, there was probably little or no difference between telerehabilitation and in-person pulmonary rehabilitation for exercise capacity measured as 6-Minute Walking Distance (6MWD) (mean difference (MD) 0.06 metres (m), 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.82 m to 10.94 m; 556 participants; four studies; moderate-certainty evidence). There may also be little or no difference for quality of life measured with the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (MD -1.26, 95% CI -3.97 to 1.45; 274 participants; two studies; lowcertainty evidence), or for breathlessness on the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) dyspnoea domain score (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.40; 426 participants; three studies; low-certainty evidence). Participants were more likely to complete a program of telerehabilitation, with a 93% completion rate (95% CI 90% to 96%), compared to a 70% completion rate for in-person rehabilitation. When compared to no rehabilitation control, trials of primary telerehabilitation may increase exercise capacity on 6MWD (MD 22.17 m, 95% CI -38.89 m to 83.23 m; 94 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence) and may also increase 6MWD when delivered as maintenance rehabilitation (MD 78.1 m, 95% CI 49.6 m to 106.6 m; 209 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence). No adverse effects of telerehabilitation were noted over and above any reported for in-person rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. Authors' conclusions This review suggests that primary pulmonary rehabilitation, or maintenance rehabilitation, delivered via telerehabilitation for people with chronic respiratory disease achieves outcomes similar to those of traditional centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation, with no safety issues identified. However, the certainty of the evidence provided by this review is limited by the small number of studies, of varying telerehabilitation models, with relatively few participants. Future research should consider the clinical effect of telerehabilitation for individuals with chronic respiratory diseases other than COPD, the duration of benefit of telerehabilitation beyond the period of the intervention, and the economic cost of telerehabilitation.";2021;4
Background Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to data collected from inertial measurement units to automatically assess balance, but rely on hand-engineered features. We explore the utility of machine learning to automatically extract important features from inertial measurement unit data for balance assessment. Findings Ten participants with balance concerns performed multiple balance exercises in a laboratory setting while wearing an inertial measurement unit on their lower back. Physical therapists watched video recordings of participants performing the exercises and rated balance on a 5-point scale. We trained machine learning models using different representations of the unprocessed inertial measurement unit data to estimate physical therapist ratings. On a held-out test set, we compared these learned models to one another, to participants' self-assessments of balance, and to models trained using hand-engineered features. Utilizing the unprocessed kinematic data from the inertial measurement unit provided significant improvements over both self-assessments and models using hand-engineered features (AUROC of 0.806 vs. 0.768, 0.665). Conclusions Unprocessed data from an inertial measurement unit used as input to a machine learning model produced accurate estimates of balance performance. The ability to learn from unprocessed data presents a potentially generalizable approach for assessing balance without the need for labor-intensive feature engineering, while maintaining comparable model performance.;2021;4
"Background Supervised physical activity interventions improve functional health during cancer survivorship, but remain costly and inaccessible for many. We previously reported on the benefits of a DVD-delivered physical activity program (FlexToBa (TM)) in older adults. This is a secondary analysis of the intervention effects among cancer survivors in the original sample. Methods Low active, older adults who self-reported a history of cancer (N = 46; M time since diagnosis = 10.7 +/- 9.4 years) participated in a 6-month, home-based physical activity intervention. Participants were randomized to either the DVD-delivered physical activity program focused on flexibility, toning, and balance (FlexToBa (TM); n = 22) or an attentional control condition (n = 24). Physical function was assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at baseline, end of intervention, and at 12 and 24 months after baseline. Results Repeated measures linear mixed models indicated a significant group*time interaction for the SPPB total score (beta = - 1.14, p = 0.048), driven by improved function from baseline to six months in the FlexToBa (TM) group. The intervention group also had improved balance (beta = - 0.56, p = 0.041) compared with controls. Similar trends emerged for the SPPB total score during follow-up; the group*time interaction from 0 to 12 months approached significance (beta = - 0.97, p = 0.089) and was significant from 0 to 24 months (beta = - 1.84, p = 0.012). No significant interactions emerged for other outcomes (ps > 0.11). Conclusions A DVD-delivered physical activity intervention designed for cancer-free older adults was capable of eliciting and maintaining clinically meaningful functional improvements in a subgroup of cancer survivors, with similar effects to the original full sample. These findings inform the dissemination of evidence-based physical activity programs during survivorship.";2021;4
"Background Telerehabilitation has been considered a suitable alternative healthcare delivery system during the COVID-19 outbreak, and many studies have promoted its feasibility in delivering physical care to patients who live with pain and disability. Physiotherapists' perceptions and willingness are two key factors that influence the provision of remote physiotherapy. Aim To investigate physiotherapists' perceptions of and willingness to use telerehabilitation in Kuwait during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the barriers that may hinder the use of telerehabilitation in this sector. Methods The following methods were used: (1) a cross-sectional survey and (2) face-to-face semi-structured interviews. In the cross-sectional survey, an electronic questionnaire was sent to 747 physiotherapists who were working in the governmental health sector. The questionnaire included four sections: perceptions of telerehabilitation, comfort with technology, willingness to use telerehabilitation, and barriers to using telerehabilitation. Six interviews were conducted with physiotherapy managers to explore the barriers and facilitators of telerehabilitation practice. Data analysis In this study, descriptive data analysis was conducted, and a cross-tabulation technique was used to find the associations between the variables, in which chi-square tests were used to identify the significance of the results, where p < 0.05. Thematic content analysis was used for the interviews. Results Only 273 completed questionnaires were received, giving a response rate of 36.5%. Most of the respondents (237; 86.8%) considered telerehabilitation a viable option to deliver healthcare to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of the lack of information and communication technology (ICT) (156; 57.1%), 89% (243) of the respondents were willing to integrate telerehabilitation into their conventional practice, as cultural and social norms were not against the use of telerehabilitation systems. The results indicate that the more the physiotherapists used the internet and email in their work and the more comfortable they were with technology, the more willing they were to use telerehabilitation systems (p = 0.01). The physiotherapy managers reported that patients' privacy and the confidentiality of their data were considered barriers. Conclusion In Kuwait, physiotherapists show overall positive perceptions towards and a willingness to use telerehabilitation to facilitate patients' access to physiotherapy services. There are several barriers to employing telerehabilitation. Accordingly, recommendations are suggested.";2021;4
"Background The coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to important challenges in health and education service delivery. Aims The present study aimed to document: (i) changes in the use of telepractice by speech-language pathology (SLP) professionals in Quebec since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak; (ii) perceptions of the feasibility of telepractice by SLPs; (iii) barriers to the use of telepractice; and (iv) the perceptions of SLP professionals regarding the main issues of telepractice. Methods & Procedures An online survey with closed and open, Likert scale and demographic questions was completed by 83 SLPs in Quebec in June and July 2020. Outcomes & Results The survey responses showed that within the cohort responding, telepractice use has increased significantly as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most respondents planned to continue using telepractice after the pandemic ends. In addition, the respondents considered telepractice to be adequate for many clinical practices but less so for others (e.g., swallowing disorders, hearing impairment). Most of the reported barriers to the use of telepractice concerned technological problems and a lack of clinical materials for online use. Confidentiality and privacy issues were also raised. Conclusions & Implications SLP professionals rapidly took advantage of existing technologies in their clinical settings to cope with the pandemic's effects on service delivery. The discrepancy between their perceptions and the evidence in the literature for some practices and populations strengthens the need for more information and education on telepractice. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject The proportion of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in Canada who use telepractice for clinical activities is unknown. Knowing this information became crucial in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because non-essential activities were interrupted to halt the spread of the disease. What this paper adds to existing knowledge The findings from this survey study confirmed that the use of telepractice in SLP in Quebec increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the majority of the respondents began using telepractice because of the pandemic, and most planned to continue doing so after it ends. This demonstrates how SLP professionals rapidly took advantage of existing technologies in their clinical settings to cope with the pandemic's effects on service delivery. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Although the SLPs expressed an overall positive perception of telepractice, they also highlighted barriers to its optimal use. The findings of this study should help employers and regulatory bodies in Quebec to bring down those barriers and make telepractice in SLP a durable, effective and efficient service delivery model.";2021;4
"Background The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the adoption of telerehabilitation in various health care settings. However, there was neither a preexisting national guideline in the Philippines nor an internationally agreed upon standard for telerehabilitation. The literature lacks nationwide studies documenting how physiatrists perceived and experienced telerehabilitation during the pandemic. Objective To determine the perceptions and experiences of physiatrists in the Philippines regarding telerehabilitation. Design Online survey originally developed by the authors with inputs from local experts in telehealth or telerehabilitation. Setting Nationwide, involving board-certified physiatrists practicing in the Philippines. Participants Fellows of the Philippine Academy of Rehabilitation Medicine (PARM) (N = 259) with Internet access. Main Outcome Measures Self-reported telerehabilitation knowledge, skills, and experience; key concerns; preferred clients, service offerings, and methods (technology, duration, charging). Results The respondents (n = 161; 62.2% response rate) had a mean age of 48.1 +/- 9.6 years, were mostly female (57.8%), and mostly practiced in private hospitals and urban settings. The majority reported inadequate telerehabilitation knowledge (61.5%), skills (58.4%), and experience (72.1%). The most common sources of telerehabilitation knowledge were colleagues (52.8%), PARM (51.6%), and telemedicine-related websites (41.6%). Most of the respondents preferred to conduct telerehabilitation with former patients over new ones and prescribe telerehabilitation programs for physical, occupational, psychological, and speech-language therapy but not for swallowing therapy. Videoconferencing was the most common telerehabilitation method. More than half of the respondents charged lesser fees for telerehabilitation compared to in-person consultations. Although the majority recognized the need for telerehabilitation, their key concerns included the lack of thorough patient examination and medicolegal liability issues. Conclusion Despite their limited baseline knowledge, skills, and experience regarding telerehabilitation, many physiatrists in the Philippines learned to adopt this service delivery method during the pandemic. Their perceptions and experiences could be used in formulating practice-based guidelines and strategies to improve the conduct of telerehabilitation in the country.";2021;4
"Background The COVID-19 pandemic impedes therapy and care activities. Tele-health, i.e., the provision of health care at a distance (HCD), is a promising way to fill the supply gap. However, facilitators and barriers influence the use and experience of HCD for occupational therapists (OTs) and midwives. We identified use of services and appraisal of experiences of Switzerland-based OTs and midwives regarding the provision of HCD during the lockdown as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. 1. Hypothesis: Profession, age in years, and area of work have a significant and meaningful influence over whether HCD is provided. 2. Hypothesis: Profession, age in years, area of work, possibility of reimbursement by health insurance, and application used have a significant and meaningful influence on the experience of HCD. Methods In a cross-sectional survey, 5755 OTs and midwives were contacted to fill out an online questionnaire with 13 questions regarding demographic information, use of HCD, and experiences while providing the service. Eleven potential facilitators and barriers and areas where there was desire for support were identified. Results The questionnaire was completed by 1269 health professionals (response rate 22.5%). 73.4% of responding OTs (n = 431) and midwives (n = 501) provided HCD during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Profession and area of work had a significant influence on whether HCD was provided. Age only had a significant influence on the use of videotelephony, SMS, and chat services. OTs experienced HCD significantly more positively than midwives (log odds = 1.3; p <= .01). Video-telephony (log odds = 1.1; p <= .01) and use of phone (log odds = 0.8; p = .01) were positive predictors for positive experience, while use of SMS (log odds = - 0.33; p = .02) was a negative predictor. Among OTs, 67.5% experienced HCD as positive or mostly positive, while 27.0% experienced it as negative or mostly negative. Among midwives, 39.5% experienced it as positive or mostly positive, while 57.5% experienced it as negative or mostly negative. Most respondents desired support concerning reimbursement by health insurance (70.8%), followed by law and data protection (60.4%). Conclusions HCD during the early COVID-19 pandemic was generally perceived as positive by OTs and midwives. There is need for training opportunities in connection with HCD during the COVID-19 pandemic.";2021;4
"Background The efficacy of exercise-based telerehabilitation in chronic low back pain (CLBP) has not been well studied. To our knowledge, no other studies have investigated the efficacy of video exercise-based telerehabilitation software in the remote management of home exercises in patients with CLBP. Aims The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of the video-based exercise software on pain, function, quality-of-life, expectation, satisfaction, and motivation in individuals with CLBP. Methods A double-blind, two-armed randomized controlled trial was carried out with 50 individuals with CLBP. Participants were randomly allocated to either the telerehabilitation group (n = 25) or the conventional rehabilitation group (n = 25). The telerehabilitation group was followed up with a video exercise-based telerehabilitation software called Fizyoweb. The clinician was able to communicate with the patients through the software. The conventional rehabilitation group was given the same home exercises as the paper-based exercise instruction form. Pain, function, quality-of-life, and kinesiophobia were evaluated at baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. In addition, patient expectations were questioned at the initial evaluation; afterward, patient satisfaction and motivation were questioned at the eighth week. Results After 8 weeks of treatment, the telerehabilitation group achieved significant improvement in pain, function, quality-of-life, kinesiophobia, satisfaction, and motivation (p < 0.05). In addition, the telerehabilitation group reported more significant gains in all parameters compared with the conventional rehabilitation group (p < 0.05). Conclusions The video exercise-based telerehabilitation software positively affects clinical parameters and adherence to rehabilitation in patients with CLBP.";2021;4
Background The first surge of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic led to a shutdown of all non-urgent medical services such as cardiac rehabilitation. Therefore, centres had to develop remote and innovative ways to deliver the core components of CR during this shutdown. This increase in usage of remote rehabilitation services provides a chance to assess patients' experiences and willingness-to-pay of remote CR sessions. Methods This was a prospective single-centre study. From 17 July 2020, to 19 August 2020, we conducted an anonymous survey about the patient experiences of the cardiac telerehabilitation services provided at Jessa Hospital Hasselt during the COVID-19 pandemic. A link to an electronic questionnaire was sent via email to 155 patients who were invited to participate in the cardiac telerehabilitation sessions during the closure of the rehabilitation centre due to COVID-19. Results Fifty-five patients (35% of all invited patients) did participate in remote CR and completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the respondents was 65.4 +/- 10.5 years, 63% were male and 70% of the participants were retired. A total of 91% possessed a smartphone and all those patients used their smartphone regularly to send text messages. Ninety-four per cent of the participants were satisfied with the provided telerehabilitation sessions and 70% of the participants would be prepared to pay for these sessions like for centre-based CR sessions. Twenty per cent of patients would even prefer the telerehabilitation sessions above centre-based CR sessions. Conclusion Most patients believed that remote CR could be an option after the COVID-19 pandemic when it is combined with centre-based CR sessions. Patients are willing to pay the same amount for a telerehabilitation session as a centre-based CR session. This demonstrates that highly motivated patients are open to shift certain parts of CR from face-to-face interactions to digital interactions.;2021;4
Background The majority of stroke survivors experience motor impairment which benefits from rehabilitation treatment. Telerehabilitation, remote delivery of rehabilitation services, is a possible solution providing access to rehabilitation for stroke survivors living in rural areas or in situations like the COVID-19 pandemic where face-to-face treatment may be risky. However, valid and reliable motor impairment measures have not yet been established over a telerehabilitation platform. The Fugl-Meyer (FM) lower extremity assessment is widely used clinically and in research. Thus, the aim was to develop a modified FM for telerehabilitation (FM-tele) and assess the feasibility and preliminary agreement of FM-tele scores with the FM. Methods Three phases were employed: phase 1 development, phase 2 feasibility, and phase 3 preliminary agreement. Literature review and consultation with clinicians were employed to develop the FM-tele. Community-dwelling individuals with stroke and FM evaluators were consulted to provide feedback via questionnaires on the feasibility of the FM-tele. To assess the preliminary agreement of the FM-tele, individuals with stroke participated in two sessions, one in-person and one via telerehabilitation. The standard version of the FM was administered during the in-person session. The FM-tele was administered in both sessions. Results From phase 1, clinician consultation identified the following key principles: safety of the client, clear lower extremity visualization, and minimization of position changes which guided FM-tele development (n = 7). Feasibility was established in phase 2 where participants with stroke indicated that they felt safe and experienced ease following the standardized instructions, despite some technological concerns (n = 5). FM evaluators agreed that participants were safe and indicated effective standardized instructions. Phase 3 (n = 5) indicated preliminary agreement of the FM-tele compared with the FM. Conclusions Participants with stroke and clinical consultation indicated the FM-tele developed for telerehabilitation is feasible. A lower extremity motor assessment tool for telerehabilitation is urgently needed for stroke survivors living in rural areas or when face-to-face visits are impossible. This pilot study provides preliminary support for a future study.;2021;4
"Background The number of people living with stroke has increased demand for rehabilitation. A potential solution is telerehabilitation for health care delivery to promote self-management. One such approach is the Augmented Community Telerehabilitation Intervention (ACTIV). This structured 6-month program uses limited face-to-face sessions, telephone contact, and text messages to augment stroke rehabilitation. Objective To investigate whether ACTIV improved physical function compared with usual care. Methods This 2-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 4 New Zealand centers. Inclusion criteria were patients with first-ever stroke, age >20 years, and discharged home. A blinded assessor completed outcome measurement in participants' homes at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months postintervention. Stratified block randomization occurred after baseline assessment, with participants allocated to ACTIV or usual care control. Results A total of 95 people were recruited (ACTIV: n = 47; control: n = 48). Postintervention intention-to-treat analysis found a nonsignificant difference between the groups in scores (4 center dot 51; P = .07) for physical function (measured by the physical subcomponent of the Stroke Impact Scale). The planned per-protocol analysis (ACTIV: n = 43; control: n = 48) found a significant difference in physical function between the groups (5 center dot 28; P = .04). Improvements in physical function were not maintained at the 12-month follow-up. Conclusions ACTIV was not effective in improving physical function in the ACTIV group compared with the usual care group. The per-protocol analysis raises the possibility that for those who receive more than 50% of the intervention, ACTIV may be effective in preventing deterioration or even improving physical function in people with stroke, in the period immediately following discharge from hospital.";2021;4
Background The sudden and unexpected pandemic changed the daily routine of the children with cerebral palsy (CP) and their caregivers. Aims This study aimed to investigate the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the utilization of health and rehabilitation services and the general health and physical status of children with CP. In addition, the second aim of the study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers' quality of life (QOL) and their fear of COVID-19. Methods The utilization of children health and rehabilitation services during the pandemic, the general health and physical status of the children during the pandemic, and the children and caregivers' history of COVID-19 infections were questioned. Furthermore, the caregivers' level of fear of COVID-19 and their QOL were examined. Results One hundred twenty caregivers were contacted by phone, and 94 (78.33%) caregivers agreed to participate in the study. Sixty-three of 94 children (67.1%) did not attend their routine control check-up during the pandemic. Twelve children (12.8%) discontinued their physical therapy sessions during the pandemic. Caregivers physical and mental QOL significantly decreased during the pandemic (p < 0.05). The median of caregivers' Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) was 17.5 (7-35). Conclusion We think that more attention should be given to telerehabilitation and telemedicine services of the clinicians who deal with the children with CP, and their caregivers in order to prevent the negative effects of future pandemic periods.;2021;4
Background There has been increased usage of virtual telerehabilitation approach during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is crucial to establish reliability of conducting virtual assessments for musculoskeletal conditions. Objectives This research determined the intra- and interrater reliability of measuring knee and wrist range of motion (ROM) assessed virtually and obtained face-to-face (F2F) using a goniometer (UG) for a student and an experienced examiner. Method Knee and wrist joint ROM for 54 healthy participants was assessed virtually and F2F by a student examiner and an experienced physical therapist. Intra- (virtual vs. UG assessment) and inter-rater (virtual or UG assessment between examiners) reliabilities were examined for all ROM using Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC values were considered good (>0.75) or excellent (>0.90). Bland and Altman plots determined the limits of agreement (LOA) in assessing joint ROM. Results/findings Student examiner had good reliability in virtually estimating knee extension (ICC = 0.79), wrist flexion (ICC = 0.82) and wrist extension (ICC = 0.78), whereas the experienced examiner had excellent reliability in virtually estimating all knee and wrist ROM (ICC > 0.90). The LOA in assessing knee and wrist ROM for the student examiner were wider indicating higher disagreement between virtual and UG-obtained ROM in some cases. Conclusions Virtual estimation of knee and wrist ROM is a reliable technique, however experience level impacts the precision of measurement. It is suggested that the same examiner conducts all the ROM assessments throughout the clinical course of a patient receiving virtual interventions for knee or wrist pathologies.;2021;4
Background While short term effects on upper limb function of stroke patients after training with robotic devices have been studied extensively, long term effects are often not addressed. HoMEcare aRm rehabiLItatioN (MERLIN) is a combination of an unactuated training device using serious games and a telerehabilitation platform in the patient's home situation. Short term effects showed that upper limb function improved after training with MERLIN. The aim was to determine long term effects on upper limb function and quality of life. Methods Six months after cessation of the 6 week MERLIN training program, the upper limb function and quality of life of 11 chronic stroke patients were assessed. Upper limb function was measured using the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE). EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) was used to measure quality of life. Results The WMFT, ARAT and EQ-5D did not show significant differences 6 months after the training period compared to directly after training. At 6 months follow-up, FMA-UE results were significantly better than at baseline. Time plots showed a decreasing trend in all tests. Conclusion Training effects were still present at 6 months follow-up, since arm function seemed similar to directly after training and FMA-UE results were better than at baseline. However, because of the decreasing trend shown in all tests, it is questionable if improvements will be maintained longer than 6 months. Due to the sample size and study design, results should be interpreted with caution. Trial registration This study is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NL7535). Registered 18-02-2019,;2021;4
"Background. Due to an increasing stroke incidence, a lack of resources to implement effective rehabilitation and a significant proportion of patients with remaining impairments after treatment, there is a rise in demand for effective and prolonged rehabilitation. Development of self-rehabilitation programs provides an opportunity to meet these increasing demands. Objective. The primary aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the effect of self-rehabilitation on motor outcomes, in comparison to conventional rehabilitation, among patients with stroke. The secondary aim was to assess the influence of trial location (continent), technology, time since stroke (acute/subacute vs chronic), dose (total training duration > vs <= 15 hours), and intervention design (self-rehabilitation in addition/substitution to conventional therapy) on effect of self-rehabilitation. Methods. Studies were selected if participants were adults with stroke; the intervention consisted of a self-rehabilitation program defined as a tailored program where for most of the time, the patient performed rehabilitation exercises independently; the control group received conventional therapy; outcomes included motor function and activity; and the study was a randomized controlled trial with a PEDro score >= 5. Results. Thirty-five trials were selected (2225 participants) and included in quantitative synthesis regarding motor outcomes. Trials had a median PEDro Score of 7 [6-8]. Self-rehabilitation programs were shown to be as effective as conventional therapy. Trial location, use of technology, stroke stage, and intervention design did not appear to have a significant influence on outcomes. Conclusion. This meta-analysis showed low to moderate evidence that self-rehabilitation and conventional therapy efficacy was equally valuable for post-stroke motor function and activity.";2021;4
Background/Aims This study reviewed the use of telehealth in paediatric occupational therapy practice and its clinical outcomes over the past 20 years. Methods A scoping review following Arksey and O'Malley's five stages was undertaken using six databases and Google Scholar. The scoping review covered articles from January 2000 to April 2020. Results A total of 22 articles were reviewed. Most studies indicated positive outcomes of using telehealth in paediatric occupational therapy practice. Although there is insufficient evidence, the results indicated that telehealth can be more effective than face-to-face interventions when there are mobility or travel challenges for children. Conclusions The use of telehealth in paediatric occupational therapy is an alternative service delivery model, facilitating access for children and their families to the rehabilitation services. Further research is needed to address the difficulties and potential solutions to expand the use of telehealth services to help children with disadvantages alongside their families.;2021;4
Background/objectives The aim of the study was to examine the effects of exercise training through telerehabilitation applied during COVID-19 isolation period on overweight and obese individuals on physical fitness and quality of life. Subjects/methods In our study, 41 participants between the ages of 18-65 years and whose BMI values were 25 kg/m(2) and above were randomly divided into two groups as telerehabilitation group (n: 21) and control group (n: 20). Exercise training applied to the telerehabilitation group with remote live connection included warm-up exercises, trunk stabilization exercises and breathing exercises under the supervision of a physiotherapist for 6 weeks, 3 days in a week. The control group was only informed about the importance of exercise for one session and evaluated at baseline and after 6 weeks. The physical fitness levels of individuals was assessed by Senior Fitness Test protocol and quality of life by Short Form-36. Results As a result of the study, statistically significant improvements were obtained in all parameters of physical fitness, quality of life in the telerehabilitation group (p < 0.05). In the difference values of the two groups, all parameters of physical fitness and quality of life were observed that there were statistically significant differences in favor of telerehabilitation group (p < 0.05). Conclusions As a result, it was found that exercise training applied through telerehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic process was an effective, safe and viable approach in overweight and obese individuals. In the future, studies investigating the long-term effectiveness of telerehabilitation in this population are needed.;2021;4
Background: Activity-based therapy (ABT) for the upper extremity (UE) enables neurologic recovery with tasks that are functional, intense, and highly repetitive. A large proportion of rehabilitation occurs in the home and there is a gap in literature on the application of ABT within the home. The objective of this scoping review was to describe ABT in the home-setting for the neurologically-impaired UE. Methods: A systematic scoping review included searches of: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and OTSeeker. Results: A systematic search yielded 51 final studies. About 61% of ABT studies were exclusively within the home, others included outpatient visits (37%). Telerehabilitation was used in 37% of the studies with live-video and store forward techniques equally represented. ABT supported by technology was used in 61% of studies. Dosing of intervention ranged from 7 to 120 hours, with a mean of 34.5 hours of practice. Adherence with intended dosing was reported in 27% of studies and subjects completed a mean of 86% of the intended practice time. Sixty-seven percent of studies reported some degree of practice without therapist supervision. Conclusions: The results showed wide variability in the intervention methods, dosing and technology used in homebased settings. The high rate of adherence with dosing is encouraging for the application of homebased neurologic UE interventions. This scoping review highlights feasibility of UE ABT within the home and need for further research.;2021;4
"Background: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer. ALL and its treatment cause altered bone-mineral homeostasis, which can contribute to musculoskeletal late adverse effects (LAEs). With the increasing number of childhood cancer survivors, LAEs are reported often, and are aggravated by inactive lifestyles. A telerehabilitation program is proposed to strengthen the muscle-bone complex and prevent future impairment. Objective: This study aimed to explore and better understand patient and parent experience of a telerehabilitation program after completion of ALL treatment. Methods: ALL survivors (n = 12), 75% girls, 7.9 to 14.7 years old, within six months to five years of treatment, were recruited to participate in the proposed study, along with a parent. The 16-week group program included 40 potential home-based physical activities, with monthly progression, supervised by a kinesiologist, through an online telerehabilitation platform. Patients could be included in the study if they joined during the first month of intervention of their group (minimum 12 weeks of intervention). A semi-structured post-intervention interview was conducted with the patients and their parent during the final assessment, along with a review of the kinesiologist's clinical notes, to obtain a portrait of the participants' experience with the telerehabilitation program. Overarching themes were identified by one author and confirmed by two senior authors before extracting the various aspects of each theme. Results: Of the 12 patients recruited, three were excluded from the analysis because they did not complete the minimum 12 weeks of intervention (one = relapse, one = failure to meet technical requirements, and one = abandoned due to parent's disinterest). The nine patients who completed the program (six girls; 10.93 +/- 2.83 years) had a mean adherence of 89%. The overarching themes identified were the program modalities (group approach with patient-parent paired training, supervised by a kinesiologist), the telerehabilitation system, the participants' perception of the benefits, and recommendations and suggestions from the families. Both patients and parents expressed very high satisfaction with the program and perceived benefits. Conclusion: Participants appreciated the program and reported they would all recommend it to other families in similar situations. The telerehabilitation method of service delivery was perceived by some as decisive in choosing to participate, while the supervision and intra- and inter-family interactions were the motivating factors that were key to program adherence.";2021;4
Background: Adherence to medication and lifestyle changes are very important in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. One of the ways is by doing a cardiac rehabilitation program. Main body of the abstract: Cardiac rehabilitation program is divided into three phases. The cardiac rehabilitation program's implementation, especially the second phase, center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR), has many barriers not to participate optimally. Therefore, the third phase, known as home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR), can become a substitute or addition to CBCR. On the other hand, this phase is also an essential part of the patients' functional capacity. During the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, HBCR has become the leading solution in the cardiac rehabilitation program's sustainability. Innovation is needed in its implementation, such as telerehabilitation. So, the cardiac rehabilitation program can be implemented by patients and monitored by health care providers continuously. Short conclusion: Physicians play an essential role in motivating patients and encouraging their family members to commit to a sustainable CR program with telerehabilitation to facilitate its implementation.;2021;4
"Background: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is characterized by joint contractures and muscle weakness, which limit daily activities. Youths with AMC require frequent physical therapeutic follow-ups to limit the recurrence of contractures and maintain range of motion (ROM) and muscle strength; however, access to specialized care may be limited because of geographical distance. Telerehabilitation can offer a potential solution for delivering frequent follow-ups for youth with AMC, but research on the use of telerehabilitation in children with musculoskeletal disorders is scarce. Objective: The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of delivering a home exercise program (HEP) by using telerehabilitation for youth with AMC. We also aim to explore the effectiveness of the HEP as a secondary aim. Methods: Youths aged between 8 and 21 years with AMC were recruited at the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Canada. The participants completed baseline and post-HEP questionnaires (the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents, Pediatrics Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, and Adolescent and Pediatric Pain Tool), and clinicians assessed their active ROM using a virtual goniometer. Clinicians used the Goal Attainment Scale with the participants to identify individualized goals to develop a 12-week HEP and assess the achievement of these goals. Follow-ups were conducted every 3 weeks to adjust the HEP. Data on withdrawal rates and compliance to the HEP and follow-ups were collected to assess the feasibility of this approach. The interrater reliability of using a virtual goniometer was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and associated 95% CI. Nonparametric tests were used to evaluate feasibility and explore the effectiveness of the HEP. Results: Of the 11 youths who were recruited, 7 (median age: 16.9 years) completed the HEP. Of the 47 appointments scheduled, 5 had to be rescheduled in <= 24 hours. The participants performed their HEP 2.04 times per week (95% CI 1.25-4.08) and reported good satisfaction with the approach. A general intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.985 (95% CI 0.980-0.989) was found for the web-based ROM measurement. Individualized goals were related to pain management; endurance in writing, standing, or walking; sports; and daily activities. In total, 12 of the 15 goals set with the participants were achieved. Statistically significant improvements were observed in the pain and comfort domain of the Pediatrics Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (preintervention: median 71; 95% CI 34-100; postintervention: median 85; 95% CI 49-100; P=.08) and Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (preintervention: median 1.62; 95% CI 1.00-2.82; postintervention: median 2.32; 95% CI 1.00-3.45; P=.046). Conclusions: The remote delivery of an HEP for youth with AMC is feasible. Promising results were found for the effectiveness of the HEP in helping youths with AMC to achieve their goals. The next step will be to assess the effectiveness of this exercise intervention in a randomized controlled trial.";2021;4
Background: Bilinguals with post-stroke aphasia (BWA) require treatment options that are sensitive to their particular bilingual background and deficits across languages. However, they may experience limited access to bilingual clinical resources due to reduced availability of bilingual practitioners, geographical constraints, and other difficulties. Telerehabilitation can improve access to bilingual clinical services for BWA and facilitate the delivery of specific language treatments at distance, but more evidence on its effectiveness and reliability is needed. This study aimed to determine the equivalence of effectiveness and reliability of a semantic treatment for word retrieval deficits in BWA delivered via telerehabilitation relative to in-person therapy. Methods: We examined the retrospective data of 16 BWA who received 20 sessions of therapy based on semantic feature analysis for word retrieval deficits in person (n = 8) or via telerehabilitation (n = 8). The two groups were comparable on age, years of education, time of post-stroke onset, aphasia severity, and naming ability in both languages. Treatment effectiveness (i.e., effect sizes in the treated and the untreated language, and change on secondary outcome measures) and reliability (i.e., clinician adherence to treatment protocol) were computed for each delivery modality and compared across groups. Results: Significant improvements were observed in most patients, with no significant differences in treatment effect sizes or secondary outcomes in the treated and the untreated language between the teletherapy group and the in-person therapy group. Also, the average percentage of correctly delivered treatment steps by clinicians was high for both therapy delivery methods with no significant differences between the telerehabilitation vs. the in-person modality. Discussion: This study provides evidence of the equivalence of treatment gains between teletherapy and in-person therapy in BWA and the high reliability with which treatment for word retrieval deficits can be delivered via telerehabilitation, suggesting that the essential treatment components of the intervention can be conducted in a comparable manner in both delivery modalities. We further discuss the benefits and potential challenges of the implementation of telerehabilitation for BWA. In the future, telerehabilitation may increase access to therapy for BWA with varying linguistic and cultural backgrounds, thus, offering a more inclusive treatment approach to this population.;2021;4
"Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a widely recommended evidence-based intervention for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, the participation rate in CR has been reported to be low globally, mainly due to barriers in access to the CR center. We evaluated the feasibility and safety of a new remote real-time monitoring system for supervising home-based CR among elderly patients with heart failure (HF). Methods: Hospitalized patients or outpatients followed for HF were enrolled. Patients received 12-week home-based CR under remote supervision using an integrated platform for telerehabilitation. Feasibility was evaluated by the participation and completion rates of the home-based CR sessions. Safety was assessed by adverse events during the sessions. All patients underwent baseline and 12-week assessment of exercise tolerance and lower extremity muscle strength. Results: All 10 patients (mean age 76 +/- 7 years; 60% male) who participated in the study completed the program without withdrawal during the study period. Median participation rate in the exercise sessions was 94.4% (interquartile range: 88.9-97.9%). While fatigue, common cold, and palpitation were observed, no serious cardiovascular events were reported. Six-minute walk distance significantly improved from 383 +/- 94 m to 432 +/- 83 m ( p = 0.003). Conclusions: Home-based CR under real-time supervision was feasible and safe among elderly HF patients. Our study suggests that home-based CR using an integrated telerehabilitation platform may be a potential option for patients who are unable to participate in center-based CR due to geographic or social accessibility and physical barrier issues.

Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite strong evidence supporting the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), over 80% of eligible patients do not participate in CR. Digital health technologies (ie, the delivery of care using the internet, wearable devices, and mobile apps) have the potential to address the challenges associated with traditional facility-based CR programs, but little is known about the comprehensiveness of these interventions to serve as digital approaches to CR. Overall, there is a lack of a systematic evaluation of the current literature on digital interventions for CR. Objective: The objective of this systematic literature review is to provide an in-depth analysis of the potential of digital health technologies to address the challenges associated with traditional CR. Through this review, we aim to summarize the current literature on digital interventions for CR, identify the key components of CR that have been successfully addressed through digital interventions, and describe the gaps in research that need to be addressed for sustainable and scalable digital CR interventions. Methods: Our strategy for identifying the primary literature pertaining to CR with digital solutions (defined as technology employed to deliver remote care beyond the use of the telephone) included a consultation with an expert in the field of digital CR and searches of the PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases for original studies published from January 1990 to October 2018. Results: Our search returned 31 eligible studies, of which 22 were randomized controlled trials. The reviewed CR interventions primarily targeted physical activity counseling (31/31, 100%), baseline assessment (30/31, 97%), and exercise training (27/31, 87%). The most commonly used modalities were smartphones or mobile devices (20/31, 65%), web-based portals (18/31, 58%), and email-SMS (11/31, 35%). Approximately one-third of the studies addressed the CR core components of nutrition counseling, psychological management, and weight management. In contrast, less than a third of the studies addressed other CR core components, including the management of lipids, diabetes, smoking cessation, and blood pressure. Conclusions: Digital technologies have the potential to increase access and participation in CR by mitigating the challenges associated with traditional, facility-based CR. However, previously evaluated interventions primarily focused on physical activity counseling and exercise training. Thus, further research is required with more comprehensive CR interventions and long-term follow-up to understand the clinical impact of digital interventions.;2021;4
Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the main causes of disability in childhood. Virtual reality (VR) has been used as a treatment option in this population, however its effectiveness is unclear. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of VR in patients with CP. Methods: We conducted electronic searches in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, PEDro, AMED, PsycoINFO, and LILACS databases and trial site registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. We included randomized controlled trials that tested the use of VR alone or in combination with other interventions compared to more conventional rehabilitation or usual care in individuals with CP. The primary outcomes were upper and lower limb function, postural control, and balance. The secondary outcomes included global motor function, perception, cognition and spatial functions, motivation, motor learning, and adverse events. Two independent reviewers extracted and assessed included articles for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We use a meta-analysis with random effect model whenever possible. We analyzed the quality of evidence using theGRADE approach. Results: We included 38 trials (pooled n = 1233 participants) in this review. There is very low quality of evidence that VR plus conventional rehabilitation is better than conventional rehabilitation for upper limb function. There is also very low quality evidence that VR alone is no better than conventional rehabilitation for upper and lower limb function. No adverse events were observed among the 10 trials that provided information on this outcome. Conclusion: At present we have very limited to limited confidence in effect estimation for utilization of VR in this population. Future studies may change our confidence in results and effect estimates. (C) 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisa e Pos-Graduacao em Fisioterapia. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

"Background: Cognitive frailty (CF) is identified as one of the main precursors of dementia. Multidomain intervention has been found to delay or prevent the onset of CF. Objective: The aim of our present study is to determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive, multidomain intervention on CF; to evaluate its cost effectiveness and the factors influencing adherence toward this intensive intervention. Methods: A total of 1,000 community dwelling older adults, aged 60 years and above will be screened for CF. This randomized controlled trial involves recruitment of 330 older adults with CF from urban, semi-urban, and rural areas in Malaysia. Multidomain intervention comprised of physical, nutritional, cognitive, and psychosocial aspects will be provided to participants in the experimental group (n = 165). The control group (n = 165) will continue their usual care with their physician. Primary outcomes include CF status, physical function, psychosocial and nutritional status as well as cognitive performance. Vascular health and gut microbiome will be assessed using blood and stool samples. A 24-month intensive intervention will be prescribed to the participants and its sustainability will be assessed for the following 12 months. The effective intervention strategies will be integrated as a personalized telerehabilitation package for the reversal of CF for future use. Results: The multidomain intervention developed from this trial is expected to be cost effective compared to usual care as well as able is to reverse CF. Conclusion: This project will be part of the World-Wide FINGERS (Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability) Network, of which common identifiable data will be shared and harmonized among the consortia.";2021;4
Background: Continuity of rehabilitation care after completion of a hospital-based rehabilitation program remains a challenge. This is of considerable significance in Saudi Arabia where there is a lack of community-based rehabilitation, which renders the need of telemedicine services. There is lack of data regarding understanding, awareness, and attitudes of rehabilitation professional toward telerehabilitation. This study was aimed to explore Saudi-based rehabilitation professionals' knowledge of telerehabilitation. Materials and Methods: After pilot testing, a survey questionnaire was distributed to 82 rehabilitation professionals working in different regions of Saudi Arabia. The survey included 14 close-ended questions targeting five domains: demographics, telemedicine knowledge, telerehabilitation service knowledge, social acceptance of these services, and risks associated with these services. Descriptive statistics were obtained by analyzing data using Microsoft Excel. Results: In total 46% of the participants were aware of telerehabilitation service technology but did not use it. 69.51% considered both telerehabilitation and community-based rehabilitation as the best service delivery methods. About 43% of participants reported that lack of knowledge about information technology and cost were the main factors that led to their limited use of telerehabilitation systems. The majority of the participants (52.44%) considered breach of confidentiality to be a risk associated with telerehabilitation services. Conclusions: Even though considerable number of the participants considered telerehabilitation as an important service delivery method, most of them are not involved in telerehabilitation. This renders the need of establishing local telerehabilitation guidelines and addressing the barriers pertaining to training, resources, cost, policy making, confidentiality, and perception of patients.;2021;4
Background: Corona virus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. This has affected service delivery among all medical disciplines in India including neurorehabilitation services. Aims and Objectives: The aims and objectives of the study were to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on neurorehabilitation services across India. Methodology: A prospective nationwide survey study was undertaken by the Indian Federation of Neurorehabilitation during the pandemic. A questionnaire was prepared using Google forms software consisting of four sections: demography, neurorehabilitation practice before COVID-19 pandemic, neurorehabilitation practice during COVID-19 pandemic, and continuing medical education during COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Responses (872) were received from neurorehabilitation professionals across the country out of which 2.2% professionals did not give consent for participating in the survey. Participants (36.6%) were practicing traditional or independent referral basis rehabilitation, while 63.4% participants were practicing multidisciplinary rehabilitation. On an average, respective units were conducting 500-750 therapy sessions per month. Majority of the rehabilitation units in India lacked a physiatrist, rehabilitation nurse, music therapist, cognitive therapist, and urologist. Approximately 80% of the rehabilitation units have the basic rehabilitation modalities and advance technology was present in only 20% of the rehabilitation units. During COVID-19 pandemic, 19.5% centers were providing elective services, 50.3% emergency services, 15.6% new outpatient services, and 22.7% were providing follow-up outpatient services. Centers (51.5%) were providing telerehabilitation services for neurological conditions during the times of COVID-19 pandemic. Professionals (61.1%) providing telerehabilitation were working from home. Among the patients who needed neurorehabilitation, 28% were doing their exercises independently, 31% were supervised by caregivers, 17% were supervised by therapists, and 24% were not receiving any therapy. Participants (95.5%) wanted to receive more training in the field of neurorehabilitation. The participants utilized webinars (71%), online courses (22%), case discussion forums (19%), panel discussions (13%), and literature search (8%) during COVID-19 pandemic to continue education. Conclusion: The study reflects the situation of neurorehabilitation service delivery in India during the pandemic as the respondents were from all parts of the country and included most components of the neurorehabilitation team. Neurorehabilitation services were severely affected across India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tele-neurorehabilitation has emerged as a new service delivery model during the pandemic. Online means of education has emerged as the primary source of continuing medical education during the pandemic.;2021;4
Background: Currently, little is known about early mobilization and exercise in individuals with COVID-19. Objective: To describe the indication and safety of early mobilization and exercises in mild to severe COVID-19 patients and to investigate the use of telerehabilitation to deliver exercise programs to these patients. Methods: This narrative literature review was conducted performing a comprehensive search of databases. Results: 32 articles met the established criteria and the main findings were summarized and described, including indication, contraindication and recommendation for early rehabilitation and exercises prescription. Conclusions: The literature suggests that early mobilization and physical exercise are beneficial for individuals with COVID-19. However, much of what has been published is based on expert opinion due to a lack of randomized trials, which are needed.;2021;4
"Background: Diabetic neuropathy dramatically affects musculoskeletal structure and function of the lower limbs by impairing their muscle strength and mobility. Specific muscle strengthening through physiotherapy strategies appears to be promising; however, adherence to physiotherapy treatment is low in people with chronic diseases. Thus, an internet-based foot-ankle exercise program was created as a potential telerehabilitation alternative for people with diabetes to improve their self-monitoring and self-care management. This study assessed the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and changes in foot health and neuropathy symptoms in people with diabetes after 12 weeks of the intervention program with the Sistema de Orientacao ao Pe diabetico - Diabetic Foot Guidance System (SOPeD). Methods: Fourteen individuals were recruited and randomized to either the usual care (control group) or usual care plus an internet-based foot-ankle exercise program through SOPeD (intervention group) three times per week for 12 weeks. For feasibility, we assessed contact and recruitment rates per week; program adherence, determined as completing over 70% of the 36 sessions; and participant satisfaction and safety assessed through a questionnaire and scored on a 5-point Likert scale. We assessed changes in neuropathy symptoms and foot health and functionality from baseline to 12 weeks estimating differences or median of differences and 95% confidence intervals in the intervention group. Results: In 24 weeks, of the 822 patients in the database, 192 were contacted, 65 were assessed for eligibility, and 20 were considered eligible. The recruitment rate was 0.83 participants per week. Fourteen out of the 20 eligible participants agreed to participate, resulting in recruitment success of 70%. Adherence to the program was 66.7%, and there was no dropout. Participants' median level of satisfaction was 5.0 (IQR: 4.5-5.0) and perceived safety was 5.0 (IQR: 5.0-5.0). Conclusion: The internet-based foot-ankle exercise program using SOPeD is feasible, satisfactory, and safe. Although this study had moderate adherence and a zero-dropout rate, recruitment needs to be improved in the larger trial.";2021;4
Background: Digital patient engagement has been suggested as a mean to increase patient activation and patient satisfaction after total joint arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to assess patient engagement with application-based educational tools and to explore what content was most useful to patients in the perioperative period surrounding total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), respectively. Methods: Patients undergoing THA and TKA between October 2017 and January 2020 were enrolled to use an application-based digital technology. The App provides comprehensive patient education using a series of modules delivered at set intervals preoperatively and postoperatively. Patient engagement was defined as patients viewing at least one time the modules that were sent, or marking them as completed. Patient satisfaction was assessed using an in-application survey. Results: Complete data were available on 207 patients of which 95 (46%) underwent THA and 112 (54%) underwent TKA. The average age was 60 years. 54% with patients invited to the program completed registration. An average compliance rate of 48% (41 modules engaged out of 83) was observed. Of all modules completed, the top three most popular categories included physical therapy/exercise videos, health literacy, and anxiety/stress/pain management. The least viewed category was nutrition planning and education. Conclusion: When presented educational material related to THA and TKA, patients had a high rate of compliance. Digital technology platforms provide a scalable, meaningful approach to engaging patients throughout the continuum of joint replacement care and may serve as a cost-effective adjunct to traditional methods.

BACKGROUND: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, rehabilitation facilities have become less accessible for patients with a stroke. Lack of early, intensive rehabilitation misses the opportunity for recovery during the critical time window of endogenous plasticity and improvement post-stroke. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this commentary was to highlighting the benefits of telework and telerehabilitation programs for workers with a stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Relevant publications regarding the management of individuals with a stroke, telerehabilitation and teleworking in the setting of COVID-19 were reviewed. RESULTS: Previous studies showed that telerehabilitation can effectively provide an alternate method of promoting recovery for patients with a stroke. With the physical distancing precautions in place for mitigating viral spread, teleworking can also provide a method for long term recovery and improvements in quality of life after a stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this commentary addresses the benefits of physically distant, safe and effective alternatives to support individuals who live with a stroke during COVID-19 pandemic.;2021;4
"BACKGROUND: During the interruption of the non-urgent healthcare services in Italy due to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, telemedicine proved to be an effective alternative, in that it supported exercise delivery in individuals with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Recent scientific evidence demonstrates its feasibility and patient satisfaction. During the lockdown period, the Department of Pediatric Orthopedics at the Istituto di Cura Citta di Pavia supported subjects affected by AIS in two manners: online with the physical therapist (TR) and by using pre-recorded videos (VE). The aim of the present exploratory trial was to evaluate the practice of telerehabilitation in order to employ it in case of new lockdown measures. METHODS: Adherence, perceived enjoyment during the exercise performance and degree of satisfaction with technology were assessed on 18 subjects with AIS, divided into two groups according to the type of exercise administration (seven patients in TR; 11 patients in VE). RESULTS: The VE group shows a more noticeable adherence than the TR group. Nonetheless, the perceived enjoyment is more significant in the TR subjects than in the VE ones. The level of satisfaction with technology is positive in both groups under study, without remarkable differences. CONCLUSIONS: The exercise administered at a distance has been positively perceived by all the subjects, though on different levels according to the type of technology employed. Results speak in favor of the use of technology as a means to therapeutic exercise delivery in individuals with AIS. Nevertheless, it is not clear which of the two types it is better to suggest. Biopsychologically speaking, the individual choice is likely to be the most workable solution.";2021;4
Background: Educational standards of advanced musculoskeletal physiotherapy include mentored clinical practice. Whilst traditionally delivered face-to-face, telehealth e-mentoring affords a distinctive andragogy to facilitate mentee development. Objective: To understand the experiences and outcomes of stakeholders participating in musculoskeletal physiotherapy telehealth e-mentoring. Design: A case study design with sequential mixed methods (quantitative patient outcome data and qualitative interviews and a focus group) of a 20-week e-mentored telehealth physiotherapy service. Methods: Data collection comprised 1) Patient experiences and measures of musculoskeletal health 2) Mentee semi-structured interviews 3) Mentor focus group. Data analysis included descriptive statistics (median and IQR) and the Framework Method for qualitative and quantitative data respectively. An exploratory bidirectional approach supported data integration across all participants. Results: Participants included patients (n = 90), mentees (n = 10) and mentors (n = 6). Patients reported improvements (>MCID) in MSK-HQ and Patient Specific Functional Scale, with high scores for Consultation and Relational Empathy and Patient Enablement Instruments. Main themes were a) social learning b) advanced professional practice c) learner experience and d) limitations of telehealth for mentees, and for mentors a) preparedness b) journey of development and c) challenges. Participant data integration resulted in 4 main themes 1) energising/positive experience 2) communications skills valued 3) perceptions of telehealth 4) upskilling required. Conclusions: Telehealth e-mentoring is a valuable alternative to face-to-face mentored physiotherapy practice to support development in advanced musculoskeletal physiotherapy practice. Findings indicate that technical and professional skills are required, high levels of communication skills were valued, there is a need for reconceptualisation of musculoskeletal physiotherapeutic interventions.;2021;4
Background: eHealth applications are constantly increasing and are frequently considered to constitute a promising strategy for cost containment in health care, particularly if the applications aim to support older persons. Older persons are, however, not the only major eHealth stakeholder. eHealth suppliers, caregivers, funding bodies, and health authorities are also likely to attribute value to eHealth applications, but they can differ in their value attribution because they are affected differently by eHealth costs and benefits. Therefore, any assessment of the value of eHealth applications requires the consideration of multiple stakeholders in a holistic and integrated manner. Such a holistic and reliable value assessment requires a profound understanding of the application's costs and benefits. The first step in measuring costs and benefits is identifying the relevant costs and benefit categories that the eHealth application affects. Objective: The aim of this study is to support the conceptual phase of an economic evaluation by providing an overview of the relevant direct and indirect costs and benefits incorporated in economic evaluations so far. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search covering papers published until December 2019 by using the Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL EB SCOhost databases. We included papers on eHealth applications with web-based contact possibilities between clients and health care providers (mobile health apps) and applications for self-management, telehomecare, telemedicine, telemonitoring, telerehabilitation, and active healthy aging technologies for older persons. We included studies that focused on any type of economic evaluation, including costs and benefit measures. Results: We identified 55 papers with economic evaluations. These studies considered a range of different types of costs and benefits. Costs pertained to implementation activities and operational activities related to eHealth applications. Benefits (or consequences) could be categorized according to stakeholder groups, that is, older persons, caregivers, and health care providers. These benefits can further be divided into stakeholder-specific outcomes and resource usage. Some cost and benefit types have received more attention than others. For instance, patient outcomes have been predominantly captured via quality-of-life considerations and various types of physical health status indicators. From the perspective of resource usage, a strong emphasis has been placed on home care visits and hospital usage. Conclusions: Economic evaluations of eHealth applications are gaining momentum, and studies have shown considerable variation regarding the costs and benefits that they include. We contribute to the body of literature by providing a detailed and up-to-date framework of cost and benefit categories that any interested stakeholder can use as a starting point to conduct an economic evaluation in the context of independent living of older persons.;2021;4
Background: eHealth has the potential to improve outcomes such as physical activity or balance in older adults receiving geriatric rehabilitation. However, several challenges such as scarce evidence on effectiveness, feasibility, and usability hinder the successful implementation of eHealth in geriatric rehabilitation. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to assess evidence on the effectiveness, feasibility, and usability of eHealth interventions in older adults in geriatric rehabilitation. Methods: We searched 7 databases for randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized studies, quantitative descriptive studies, qualitative research, and mixed methods studies that applied eHealth interventions during geriatric rehabilitation. Included studies investigated a combination of effectiveness, usability, and feasibility of eHealth in older patients who received geriatric rehabilitation, with a mean age of >= 70 years. Quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and a narrative synthesis was conducted using a harvest plot. Results: In total, 40 studies were selected, with clinical heterogeneity across studies. Of 40 studies, 15 studies (38%) found eHealth was at least as effective as non-eHealth interventions (56% of the 27 studies with a control group), 11 studies (41%) found eHealth interventions were more effective than non-eHealth interventions, and 1 study (4%) reported beneficial outcomes in favor of the non-eHealth interventions. Of 17 studies, 16 (94%) concluded that eHealth was feasible. However, high exclusion rates were reported in 7 studies of 40 (18%). Of 40 studies, 4 (10%) included outcomes related to usability and indicated that there were certain aging-related barriers to cognitive ability, physical ability, or perception, which led to difficulties in using eHealth. Conclusions: eHealth can potentially improve rehabilitation outcomes for older patients receiving geriatric rehabilitation. Simple eHealth interventions were more likely to be feasible for older patients receiving geriatric rehabilitation, especially, in combination with another non-eHealth intervention. However, a lack of evidence on usability might hamper the implementation of eHealth. eHealth applications in geriatric rehabilitation show promise, but more research is required, including research with a focus on usability and participation.;2021;4
"Background: Falls are more prevalent in stroke survivors than age-matched healthy older adults because of their functional impairment. Rapid balance recovery reaction with adequate range-of-motion and fast response and movement time are crucial to minimize fall risk and prevent serious injurious falls when postural disturbances occur. A Kinect-based Rapid Movement Training (RMT) program was developed to provide real-time feedback to promote faster and larger arm reaching and leg stepping distances toward targets in 22 different directions. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the interactive RMT and Conventional Balance Training (CBT) on chronic stroke survivors' overall balance and balance recovery reaction. Methods: In this assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial, chronic stroke survivors were randomized to receive twenty training sessions (60-min each) of either RMT or CBT. Pre- and post-training assessments included clinical tests, as well as kinematic measurements and electromyography during simulated forward fall through a lean-and-release perturbation system. Results: Thirty participants were recruited (RMT = 16, CBT = 14). RMT led to significant improvement in balance control (Berg Balance Scale: pre = 49.13, post = 52.75; P = .001), gait control (Timed-Up-and-Go Test: pre = 14.66 s, post = 12.62 s; P = .011), and motor functions (Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery: pre = 60.63, post = 65.19; P = .015), which matched the effectiveness of CBT. Both groups preferred to use their non-paretic leg to take the initial step to restore stability, and their stepping leg's rectus femoris reacted significantly faster post-training (P = .036). Conclusion: The RMT was as effective as conventional balance training to provide beneficial effects on chronic stroke survivors' overall balance, motor function and improving balance recovery with faster muscle response.";2021;4
Background: HoMEcare aRm rehabiLItatioN (MERLIN) is an unactuated version of the robotic device ArmAssist combined with a telecare platform. Stroke patients are able to train the upper limb function using serious games at home. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of MERLIN training on the upper limb function of patients with unilateral upper limb paresis in the chronic phase of stroke (> 6 months post stroke). Methods: Patients trained task specific serious games for three hours per week during six weeks using an unactuated version of a robotic device. Progress was monitored and game settings were tailored through telerehabilitation. Measurements were performed six weeks pre-intervention (T0), at the start (T1), end (T2) and six weeks post-intervention (T3). Primary outcome was the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). Secondary outcomes were other arm function tests, quality of life, user satisfaction and motivation. Results: Twelve patients were included, ten completed the training. From start of the intervention to six weeks follow up, WMFT improved significantly with 3.8 points (p=.006), which is also clinically relevant. No significant changes in quality of life were observed. Patients were overall satisfied with the usability of the device. Comfort and the robustness of the system need further improvements. Conclusion: Patients in the chronic phase of stroke significantly improved their upper limb function with the MERLIN training at home.;2021;4
"Background: In Canada, only 11% of stroke survivors have access to outpatient and community-based rehabilitation after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Hence, innovative community-based strategies are needed to provide adequate postrehabilitation services. The VirTele program, which combines virtual reality exergames and a telerehabilitation app, was developed to provide stroke survivors with residual upper extremity deficits, the opportunity to participate in a personalized home rehabilitation program. Objective: This study aims to determine the feasibility of VirTele for remote upper extremity rehabilitation in a chronic stroke survivor; explore the preliminary efficacy of VirTele on upper extremity motor function, the amount and quality of upper extremity use, and impact on quality of life and motivation; and explore the determinants of behavioral intention and use behavior of VirTele along with indicators of empowerment. Methods: A 63-year-old male stroke survivor (3 years) with moderate upper extremity impairment participated in a 2-month VirTele intervention. He was instructed to use exergames (5 games for upper extremity) for 30 minutes, 5 times per week, and conduct videoconference sessions with a clinician at least once per week. Motivational interviewing was incorporated into VirTele to empower the participant to continue exercising and use his upper extremities in everyday activities. Upper extremity motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment-upper extremity), amount and quality of upper extremity use (Motor Activity Log-30), and impact on quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale-16) and motivation (Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire-15) were measured before (T1), after (T2) VirTele intervention, and during a 1-(T3) and 2-month (T4) follow-up period. Qualitative data were collected through logs and semistructured interviews. Feasibility data (eg, number and duration of videoconference sessions and adherence) were documented at the end of each week. Results: The participant completed 48 exergame sessions (33 hours) and 8 videoconference sessions. Results suggest that the VirTele intervention and the study protocol could be feasible for stroke survivors. The participant exhibited clinically meaningful improvements at T2 on the Fugl-Meyer and Stroke Impact Scale-16 and maintained these gains at T3 and T4. During the follow-up periods, the amount and quality of upper extremity use showed meaningful changes, suggesting more involvement of the affected upper extremity in daily activities. The participant demonstrated a high level of autonomous motivation, which may explain his adherence. Performance, effort, and social influence have meaningful weights in the behavioral intention of using VirTele. However, the lack of control of technical and organizational infrastructures may influence the long-term use of technology. At the end of the intervention, the participant demonstrated considerable empowerment at both the behavioral and capacity levels. Conclusions: VirTele was shown to be feasible for use in chronic stroke survivors for remote upper extremity rehabilitation. Meaningful determinants of behavioral intention and use behavior of VirTele were identified, and preliminary efficacy results are promising.

"Background: In March 2020, the pandemic added a major barrier resulting in the cancelation of all low vision ocular rehabilitation services. To prevent delay of beginning low vision ocular rehabilitation services, all low vision care was switched to telerehabilitation to home. Methods: Case managers began to cancel all in-person services and offer Veterans Affairs (VA) video connect services to their home. Patients with video access scheduled a home VA video connect telerehabilitation evaluation and therapy assessment. Patients who did not have video access waited to schedule a future in-person low vision appointment (postpandemic). Results: Of the in-person canceled appointments, 54% who scheduled the new home telerehabilitation evaluation were delayed on average 25 calendar days. Patients who waited for in-person low vision care were delayed on average 98, 138, or 153 calendar days. Of the 56 new patients referred for low vision optometry services during this 4-month period (COVID-19), 91% scheduled home low vision ocular telerehabilitation evaluations without delay; 5% waited until in-person clinics were open; and 4% waited until rural VA's and community-based outpatient centers were open. Discussion: Veterans with low vision who live in rural communities have limited access to services unless they are able to travel several miles to a specialty low vision clinic. Low vision ocular rehabilitation telehealth services have been successfully provided at the VA Western New York Healthcare System (Buffalo, NY) low vision clinic. Conclusions: Home low vision ocular rehabilitation telehealth increases access as early as possible once diagnosed with ocular pathology resulting in low vision.";2021;4
Background: In recent years, emphasis has been placed on cognitive enhancement to stimulate cognitive abilities and prevent functional decline. Considering that traditional face-to-face interventions can be very expensive and are not accessible to all individuals, the need to transfer care from the clinic to the patient's home is evident. In this regard, cognitive tele-enhancement interventions have received increased attention. Aim: The aim of this review was to provide an overview of protocols that apply remotely controlled cognitive training with individualized feedback on performance by the therapist in healthy older adults or participants with subjective memory complaints. Methods: Out of 35 articles assessed for eligibility, eight studies were identified. Of the selected studies, five included cognitively healthy older adults, while three included participants with subjective memory complaints. Results: Most of the reviewed studies showed beneficial effects of cognitive tele-enhancement interventions, reporting improvements in memory, sustained attention, working memory, executive functions, and language abilities. Moreover, reductions in anxiety and depression symptomatology levels, as well as in subjective memory difficulties, were described in some of the studies. Conclusions: Cognitive tele-enhancement treatment could be a good alternative to face-to-face intervention. This literature review highlights the importance of applying preventive cognitive interventions to subjects with initial subjective memory complaints. Remote modalities seem to facilitate the application of such interventions.;2021;4
Background: Low back pain is a common health problem. We compared the effects of a remote exercise instruction with in-person exercise instruction on the pain and disability of people with nonspecific low back pain for more than 12 weeks. Material and methods: We carried out a randomized clinical trial with two study arms in an outpatient clinic at a University Hospital. A total of 56 patients were included and randomly allocated to each study arm. The primary outcome was the intensity of the low back pain. The secondary outcome was the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire score. We measured the outcomes before the intervention and in one and three months after completion of the program. The program consisted of core stability exercises and included flexibility and strengthening for all patients. Participants in the remote exercise group carried out the exercises at home two times a day for four weeks. They were followed by telephone calls. Patients in the in-person exercise group received the same exercises at the clinic, three times a week for four weeks. Results: Between-group comparisons indicated that there were no significant differences between the two approaches in changing pain (p = 0.93) and disability scores (p = 0.74) from the baseline to three months postintervention values. Conclusions: There was no measurable difference between an exercise program delivered remotely compared to in-person.;2021;4
"Background: Many patients with MS continue to have symptoms of their disease even when inflammatory activity is reduced by DMTs. Although disease activity tends to be reduced during pregnancy-especially in the third trimester-women with MS can experience ongoing symptoms during pregnancy, or new ones in the immediate postpartum period, that degrade quality of life. While many MS-related and postpartum symptoms can be improved with physical therapy (PT), there are currently no guidelines on pregnancy-related rehabilitation in MS. In this analysis, we evaluated the prevalence of PT-amenable symptoms and patterns of PT referrals in a cohort of UCSF MS Clinic patients who became pregnant. Methods: We extracted electronic medical records (EMR) data for the year before conception, during pregnancy, and year postpartum for women with MS cared for at UCSF between 09-2005 and 08-2019. This included clinical visits, MS therapies and symptoms (as defined by the National MS Society). PT and pelvic floor PT orders and notes were also extracted. Results: We included 142 live birth pregnancies from 118 women. During the course of their pregnancy and within the year postpartum, 107 women (75.4%) reported at least one PT-amenable symptom. A total of 30 (28.0%) referrals were made to PT, with attendance confirmed for 10 (33.3% of referrals). Symptoms most commonly triggering a referral for PT evaluation were numbness and urinary incontinence. Falls were reported after 10 of the pregnancies; 4 resulted in a referral to PT. Forty-one women reported urinary incontinence: 11 (26.8%) were referred to PT, and 2 to pelvic floor PT. Nineteen women experienced a documented relapse during pregnancy and/or postpartum: 11 received a PT referral, and 4 attended PT. Conclusions: While women with MS recorded at least 1 PT-amenable symptom during or following 75.4% of their pregnancies, only 28% of these were referred to PT-and only a third attended PT. Of significance was the 4.9% referral rate for pelvic floor PT in postpartum women with a record of urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor PT is a mainstay of general postpartum care in many European countries. These data illustrate critical gaps in rehabilitation referral, access and use at the intersection of neurological conditions and pregnancy in a large US-based MS clinic. They lend support for quality improvement efforts to improve care pathways and for telerehabilitation innovations to reduce barriers to access and improve synergistic care between PT, MD and urologic care.";2021;4
"Background: Mobile app-based therapies are increasingly being employed by speech-language pathologists in the rehabilitation of people with aphasia as adjuncts or substitutes for traditional in-person therapy approaches. These apps can increase the intensity of treatment and have resulted in meaningful outcomes across several domains. Objective: VoiceAdapt is a mobile therapy app designed with user and stakeholder feedback within a user-centered design framework. VoiceAdapt uses two evidence-based lexical retrieval treatments to help people with aphasia in improving their naming abilities through interactions with the app. The purpose of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) proposed here is to examine the feasibility and clinical efficacy of training with VoiceAdapt on the language and communication outcomes of people with aphasia. Methods: A multicenter RCT is being conducted at two locations within Canada A total of 80 people with aphasia will be recruited to participate in a two-arm, waitlist-controlled, crossover group RCT. After baseline assessment, participants will be randomized into an intervention group or a waitlist control group. The intervention group participants will engage in 5 weeks of training with the app, followed by posttreatment and follow-up assessments after an additional 5 weeks. Those in the waitlist control group will have no training for 5 weeks; this is followed by pretreatment assessment, training for 5 weeks, and posttreatment assessment. All trial procedures are being conducted remotely given the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Recruitment of participants started in September 2020, and the study is expected to be completed by March 2022. Publication of results is expected within 6 months of study completion. Conclusions: The results of the RCT will provide information on evidence-based practice using technology-based solutions to treat aphasia. If positive results are obtained from this RCT, the VoiceAdapt app can be recommended as an efficacious means of improving lexical retrieval and communicative functioning in people with aphasia in an easily accessible and a cost-effective manner. Moreover, the implementation of this RCT through remote assessment and delivery can provide information to therapists on telerehabilitation practices and monitoring of app-based home therapy programs.";2021;4
"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal and psychosocial problems have tended to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changes in musculoskeletal problems and psychosocial status of teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic due to online education and to investigate the effects of preventive telerehabilitation applications for musculoskeletal problems. METHODS: Forty teachers who conducted online education during the pandemic volunteered to participate in the study. All assessments were performed via online methods. The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (CMDQ), ProFitMap-Neck questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) were used to evaluate musculoskeletal problems; the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate anxiety and depression, respectively; and the Work-Life Balance Scale (WLBS) was used to evaluate how well individuals achieve this balance. Information about before online education, during online education, and after training was obtained with the assessments. After the first assessment, telerehabilitation, which involved presentations and brochures, was applied to 18 participants willing to participate in the training. RESULTS: The ProFitMap, UEFI, and WLBS scores during the online education decreased significantly, while the scores of the CMDQ, ODI, BDI, and BAI during the online education increased significantly compared to the pre-online education scores (p < 0.05). In addition, the total CMDQ, ProFitMap, and ODI scores improved significantly after the training (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal and psychosocial problems increased in teachers during online education. Preventive telerehabilitation methods will be beneficial for individuals who do not have access to face-to-face physiotherapy.";2021;4
Background: Neuroscience and neurotechnology are transforming stroke rehabilitation. Robotic devices, in addition to telerehabilitation, are increasingly being used to train the upper limbs after stroke, and their use at home allows us to extend institutional rehabilitation by increasing and prolonging therapy. The aim of this study is to assess the usability of the MERLIN robotic system based on serious games for upper limb rehabilitation in people with stroke in the home environment. Methods: 9 participants with a stroke in three different stages of recovery (subacute, short-term chronic and long-term chronic) with impaired arm/hand function, were recruited to use the MERLIN system for 3 weeks: 1 week training at the Maimonides Biomedical Research Institute of Cordoba (IMIBIC), and 2 weeks at the patients' homes. To evaluate usability, the System Usability Scale (SUS), Adapted Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology (QUEST), and the ArmAssist Usability Assessment Questionnaire were used in the post-intervention. Clinical outcomes for upper limb motor function were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results: 9 patients participated in and completed the study. The usability assessment reported a high level of satisfaction: mean SUS score 71.94 % (SD = 16.38), mean QUEST scale 3.81 (SD = 0.38), and mean Adapted IMI score 6.12 (SD = 1.36). The results of the ArmAssist Questionnaire showed an average of 6 out of 7, which indicates that MERLIN is extremely intuitive, easy to learn and easy to use. Regarding clinical assessment, the Fugl-Meyer scores showed moderate improvements from pre- to post-intervention in the total score of motor function (p = 0.002). There were no significant changes in the Modified Ashworth scale outcomes (p = 0.169). Conclusions: This usability study indicates that home-based rehabilitation for upper limbs with the MERLIN system is safe, useful, feasible and motivating. Telerehabilitation constitutes a major step forward in the use of intensive rehabilitation at home.;2021;4
Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, debilitating, and degenerative joint disease. However, it is difficult for patients with knee OA to access conventional rehabilitation when discharging from the hospital. Internet-based rehabilitation is one of the promising telemedicine strategies to provide a means combining monitoring, guidance, and treatment for patients with knee OA. Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis for assessing the effect of internet-based rehabilitation programs on pain and physical function in patients with knee OA. Methods: Keywords related to knee OA and internet-based rehabilitation were systematically searched in the Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database), CNKI, SinoMed, and WANFANG databases from January 2000 to April 2020. Only randomized controlled trials were included. The authors independently screened the literature. The main outcome measures were focused on pain and physical function. A meta-analysis was performed on the collected data. Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.3) was used for all analyses. Results: The systematic review identified 6 randomized controlled trials, 4 of which were included in the meta-analysis, comprising a total of 791 patients with knee OA. The meta-analysis with the fixed-effects model showed that the internet-based rehabilitation programs could significantly alleviate the osteoarthritic pain for patients compared with conventional rehabilitation (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.21, 95% CI -0.4 to -0.01, P=.04). No significant difference was found in the improvement of physical function in patients with knee OA compared with conventional rehabilitation within 2 to 12 months (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.12, P=.43). Conclusions: This systematic review shows that internet-based rehabilitation programs could improve the pain but not physical function for patients with knee OA. However, there was a very small number of studies that could be included in the review and meta-analysis. Thus, further studies with large sample sizes are warranted to promote the effectiveness of internet-based rehabilitation and to develop its personalized design.;2021;4
Background: Pelvic girdle dysfunction is a common musculoskeletal disorder among pregnant women. It is a disabling condition affecting the ability of a pregnant woman to perform her daily functional activities. The scope of digital health in delivering rehabilitation services is growing exponentially, especially in the present COVID -19 pandemic crisis. Case description: A 29-year-old primigravida, at 32 weeks of gestation with severe pelvic girdle pain during bed transitions, sought physiotherapy consultation via video call, as she expressed difficulty in accessing Physiotherapy services due to the present pandemic crisis. Physiotherapy consultation was provided in 4 weekly sessions using a real-time video-based telerehabilitation program and the patient performed unsupervised exercise sessions for 30 minutes for 5 days per week for 4 weeks. The plan of care included muscle energy techniques, pelvic cloth belt, strengthening, stabilization exercises and stretching. Outcomes: The patient completed four sessions including evaluation and treatment and there was a reduction of pain scores for bed transitions from NPRS 8/10 during session one to NPRS 0/10 during session four. The Pelvic girdle dysfunction questionnaire showed a decrease in percentage scores from 54.6 to 4 at the end of physiotherapy sessions. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation was successfully used to manage a pregnant woman with pelvic girdle dysfunction.;2021;4
"Background: Physical performance measures assessing mobility are important took for assessing current functional status, predicting future functional status, and monitoring change. To respond to the increased necessity to conduct research and care remotely and self-monitor one's health status, there is a need for reliable, valid, and responsive measures that can be self or remotely administered. Objectives: To evaluate (i) the test procedures and population suitability of remotely or self-administered lower extremity performance measures and (ii) the measurement properties of scores for these measures. Methods: This review will include quantitative studies with adult participants (>= 18years) who are living independently in the community. For the purposes of this review, mobility is defined as the ability to move by changing body position or location or transferring from one place to another as per the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. Five databases; MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and Cochrane CENTRAL will be searched to identify relevant studies. Reference lists of relevant studies will be hand-searched to identify additional eligible studies. Title and abstracts screening, full text screening and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. Results will be compared against COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments' (COSMIN) criteria for measurement properties which provide a sufficient, insufficient, or indeterminate rating based on whether a previously defined hypothesis (set by research team or by COSMIN). The quality of each study will be assessed by two independent reviewers using COSMIN's Risk of Bias tool.";2021;4
"Background: Public health responses to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) including lockdowns may negatively impact physical and mental functioning in clinical populations. People living with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be more susceptible to physical function deterioration while practicing social distancing. Recent reports have suggested that about 50% of people with MS (pwMS) decreased their leisure physical activity during COVID-19, and upwards of 30% reported decreased physical fitness levels. However, the impact of social distancing on adverse health-related outcomes such as falls has not received much scrutiny. Therefore, we explored the frequency and characteristics of falls experienced by people living with and without MS during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Two-hundred and thirty-nine individuals, including 106 pwMS (median age: 59 years) and 133 people living without MS (median age: 66 years) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. A snowball sampling strategy was used for online recruitment. Participants completed a customized falls questionnaire and the number of falls experienced (if any) during COVID-19 was recorded. Fall-related characteristics such as the timing, locations, activities undertaken before falling and consequences, as well as self-reported physical activity were also recorded. Results: Overall, participants reported 232 falls (1.67 falls/person in pwMS and 0.41 falls/person in non-MS participants). People living with MS (pwMS) had a significantly higher frequency of falls (58.5% vs 21.8%; p< 0.001) and recurrent falls (45.3% vs 9.8%; p<0.001) compared to non-MS participants. Additionally, pwMS reported a significantly higher proportion of in-home falls (83.9% vs 54.2%; p = 0.004), as well as a higher proportion of overall injuries (44.3% vs 12.5%, p<0.001), fractures (5.7% vs 0.8%, p = 0.048), and healthcare utilization (9.4% vs 1.6%, p = 0.007) compared to non-MS participants. A similar proportion of pwMS (49.1%) and non-MS participants (52.2%) reported lower physical activity levels during COVID-19. Conclusion: This cross-sectional study revealed that pwMS remain at high risk of falls and fall-related outcomes during COVID-19. The high number of falls experienced by pwMS is of clinical concern considering the current strain on the healthcare system. Findings from this study highlight the importance of monitoring falls and the potential for telerehabilitation in persons with MS during COVID-19.";2021;4
Background: Recovery of physical activity (PA) after telerehabilitation following knee and hip arthroplasty (TKA-THA) has rarely been studied. An improved understanding of PA recovery is needed, as it could be influenced by many factors such as age, gender or pre-operative physical function. Objectives: To assess PA recovery weekly for 3 months after TKA-THA and to determine peri-operative factors that could help predict PA recovery at 3 months. Methods: From one week before until 3 months after surgery, 132 patients wore a fitness tracker continuously. Each patient received personalized and daily exercises and feedback through a tablet. Before and after surgery, patient-reported outcome measures of symptoms, pain, activities of daily living and quality of life were recorded. A one-way repeated-measure ANOVA was used to assess the time effect on step count for each post-operative week. To predict the absolute step count at 3 months post-surgery, a backward multiple linear regression was used. Results: Patients reached their pre-operative PA level at week 7, with no significant additional improvement by 3 months post-surgery. Pre-operative step count, the number of days using crutches and pre-operative symptoms explained 35% of the variability of step count at 3 months. Conclusion: This patient population receiving telerehabilitation reached their pre-operative PA level at 7-week post-surgery with no further improvement over the subsequent 5 weeks. The PA level at 3 months could be predicted by pre-operative step count, duration of crutches use, and pre-operative symptoms.

"Background: Reduced falls and fall risks have been observed among older adults referred to the HOP-UP-PT (Home-based Older Persons Upstreaming Prevention-Physical Therapy) program. The purpose of this study was to describe outcomes of HOP-UP-PT program participants and then to compare these outcomes to non-participants. Methods: Six Michigan senior centers referred adults >= 65 years who were at-risk for functional decline or falls. 144 participants (n = 72 per group) were randomized to either the experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG). Physical therapists (PTs) delivered physical, environmental, and health interventions to the EG over nine encounters (six in-person, three telerehabilitation) spanning seven months. The CG participants were told to continue their usual physical activity routines during the same time frame. Baseline and re-assessments were conducted at 0-, 3-, and 7-months in both groups. Descriptions and comparisons from each assessment encounter were analyzed. Results: Participants ages were: EG = 76.6 (7.0) years and CG = 77.2 (8.2). Baseline measures were not significantly different apart from the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) which favored the EG (P = 0.02). While no significant differences were identified in the survey outcomes or home environment assessments, significant differences in favor of the EG were identified in common fall risk indicators including the Timed Up and Go (P = 0.04), Four Test Balance Scale (P = 0.01), and the modified SPPB (P = 0.02) at the 3-month assessment visit. However, these differences were not sustained at the 7-month assessment as, notably, both groups demonstrated positive improvements in the Four Test Balance Score and SPPB. For individuals at a moderate/high fall risk at baseline, 47.8% of CG reported falling at seven months; whereas, only 6.3% of EG participants meeting the same criteria reported a fall after HOP-UP-PT participation. Conclusions: A prevention-focused multimodal program provided by PTs in older adults' homes proved beneficial and those with the highest fall risk demonstrated a significant decrease in falls. A collaboration between PTs and community senior centers resulted in upstreaming care delivery that may reduce both the financial and personal burdens associated with falls in an older adult population.";2021;4
Background: Rehabilitation is seen as crucial in dealing with the demographic change in many European countries. In Germany, for example, after having stayed in a rehabilitation center, patients have the possibility to participate in aftercare programs aimed at promoting long-term health behaviour. Despite the relevance of follow-up support for patients' long-term health and work ability, participation rates in aftercare programs are quite low. Here, web-based aftercare programs can be a viable alternative to the traditional face-to-face programs due to their flexibility in time and location. This research project aims to use quantitative and qualitative methods to gain more insight into the potential of web-based aftercare programs. Methods: The goal is to recruit up to 1150 patients at baseline in five rehabilitation centers across Germany. For ethical reasons, partially randomized experimental study design is used to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of web-based aftercare programs. All patients are offered the traditional face-to-face aftercare treatment (IRENA). When patients deny to participate in traditional face-to-face aftercare, they are randomly distributed into either web-based aftercare (digIRENA) or a control group. In all three groups, the SF-12, which measures subjective health, and the WAI, which measures working ability, will be used at baseline, 13 weeks, 26 weeks and 43 weeks after the patients have left the rehabilitation center. BREQ-2, which measures motivation, is used only in the traditional aftercare group and the web-based aftercare group. A multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measurement and latent growth curve models will be used to compare the development of the variables in the three groups. For the qualitative part of the study, interviews with patients and therapists will be conducted to shed light on the applicability, acceptance, and usability of web-based aftercare programs. Discussion: This study may provide valuable insight into the potential of web-based rehabilitation aftercare programs as a way to supplement traditional face-to-face programs. This seems particularly promising if it can manage to reach those patients who do not currently participate in traditional face-to-face rehabilitation aftercare programs due to time and location constraints.;2021;4
"Background: Returning to work after traumatic injury can be problematic. We developed a vocational telerehabilitation (VR) intervention for trauma survivors, delivered by trained occupational therapists (OTs) and clinical psychologists (CPs), and explored factors affecting delivery and acceptability in a feasibility study. Methods: Surveys pre- (5 OTs, 2 CPs) and post-training (3 OTs, 1 CP); interviews pre- (5 OTs, 2 CPs) and post-intervention (4 trauma survivors, 4 OTs, 2 CPs). Mean survey scores for 14 theoretical domains identified telerehabilitation barriers (score <= 3.5) and facilitators (score >= 5). Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed. Results: Surveys: pre-training, the only barrier was therapists' intentions to use telerehabilitation (mean = 3.40 +/- 0.23), post-training, 13/14 domains were facilitators. Interviews: barriers/facilitators included environmental context/resources (e.g., technology, patient engagement, privacy/disruptions, travel and access); beliefs about capabilities (e.g., building rapport, complex assessments, knowledge/confidence, third-party feedback and communication style); optimism (e.g., impossible assessments, novel working methods, perceived importance and patient/therapist reluctance) and social/professional role/identity (e.g., therapeutic methods). Training and experience of intervention delivery addressed some barriers and increased facilitators. The intervention was acceptable to trauma survivors and therapists. Conclusion: Despite training and experience in intervention delivery, some barriers remained. Providing some face-to-face delivery where necessary may address certain barriers, but strategies are required to address other barriers.";2021;4
BACKGROUND: Several factors, including the aging population and the recent corona pandemic, have increased the need for cost effective, easy-to-use and reliable telerehabilitation services. Computer vision-based marker-less human pose estimation is a promising variant of telerehabilitation and is currently an intensive research topic. It has attracted significant interest for detailed motion analysis, as it does not need arrangement of external fiducials while capturing motion data from images. This is promising for rehabilitation applications, as they enable analysis and supervision of clients' exercises and reduce clients' need for visiting physiotherapists in person. However, development of a marker-less motion analysis system with precise accuracy for joint identification, joint angle measurements and advanced motion analysis is an open challenge. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this paper is to provide a critical overview of recent computer vision-based marker-less human pose estimation systems and their applicability for rehabilitation application. An overview of some existing marker-less rehabilitation applications is also provided. METHODS: This paper presents a critical review of recent computer vision-based marker-less human pose estimation systems with focus on their provided joint localization accuracy in comparison to physiotherapy requirements and ease of use. The accuracy, in terms of the capability to measure the knee angle, is analysed using simulation. RESULTS: Current pose estimation systems use 2D, 3D, multiple and single view-based techniques. The most promising techniques from a physiotherapy point of view are 3D marker-less pose estimation based on a single view as these can perform advanced motion analysis of the human body while only requiring a single camera and a computing device. Preliminary simulations reveal that some proposed systems already provide a sufficient accuracy for 2D joint angle estimations. CONCLUSIONS: Even though test results of different applications for some proposed techniques are promising, more rigour testing is required for validating their accuracy before they can be widely adopted in advanced rehabilitation applications.;2021;4
Background: Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. Barriers to rehabilitation include cost, transportation, lack of trained personnel, and equipment. Telerehabilitation (TR) has emerged as a promising modality to reduce costs, improve accessibility, and retain patient independence. TR allows providers to remotely administer therapy, potentially increasing access to underserved regions. Objectives: To describe types of stroke rehabilitation therapy delivered through TR and to evaluate whether TR is as effective as traditional in-person outpatient therapy in improving satisfaction and poststroke residual deficits such as motor function, speech, and disability. Methods: A literature search of the term telerehabilitation and stroke was conducted across three databases. Full-text articles with results pertaining to TR interventions were reviewed. Articles were scored for methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Results: Thirty-four articles with 1,025 patients were included. Types of TR included speech therapy, virtual reality (VR), robotic, community-based, goal setting, and motor training exercises. Frequently measured outcomes included motor function, speech, disability, and satisfaction. All 34 studies reported improvement from baseline after TR therapy. PEDro scores ranged from 2 to 8 with a mean of 4.59 +/- 1.94 (on a scale of 0-10). Studies with control interventions, randomized allocation, and blinded assessment had significantly higher PEDro scores. All 15 studies that compared TR with traditional therapy showed equivalent or better functional outcomes. Home-based robotic therapy and VR were less costly than in-person therapy. Patient satisfaction with TR and in-person clinical therapy was similar. Conclusions: TR is less costly and equally as effective as clinic-based rehabilitation at improving functional outcomes in stroke patients. TR produces similar patient satisfaction. TR can be combined with other therapies, including VR, speech, and robotic assistance, or used as an adjuvant to direct in-person care.;2021;4
"Background: Stroke survivors need continuing exercise intervention to maintain functional status. This study assessed the feasibility and efficacy of an interactive telerehabilitation exergaming system to improve balance in individuals with chronic stroke, compared to conventional one-on-one rehabilitation. Methods: In this prospective case-control pilot study, 30 Taiwanese individuals with chronic stroke were enrolled and randomly allocated to an experimental group and a control group. All participants received intervention 3 times per week for 4 weeks in the study hospital. The experiment group underwent telerehabilitation using a Kinect camera-based interactive telerehabilitation system in an independent room to simulate home environment. In contrast, the control group received conventional one-on-one physiotherapy in a dedicated rehabilitation area. The effectiveness of interactive telerehabilitation in improving balance in stroke survivors was evaluated by comparing outcomes between the two groups. The primary outcome was Berg Balance Scale (BBS) scores. Secondary outcomes were performance of the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, Motricity Index, and Functional Ambulation Category. Results: Comparison of outcomes between experimental and control groups revealed no significant differences between groups at baseline and post-intervention for all outcome measures. However, BBS scores improved significantly in both groups (control group: p = 0.01, effect size = 0.49; experimental group: p = 0.01, effect size = 0.70). Completion times of TUG tests also improved significantly in the experimental group (p = 0.005, effect size = 0.70). Conclusion: The Kinect camera-based interactive telerehabilitation system demonstrates superior or equal efficacy compared to conventional one-on-one physiotherapy for improving balance in individuals with chronic stroke.";2021;4
Background: Strong evidence supports beginning stroke rehabilitation as soon as the patient's medical status has stabilized and continuing following discharge from acute care. However, adherence to rehabilitation treatments over the rehabilitation phase has been shown to be suboptimal. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a telerehabilitation platform on stroke patients' adherence to a rehabilitation plan and on their level of reintegration into normal social activities, in comparison with usual care. The primary outcome is patient adherence to stroke rehabilitation (up to 12 weeks), which is hypothesized to influence reintegration into normal living. Secondary outcomes for patients include functional recovery and independence, depression, adverse events related to telerehabilitation, use of services (up to 6 months), perception of interprofessional shared decision making, and quality of services received. Interprofessional collaboration as well as quality of interprofessional shared decision making will be measured with clinicians. Methods: In this interrupted time series with a convergent qualitative component, rehabilitation teams will be trained to develop rehabilitation treatment plans that engage the patient and family, while taking advantage of a telerehabilitation platform to deliver the treatment. The intervention will be comprised of 220 patients who will take part in stroke telerehabilitation with an interdisciplinary group of clinicians (telerehabilitation group) versus face-to-face standard of care (control group: n=110 patients). Results: Our Research Ethics Board approved the study in June 2020. Data collection for the control group is underway, with another year planned before we begin the intervention phase. Conclusions: This study will contribute to the minimization of both knowledge and practice gaps, while producing robust, in-depth data on the factors related to the effectiveness of telerehabilitation in a stroke rehabilitation continuum. Findings will inform best practice guidelines regarding telecare services and the provision of telerehabilitation, including recommendations for effective interdisciplinary collaboration regarding stroke rehabilitation.;2021;4
Background: Substantial evidence supports the benefits of supervised exercise training (ET) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, there are limitations such as transportation problems preventing physical activity for some people with MS. One opportunity for increasing physical activity participant in people with MS is home-based exercise training (HBET), yet we are unaware of a systematic review of HBET in people with MS. We undertook a systematic review for enhancing the knowledge about HBET in people with MS. Methods: To identify eligible studies, we included the medical subject headings (MeSH) keywords including 'multiple sclerosis' OR 'MS' OR 'degenerative nerve disease' AND 'home-based exercise' OR 'home-based training' OR 'home-based balance training' OR 'home-based rehabilitation' OR 'physical telerehabilitation' OR 'home-based walking' OR 'home-based step training.' Studies were included in this review that examined the effect of HBET in people with MS, were written in English, and available in full-text. Results: According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24 studies were judged eligible to be included in this systematic review. The results indicated that a total number of 10 studies had mainly implemented combined ET interventions. Balance and aerobic ET had been included in 5 studies. Three studies had further administered resistance ET interventions and one study had applied exergaming. Moreover, 13 studies had focused on the effects of ET on physical fitness, one article had reflected on the impact of ET on fatigue, and nine cases had included fatigue, quality of life, and fitness as outcome measures. Conclusions: Home-based ET, 2-7 times per week, is beneficial, feasible, and safe in people with MS. Nevertheless, there were notable limitations, including (a) adherence to interventions, which needs to be addressed in future studies, and (b) disability-related outcomes which should be considered in future HBET studies.;2021;4
"Background: Technology is being increasingly investigated as an option to allow stroke survivors to exploit their full potential for recovery by facilitating home-based upper limb practice. This review seeks to explore the factors that influence perseverance with technology-facilitated home-based upper limb practice after stroke. Methods: A systematic mixed studies review with sequential exploratory synthesis was undertaken. Studies investigating adult stroke survivors with upper limb disability undertaking technology-facilitated home-based upper limb practice administered >= 3 times/week over a period of >= 4 weeks were included. Qualitative outcomes were stroke survivors' and family members' perceptions of their experience utilising technology to facilitate home-based upper limb practice. Quantitative outcomes were adherence and dropouts, as surrogate measures of perseverance. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess quality of included studies. Results: Forty-two studies were included. Six studies were qualitative and of high quality; 28 studies were quantitative and eight were mixed methods studies, all moderate to low quality. A conceptual framework of perseverance with three stages was formed: (1) getting in the game; (2) sticking with it, and; (3) continuing or moving on. Conditions perceived to influence perseverance, and factors mediating these conditions were identified at each stage. Adherence with prescribed dose ranged from 13 to 140%. Participants were found to be less likely to adhere when prescribed sessions were more frequent (6-7 days/week) or of longer duration (>= 12 weeks). Conclusion: From the mixed methods findings, we propose a framework for perseverance with technology-facilitated home-based upper limb practice. The framework offers opportunities for clinicians and researchers to design strategies targeting factors that influence perseverance with practice, in both the clinical prescription of practice and technology design. To confirm the clinical utility of this framework, further research is required to explore perseverance and the factors influencing perseverance.";2021;4
Background: Telehealth implementation is a great solution for Indigenous older adults (OAs) due to the rise of chronic disease and other age-related health disorders. Telehealth is a promising option to increase quality of life, decrease healthcare costs, and offer more independent living. Objectives: This scoping review investigated existing telehealth solutions that have been implemented to serve Indigenous OAs. Methods: A structured search strategy was performed on 6 electronic databases: Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO, Ovid Embase, EBSCOhost, Scopus and Cochrane. Studies were included in the review if they contained information on telehealth technologies for Indigenous OAs (aged 65 years and older). Grey literature was also explored in ProQuest Theses and Dissertations, ERIC, Google Advanced and various government websites from Canada, Australia/New Zealand and the USA. Results: Twenty six articles were included and reviewed by two assessors. Analysis of the results from five countries revealed eight different types of telehealth solutions for Indigenous OAs. No documented telerehabilitation technologies were available to OAs in Indigenous Communities. Analysis of a broad range of Indigenous OAs with different chronic diseases revealed that they are seeking telehealth technologies for ease of access to health care, increased health equity and cost-effectiveness. Results revealed various advantages of telehealth for Indigenous OAs and barriers for implementing such technologies in Indigenous communities. Conclusion: The use of telehealth technologies among OAs is expected to rise, but effective implementation will be successful only if the patient's acceptance and culture are kept at the forefront, and if healthcare services are provided by telehealth-trained healthcare professionals.;2021;4
Background: Telemedicine in upper extremity surgery is an evolving modality that provides a viable alternative to the traditional in-person visit for achieving convenient, safe, and cost-effective health care. Our study aimed to identify patient preferences for virtual visits for hand and upper extremity surgery. Methods: An institutional review board approved survey was prospectively administered to all patients >18 years of age, presenting for any complaint to an orthopedic hand and upper extremity clinic at a Level I academic trauma center from September to December 2019. This survey included questions about access and literacy of technology as well as patient preferences regarding virtual visits. The medical record was reviewed to collect demographics, insurance type, and reasons for their visit. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed according to survey responses. Results: Two hundred consecutive patients (n) completed surveys. Surveys revealed that >88% of patients own a computer or smartphone, have WiFi access at home, and own a device capable of video chat. In total, 75% of patients reported that they would be moderately or highly comfortable in their ability to use a device for a virtual visit. In bivariate and multivariate analyses, technological literacy and access to a private space to conduct a visit were associated with high interest in virtual visits. Discussion: Telemedicine is a viable alternative to in-person patient visits. Our study demonstrates that most patients are willing and able to participate in a virtual visit for a hand or upper extremity issue.;2021;4
Background: Tele-neuropsychological assessments have got a lot of attention as they can be available for older adults in rural areas who have difficulty in accessing medical services. However, to date, their reliability and validity are unclear yet. This study was to investigate the reliability of the tele-neuropsychological assessment using the newly developed Mobile Screening System for Mild Cognitive Impairment (mSTS-MCI). Method: Sixteen older adults (age: 65-85 years, 11 females) in rural areas participated in this study and were allocated into three conditions. While a primary rater scored subjects' performances on the mSTS-MCI either face-to-face or by health, a secondary rater independently observed the primary rater's administration and scored subjects' performances on the mSTS-MCI in-person or by telehealth in accordance with the conditions. The inter-rater reliabilities across conditions were compared to test differences between in-person and telehealth methods. Results: The inter-rater reliability of the mSTS-MCI score and reaction time across the three conditions was high, ranging from r = 0.987 to r = 1.000. There were no significant differences in reliability correlations among the conditions (p's > 0.1). Moreover, the absolute mean difference between both the raters revealed no significant differences across the conditions, indicating acceptable accuracy (p = 0.324). On the other hand, all subjects were found to be positive about computer use. Conclusion: These results indicated the reliability of administering the mSTS-MCI by telehealth, which suggests telehealth could be regarded as a beneficial way for older adults in rural areas.

"Background: Tele-rehabilitation (TR) may be an effective alternative or complement to centre-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) with heart failure (HF) patients, helping overcome accessibility problems to CBCR. The aim of this study is to systematically review the literature in order to assess the clinical effectiveness of TR programs in the management of chronic HF patients, compared to standard of care and standard rehabilitation (CBCR). Methods and Results: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on the effect and safety of TR programs in HF patients, regarding cardiovascular death, heart failure-related hospitalizations, functional capacity and quality of life. We searched 4 electronic databases up until May 2020, reviewed references of relevant articles and contacted experts. A quantitative synthesis of evidence was performed by means of random-effects meta-analyses. We included 17 primary studies, comprising 2206 patients. Four studies reported the number of hospitalizations (TR: 301; Control: 347). TR showed to be effective in the improvement of HF patients' functional capacity in the 6 Minute Walk-Test (Mean Difference (MD) 15.86; CI 95% [7.23; 24.49]; I2 = 74%) and in peak oxygen uptake (pVO2) results (MD 1.85; CI 95% [0.16; 3.53]; I-2 = 93%). It also improved patients' quality of life (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire: MD -6.62; CI 95% [-11.40; -1.84]; I-2 = 99%). No major adverse events were reported during TR exercise. Conclusion: TR showed to be superior than UC without CR on functional capacity improvement in HF patients. There is still scarce evidence of TR impact on hospitalization and cv death reduction. Further research and more standardized protocols are needed to improve evidence on TR effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness.";2021;4
BACKGROUND: Telerehabilitation is an effective health delivery method for patients with a variety of health conditions. There is insufficient knowledge about use of telerehabilitation to support patients with disabilities and chronic illness in obtaining or sustaining competitive employment. Employment rates of Veterans are lower than civilian rates, and the employment gap is higher for Veterans living in rural areas. OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors that enabled and constrained routine use of video tele-technologies in delivering individualized community-based vocational rehabilitation (referred to as Tele-VR) services and to identify impacts and promising practices in implementation. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with providers from two Veterans Health Administration Medical Sites that use telerehabilitation to supplement their existing face-to-face individualized community-based VR services. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five themes in the implementation of Tele-VR were identified (1) Enhancing Workflow for Providers, (2) Improving Quality of Therapeutic Care, (3) Practicalities in Implementing Tele-VR, (4) EmbeddingVocational Rehabilitation into Interdisciplinary Care as a Facilitator to Implementation, and (5) Impact of Tele-VR. CONCLUSIONS: The telerehabilitation delivery of employment service to Veterans with disabilities is a viable means for remotely providing or enhancing face-to-face individualized and community-based VR services that support Veterans' competitive employment and job stability within their communities.;2021;4
"Background: Telerehabilitation is imperative and impending in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. However, its feasibility in low- and middle-income nations such as India remained unclear. Objective: To assess the feasibility of administering a smartphone-based telerehabilitation program for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in India. Material and method: An online cross-sectional survey was administered to stakeholders of the telerehabilitation program: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, health care professionals including pulmonary care physicians, rehabilitation nurses and physiotherapists. The survey sought to ascertain the causes, barriers, and facilitators associated with the implementation of smartphone-based telerehabilitation, as well as strategies for practice improvement. Results: While 71% (n = 37/52) of the 52 healthcare professionals surveyed were aware of smartphone-based telerehabilitation, implementation was found to be extremely low (n = 4/37; 10%). The majority of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 21/30; 70%) agreed to accept smartphone-based telerehabilitation as one of their treatment options. In India, challenges to efficient telerehabilitation implementation included a lack of infrastructure, perceived time consumption, a lack of expertise and training, organizational support, and perceived inefficacy. Conclusion: While knowledge of smartphone-based telerehabilitation is high among healthcare professionals and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, implementation of this novel intervention measure has been limited due to perceived constraints associated with smartphone-based telerehabilitation. Adapting national and organizational policies to support smartphone-based telerehabilitation services is critical during this decade of social isolation.";2021;4
Background: TELEREH-HF study showed a statistically significant improvement in the tertiary outcomes i.e. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class after a 9 week follow-up, consistent with telerehabilitation-related benefit in quality of life (QoL) measured by the 36-Item Short Form questionnaire (SF-36). Aim: We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of hybrid telerehabilitation compared to standard care in heart failure patients in the Polish setting using findings from the TELEREH-HF trial. Methods: Cost-utility analysis was conducted from a public payer (Polish National Health Fund) perspective. The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measure was based on QoL, as survival benefit was not confirmed in the TELEREH-HF. Utility values were estimated based on NYHA improvement and a systematic review of NYHA-specific utility values. Alternatively, SF-36 results were translated into utility values. Telerehabilitation costs covered 8 weeks, 5 days/week, at a daily cost of 74 PLN. Standard care costs resulted from extra in-patient and out-patient rehabilitation costs incurred for selected patients. A lifetime horizon was adopted, with an estimated average survival time of 3.9 years based on 2 years TELEREH-HF follow up and subsequent literature-derived prognosis. Results: Base case analysis yielded a 0.044 and 0.027 gain in QALY for the NYHA- and SF-36-based approach, corresponding to a cost per QALY of 58.7 and 96 thousand PLN, respectively. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that the cost per QALY value was likely below the official cost-effectiveness threshold in Poland. Conclusions: The use of telerehabilitation was found cost-effective in Poland, i.e., the clinical benefits justify the additional costs.;2021;4
Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered a devastating effect worldwide. In addition to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal deconditioning, reports of neurological consequences (e.g. stroke, critical illness polyneuropathy, myopathy, vertigo, headaches, facial palsy, and delirium) are growing increasingly common. Objectives: Part I of this review of rehabilitation strategies and neurological consequences in patients with COVID-19 sought to consider potential rehabilitation strategies for managing the emerging neurological consequences of COVID-19. Methods: An exploratory review was conducted that comprised a narrative synthesis in two parts. Part I focused on neurological consequences and physiotherapy and rehabilitation approaches. Part II focused on the general principles of rehabilitation interventions and precautions that should be considered. Literature on the use of the neurorehabilitation approaches was also included in the review. Results: Rehabilitation services include inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services. With respect to the recovery of mobility and function, an interdisciplinary approach was generally involved. Conclusions: A thorough assessment and the development of an individualized, progressive treatment and rehabilitation plan should be implemented by focusing on existing function, any disabilities, the desire to return to participation in society, and maximizing function and quality of life. It should be noted that neurorehabilitation should not be delayed and be completed for all patients with COVID-19 of all levels in need.;2021;4
Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered a devastating effect worldwide.

Methods: An exploratory review was conducted that comprised a narrative synthesis in two parts. Part I focused on neurological consequences and physiotherapy and rehabilitation approaches. Part II focused on general principles of rehabilitation interventions and precautions that should be considered. Literature on the use of neurorehabilitation approaches was also included in the review. Results: Rehabilitation should be initiated as quickly as possible. Neurorehabilitation protocols include public health training valid for the whole community and providing intensive care, pulmonary rehabilitation, mobilization, exercise and strengthening, whole-body vibration, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, telerehabilitation, and other rehabilitation interventions. Interventions should be conducted while correctly implementing personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, sterilization procedures, and other precautions to avoid the risk of contamination. Conclusions: Multidimensional assessment should be followed by development of individualized and progressive treatment and neurorehabilitation plans. These plans should focus on existing potential and recovery of mobility and function in particular. It is important for rehabilitation teams to keep gathering and reporting data on patients with COVID-19 and the neurologic complications of COVID-19 during and after the pandemic.;2021;4
Background: The announcement of a national lockdown in South Africa had country-wide impact on the delivery of health services. Strategies included prioritisation of patients and protecting patients who were considered at risk, resulting in the need for cancellation and temporary termination of many outpatient therapy services. This necessitated the urgent need to come up with a way of delivering physiotherapy rehabilitation services to patients in a more non-traditional format. Telerehabilitation allows for the provision of services by using electronic communication, thus ensuring that patients are still able to access necessary rehabilitation services. Methods/design: This is a prospective, mixed method study with participants recruited from the outpatient physiotherapy department of Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH). Telerehabilitation services will be provided via the patients' preferred method of communication. On discharge, participants and therapists will be asked about their experiences of telerehabilitation. Discussion: Because of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients are unable to receive traditional face-to-face physiotherapy services. Telerehabilitation offers a suitable alternative to treatment, but the feasibility, outcome and experiences of offering these services in the public health system have not been studied. Conclusion: This study will determine whether telerehabilitation is a feasible service that can be offered in the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as post-pandemic, to enable physiotherapists to access those patients who are often unable to attend physiotherapy because of transport costs and various other reasons for non-attendance. Clinical implications: The results of this study may indicate a way of managing patients in situations where face to face therapy cannot be undertaken.

Background: The closure of all educational institutions and most rehabilitation centres represents a precautionary measure to face the COVID-19 pandemic, but the isolation and social distancing may be particularly challenging for children with special needs and disabilities (SEND), such as Rett Syndrome (RTT). The main aim of this study was to promote cognitive and social interactions among children with RTT through an interactive school program. Methods: The Interactive School palimpsest was composed of moments in which a teacher spoke directly to children with RTT and expected a response through eye gaze, and moments in which storeys-cartoon were presented while tracking the eye gaze of children. We investigated behavioural, social and cognitive parameters. Results: Children participated in both social and cognitive tasks with the spontaneous reduction of stereotypies and with increase in attention. They recalled more significant indexes when music or a song was presented together with a cartoon or a cognitive task. Conclusions: This study provides initial insights in promoting cognitive and social interactions and in the support needs of families with a child with RTT during the COVID-19 pandemic.;2021;4
Background: The costs and benefits of full lockdown measures are debated. Neurologically impaired children are a vulnerable population with specific needs in terms of protection against infection and access to health services. Objectives: We investigated the effects of lockdown on the health of children with neurological disorders and on their access to care during lockdown. Methods: Data from 514 children (282 males e 232 females) were collected through physician administered interviews to investigate: the occurrence of viral-like physical symptoms, the correlation between the risk of developing such symptoms and several demographic and clinical variables, the occurrence of any worsening of the children's neurological conditions during lockdown, and their access to care services during this period. Results: 49.1% experienced at least one symptom during the study period, but no child developed severe complications. The prevalence of symptoms was significantly lower during lockdown than during the previous two months. The underlying neurological condition worsened in 11.5% of the patients. Children who regularly left the home during lockdown were greater risk of exhibiting symptoms. During lock down, 67.7% had a specialist appointment cancelled, 52.6% contacted their paediatrician, and 30.9% contacted their child neuropsychiatrist. Among patients who usually receive rehabilitation, 49.5% continued remotely. Conclusion: Lockdown protected children from infections. Telemedicine and telerehabilitation constituted a valid alternative for the care and treatment of these children, but they should not become a widespread and definitive model of care. COVID-19 and other emergency response plans must take into account the specific needs of children with disabilities. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2021;4
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic forced reorganization of the multidisciplinary healthcare system for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Digital solutions seem to be optimal for providing rehabilitation at this time. The aim of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to conduct respiratory physical therapy with the use of telerehabilitation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Methods: The study was conducted during an online conference for families with DMD. During the physical therapy panel we showed the video with the instructions of respiratory exercises. All participants (n = 152) were asked to fill in the online survey evaluating the quality, acceptance, and understanding of the instructions. Results: The survey was filled in by 45 (29.6%) participants. The mean rating of satisfaction was 4.70/5, and for intelligibility was 4.78/5. Thirty-seven (82.2%) patients declared that they had performed the exercises, all caregivers declared that it was possible to perform the proposed exercises a few times a week or daily, and only two respondents replied to invitations to individual online sessions. Conclusions: Findings from the study show that respiratory telerehabilitation may be implemented for DMD patients; however, the interest in digital rehabilitation among caregivers of DMD boys in Poland is low. The reasons for this situation require further research.";2021;4
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes to in-office orthopedic care, with a rapid shift to telemedicine. Institutions' lack of established infrastructure for these types of visits has posed challenges requiring attention to confidentiality, safety, and patient satisfaction. Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of telemedicine in orthopedics during the pandemic and its effect on efficiency and patient satisfaction. Methods: Patients seen by the Emory University Department of Orthopaedics Sports Medicine and Upper Extremity Divisions via telemedicine from March 23 to April 24, 2020, were contacted by telephone. Each patient was asked to respond to questions on satisfaction, ease of use, and potential future use; satisfaction with telemedicine and previous clinical visits were measured using a modified 5-point Likert scale. Results: Of the 762 patients seen, 346 (45.4%) completed the telemedicine questionnaire. Satisfaction varied by visit type, with average scores of 4.88/5 for in-office clinic visits versus 4.61/5 for telemedicine visits. There was no significant difference among age groups for satisfaction ratings. Patients 65 years old or older reported significantly longer visit times and decreased ease of use with the telemedicine platform. Conclusion: Telemedicine in a large orthopedics department was successfully implemented without compromising patient satisfaction. The use of telemedicine allows many patients to be seen quickly and efficiently without diminishing their musculoskeletal clinical experience.";2021;4
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the delivery of face-to-face pain services including pain management programmes in the United Kingdom with considerable negative impact on patients with chronic musculosketetal pain. We aimed to develop and implement a remotely delivered pain management programme (PMP) using video-conferencing technology that contains all the core components of a full programme: the 'virtual PMP' (vPMP). By reporting on the process of this development, we endeavour to help address the paucity of literature on the development of remote pain management programmes. Methods: The vPMP was developed by an inter-disciplinary group of professionals as a quality improvement (QI) project. The Model for Improvement Framework was employed with patient involvement at the design phase and at subsequent improvements. Improvement was measured qualitatively with frequent and repeated qualitative data collection leading to programme change. Quantitative patient demographic comparisons were made with a patient cohort who had been on a face-to-face PMP pathway. Results: Sixty-one patients on the PMP waiting list were contacted and 43 met the criteria for the programme. Fourteen patients participated in three vPMP cycles. Patient involvement and comprehensive stakeholder consultation were essential to a robust design for the first vPMP. Continued involvement of patient partners during the QI process led to rapid resolution of implementation problems. The most prominent issues that needed action were technical challenges including training needs, participant access to physical and technological resources, participant fatigue and concerns about adequate communication and peer support. Conclusion: This report demonstrates how a remotely delivered PMP, fully in line with national guidance, was rapidly developed and implemented in a hospital setting for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. We also discuss the relevance of our findings to the issues of cost, patient experience, patient preferences and inequities of access in delivering telerehabilitation for chronic pain.;2021;4
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid shift from center-based rehabilitation to telerehabilitation for chronic respiratory disease and lung transplantation due to infection control precautions. Clinical experience with this delivery model on a large scale has not been described. Objective: The aim of this study is to describe usage and satisfaction of providers and lung transplant (LTx) candidates and recipients and functional outcomes following the broad implementation of telerehabilitation with remote patient monitoring during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study was a program evaluation of providers, LTx candidates, and early LTx recipients who used a web-based, remote monitoring app for at least four weeks between March 16 and September 1, 2020, to participate in telerehabilitation. Within-subjects analysis was performed for physical activity, Self-efficacy For Exercise (SEE) scale score, aerobic and resistance exercise volumes, 6-minute walk test results, and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) results. Results: In total, 78 LTx candidates and 33 recipients were included (57 [51%] males, mean age 58 [SD 12] years, 58 [52%] with interstitial lung disease, 34 [31%] with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). A total of 50 (64%) LTx candidates and 17 (51%) LTx recipients entered >= 10 prescribed exercise sessions into the app during the study time frame. In addition, 35/42 (83%) candidates agreed the app helped prepare them for surgery and 18/21 (85%) recipients found the app helpful in their self-recovery. The strongest barrier perceived by physiotherapists delivering the telerehabilitation was patient access to home exercise and monitoring equipment. Between the time of app registration and >= 4 weeks on the waiting list, 26 LTx candidates used a treadmill, with sessions increasing in mean duration (from 16 to 22 minutes, P=.002) but not speed (from 1.7 to 1.75 mph, P=.31). Quadriceps weight (pounds) for leg extension did not change (median 3.5, IQR 2.4-5 versus median 4.3, IQR 3-5; P=.08; n=37). On the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity questionnaire (RAPA), 57% of LTx candidates scored as active, which improved to 87% (P=.02; n=23). There was a decrease in pretransplant 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from 346 (SD 84) meters to 307 (SD 85) meters (P=.002; n=45) and no change in the SPPB result (12 [IQR 9.5-12] versus 12 [IQR 10-12]; P=.90; n=42). A total of 9 LTx recipients used a treadmill that increased in speed (from 1.9 to 2.7 mph; P=.003) between hospital discharge and three months posttransplant. Quadriceps weight increased (3 [IQR 0-3] pounds versus 5 [IQR 3.8-6.5] pounds; P<.001; n=15). At three months posttransplant, 76% of LTx recipients scored as active (n=17), with a high total SEE score of 74 (SD 11; n=12). In addition, three months posttransplant, 6MWD was 62% (SD 18%) predicted (n=8). Conclusions: We were able to provide telerehabilitation despite challenges around exercise equipment. This early experience will inform the development of a robust and equitable telerehabilitation model beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.";2021;4
"Background: The current study evaluated patient expectations for synchronous telerehabilitation. Because the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic decreased regulatory barriers and increased accessibility of telehealth, improved understanding of expectations may direct future educational efforts, improve implementation strategies, and inform future analyses of consumer adoption and utilization of telehealth. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used to measure ideal expectations (what they want to happen) and realistic expectations (what they think will happen) of telerehabilitation-naive patients for synchronous telerehabilitation. Participants were recruited through e-mail and social media and in person from seven outpatient private practice physical therapy clinics across the United States. Patients completed an online anonymous adaptation of the Patients' Expectations Questionnaire (PEQ) and were asked whether they expected synchronous telerehabilitation to benefit them personally. Open-ended responses were collected and analyzed for categories and themes. Results: Of 178 participants, the greatest mean difference between ideal and realistic expectations among PEQ subscales was for outcomes (0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.60), and the greatest mean difference among individual items was for symptom reduction (0.53; 95% CI, 0.41-0.66). Although participants appeared to appreciate the value of telerehabilitation visits, with 69.7% indicating that it would benefit them personally, many expressed a preference for face-to-face visits when possible. Discussion: Expectations were mostly positive. Lower outcomes expectations may be a potential barrier to adoption and utilization of telehealth and other types of digital physical therapy in some patients. Conclusions: To improve beliefs and address potential barriers, physical therapy clinicians should discuss expectations with patients before recommending telerehabilitation visits.";2021;4
Background: The effectiveness of telehealth programs in the administration of rehabilitation and the monitoring of postoperative progress after joint replacement is not well studied. The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the currently available evidence on the use of smart-device technology and telehealth programs to guide and monitor postoperative rehabilitation following total joint arthroplasty and to assess their impact on outcomes following surgery. Methods: A literature search of the MEDLINE database was performed using keywords mobile, app, telehealth, virtual, arthroplasty, outcomes, joint replacement, web based, telemedicine, TKA, THA, activity tracker, fitness tracker, monitor, rehab, online, and stepcounter in all possible combinations. All English studies with a level of evidence of I to III that were published from January 1, 2010, to December 19, 2020 were considered for inclusion. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed on the data collected. Results: A total of 28 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were identified and reviewed. With regard to objective functional outcome measures, such as strength, range of motion, or results of the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the virtual physical therapy group had equivalent or slightly superior outcomes compared with in-person physical therapy. There was similar improvement overall in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient satisfaction between virtual and in-person physical therapy. Virtual physical therapy resulted in cost savings ranging from $206 to $4,100 per patient compared with in-person physical therapy. Conclusions: Telerehabilitation following lower-extremity joint replacement is less expensive compared with in-person physical therapy, with equivalent outcomes and patient satisfaction. Telerehabilitation and electronic health adjuncts can be used to substitute for traditional rehabilitation and augment postoperative care following total joint arthroplasty, respectively. Telerehabilitation that provides outcomes equivalent to in-person physical therapy not only increases convenience for patients but also decreases the cost burden on the health-care system.;2021;4
Background: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional exercise capacity seemed quickly clinically evident. The objective of this study was to assess the functional exercise capacity of patients with severe COVID-19 and to evaluate the effect of a telerehabilitation program in the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Patients hospitalized for severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited. The functional exercise capacity (1-min sit-to-stand test (STST)) was prospectively quantified at discharge. A telerehabilitation program was then proposed. A control group was composed with the patients refusing the program. Results: At discharge, none of the 48 recruited patients had a STST higher than the 50th percentile and 77% of them were below the 2.5th percentile. SpO2 was 92.6 +/- 3.0% after STST and 15 patients had oxygen desaturation. After 3-months of follow-up, the number of repetitions during STST significantly increased either in telerehabilitation (n = 14) (p < 0.001) or in control groups (n = 13) (p = 0.002) but only one patient had a result higher than the 50th percentile (in Telerehabilitation group) and 37% of them were still under the 2.5th percentile for this result. The improvement was significantly and clinically greater after the telerehabilitation program (p = 0.005). No adverse events were reported by the patients during the program. Conclusions: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have a low functional exercise capacity at discharge and the recovery after three months is poor. The feasibility and the effect of a simple telerehabilitation program were verified, this program being able to substantially improve the functional recovery after three months.;2021;4
Background: The new human coronavirus that leads to COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has spread rapidly around the world and has a high degree of lethality. In more severe cases, patients remain hospitalized for several days under treatment of the health team. Thus, it is important to develop and use technologies with the aim to strengthen conventional therapy by encouraging movement, physical activity, and improving cardiorespiratory fitness for patients. In this sense, therapies for exposure to virtual reality (VR) are promising and have been shown to be an adequate and equivalent alternative to conventional exercise programs. Aim: This is a study protocol with the aim of comparing the conventional physical therapy intervention with the use of a non-immersive VR software during COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods: Fifty patients hospitalized with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be divided in two groups under physiotherapy treatment using conventional or VR intervention: Group A: participants with COVID-19 will start the first day of the protocol with VR tasks in the morning and then in the second period, in the afternoon, will perform the conventional exercises (n = 25) and Group B: participants with COVID-19 will start the first day with conventional exercises in the morning and in the second period, in the afternoon, will perform activity with VR (n = 25). All participants will be evaluated with different motor and physiologic scales before and after the treatment to measure improvements. Conclusion: Considering the importance of benefits from physical activity during hospitalization, VR software shows promise as a potential mechanism for improving physical activity. The results of this study may provide new insights into hospital rehabilitation.;2021;4
"Background: The occurrence of postoperative complications may lead to delayed recovery and a decline in physical function in the first 3 months after esophagectomy. The outbreak of COVID-19 imposed physical and emotional obstacles for traditional face-to-face rehabilitation. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of telerehabilitation remained unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation. Methods: A cohort of 86 patients who received minimally invasive esophagectomy between September 2020 and January 2021 was randomly allocated into two groups. The telerehabilitation group received additional online consulting and training, including (I) precautions for nutritional support; (II) swallowing function training; (III) respiratory function training; (IV) guidance and feedback on matters such as patient's current vital signs, wound status, medication, and sleep status. The primary outcome was the change of quality of life (QOL) of each patient at 3 months after surgery. Results: No serious adverse events were observed in either group. The telerehabilitation group showed significant improvements in pain using the OLQ-C30 scale (P<0.001), and in choking using the QLQ-OES18 scale (P<0.001). The comparison of the QLQ-C30 and QES-18 score changes at three months after discharge revealed that nearly all aspects in the telerehabilitation group displayed more score changes with significant changes in the appetite loss and pain part (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). The score changes in QLQ-OES18 revealed significant improvement in swallowing saliva (P<0.05), as well slight improvements in choking, dry mouth, taste, and cough without significance. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that telerehabilitation was at least an important supplement to traditional face-to-face consulting and training for patients after esophageal cancer surgery during the COVID-19 period.";2021;4
Background: The world is currently undergoing a pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19). According to the World Health Organization, patients with chronic illnesses appear to be at the highest risk for COVID-19 associated sequelae. Inability to participate in outpatient-based rehabilitation programs and being home-bound can increase the risk for and potential worsening of chronic health conditions. This study evaluated the short-term effects of telerehabilitation on patients' walk test performance and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: 47 patients (23 cardiovascular, 15 pulmonary, 9 oncology) participated in the telerehabilitation program. At baseline and following a 1-month intervention, patients had their 6-minute walk test distance (6MWTD) and HRQoL assessed. Average daily step counts were measured by the PACER App. Conclusion: Our results indicate that a short-term, supervised virtual telerehabilitation program had significant positive effects on 6MWTD and HRQoL in cardiac, pulmonary and oncology patients during COVID-19.;2021;4
Background: There is uncertainty regarding efficacy of telehealth-based approaches in COPD patients for sustaining benefits achieved with intensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Research question: To determine whether a maintenance pulmonary telerehabilitation (TelePR) programme, after intensive initial PR, is superior to usual care in sustaining over time benefits achieved by intensive PR. Study design and methods: A multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted. Two groups were created at completion of an 8-week intensive outpatient hospital PR programme. Intervention group (IG) patients were given appropriate training equipment and instructed to perform three weekly training sessions and send performance data through an app to a web-based platform. Patients in the control group (CG) were advised to exercise regularly (usual care). Results: Ninety-four patients (46 IG, 48 CG) were randomized. The analysis of covariance showed non-significant improvements in 6-min walk distance [19.9 m (95% CI -4.1/+43.8)] and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire - Emotion score [0.4 points (0-0.8)] in the IG. Secondary linear mixed models showed improvements in the IG in Short Form-36 mental component summary [9.7, (4.0-15.4)] and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire - Emotion [0.5, (0.2-0.9)] scores, but there was no association between compliance and outcomes. Acute exacerbations were associated with a marginally significant decrease in 6-minute walk distance of 15.8 m (-32.3/0.8) in linear models. Conclusions: The TelePR maintenance strategy was both feasible and safe but failed to show superiority over usual care, despite improvements in some HRQoL domains. Acute exacerbations may have an important negative influence on long-term physical function. (C) 2020 SEPAR. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.;2021;4
Background: This article systematically summarizes the present evidences, published in the last 20 years, regarding the pre- and post-operative factors, which may influence recovery of the function of the quadriceps muscle group following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We following the PRISMA methodology, including meta-analyses and high-level evidence studies (prospective trials, and, when unavailable, retrospective studies). Sources of data: Pubmed and Cochrane databases: 582 articles were identified and 54 of them were selected. Areas of agreement: Tourniquets inflated at high pressure exert a detrimental effect on the quadriceps muscle group. Faster quadriceps recovery takes place using mini-invasive approaches, an eight-week rehabilitation period including balance training and the use of nutraceuticals. Areas of disagreement: Pre-habilitation and pre-operative factors, analgesic methods and different TKA implants. Growing points and areas timely for developing research: Telerehabilitation seems a cost-effective tool for rehabilitation after TKA. Patients' optimization protocols before TKA should include standardized nutraceuticals intake.;2021;4
Background: Total joint arthroplasty is one of the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedures globally. Telerehabilitation has recently been used as a supplement or an alternative to face-to-face rehabilitation services among patients after total joint arthroplasty. Objectives: To synthesise the evidence on the effectiveness of internet-based telerehabilitation regarding pain relief, range of motion, physical function, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, psychological well-being/problems, and satisfaction among patients after total joint arthroplasty. Methods: An integrative review was conducted using defined search periods, databases, and search terms. This review adopted a five-stage approach: problem identification, literature search, data evaluation, data analysis and presentation. Studies published in English and Chinese were included. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the quality of included studies. Results: Twenty-two eligible studies with 1,179 participants were included in this review. Nineteen of them were conducted in North America, Europe and Australia, and three in China. There were 20 quantitative and two qualitative studies. Synchronous mode using videoconferencing (n = 11) was predominant in the studies between 2003 and 2017, while asynchronous mode using mobile apps (n = 7) has become the main mode since 2017. Internet-based telerehabilitation was delivered by physiotherapists in 17 studies and by nurses in three. Most of the included studies reported that, compared to face-to-face rehabilitation, internet-based telerehabilitation showed a comparable improvement in pain relief, range of motion, physical function, and health-related quality of life. Patients had a high satisfaction level. Very few studies addressed the patients' psychological well-being/problems and self-efficacy as the outcome measures. Conclusions: Internet-based telerehabilitation appears to be effective for and accepted by patients after total joint arthroplasty. Telerehabilitation could be delivered by nurses in collaboration with physiotherapists and surgeons as a team. The mobile app is an accessible and flexible delivery medium for telerehabilitation. Robust randomised controlled trials are warranted to enhance the quality of evidence on the effectiveness of mobile app-based telerehabilitation and nurse-delivered program. Qualitative components are suggested to be included in future research. Psychological outcomes should also be measured. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2021;4
Background: Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is an intervention that can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis. Early start of rehabilitation and its continuation at home once the patient is discharged are key factors for the success of the process. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a home-based telerehabilitation solution (ReHub) on improving functional capacity and clinical outcomes for patients who underwent TKA. Methods/design: The study is a randomized, open-label with blinded outcome assessor, parallel assignment clinical trial with a sample size of 52 patients that is conducted according to the SPIRIT recommendations. After the TKA intervention, the patients are randomly allocated to the control group or the experimental group with a 1:1 ratio. Both groups follow a Fast Track recovery protocol which includes discharge after 2-3 days from surgery, a daily plan of 5 exercises for autonomous rehabilitation and domiciliary visits by a physiotherapist starting approximately 2 weeks after surgery. The experimental group uses the sensor-based telerehabilitation system ReHub to perform the exercises. The primary outcome measure is the range of motion of the knee. Secondary outcomes include physical performance, quality of life, pain intensity, muscle strength, treatment adherence and satisfaction with the ReHub system. The outcomes assessment is performed at hospital discharge (baseline), at stitch removal (2 weeks after baseline) and 2 weeks after stitch removal (4 weeks after baseline). The study conforms to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the hospital's ethics committee. Discussion: The study will address an important gap in the evidence base by reporting the effectiveness of an affordable and low-cost home-based telerehabilitation solution in patients who underwent TKA. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the hospital's ethics committee (Comite Etico de Investigacion Clinica del HCB, reg. HCB/2019/0571). The trial was registred at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04155957). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals as well as national and international conferences. Highlights: Assessing a home-based telerehabilitation solution effectiveness in knee surgery. In situations such as the CoVid-19 pandemic, it is a resolutive intervention method. Telerehabilitation is an alternative to conventional face-to-face physical therapy. This system is far less demanding in terms of human resources. Range of motion assessment is the primary outcome measure.;2021;4
Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common comorbidities among patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). There are limited data regarding efficacy of hybrid comprehensive telerehabilitation (HCTR) on cardiopulmonary exercise capacity in patients with HFrEF with versus those without diabetes. Aim: The aim of the present study was to analyze effects of 9-week HCTR in comparison to usual care on parameters of cardiopulmonary exercise capacity in HF patients according to history of DM. Methods: Clinically stable HF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40% after a hospitalization due to worsening HF within past 6 months were enrolled in the TELEREH-HF (The TELEREHabilitation in Heart Failure Patients) trial and randomized to the HCTR or usual care (UC). Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) were performed on treadmill with an incremental workload according to the ramp protocol. Results: CPET was performed in 385 patients assigned to HCTR group: 129 (33.5%) had DM (HCTR-DM group) and 256 patients (66.5%) did not have DM (HCTR-nonDM group). Among 397 patients assigned to UC group who had CPET: 137 (34.5%) had DM (UC-DM group) and 260 patients (65.5%) did not have DM (UC-nonDM group). Among DM patients, differences in cardiopulmonary parameters from baseline to 9 weeks remained similar among HCTR and UC patients. In contrast, among patients without DM, HCTR was associated with greater 9-week changes than UC in exercise time, which resulted in a statistically significant interaction between patients with and without DM: difference in changes in exercise time between HCTR versus UC was 12.0 s [95% CI - 15.1, 39.1 s] in DM and 43.1 s [95% CI 24.0, 63.0 s] in non-DM, interaction p-value = 0.016. Furthermore, statistically significant differences in the effect of HCTR versus UC between DM and non-DM were observed in ventilation at rest: - 0.34 l/min [95% CI - 1.60, 0.91 l/min] in DM and 0.83 l/min [95% CI - 0.06, 1.73 l/min] in non-DM, interaction p value = 0.0496 and in VE/VCO2 slope: 1.52 [95% CI - 1.55, 4.59] for DM vs. - 1.44 [95% CI - 3.64, 0.77] for non-DM, interaction p value = 0.044. Conclusions: The benefits of hybrid comprehensive telerehabilitation versus usual care on the improvement of physical performance, ventilatory profile and gas exchange parameters were more pronounced in patients with HFrEF without DM as compared to patients with DM.;2021;4
BACKGROUND: Upper extremity activity-based therapy for neurologic disorders employs high-intensity, high repetition functional training to exploit neuroplasticity and improve function. Research focused on high-intensity upper extremity activity-based therapy for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is limited. OBJECTIVE: To summarize high-intensity activity-based interventions used in neurological disorders for their current or potential application to SCI. METHODS: The scoping review included articles from MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and OTSeeker with the criteria: non-invasive activity-based interventions delivered at least three times/week for two weeks, upper extremity functional outcomes, age 13 years or older, English language, and neurological disorders three months post onset/injury. RESULTS: The search yielded 172 studies. There were seven studies with SCI, all in adults. Activity-based interventions in SCI included task-specific training and gaming, with and without electrical stimulation, and a robotic exoskeleton. The other populations found in the review included studies in stroke, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. Thirty-four different interventions were reported in other populations. In comparison to the extensive stroke research, work in SCI was not found for high-intensity interventions using virtual reality, brain stimulation, rehabilitation devices, and applications to the home and telerehab settings. CONCLUSION: The results highlight critical gaps within upper extremity high-intensity activity-based research in SCI.;2021;4
Background: We analyzed the immediate effects of a Telerehabilitation Program (TP) based on aerobic exercise in women with fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome during the lockdown declared in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was designed. Thirty-four women with FM were randomized into two groups: TP group and Control group. The intervention lasted 15 weeks, with 2 sessions per week. The TP based on aerobic exercise was guided by video and the intensity of each session was monitored using the Borg scale. Pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), mechanical pain sensitivity (algometer), number of tender points, FM impact (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), physiological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), upper (Arm Curl Test) and lower-limb physical function (6-min Walk Test) were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Results: The TP group improved pain intensity (p = 0.022), mechanical pain sensitivity (p < 0.05), and psychological distress (p = 0.005), compared to the Control group. The Control group showed no statistically significant changes in any variable (p > 0.05). Conclusions: A TP based on aerobic exercise achieved improvements on pain intensity, mechanical pain sensitivity, and psychological distress compared to a Control group during the lockdown declared in Spain due to COVID-19 pandemic.;2021;4
Background: Women after breast cancer (BC) cope with decreased daily participation and quality of life (QOL) due to physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms. This study examined a hybrid occupation-based intervention, Managing Participation with Breast Cancer (MaP-BC), to improve daily participation in their meaningful activities. Methods: Thirty-five women after BC phase were randomly allocated to the MaP-BC intervention (n = 18) or control (n = 17) group (standard care only). Assessments were administered at baseline (T1), 6-week (T2), and 12-week (T3) post-T1. Main outcome: perceived performance and performance-satisfaction with meaningful activities according to the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Secondary outcomes: retained activity levels (Activity Card Sort), QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), cognitive abilities (Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function), and upper-extremity functioning (Disability of Arm, Shoulder, Hand). Results showed significant interaction (group x time) effects for the primary outcome in performance, F(2,66) = 29.54, p = 0.001, eta(2)(P) = 0.472, and satisfaction, F(2,66) = 37.15, p = 0.000, eta(2)(P) = 0.530. The intervention group improved more in performance, t = 5.51, p = 0.0001, d = 1.298, and satisfaction, t = 5.32, p = 0.0001, d = 1.254, than the control group between T1 and T2. Secondary outcomes demonstrated withingroup improvements. Conclusion: MaP-BC, a comprehensive occupation-based hybrid intervention tailored to women's functional daily needs after BC, improved participation in meaningful activities within a short period.;2021;4
Background:The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many cardiac rehabilitation centres to focus more on the remote delivery of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) components. This increased focus and the lessons learned from this period could enhance the implementation of telerehabilitation and increase the participation in CR in Belgium. Methods:We conducted a survey between April and May 2020 about the implementation of telerehabilitation services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The electronic questionnaire was sentviaemail to the heads of 42 Belgian CR centres. Three remindersviaemail were sent during the study period. Results:27 CR centres (64%) returned completed questionnaires after three mailings. 52% of the CR centres provided remote CR services during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All CR centres that provided remote CR services delivered exercise training. The most used medium to deliver the CR components were online videos (71%) followed by online information on the website (64%) and emails (64%). Conclusion:It is interesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged many CR centres to implement remote delivery of CR components. This can help to speed up the research and implementation of telerehabilitation in daily clinical practice. The COVID-19 pandemic could be the push for a large multicentre implementation study that could prove that telerehabilitation is feasible and effective in the Belgian setting.;2021;4
BackgroundAs the primary treatment for adhesive capsulitis, intensive and accurate home exercise is as important as physical therapy in hospitals. Augmented reality (AR)-based telerehabilitation has been implemented recently in various musculoskeletal conditions to increase patient compliance and enable patients to exercise with the correct posture. The objective of this study is to present a protocol for investigating the additive effect of interactive AR-based telerehabilitation in comparison with the usual care for patients with adhesive capsulitis.MethodsThis study presents the protocol of a prospective, multi-center, single-blinded, two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT). One hundred patients with stage I or II adhesive capsulitis will be recruited at the physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups with 1:1 allocation. The intervention group will receive 3months of hospital-based physical therapy in conjunction with home-based telerehabilitation. The control group will receive 3months of hospital-based physical therapy in conjunction with a home-based exercise described in a brochure provided by the hospital. The primary outcome will be the change in passive range of motion (ROM) of the affected shoulder joint from baseline to 12weeks after baseline assessment. The secondary outcomes will be active ROM, pain measured with the numeric rating scale, shoulder pain and disability index, 36-Item Short Form Survey, EuroQoL-5D-5L, and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure.DiscussionThis will be the first RCT study protocol to investigate the effect of telerehabilitation in patients with adhesive capsulitis. The result of this RCT will determine whether AR-based telerehabilitation is more effective than a brochure-based home exercise program and will provide evidence of the usefulness of telerehabilitation using hardware (IoT) and software (monitoring platform) technologies to develop digital therapeutics for the future.Trial registrationThis trial was retrospectively registered at the Clinicaltrials.gov website on 20 March 2020, with the identifier NCT04316130.;2021;4
BackgroundDelays in starting physical therapy after hospital discharge worsen deconditioning in older adults. Intervening quickly can minimize the negative effects of deconditioning. Telerehabilitation is a strategy that increases access to rehabilitation, improves clinical outcomes, and reduces costs. This paper presents the protocol for a pragmatic clinical trial that aims to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component intervention offered by telerehabilitation for discharged older adults awaiting physical therapy for any specific medical condition.MethodsThis is a pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial with two groups: telerehabilitation and control. Participants (n=230) will be recruited among individuals discharged from hospitals who are in the public healthcare system physical therapy waiting lists. The telerehabilitation group will receive a smartphone app with a personalized program (based on individual's functional ability) of resistance, balance, and daily activity training exercises. The intervention will be implemented at the individuals' homes. This group will be monitored weekly by phone and monthly through a face-to-face meeting until they start physical therapy. The control group will adhere to the public healthcare system's usual flow and will be monitored weekly by telephone until they start physical therapy. The primary outcome will be a physical function (Timed Up and Go and 30-s Chair Stand Test). The measurements will take place in baseline, start, and discharge of outpatient physical therapy. The economic evaluations will be performed from the perspective of society and the Brazilian public healthcare system.DiscussionThe study will produce evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multi-component telerehabilitation intervention for discharged older adult patients awaiting physical therapy, providing input that can aid the implementation of similar proposals in other patient groups.Trial registrationBrazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC), RBR-9243v7.

"BackgroundStroke is increasing in Africa and consequences such as limitations in the performance of activities in everyday life persist a long time. A family member might need to care for and assist the person who has had a stroke. The life situation of these caregivers thereby changes, which could lead to increased workload and new responsibilities in caring for which they lack but request knowledge. During the F@ce rehabilitation program, the caregivers received counseling, which is uncommon in the African context. The aim of the study was twofold; (1) to investigate the perceived caregiver burden and life satisfaction and, (2) to explore and describe the life situation for caregivers to persons that have had a stroke and received the mobile phone supported rehabilitation F@ce in urban areas in Uganda.MethodA mixed method design was used. Twelve caregivers took part in a semi-structured interview regarding their everyday life situation and responded to questionnaires on caregiver burden and life satisfaction. Latent qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the interviews.ResultsFive categories were identified in the caregivers' experiences of their life situation: Feels obligated but is just a natural commitment; a tightly scheduled everyday life; being the supporting relative; the caregivers approach as rehabilitators; and being supported by the rehabilitation intervention. The caregivers rated relatively high on the Caregiver Burden Scale and two thirds of the sample rated their satisfaction with life as a whole as dissatisfying. Further ratings on the Life Satisfaction checklist revealed that the financial, vocational, leisure and family situations were dissatisfying.Conclusions F Even if it was viewed as a natural commitment to be a caregiver when a family member had had a stroke, the life situation changed substantially for those who took on the caregiving role. Caregiving responsibilities were challenging as well as a heavy workload and a strained financial situation as many were giving up on jobs. The participants felt burdened and rated a low life satisfaction. The F@ce intervention was, however, expressed as valued and involved support and advice in their caregiving situation as well as information on stroke which relieved stress among them.";2021;4
"BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a threat to ongoing clinical trials necessitating regular face-to-face, in-person meetings, particularly in participants with a high risk of complications. Guidance on how to handle and safely continue such trials is lacking. Chronically ill elderly individuals require-in addition to protection from infection-regular physical exercise and social contact to remain healthy. Solutions on how to handle these conflicting necessities are needed.The ENTAIER-randomised controlled trial was investigating the influence of mindful movements on fall risk, fear of falling, mobility, balance, life quality, and other outcomes. The study population was planned to comprise of 550 chronically ill elderly individuals with a high risk of falling. The movements were regularly performed in coached groups over 6months. After the trial began, COVID-19 lockdowns stopped all in-person meetings, and it was expected that the limitations of this pandemic would continue for a long term. Therefore, the exercise programme, which involved complex movements and was typically conducted face-to-face in groups, had to be substituted by a telemedicine programme within a short timeframe. The objectives, therefore, were to identify challenges and tasks that could to be resolved and steps that could to be taken to achieve high-quality, efficacy, safety, and enable human encounter and motivation.MethodsWe proceeded with four steps: 1) A literature review on the quality and feasibility issues of telemedicine in general, and specifically, in exercise training in elderly individuals. 2) Participation in two international telemedicine task forces on integrative medicine, particularly, mind-body medicine. 3) Interviews with study therapists, (for practical purposes, eurythmy therapists and Tai Chi teachers are summarized here as therapists) personnel, and international experts on providing mindful movement exercises and other physiotherapies via live telecommunication technology, and with scientists and patient representatives. 4) Final evaluation by the core trial team and subsequent planning and implementation of changes in the trial organisation.ResultsVarious tasks and challenges were identified: for the technical equipment for therapists and patients; for the ability of therapists and trial participants to adequately manage the technology and telemedicine intervention; the reservations and concerns about the technology among therapists and participants; safety and data protection in using the technology; and study design. The two major options found on how to continue the trial in the COVID-19 situation were a complete switch to telemedicine and a partial switch in the form of risk management implemented into the former design.ConclusionsThe management of an ongoing clinical trial in a national or international crisis with a minimum of available time and extra financial resources, alongside with two checklists on steps and procedures for trial continuation and telemedicine implementation, may be informative for other researchers or healthcare providers faced with similar challenges and making similar decisions in the current situation or similar future scenarios.Trail registrationwww.drks.de.

BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has forced many cancer services to consider a transition to a remote format of delivery that is largely untested. Accordingly, we sought to perform a systematic review of the effects of remotely delivered interventions to improve exercise behaviour in sedentary adults living with and beyond cancer.MethodsEligible studies were randomised controlled trials comparing a remotely delivered exercise intervention to a usual care comparison in sedentary people over 18years old with a primary cancer diagnosis. Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to November 2020.ResultsThe review included three trials, totalling 186 participants. Two of the included trials incorporated prescriptions that meet current aerobic exercise recommendations, one of which also meets the guidelines for resistance exercise. No trials reported an intervention adherence of 75% or more for a set prescription that meets current exercise guidelines.ConclusionThere is little evidence suggesting that remote exercise interventions promote exercise behaviours or improve physical function in sedentary adults living with and beyond cancer. The development and evaluation of novel remote exercise interventions is needed to establish their usefulness for clinical practice. Given the social response to the COVID-19 pandemic, further research in this area is urgently needed.;2021;4
Being diagnosed as positive for SARS-2 CoV RNA on PCR generates anxiety and stress as well as depression due to the prospects of being isolated. With genetically varied forms of virus on the rise the widely adopted manner to protect oneself is social distancing. This is frightening for rehabilitation professionals who at times are exposed at close quarters to the patients as rehabilitation is essential. Data in this backdrop is lacking, as this is a recent and ongoing pandemic. As such the current study was conducted with an attempt to review and highlight the causes of fright among rehabilitation professionals and possible management options in the wake of current pandemic of COVID-19 in the perspective of Pakistan. For this purpose literature was searched from major electronic databases including PubMed, Google, Google Scholar and Web-of-science, with keywords Covid-19, mental health, telehealth, telemedicine, tele-rehabilitation and combination of words. Eighty English, full text articles were studied out of which 36 were used for the literature review. With this literature review we conclude that COVID-19 has resulted in fear of contracting and transmitting this disease among health professionals and can be reduced and managed by provision of tele-rehabilitation and telehealth facilities. Patients emerging from prolonged mechanical ventilations require extensive rehabilitation to restore routine body functions. The role of the otolaryngologist and speech language pathologist (SLP) is formal and direct to ensure appropriate and timely long term intervention and rehabilitation to ensure that these individuals re-enter mainstream activities.;2021;4
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has evolved as an important part of the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease. However, to date, its full potential is fairly underutilised. This review discusses new developments in CR aimed at improving participation rates and long-term effectiveness in the general cardiac population. It consecutively highlights new or challenging target groups, new delivery modes and new care pathways for CR programmes. These new or challenging target groups include patients with atrial fibrillation, obesity and cardiovascular disease, chronic coronary syndromes, (advanced) chronic heart failure with or without intracardiac devices, women and frail elderly patients. Also, the current evidence regarding cardiac telerehabilitation and loyalty programmes is discussed as new delivery modes for CR. Finally, this paper discusses novel care pathways with the integration of CR in residual risk management and transmural care pathways. These new developments can help to make optimal use of the benefits of CR. Therefore we should seize the opportunities to reshape current CR programmes, broaden their applicability and incorporate them into or combine them with other cardiovascular care programmes/pathways.;2021;4
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a comprehensive program that includes exercise training, titration of medical therapy, lifestyle modification, educational support, and psychosocial assessment. All these components are safe and beneficial resulting in significant improvements in quality of life, functional capacity, mortality, and hospital readmission. Current guidelines support its use in a broad spectrum of cardiac disease. This review focuses on exercise-based CR for heart failure (HF) patients in whom CR is a recommended treatment. Exercise should be prescribed according to a personalized approach, optimizing, and tailoring the rehabilitative program to the patient's characteristics. Specific CR programs are dedicated to older patients, those with HF and preserved ejection fraction, and recipients of cardiac implantable electronic devices or left ventricular assistance device. Telemedicine may increase CR participation and overcome some of the barriers that limit its utilization.;2021;4

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of mortality worldwide. They are frequently the reasons for patient hospitalization, their incapability for work, and disability. These diseases represent a significant socio-economic burden affecting the medical system as well as patients and their families. It has been demonstrated that the etiopathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases is significantly affected by lifestyle, and so modification of the latter is an essential component of both primary and secondary prevention. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) represents an efficient secondary prevention model that is especially based on the positive effect of regular physical activity. This review presents an overview of basic information on CR with a focus on current trends, such as the issue of the various training modalities, utilization, and barriers to it or the use of telemedicine technologies. Appropriate attention should be devoted to these domains, as CR continues evolving as an effective and readily available intervention in the future.;2021;4
"Cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) is a useful comprehensive approach in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart failure through programs based on specialized hospital centers. Comprehensive CR reduces morbidity and mortality and increases the quality of life of cardiac patients. Despite the benefits it brings, patient participation in rehabilitation programs is low. In addition to the low utilization rate and completion of the CR program, the goals of secondary prevention in a large proportion of heart patients are not achieved. This condition seems to be an opportunity for improvement. Cardiovascular telerehabilitation can have an impact on barriers that prevent the use of CR programs. In telerehabilitation, one or more components of CR are distributed outside a specialized hospital center through telemonitoring, e-learning, or telecoaching. Current clinical studies show that cardiovascular telerehabilitation is a safe, cost-effective, and efficient alternative in improving functional capacity and quality of life in patients with coronary artery disease. The development and implementation of cardiovascular telerehabilitation are generally supported by the European Association of Preventive Cardiology, especially in the current global situation with the COVID-19 pandemic; this topic is becoming increasingly important.";2021;4
Children with cerebral palsy (CP) experience various restrictions owing to their underdeveloped mobility. Home confinement due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may further increase these restrictions. We report the case of a 7-year-old boy with CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level IV) whose motor function declined during the period when physical therapy was discontinued due to lockdown, approximately four months. At the end of the home confinement, the patient's ability to maintain a sitting posture and weight-bearing capacity of the lower extremities decreased. His Gross Motor Function Measure total score also decreased from 34.5% to 31.9%. After resuming physical therapy, the patient recovered the function status seen before the discontinuation of physical therapy, but this took almost twice as long as the confinement period. We reaffirm that frequent physical therapy is crucial for maintaining motor function in non-ambulatory children with CP. As a countermeasure for the future, urgent efforts are needed for the development of telerehabilitation.;2021;4
Children's National Hospital held a virtual symposium on The Clinic of the Future and Telehealth in December 2020. The goal of the symposium was to explore future trends in these domains. We also discussed how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic accelerated ongoing changes in healthcare. We explored what is on the horizon in these fields and how these changes might affect care delivery in the future. Specifically, we discussed the Clinic of the Future with clinical teams from genetics and metabolism, orthopedic surgery, and primary care while our telehealth discussion involved genetics and metabolism, psychiatry, and telerehabilitation. As one example, wearable technology could be adopted among primary care practices and drive a shift in outpatient cam from center-based care to patient-based care. We also examined technological innovations in physical exam instruments, gait analysis, imaging integration, and cast technology that could modernize the orthopedic surgery clinic. Telemedicine has rapidly expanded among all fields of medicine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, and has spurred innovation to improve the effectiveness of virtual physician visits. The development of technology to improve the virtual physical exam, during a telemedicine visit, further increases the utility of online appointments and increases access to care in all specialties. The incorporation of photogrammetry technology, in genetics and metabolism dysmorphology exams, will offer standardized tracking of patients that could improve diagnosis and treatment. Psychiatry has found nearly equal efficacy in diagnosis and treatment with telehealth visits and the additional benefit of gaining insight in the setting of the patients' home. Robotics has become increasingly common in rehabilitation, which can now incorporate a gaming experience that can be remotely updated and increase engagement and adherence in pediatric patients. The continued exploration of new ideas promises to improve both in-person and virtual care options.;2021;4
"Coaching has been identified as a best practice for early intervention (El) services provided through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C. The current study describes the establishment and progress of a research-relationship partnership to deliver coaching via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Community-based El providers implemented 9-weeks of telehealth coaching and evaluated the extent to which child and caregiver outcomes differed between families that had previously received in-person services versus telehealth only. Four El providers completed the intervention with n=17 families of children aged 6-34 months during the pandemic (April-August 2020). We used the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) to collect outcomes on caregiver identified goals; we used Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests to examine pre-to post-intervention data. Results showed significant improvements in parent satisfaction, child performance, and goal attainment (all p<.01). Findings suggest that telehealth coaching procedures implemented by community-based El providers resulted in improvements in caregiver identified goals for young children.";2021;4
Communication and swallowing disorders are highly prevalent in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The negative impact of these disorders on the quality of life of the person with PD and their families cannot be underestimated. Despite a demand for speech-language pathology services to support people with PD, many barriers to services exist. Telerehabilitation provides an alternate and complementary approach to in-person therapy that is patient-centered, enables timely assessment and intervention, and facilitates continuity of care throughout the course of the disease. This review explores the telerehabilitation applications designed for the management of the communication and swallowing disorders in PD, addresses the benefits and challenges of telerehabilitation, identifies future research directions, and highlights the potential of new technologies to enhance the management of communication and swallowing disorders and quality of life for people with PD.;2021;4
"Concerns have been raised about motivation and psychological distress when implementing telerehabilitation in patients with heart failure. The current study compared conventional and telerehabilitation in two groups (n=67; n=70) of patients with heart failure at 0, 6, and 12 months on measures of motivation (Self-Determination Theory measures) and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale). We found no significant changes in motivation across groups, although our telerehabilitation group had a slightly lower level of controlled motivation and higher levels of relatedness. In addition, there were no differences between groups with regard to psychological distress. This study demonstrates that telerehabilitation motivates patients with heart failure to the same degree as conventional rehabilitation, and that telerehabilitation is not associated with increased psychological distress. As such, telerehabilitation offers an alternative to conventional rehabilitation and addresses some of the barriers for participating in rehabilitation identified in the literature.";2021;4
"Considering the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, telerehabilitation may be a viable first-line option for patients with respiratory tract disease. To date, there has been no systematic review on telerehabilitation for respiratory tract diseases, including COVID-19. Therefore, this scoping review aimed to determine what telerehabilitation for patients with respiratory tract diseases consists of, how safe telerehabilitation is for patients with respiratory tract diseases, and how feasible telerehabilitation is for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In May 2020, we conducted a search of the following publication databases on the use of telerehabilitation in the treatment of respiratory tract diseases: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Literature, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database. Of the 208 articles identified, 23 studies were subsequently included in this scoping review. In 22 of the included studies, subjects had stable COPD and underwent telerehabilitation at home. The final included study was a case series of subjects with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who underwent telerehabilitation in-hospital. Most telerehabilitation programs consisted of aerobic exercises using a cycle ergometer or a treadmill, walking, and muscle-strengthening exercises. The reported number of adverse events was low, and most studies reported that the average session adherence rate was > 70%. The majority of the telerehabilitation programs included a face-to-face rehabilitation assessment. Our findings indicate that, in its current state, telerehabilitation may be safe and feasible and may lead to reduced face-to-face rehabilitation therapy; in addition, remote rehabilitation assessment should be considered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research that targets a more diverse range of respiratory tract diseases and considers telerehabilitation in a hospital setting is required.";2021;4
Context Aphasia is a post-stroke condition that can dramatically impact a person with aphasia's (PWA) communication abilities. To date, few if any studies have considered the cost and cost-effectiveness of functional change in aphasia nor considered measures of patient's value for aphasia treatment. Objective To assess the cost, cost-effectiveness, and perceived value associated with improved functional communication in individuals receiving telerehabilitation treatment for aphasia. Design Twenty PWA completed between 5 and 12 telehealth rehabilitation sessions of 45-60 minutes within a 6-week time frame using a Language-Oriented Treatment (LOT) designed to address a range of language issues among individuals with aphasia. National Outcomes Measures (NOMS) comprehension and verbal expression and the ASHA Quality of Communication Life (QCL) were completed prior to and at the completion of rehabilitation to obtain baseline and treatment measures. Results Age, education, and race are significantly correlated with improvement in the NOMS verbal expression. African Americans (OR = 2.0917) are twice as likely as Whites to experience improvement after treatment. The likelihood of improvement also increases with each additional year of education (OR = 1.002) but decrease with age (OR = 0.9463). A total of 15 PWA showed improvement in NOMS comprehension and nine patients showed improvement in NOMS verbal expression. Improving patients attended between five and 12 treatment sessions. The average cost of improvement in NOMS comprehension was $1,152 per patient and NOMS verbal expression was $1,128 per patient with individual treatment costs varying between $540 and $1,296. However, on average, the monetary equivalent in patient's improved QCL was between $1,790.39 to $3,912,54-far exceeding the financial cost of treatment. Conclusions When measuring the functional improvement of patients with aphasia, patient's quality of communication life received from treatment exceeded financial cost of services provided.;2021;4
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a serious acute respiratory syndrome that has been recognized as a pandemic disease caused by Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The complications related to coronavirus itself, physically inactive period due to symptoms of disease and lockdown may also influence the functional capacities of COVID-19 survivors negatively. It may lead to obstructions in engaging with previous activities of daily living. As a physiotherapy intervention, exercise treatment is one of the novel approaches to support these individuals after the COVID-19 treatment. However, there is limited access to physiotherapy and rehabilitation services during pandemic conditions because of lockdown, especially for infected patients. For increasing accessibility to physiotherapy and rehabilitation care, the World Confederation of Physical Therapy has published a report advising the home-based exercise interventions via Telerehabilitation. Up to date, there is no published framework for structured exercise programs for this population, yet. Since the individual differences in functional levels and possible differences in the severity of coronavirus infection, the physiotherapy, and rehabilitation exercise program should be structured individually for COVID-19 survivors. This document suggests a framework for physical therapists to put into practice an exercise training via telerehabilitation in COVID-19 survivors. The proposed framework has consisted of determination of eligible and risky COVID-19 patients for intervention, physiotherapy assessment tools, 6-week exercise prescription based on FIIT-VP principle (frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, and progression) and criteria for ending exercise.;2021;4
COVID-19 can cause important sequels in the respiratory system and frequently presents loss of strength, dyspnea, polyneuropathies and multi-organic affectation. Physiotherapy interventions acquire a fundamental role in the recovery of the functions and the quality of life. Regarding the recovery phases after hospital discharge, the current evidence available is very preliminary. Telerehabilitation is presented as a promising complementary treatment method to standard physiotherapy. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized telerehabilitation intervention after discharge from hospital for the improvement of functional capacity and quality of life compared to a program of health education and/or care in a rehabilitation center. As secondary objectives, to identify the satisfaction and perception of patients with the telerehabilitation intervention and the presence of barriers to its implementation, as well as to evaluate the cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the health system. This study protocol will be carried out through a single blind multicenter randomized clinical trial in the south of Spain. We hypothesize that the implementation of a telerehabilitation program presents results not inferior to those obtained with the current standard intervention. If the hypothesis is confirmed, it would be an opportunity to define new policies and interventions to address this disease and its consequences. Trial registration NCT04742946.;2021;4
"COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of telehealth among various specialties, including rehabilitation. The fast-paced implementation of telerehabilitation has laid bare its challenges, providing an opportunity for innovation in order to enhance the experience of remote care. The purpose of this study sought to understand the attitudes toward telerehabilitation from physical therapist (PT) and patient perspectives. Two surveys administered to PTs, and the general patient population explored beliefs regarding telerehabilitation. There were a total of 289 participant responses in this study. There were 228 PT respondents and 61 patients who responded to the patient survey. Qualitative results describe current attitudes toward telerehabilitation. Results indicated both groups were receptive to virtual therapy sessions; however, some challenges were also reported. Current challenges and trends in utilizing telerehabilitation are further discussed.";2021;4
Current neurorehabilitation models primarily rely on extended hospital stays and regular therapy sessions requiring close physical interactions between rehabilitation professionals and patients. The current COVID-19 pandemic has challenged this model, as strict physical distancing rules and a shift in the allocation of hospital resources resulted in many neurological patients not receiving essential therapy. Accordingly, a recent survey revealed that the majority of European healthcare professionals involved in stroke care are concerned that this lack of care will have a noticeable negative impact on functional outcomes. COVID-19 highlights an urgent need to rethink conventional neurorehabilitation and develop alternative approaches to provide high-quality therapy while minimizing hospital stays and visits. Technology-based solutions, such as, robotics bear high potential to enable such a paradigm shift. While robot-assisted therapy is already established in clinics, the future challenge is to enable physically assisted therapy and assessments in a minimally supervized and decentralized manner, ideally at the patient's home. Key enablers are new rehabilitation devices that are portable, scalable and equipped with clinical intelligence, remote monitoring and coaching capabilities. In this perspective article, we discuss clinical and technological requirements for the development and deployment of minimally supervized, robot-assisted neurorehabilitation technologies in patient's homes. We elaborate on key principles to ensure feasibility and acceptance, and on how artificial intelligence can be leveraged for embedding clinical knowledge for safe use and personalized therapy adaptation. Such new models are likely to impact neurorehabilitation beyond COVID-19, by providing broad access to sustained, high-quality and high-dose therapy maximizing long-term functional outcomes.;2021;4
"Currently, there are more than 1.55 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain. Of these, it is estimated that around 45% will present respiratory complications, which represents approximately 620,000 patients who will need respiratory rehabilitation. The health system has no resources for this huge quantity of patients after the hospital discharge to finish the complete recovery and avoid the chronicity of the symptoms. We propose an application named RespiraConNosotros. The application has been created and designed to guide users in performing respiratory rehabilitation exercises, especially for COVID-19 patients, and it also facilitates patient-physiotherapist contact via chat or video calling to help patients. It is accessible for all users and on all devices. All exercises would be guided and supervised by a specialized physiotherapist who suggests, adapts, and guides the exercise according to the function level of each patient. Data obtained was satisfactory; all patients pointed out the easy access, the intuitive format, and the advantage of communicating with an expert. Concerning functional assessment, all participants improved their score on the Borg scale after performing the intervention with the application.This platform would help respiratory patients to make rehabilitation treatments to recover their pulmonary function and to decrease or eliminate the possible complications they have. It never substitutes any prescribed treatment. In conclusion, RespiraConNosotros is a simple, viable, and safe alternative for the improvement and maintenance of respiratory capacity and patient's functionality affected by COVID-19. It could be used as a complement to face-to-face treatment when the situation allows it.";2021;4
Demographic changes associated with an expanding and aging population will lead to an increasing number of orthopedic surgeries, such as joint replacements. To support patients' home exercise programs after total hip replacement and completing subsequent inpatient rehabilitation, a low-cost, smartphone-based augmented reality training game (TG) was developed. To evaluate its motion detection accuracy, data from 30 healthy participants were recorded while using the TG. A 3D motion analysis system served as reference. The TG showed differences of 18.03 mm to 24.98 mm along the anatomical axes. Surveying the main movement direction of the implemented exercises (squats, step-ups, side-steps), differences between 10.13 mm to 24.59 mm were measured. In summary, the accuracy of the TG's motion detection is sufficient for use in exergames and to quantify progress in patients' performance. Considering the findings of this study, the presented exer-game approach has potential as a low-cost, easily accessible support for patients in their home exercise program.;2021;4
"Despite evidence of the efficacy of telerehabilitation post-stroke, uptake has lagged behind the development of available technology, slowed by low confidence in user experience. We aimed to explore the issue of acceptability by characterizing the experience of telerehabilitation for service providers and consumers of a memory rehabilitation program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine clinicians (M-age = 33.29;SD = 7.37; range 25-44) and 25 stroke survivors with memory difficulties (M-age = 54.12;SD = 10.99; range 36-82) following a 6-week compensatory memory skills program delivered via in-home videoconferencing. Thematic analysis identified a range of perspectives under three overarching themes: (1)Content and Delivery; (2)Relationship and Connection; and (3)The Role and Benefits of Telerehabilitation. Reports from both respondent groups were overwhelmingly positive about the telerehabilitation experience and identified the benefits of increasing service availability. Videoconferencing technology was usable and occasional reliability issues were not a barrier. Users identified a range of benefits and challenges regarding communication, rapport building, and integration of rehabilitation in the home environment. Furthermore, most stroke survivors reported benefit from the intervention, via the acquisition of memory strategies and improved self-confidence through better understanding of their deficits. Overall, telerehabilitation of memory was acceptable to users.";2021;4
Digital games can make speech therapy exercises more enjoyable for children and increase their motivation during therapy. However, many such games developed to date have not been designed for long-term use. To address this issue, we developed Apraxia World, a speech therapy game specifically intended to be played over extended periods. In this study, we examined pronunciation improvements, child engagement over time, and caregiver and automated pronunciation evaluation accuracy while using our game over a multi-month period. Ten children played Apraxia World at home during two counterbalanced 4-week treatment blocks separated by a 2-week break. In one treatment phase, children received pronunciation feedback from care-givers and in the other treatment phase, utterances were evaluated with an automated framework built into the game. We found that children made therapeutically significant speech improvements while using Apraxia World, and that the game successfully increased engagement during speech therapy practice. Additionally, in offline mispronunciation detection tests, our automated pronunciation evaluation framework outperformed a traditional method based on goodness of pronunciation scoring. Our results suggest that this type of speech therapy game is a valid complement to traditional home practice.;2021;4
Digital health is becoming more integrated in daily medical practice. In cardiology, patient care is already moving from the hospital to the patients' homes, with large trials showing positive results in the field of telemonitoring via cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure via implantable devices, telemonitoring via home-based non-invasive sensors, and screening for atrial fibrillation via smartphone and smartwatch technology. Cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention are modalities that could greatly benefit from digital health integration, as current compliance and cardiac rehabilitation participation rates are low and optimisation is urgently required. This viewpoint offers a perspective on current use of digital health technologies in cardiac rehabilitation, heart failure and secondary prevention. Important barriers which need to be addressed for implementation in medical practice are discussed. To conclude, a future ideal digital tool and integrated healthcare system are envisioned. To overcome personal, technological, and legal barriers, technological development should happen in dialog with patients and caregivers. Aided by digital technology, a future could be realised in which we are able to offer high-quality, affordable, personalised healthcare in a patient-centred way.;2021;4
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the higher susceptibility of post-stroke patients to infection calls for extra safety precautions. Despite the imposed restrictions, early neurorehabilitation cannot be postponed due to its paramount importance for improving motor and functional recovery chances. Utilizing accessible state-of-the-art technologies, home-based rehabilitation devices are proposed as a sustainable solution in the current crisis. In this paper, a comprehensive review on developed home-based rehabilitation technologies of the last 10 years (2011-2020), categorizing them into upper and lower limb devices and considering both commercialized and state-of-the-art realms. Mechatronic, control, and software aspects of the system are discussed to provide a classified roadmap for home-based systems development. Subsequently, a conceptual framework on the development of smart and intelligent community-based home rehabilitation systems based on novel mechatronic technologies is proposed. In this framework, each rehabilitation device acts as an agent in the network, using the internet of things (IoT) technologies, which facilitates learning from the recorded data of the other agents, as well as the tele-supervision of the treatment by an expert. The presented design paradigm based on the above-mentioned leading technologies could lead to the development of promising home rehabilitation systems, which encourage stroke survivors to engage in under-supervised or unsupervised therapeutic activities.;2021;4
"Dysphagia is the difficulty in swallowing because of the presence of certain diseases; it particularly compromises the oral and/or pharyngeal stages. In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, neuromuscular complications, prolonged bed rest, and endotracheal intubation target different levels of the swallowing network. Thus, critically ill patients are prone to dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia. In this review, we first discuss the possible cause and pathophysiology underlying dysphagia associated with coronavirus disease 2019, including cerebrovascular events, such as stroke, encephalomyelitis, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and myositis, that may lead to the dysphagia reported as a complication associated with the coronavirus disease 2019. Next, we present some recommendations for dysphagia evaluation with modifications that would allow a safe and comprehensive assessment based on available evidence to date, including critical considerations of the appropriate use of personal protective equipment and optimization individual's noninstrumental swallowing tasks evaluation, while preserving instrumental assessments for urgent cases only. Finally, we discuss a practical managing strategy for dysphagia rehabilitation to ensure safe and efficient practice in the risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure, in which swallowing therapy using newer technology, such as telerehabilitation system or wearable device, would be considered as a useful option.";2021;4
Ensuring proper dosage of treatment and repetition over time is a major challenge in neurorehabilitation. However, a requirement of physical distancing to date compromises their achievement. While mostly associated to COVID-19, physical distancing is not only required in a pandemic scenario, but also advised for several clinical conditions (e.g. immunocompromised individuals) or forced for specific social contexts (e.g. people living in remote areas worldwide). All these contexts advocate for the implementation of alternative healthcare models. The objective of this perspective is to highlight the benefits of remote administration of rehabilitative treatment, namely telerehabilitation, in counteracting physical distancing barriers in neurorehabilitation. Sustaining boosters of treatment outcome, such as compliance, sustainability, as well as motivation, telerehabilitation may adapt to multiple neurological conditions, with the further advantage of a high potential for individualization to patient's or pathology's specificities. The effectiveness of telerehabilitation can be potentiated by several technologies available to date: virtual reality can recreate realistic environments in which patients may bodily operate, wearable sensors allow to quantitatively monitor the patient's performance, and signal processing may contribute to the prediction of long-term dynamics of patient recovery. Telerehabilitation might spark its advantages far beyond the mere limitation of physical distancing effects, mitigating criticalities of daily neurorehabilitative practice, and thus paving the way to the envision of mixed models of care, where hospital-based procedures are complementarily integrated with telerehabilitative ones.;2021;4
Featured Application This article presents an application of dynamic segmentation for physical activity recognition using machine learning techniques. Data segmentation is an essential process in activity recognition when using machine learning techniques. Previous studies on physical activity recognition have mostly relied on the sliding window approach for segmentation. However, choosing a fixed window size for multiple activities with different durations may affect recognition accuracy, especially when the activities belong to the same category (i.e., dynamic or static). This paper presents and verifies a new method for dynamic segmentation of physical activities performed during the rehabilitation of individuals with spinal cord injuries. To adaptively segment the raw data, signal characteristics are analyzed to determine the suitable type of boundaries. Then, the algorithm identifies the time boundaries to represent the start- and endpoints of each activity. To verify the method and build a predictive model, an experiment was conducted in which data were collected using a single wrist-worn accelerometer sensor. The experimental results were compared with the sliding window approach, indicating that the proposed method outperformed the sliding window approach in terms of overall accuracy, which exceeded 5%, as well as model robustness. The results also demonstrated efficient physical activity segmentation using the proposed method, resulting in high classification performance for all activities considered.;2021;4
Featured Application: The present work is a potential application for improve the rehabilitation process using remote supervision. There are more than 800 million people in the world with chronic diseases. Many of these people do not have easy access to healthcare facilities for recovery. Telerehabilitation seeks to provide a solution to this problem. According to the researchers, the topic has been treated as medical aid, making an exchange between technological issues such as the Internet of Things and virtual reality. The main objective of this work is to design a distributed platform to monitor the patient's movements and status during rehabilitation exercises. Later, this information can be processed and analyzed remotely by the doctor assigned to the patient. In this way, the doctor can follow the patient's progress, enhancing the improvement and recovery process. To achieve this, a case study has been made using a PANGEA-based multi-agent system that coordinates different parts of the architecture using ubiquitous computing techniques. In addition, the system uses real-time feedback from the patient. This feedback system makes the patients aware of their errors so that they can improve their performance in later executions. An evaluation was carried out with real patients, achieving promising results.;2021;4
Featured Application</p> The findings reported in this manuscript can act as a guideline in developing and designing videogames and consoles that are enjoyable, accessible, and inclusive for children with neurological impairments.</p> Game activity is fundamental for children's cognitive and social development. During recent years, technology development has led to changes in several areas, including the ludic one. However, while in the literature, there are plenty of studies that report the importance of technology-based games in rehabilitation program, little attention has been paid to their role as pure entertainment. In contrast, the market does not provide videogames that are engaging, accessible, and inclusive. In this context, a survey was distributed to families who have a child with neuromotor limitations to investigate how these children deal with play, in particular with videogames, and what the requirements are for accessible and inclusive videogames. FightTheStroke distributed the questionnaire to families with a child with neuromotor impairments in April 2020. Fifty-six families responded to the survey. The answers revealed that children generally manifest positive feelings when playing with videogames, especially with cooperative ones, even if they are not fully accessible. The survey also collected user needs and suggestions from families about the design of videogames for neuromotor-impaired children. Guidelines derived from the survey are reported for the development of entertaining, inclusive, and accessible videogames, playable by children with neuromotor disabilities.</p>;2021;4
Following the COVID-19 health emergency, the use of telemedicine, that is the provision of health services through telecommunications and internet technologies, has spread. This work presents a critical review of the characteristics, purposes, advantages and problems of telemedicine in the care of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and the prospects that can be hypothesized in its application even beyond the pandemic emergency.;2021;4
For the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), early diagnosis and unconditionally correct management at the initial stage of the disease are very important when the symptoms are not yet too worrying. In this way, the progress of the disease can be slowed down, as can the occurrence of late, life-threatening symptoms. Pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential component of the management of COPD. The selection of appropriate exercises, which are determined during the classification of patients into a suitable improvement program, is of key importance in the process of rehabilitation. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in major limitations to public health care. Health systems were largely unprepared for an outbreak of this magnitude. Searching for new, attractive technologies that help patients with chronic diseases seems to be justified. This may be driven by telehealth platforms, likewise with the use of virtual reality (VR). Analysis of the available literature indicates promising effectiveness, high patient acceptance, and high motivations to undertake physical activity with the use of such a solution. Thus, the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic should include options for remote delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation, including home-based, telerehabilitation, and computer-based virtual programs.;2021;4
Health monitoring assists physicians in the decision-making process, which in turn, improves quality of life. As technology advances, the usage and applications of context-aware systems continue to spread across different areas in patient monitoring and disease management. It provides a platform for healthcare professionals to assess the health status of patients in their care using multiple relevant parameters. In this survey, we consider context-aware systems proposed by researchers for health monitoring and management. More specifically, we investigate different technologies and techniques used for cardiac condition monitoring and management. This paper also proposes 'mCardiac', an enhanced context-aware decision support system for cardiac condition monitoring and management during rehabilitation.;2021;4
"Healthcare access and delivery for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who live in remote areas or who are susceptible to contracting communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, may be a challenge. Telehealth and remote monitoring devices can be used to overcome this issue. However, the accuracy of these devices must be ensured before forming healthcare decisions based on their outcomes. Therefore, a systematic review was performed to synthesize the evidence on the reliability, validity and responsiveness of digital devices used for tracking oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and/or respiratory rate (RR) in individuals with COPD, in remote settings. Three electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE (1996 to October 8, 2020), EMBASE (1996 to October 8, 2020) and CINAHL (1998 to October 8, 2020). Studies were included if they aimed to evaluate one or more measurement properties of a digital device measuring SpO(2) or RR in individuals with COPD. Six-hundred and twenty-five articles were identified and after screening, 7 studies matched the inclusion criteria; covering 11 devices measuring SpO(2) and/or RR. Studies reported on the reliability (n = 1), convergent validity (n = 1), concurrent validity (n = 2) and predictive validity (n = 2) of SpO(2) devices and on the convergent validity (n = 1), concurrent validity (n = 1) and predictive validity (n = 1) of RR devices. SpO(2) and RR devices were valid when compared against other respiration monitoring devices but were not precise in predicting exacerbation events. More well-designed measurement studies are needed to make firm conclusions about the accuracy of such devices. Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1945021 .";2021;4
Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation can decrease symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a home-based pulmonary rehabilitation by instructive multimedia in the form of videos and flip charts on clinical symptoms and exercise performance in COPD patients. An eight-week home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program was performed with twenty COPD patients older than 60 years of age with moderate to severe stages. They were separated into two groups: a multimedia group (n = 10) and a control group, which was only provided with telephone monitoring (n = 10). Clinical symptoms were measured by using the clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ), and exercise performance was measured using a six-minute walk test (6MWT) and an upper-lower limb muscle strengthening test. After 8 weeks, the results showed that both groups showed a statistically significant decrease in the CCQ (p < 0.05). The multimedia group showed a statistically significant increase in the lower-limb muscle strengthening (p < 0.05), while the control group was not found to show a statistically significant increase in the lower-limb muscle strengthening. Therefore, a pulmonary rehabilitation program using multimedia at home can lessen symptoms and improve exercise performance in COPD patients.;2021;4
Hospital visits and regular rehabilitation of chronic patients due to COVID-19 pose a risk. Therefore, patients with chronic illnesses who need regular rehabilitation have been victims of the pandemic process. Because of their fear of being infected, they were deprived of the chance of their symptoms being rehabilitated. Therefore, it is extremely important to rehabilitate individuals with chronic illnesses in need of rehabilitation through telerehabilitation. In this study, we aimed to show the effect of Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises to be applied through telerehabilitation on eye movements, vision, and quality of life in a patient suffering from diplopia due to multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been found that Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises improve the quality of life and reduce the complaints of diplopia in MS patients with diplopia. In addition, the patient verbally stated that his balance increased after Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises. As a result, Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises are a rehabilitation method that gives positive results in the treatment of diplopia and it is recommended to apply this method via telerehabilitation.;2021;4
"IMPORTANCE Arthroscopic meniscectomy is one of the most common orthopedic procedures. The optimal postoperative approach remains debated. OBJECTIVE To compare outcomes associated with home-based rehabilitation programs (HBP) vs standard inpatient and/or outpatient supervised physical therapy (IOP) following arthroscopic isolated meniscectomy (AM). DATA SOURCES A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases on March 15, 2021. The included studies were published from 1982 to 2019. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of patients treated with HBP vs 10P after AM were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were independently screened and extracted by 2 authors according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) reporting guideline. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model; when an I-2 < 25% was observed, the fixed-effect model was used. The Hartung-Knapp correction was applied. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the Lysholm score (scale of 0-100 with higher scores indicating better knee function) and secondary outcomes were subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, knee extension and flexion, thigh girth, horizontal and vertical hop test, and days to return to work, as indicated in the PROSPERO registration. Outcomes were measured in the short-term (ranging from 28 to 50 days) and the midterm (6 months). RESULTS In this meta-analysis of 8 RCTs including 434 patients, 10P was associated with a greater short-term improvement in Lysholm score compared with HBP, with a mean difference of -8.64 points (95% CI, -15.14 to -2.13 points; P = .02) between the 2 approached, but the sensitivity analysis showed no difference. Similarly, no statistically significant difference was detected at midterm for Lysholm score, with a mean difference between groups of -4.78 points (95% CI, -9.98 to 0.42 points; P = .07). HBP was associated with a greater short-term improvement in thigh girth, with a mean difference between groups of 1.38 cm (95% CI, 0.27 to 2.48 cm; P = .01), whereaslOP was associated with a better short-term vertical hop score, with a mean difference between groups of -3.25 cm (95% CI, -6.20 to -0.29 cm; P = .03). No differences were found for all the other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No intervention was found to be superior in terms of physical and functional outcomes as well as work-related and patient-reported outcomes, both at short-term and midterm follow-up. Overall, these results suggest that HBP may be an effective management approach after AM in the general population.";2021;4
In 2019, COVID-19 a disease associated with Novel Corona-virus was initially reported from Wuhan, China. Since then, infection rates have gone out of control. World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, many government and nonprofit organisations are working to control this situation, norms like lockdown, social distancing, and restricting gatherings have been implemented to control the spread of the virus. Despite following these policies, the infection rate is high and people with COVID-19 infection are experiencing a lot of complications. Cardiac and pulmonary complications like shortness of breath, Oxygen saturation etc., were documented, but recent reports mentioned musculoskeletal symptoms like Myalgia, Arthralgia, and Fatigue are also prevalent in people with post-COVID-19 infection. Due to the reoccurrence of symptoms and vulnerability of people, post-Covid-19 has made healthcare workers and hospitals to adopt alternative strategies in treating people. Of those strategies telerehabilitation, patient education, self-management, and pain management are the most used rehabilitation options in treating post-COVID-19 infection. In this literature review, the strategies for treating people with post-COVID-19 infection are summarised.;2021;4

In catastrophic situations such as pandemics, patients' healthcare including admissions to hospitals and emergency services are challenged by the risk of infection and by limitations of healthcare resources. In such a setting, the use of telemedicine interventions has become extremely important. New technologies have proved helpful in pandemics as a solution to improve the quality of life in vulnerable patients such as persons with neurological diseases. Moreover, telemedicine interventions provide at-home solutions allowing clinicians to telemonitor and assess patients remotely, thus minimizing risk of infection. After a review of different studies using telemedicine in neurological patients, we propose a telemedicine process flow for healthcare of subjects with chronic neurological disease to respond to the new challenges for delivering quality healthcare during the transformation of public and private healthcare organizations around the world forced by COVID-19 pandemic contingency. This telemedicine process flow represents a replacement for in-person treatment and thereby the provision equitable access to the care of vulnerable people. It is conceptualized as comprehensive service including (1) teleassistance with patient counseling and medical treatment, (2) telemonitoring of patients' health conditions and any changes over time, as well as (3) telerehabilitation, i.e., interventions to assess and promote body functions, activities, and consecutively participation. The hereby proposed telemedicine process flow could be adopted on a large scale to improve the public health response during healthcare crises like the COVID-19 pandemic but could equally promote equitable health care independent of people's mobility or location with respect to the specialized health care center.;2021;4
In literature there is a growing evidence that in cervical dystonia (CD) rehabilitation, both in person and remotely, is an efficacious add on treatment to botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) injections, but there is no consensus about protocols. We present here two rehabilitation programs implemented by our neuro-rehabilitative multidisciplinary team. The enclosed video clips show exercises to be performed at home as self-rehabilitation program, and exercises presented by a physiotherapist for a telerehabilitation program. These two protocols may be helpful for integrating rehabilitation with BoNT treatment in CD.;2021;4
"In many health systems, it is difficult to carry out traditional rehabilitation programs as the systems are stressed. We evaluate the effectiveness of a telerehabilitation program conducted in primary care in post-COVID-19 patients. An observational, prospective study was conducted in seven primary care centers in Chile. We included adult patients (> 18 years) with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The telerehabilitation program consisted of 24 sessions of supervised home-based exercise training. The efficacy was measured by the 1-min sit-to-stand test (1-min STST), the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms before and after intervention. We included 115 patients (55.4% female) with a mean age of 55.6 & PLUSMN; 12.7 years. Fifty-seven patients (50%) had antecedents of hospitalization, and 35 (30.4%) were admitted to the ICU. The 1-min STST was improved after the intervention from 20.5 & PLUSMN; 10.2 (53.1 & PLUSMN; 25.0%predicted) to 29.4 & PLUSMN; 11.9 (78.2 & PLUSMN; 28.0%predicted) repetitions (p < 0.001). The SF-36 global score improved significantly from 39.6 & PLUSMN; 17.6 to 58.9 & PLUSMN; 20.5. Fatigue and dyspnea improved significantly after the intervention. Although limited by the absence of a control group, this report showed that a telerehabilitation program applied in primary health care is feasible and was effective in improving physical capacity, quality of life and symptoms in adult survivors of COVID-19.</p>";2021;4
In recent years, there has been a significant growth in the number of research works focused on improving the lifestyle and health of elderly people by means of technology. Telerehabilitation and the promotion of physical activity at home have been two of the fields that have attracted more attention, especially currently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, elderly people are sometimes reluctant to use technology at home, mainly due to fear of technology and lack of familiarity. In this context, this article presents a low-cost platform that relies on exergames and natural user interfaces to promote physical activity at home and improve the quality of life in elderly people. The underlying system is easy to use and accessible, offering a number of interaction mechanisms that guide users through the execution of routines and exercises. A relevant feature of the proposal is the ability to customize the exergames, making it possible for the therapist to adapt them according to the user's needs. Motivation is also addressed within the developed platform to maintain the user's engagement level as time passes by. An empirical experiment is conducted to measure the usability and motivational aspects of the proposal, which was evaluated by 17 users between 62 and 89 years of age. The obtained results showed that the proposal was well received, considering that most of the users were not experienced at all with exergame-based systems.;2021;4
In response to the rehabilitation needs of stroke patients who are unable to benefit from conventional rehabilitation due to the COVID-19 epidemic, this paper designs a robot that combines on-site and telerehabilitation. The objective is to assist the patient in walking. We design the electromechanical system with a gantry mechanism, body-weight support system, information feedback system, and man-machine interactive control system. The proposed rehabilitation robot remote system is based on the client/server (C/S) network framework to realize the remote control of the robot state logic and the transmission of patient training data. Based on the proposed system, doctors can set or adjust the training modes and control the parameters of the robot and guide remote patient rehabilitation training through video communication. The robotic system can further store and manage the rehabilitation data of the patient during training. Experiments show the human-computer interaction system of the lower limb rehabilitation robot has good performance, can accurately recognize the information of human motion posture, and achieve the goal of actively the following motion. Experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed design, the information management of stroke patients, and the efficiency of rehabilitation training. The proposed system can reduce the workload of the doctors in practical training.;2021;4
In this paper, an augmented reality mirror application using vision-based human pose detection based on vision-based pose detection called ExerCam is presented. ExerCam does not need any special controllers or sensors for its operation, as it works with a simple RGB camera (webcam type), which makes the application totally accessible and low cost. This application also has a system for managing patients, tasks and games via the web, with which a therapist can manage their patients in a ubiquitous and totally remote way. As a final conclusion of the article, it can be inferred that the application developed is viable as a telerehabilitation tool, as it has the resource of a task mode for the calculation of the range of motion (ROM) and, on the other hand, a game mode to encourage patients to improve their performance during the therapy, with positive results obtained in this aspect.</p>;2021;4
In this paper, we focus on the human upper limb rehabilitation scheme that utilizes the concept of teleoperation. Teleoperation can help the therapist demonstrate different rehab exercises to a different group of people at the same time remotely. Different groups of people from a different place connected to the same network can get therapy from the same therapist at the same time using the telerehabilitation scheme. Here, we presented a humanoid robot NAO that can be operated remotely by a therapist to demonstrate the exercise to a patient. To mimic the movement demonstrated by the therapist, Kinect V2 sensor which is a markerless vision-based motion-tracking device, was used. Modified Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention was used for the kinematic modeling of the human upper arm. From the Kinect data, a geometric solution was developed to find a unique inverse kinematic solution of human upper-extremity. Experimental results revealed that NAO could be teleoperated successfully to instruct and demonstrate patients to perform different arm movement exercises in real-time.;2021;4
In this research work, the development of an electro-mechanical device for the rehabilitation of the flexor-extensor movement of the elbow with rehabilitative potential is presented. For the development of this prototype, an elbow joint was designed and built which allows movements from 0 degrees to 120 degrees. The design of the gear system was carried out using Solid Edge software from a previous selection of the step motor that offered enough torque to achieve flexion and extension of the elbow, then for the construction of this system a 3D printing was used in PLA. This system was coupled to a hinged arm stabilizer system. The prototype is operated from a software application on Android using the IDE MITapp inventor, which sends the desired angulation to an Arduino device which implements a digital control system. To improve the perception of exoskeleton therapy, a telerehabilitation software application was developed using IDE processing and a Kinect body recognition device, which guides the patient in an interactive therapy where they perform the rehabilitation of flexion and extension movement by guiding a virtual object from one angle to another.;2021;4
In this review, we present the safest and most effective diagnosis and treatment approaches to dysphagia during the novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the light of available data, relevant literature, and personal experiences. Evaluations for dysphagia patients should be based on clinical assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic and instrumental assessment should be planned for very few number of patients. The main approach to rehabilitation must depend on compensatory methods, texture-modified foods, and postural strategies. Direct treatment methods should be avoided and home-based exercise programs should be encouraged. It is also obvious that there is a need for the development of new strategies for telemedicine/telerehabilitation practices in the new world order.;2021;4
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent global events, the healthcare system and its services have been negatively affected, contributing towards extensive surgical backlogs. Oncological surgical candidates have been the most impacted by these changes and recommended self-isolation practices, which could result in emotional distress, sedentary behavior, and poor lifestyle habits. Preoperative supportive intervention, prehabilitation, has been proven to improve patients' functional status and clinical trajectories. Presently, there is a critical need for prehabilitation to optimize patient health, as they experience extended wait times. However, in-hospital delivery may not be an ideal approach due to public health and safety measures. Telehealth is a field of research and practice, which has grown and evolved significantly in the last two decades, allowing for the remote delivery of health services. Therefore, the current commentary addresses the different modalities of telehealth delivery in perspective of their known feasibility and potential application in prehabilitation.;2021;4
Individual and group cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by reducing recurrent events, improving risk factors, aiding compliance with drug treatment, and improving quality of life through physical activity and education. Home-based programs are equally effective in improving exercise capacity, risk factors, mortality, and health-related quality of life outcomes compared to hospital-based intervention. Cardio-telerehabilitation (CTR) programs are a supplement or an alternative to hospital rehabilitation programs providing similar benefits to usual hospital and home care. Despite this statement, implementation in the public and private healthcare environment is still scarce and limited. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and adherence of a personalized eight-week mHealth telerehabilitation program in low-risk cardiac patients in the hospital of Melilla (Spain). The secondary aims were to investigate patient satisfaction, identify barriers of implementation and adverse events, and assess cost-effectiveness from a health system perspective. A study protocol for a single center prospective controlled trial was conducted at the Regional Hospital of Melilla (Spain), with a sample size of (n = 30) patients with a diagnosis of low-risk CVD with class I heart failure according to NYHA (New York Heart Association). Outcomes of this study, will add new evidence that could support the use of CTR in cardiac patients clinical guidelines.;2021;4
Individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) experience impaired gross motor skills limiting their capacity. Therefore, they need support to participate in physical activities, and it is crucial to work with primary caregivers when developing appropriate strategies, thereby leading to an active lifestyle. There is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of remotely supported physical activity interventions. This project aimed to evaluate the effects of a skype-based, telehealth-delivered physical activity program carried out by participants' parents at home. This article will focus on parental points of view. A mixed-methods design evaluating parental satisfaction was conducted. Forty participants with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of RTT and their families were recruited. The intervention included a 12-week individualized daily physical activity program carried out by participants' parents and bi-weekly supervised by expert therapists. Parents' impressions and feelings related to the program implementation were collected throughout semi-structured interviews, and an ad hoc developed questionnaire and discussed. The current project results suggest that a remote physical rehabilitation program, supported fortnightly by video calls, represents an effective way of conducting a remote physical therapy intervention for this population and that it can be easily carried out at home by primary caregivers, promoting positive functional changes, without bringing feelings of frustration due to the required workload. The strategies that families have learned during the program to support the motor activities of their daughters represent an easily performed set of tools that they can maintain and use in everyday life even after the cessation of the program.</p>;2021;4
Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are a concrete answer to many needs in the healthcare framework since they enable remote support for patients and foster continuity of care. Currently, frail elderly people are among end users who most need and would benefit from IoT solutions from both a social and a healthcare point of view. Indeed, IoT technologies can provide a set of services to monitor the healthcare of the elderly or support them in order to reduce the risk of injuries, and preserve their motor and cognitive abilities. The main feature of IoT solutions for the elderly population is ease of use. Indeed, to fully exploit the potential of an IoT solution, patients should be able to autonomously deal with it. The remote-monitoring validation engineering system (ReMoVES) described here is an IoT solution that caters to the specific needs of frail elderly individuals. Its architecture was designed for use at rehabilitation centers and at patients' homes. The system is user-friendly and comfortably usable by persons who are not familiar with technology. In addition, exergames enhance patient engagement in order to curb therapy abandonment. Along with the technical presentation of the solution, a real-life scenario application is described referring to sit-to-stand activity.;2021;4
"Introduction After cochlear implantation, auditory and speech training is usually necessary. Up until now, this has been performed on an out- or inpatient basis in direct contact with a therapist. Due to technical advances but also particularly because of an increasing use of digital media and a desire for mobility and independence, the demand for digital training programs is increasing in the field of hearing rehabilitation. Materials and Methods In a first step, the most important elements of auditory training were determined on the basis of commonly used auditory and speech processing models, and the core features of a computer-based teletherapeutic hearing platform were defined. This process considered motivational elements and adaptive mechanisms as regularly used in educational and speech and language therapy. In a second step, an initial prototype of the train2hear teletherapeutic hearing platform was developed by an interdisciplinary research team. Results The core of the train2hear platform is an initial analysis according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), on the basis of which an individual training plan is designed. Various adaptive mechanisms enable the level of difficulty to be continually adapted to the individual user & apos;s learning progress. A videoconference tool enables contact between the patient and the therapist. Conclusion The train2hear platform represents a first prototype of a computer-based auditory rehabilitation program in German. Further evaluation and development in a clinical study are needed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of the platform.";2021;4
Introduction As the demand for rehabilitation in orthopaedics increases, so too has the development in advanced rehabilitation technology. However, to date, there are no review papers outlining the broad scope of advanced rehabilitation technology used within the orthopaedic population. The aim of this study is to identify, describe and summarise the evidence for efficacy for all advanced rehabilitation technologies applicable to orthopaedic practice. Methods The relevant literature describing the use of advanced rehabilitation technology in orthopaedics was identified from appropriate electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) and a narrative review undertaken. Results Advanced rehabilitation technologies were classified into two groups: hospital-based and home-based rehabilitation. In the hospital-based technology group, we describe the use of continuous passive motion and robotic devices (after spinal cord injury) and their effect on improving clinical outcomes. We also report on the use of electromagnetic sensor technology for measuring kinematics of upper and lower limbs during rehabilitation. In the home-based technology group, we describe the use of inertial sensors, smartphones, software applications and commercial game hardware that are relatively inexpensive, user-friendly and widely available. We outline the evidence for videoconferencing for promoting knowledge and motivation for rehabilitation as well as the emerging role of virtual reality. Conclusions The use of advanced rehabilitation technology in orthopaedics is promising and evidence for its efficacy is generally supportive.;2021;4
"Introduction Clinical guidelines recommend multidisciplinary non-surgical management for most musculoskeletal spinal conditions. Access to such services continues to be a barrier for many individuals residing outside metropolitan regions. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether clinical outcomes achieved via telerehabilitation are as good as those achieved via in-person care. Methods A non-randomised pilot clinical trial was undertaken where eligible patients chose to access treatment either via telerehabilitation or in-person (control group). Outcome measures for pain-related disability, pain severity and health-related quality of life were recorded at baseline, 3-, 6- and 9-months. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction and technical disruptions. Results Seventy-one patients were recruited (telerehabilitation, n = 51; control group, n = 20). Patient characteristics did not differ at baseline and clinically meaningful improvements for pain-related disability and health-related quality of life were observed in both groups. Non-inferiority of telerehabilitation could not be claimed for any clinical outcome measure. There were no significant group-by-time interactions observed for either pain-related disability (p = 0.706), pain severity (p = 0.187) or health-related quality of life (p = 0.425) measures. The telerehabilitation group reported significantly higher levels of treatment satisfaction (median: 97 vs. 76.5; p = 0.021); 7.9% of telerehabilitation appointments were not completed due to technical disruptions. Discussion Findings indicate patients with chronic musculoskeletal spinal conditions can achieve clinically meaningful improvements in their condition when accessing care via telerehabilitation. Telerehabilitation should be considered for individuals unable to access relevant in-person services; however non-inferiority remains inconclusive and requires further exploration.";2021;4
Introduction Communication skills training for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their carers is recommended best practice. Delivery via telehealth could improve access to this training. This paper focuses on the acceptability of telehealth delivery of communication skills training. Methods A mixed-methods investigation of acceptability of telehealth to people with TBI and their carers was incorporated into a clinical trial. Thirty-six people with TBI (23 metropolitan and 13 regional) and their carers were recruited. Metropolitan participants were randomly allocated to telehealth or in-person intervention at a 1:3 ratio. Regional participants were allocated to telehealth. Telehealth and in-person participants were compared on retention, time to complete the programme, home practice completion and therapeutic alliance ratings. Participants completed semi-structured interviews regarding their views on telehealth, which were analysed using thematic analysis. Results There were no significant differences between telehealth and in-person participants in retention rate, time to complete the programme, degree of home practice completion or therapeutic alliance ratings. Three themes were identified: 'telehealth delivery opens a window for access to rehabilitation in the context of my daily life', 'in-person delivery offers rehabilitation based on natural human interaction' and 'weighing telehealth against in-person delivery'. Discussion Participants found telehealth delivery acceptable, as indicated by the similarity between groups in the quantitative process measures, and as reported in interviews. Some reported a preference for in-person delivery if there had been a choice of delivery mode. Participants described characteristics of the two delivery modes which were relevant to their attitudes towards telehealth.;2021;4
Introduction COVID-19 pandemic radically transformed our daily clinical practice, raising the need not to lose close contact with patients without being able to see them face-to-face. These issues are even more felt and evident in fragile patients, as those affected by neuromuscular disease. An important help came from new digital technologies that allow clinicians to remotely monitor health status and any deterioration of chronically ill patients. Methods In this mini-review, an initiative of the Digital Technologies, Web and Social Media Study Group of the Italian Society of Neurology, we propose to analyze the approach to neuromuscular patients by looking over raising evidence on the main cornerstones of Telemedicine (TM): clinician-patient interaction, remote clinical assessment, remote monitoring, and digital therapeutics. In particular, we explored the strategies developed by researchers and their impact on the physical and emotional status of the patients, with particular focusing on their adherence to the program of virtual monitoring. Results TM plays an important role in each of four stages of approach to neuromuscular disease, having demonstrated validity in keep close clinical patient interaction, clinical assessment, remote monitoring, and telerehabilitation. Nevertheless, there is no remote alternative to electrophysiological testing neither validate tools to assess disability. Conclusion The role of TM in neuromuscular care is yet underestimated but is crucial, beyond the pandemic era. Further development of TM is advisable, through making specific apps, remotely controlled by clinicians, and making more engaging clinicians-patients interaction. Last, it is necessary to ensure adequate internet access to everyone.;2021;4
Introduction Covid-19 has been sweeping over the world for more than a year. People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) might be particularly vulnerable either for the disease iteself or for the ongoing immune treatment. The aim of this review is to understand the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown on patients with MS and to provide evidence-based advice to ensure them a high standard of care even during the pandemic. Areas covered Literature search was conducted in the Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed electronic databases, and articles reference lists to investigate the effect of Covid-19 on MS patients' treatment, access to health-care services and mental-health.The search terms 'multiple sclerosis' AND 'Covid-19' were combined with each of the following term 'disease modifying treatment,' 'steroids,' 'vaccination,' 'mental health,' 'stress,' 'quality of life,' 'management,' 'impact,' 'recommendations,' Expert opinion To ensure MS control during the pandemic, minimizing the risk of Covid-19 contagion, face-to-face visits may be implemented with televisits. Management of relapses and DMTs schedule should be adapted based on the specific benefit/risk ratio for each patient, considering disease activity, disability, comorbidities. Vaccination should be strongly recommended. Telerehabilitation and online psychological support programs should be encouraged to preserve motor performances and mental health.;2021;4
"Introduction Dietary modification and exercise are encouraged to address cardiometabolic risk factors after solid organ transplantation. However, the lived experience of attempting positive lifestyle changes for liver transplant recipients is not known. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of liver transplant recipients and their perspectives of a 12-week telehealth lifestyle programme and assess the feasibility of this innovative health service. Methods Focus groups and one-on-one interviews were conducted with participants who had completed a 12-week, group-based, telehealth-delivered diet and exercise programme and thematic qualitative analysis was used to code and theme the data. Results In total, 19 liver transplant recipients participated in the study (25-68 years, median time since transplant 4.4 years, 63% male). Overarching themes included: (a) 'broad telehealth advantages' which highlighted that telehealth reduced the perceived burdens of face-to-face care; (b) 'impact of employment' which identified employment as a competing priority and appeared to effect involvement with the programme; (c) 'adapting Mediterranean eating pattern to meet individual needs' which identified the adaptability of the Mediterranean diet supported by sessions with the dietitian; (d) 'increasing exercise confidence' which recognised that a tailored approach facilitated confidence and acceptability of the exercise component of the programme. Discussion A telehealth lifestyle programme delivered by dietitians and exercise physiologists is an acceptable alternative to face-to-face care that can meet the needs of liver transplant recipients. There is a need to further innovate and broaden the scope of routine service delivery beyond face-to-face consultations.";2021;4
Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, children with neurodevelopmental disabilities could not attend their usual rehabilitation therapies, with a consequent reduced support of developmental process and risk of worsening of their clinical conditions. Methods We prospectively enrolled 14 children with developmental delay, who had already tried a personalised music therapy (Euterpe method). We included them in a 12-day programme of home-based music therapy. The children and their parents were investigated using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Parent Stress Index-Short Form. Results Fourteen children started the intervention, while only 12 children completed all the planned home sessions and assessments. We observed a significant improvement in children's sleep quality and a reduction of parental distress. Discussion The significant improvements in parental distress and sleep quality must be considered important achievements for the quality of life of a child and their family. Home-based music therapy can provide a feasible approach to improving sleep and parent's stress for children with developmental disorders.;2021;4
Introduction Few studies have reported information related to the cost-effectiveness of traditional face-to-face treatments for aphasia. The emergence and demand for telepractice approaches to aphasia treatment has resulted in an urgent need to understand the costs and cost-benefits of this approach. Methods Eighteen stroke survivors with aphasia completed community-based aphasia telerehabilitation treatment, utilizing the Language-Oriented Treatment (LOT) delivered via Webex videoconferencing program. Marginal benefits to treatment were calculated as the change in Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R) score pre- and post-treatment and marginal cost of treatment was calculated as the relationship between change in WAB-R aphasia quotient (AQ) and the average cost per treatment. Controlling for demographic variables, Bayesian estimation evaluated the primary contributors to WAB-R change and assessed cost-effectiveness of treatment by aphasia type. Results Thirteen out of 18 participants experienced significant improvement in WAB-R AQ following telerehabilitation delivered therapy. Compared to anomic aphasia (reference group), those with conduction aphasia had relatively similar levels of improvement whereas those with Broca's aphasia had smaller improvement. Those with global aphasia had the largest improvement. Each one-point of improvement cost between US$89 and US$864 for those who improved (mean = US$200) depending on aphasia type/severity. Discussion Individuals with severe aphasia may have the greatest gains per unit cost from treatment. Both improvement magnitude and the cost per unit of improvement were driven by aphasia type, severity and race. Economies of scale to aphasia treatment-cost may be minimized by treating a variety of types of aphasia at various levels of severity.;2021;4
Introduction Intensive voice therapy is one of the best evidence-based treatments to improve speech and voice difficulties to individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, accessibility to intensive voice therapy is highly challenging in Malaysia due to the lack of voice specialised speech-language therapists. This study examined the feasibility of using smartphone videoconference to deliver intensive voice therapy to individuals with PD in Malaysia. Methods Intensive voice therapy was delivered to 11 adults with PD using a smartphone videoconference method via WhatsApp Messenger freeware. The therapy consisted of 12 sessions over four weeks and focused on increasing vocal loudness. Outcomes were assessed using objective, perceptual and quality-of-life measures pre and post treatment. Participant satisfaction with the telerehabilitation method was obtained via the Smartphone-Based Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire. Results Significant gains were reported for sound pressure level in sustained vowels and monologue. Perceptual ratings showed significant improvements in overall mean severity and loudness after treatment. Mean scores of speech intelligibility and Voice Handicap Index-10 were significantly better post treatment. Overall, participants were highly satisfied with the smartphone videoconference method. Discussion Present results suggest that the smartphone videoconference method is feasible to deliver intensive voice therapy to individuals with PD to gain better speech and voice functions. Future studies need to address the standardisation of the system protocol to optimise this novel service delivery method in Malaysia.;2021;4
Introduction Mild motor difficulties in children are underdiagnosed despite being highly prevalent, leaving such children often underserved and at higher risk for secondary consequences such as cardiovascular disease and anxiety. Evidence suggests that early patient-oriented interventions, coaching parents and providing children with early stimulation should be provided, even in the absence of a diagnosis. Such interventions may be effectively delivered via telerehabilitation. Methods and analysis A family-centred, pragmatic randomised controlled trial will be carried out to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a Web-based Early intervention for Children using multimodAl REhabilitation (WECARE). Families of children with motor difficulties, 3-8 years of age, living in Quebec, Canada, and receiving no public rehabilitation services (n=118) will be asked to determine up to 12 performance goals, evaluated using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM, the primary outcome). Families will be randomised to receive either usual care or the WECARE intervention. The WECARE intervention will be delivered for 1 year via a web-based platform. Families will have access to videoconferences with an assigned rehabilitation therapist using a collaborative coaching approach, a private chat function, a forum open to all intervention arm participants and online resources pertaining to child development. Participants will be asked to re-evaluate the child's COPM performance goals every 3 months up to 1 year post allocation. The COPM results will be analysed using a mixed Poisson regression model. Secondary outcomes include measures of the child's functional ability, parental knowledge and skills and health-related quality of life, as well as qualitative outcomes pertaining to parental satisfaction and service delivery trajectories. Investigators and quantitative data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. Ethics and dissemination The CIUSSS de l'Estrie-CHUS ethics committee approved this trial (2020-3429). Study results will be communicated via peer-reviewed journal publications, conference presentations and stakeholder-specific knowledge transfer activities.;2021;4
Introduction People living with multiple sclerosis (MS) often require rehabilitation to manage their symptom burden. Telerehabilitation offers improved access to treatment options by reducing travel time and cost. Our telerehabilitation program pairs training exercises simultaneously with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique. In the current study, we characterized the benefits of our remotely supervised tDCS (RS-tDCS) at-home telerehabilitation protocol in an urban sample of MS participants. Methods Participants with MS were recruited to complete a telerehabilitation trial using tDCS paired with cognitive rehabilitation at-home using remote supervision (RS-tDCS). Participant time and travel costs for study visits to our clinic in midtown New York City were calculated. Results Forty-four patients with MS (aged 18 to 71) with mild to severe neurologic disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score median = 3.5, range: 0.0 to 8.0) completed the survey. Round-trip clinic attendance required 2.3 +/- 2.3 h and US $27.04 +/- 38.13 for out-of-pocket expenses. Participants rated difficulty of clinic attendance as moderately to significantly difficult (2.5 +/- 1.3). Severity of neurologic disability accounted for the greatest variance in difficulty attending clinic (30%, p < 0.001). RS-tDCS had 95% treatment compliance and 93% of participants reported satisfaction with the at-home treatment. Discussion Attending clinic is associated with significant costs for patients with neurologic disorders, even in urban settings. Rehabilitation can be delivered at home and supervised in real-time via videoconference.;2021;4
Introduction Remote consulting has exploded into primary care following the initial COVID-19 surge as a measure to reduce potential cross-infection (staff-patient or patient-patient). Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions comprise up to 21% of the annual primary care caseload in England. Established techniques for MSK examination, however, rely on face-to-face attendance. Evidence-based guidance for remote MSK assessment is required to ensure the quality of care is maintained with the move from face-to-face to virtual consultations. Method A literature review of published evidence and current guidelines was conducted. The most appropriate remote consultation techniques and MSK examinations were identified and where there was no evidence, modified examination tests were developed from established face-to-face examination techniques. A concise, accessible framework for remote MSK assessment in primary care was then created and tested on a non-medically trained volunteer. Results Over 2232 papers and articles were identified by search headings, reducing to 28 sources that had relevant content. At the time of searching, there was no published evidence relating to MSK remote consultation in a primary care setting. However, evidence was found in the physiotherapy and rehabilitation literature for the efficacy and practicality of MSK teleconsultation. MSK remote examination framework From this literature and with the addition of modified established examinations, an MSK assessment framework was constructed. This framework provides pre-consultation guidance and step-by-step remote examination instructions. Patient and clinician resources (including a patient information leaflet and photographic examples of examinations) were created as supplementary material. Conclusion Due to the frameshift away from face-to-face consultation, primary care clinicians have found themselves lacking an evidence base or practical guidance to support remote MSK assessment. This paper is a systematic literature review of MSK telemedicine from which practical advice and evidence-based MSK tests have been developed. Where there is no evidence, modified traditional tests are suggested to allow a complete framework for remote MSK examination - using a system approach of 'look, point, move' followed by modified special tests, for use in a primary care setting as a 'ready-to-use' practical guide to remote MSK assessment, presented in a downloadable format. What did this add? With 21% of primary care consultations relating to MSK conditions and limited means of performing face-to-face MSK examination due to COVID-19, there needs to be a recognised framework for assessing the MSK system remotely. To the best of our knowledge, this evidence does not exist for primary care remote MSK examination. This paper demonstrates evidence-based practical advice (from non-primary care settings) and modified MSK examinations to be used in a primary care MSK remote consultation.;2021;4
Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease is a systemic progressive inflammatory autoimmune disorder. Elderly-onset RA can be assumed as a benign form of RA. Until recently, face-to-face therapeutic sessions between health professionals and patients are usually the method of its treatment. However, during pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), teletherapeutic sessions can extensively increase the patient safety especially in elderly patients who are more vulnerable to these infections. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate a novel teletherapy approach for management of elderly patients suffering from RA by utilizing laser acupuncture. Methods A teletherapy system was used for management of elderly patients suffering from RA. Sixty participants were allocated randomly into two groups and the ratio was 1:1. Patients in the first group were treated with laser acupuncture and telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Patients in the second group received telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual reality training. Evaluation of patients was done by using the Health Assessment questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) questionnaire, and the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). Results A statistically significant difference was found in CRP, RAQoL, IL-6 and MDA between the pre- and post-treatments in the first group (p < 0.05) favouring the post-treatment group, while the HAQ showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatments (p < 0.05) in both groups. Statistically significant post-treatment differences were also observed between the two groups (p < 0.05) in RAQoL, CRP, ATP and MDA, favouring the first group. Discussion Laser acupuncture teletherapy could be suggested as a reliable treatment method for elderly patients suffering from RA, as it can provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach. Teletherapy provided safer access to health professionals and patients while giving a high patient satisfaction value with a relatively lower cost (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04684693).;2021;4
"Introduction Sustaining a stroke has a devastating, long-term impact on participation in everyday life. Despite the recognition of participation as a key outcome of stroke rehabilitation, there are few effective interventions that address participation. Occupational performance coaching is a promising intervention designed to improve participation among stroke survivors. Delivery of occupational performance coaching using telerehabilitation could improve access. This study examined the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of telerehabilitation occupational performance coaching. Method A single-case experimental design was used. Six community-dwelling stroke survivors received 10 sessions of telerehabilitation occupational performance coaching over 16 weeks. We examined the feasibility and acceptability of telerehabilitation occupational performance coaching, improvement in performance and satisfaction with identified goals. Results Telerehabilitation occupational performance coaching was feasible and acceptable to deliver; participants who started the intervention completed it and reported high satisfaction and a strong therapeutic relationship. All participants experienced technological issues that required resolution. Goal-performance and/or satisfaction improved for five of six participants. Sixty-four percent of goals showed trends for improvement and 43% showed significant improvements. Conclusions Findings support the feasibility and acceptability of telerehabilitation occupational performance coaching, along with its efficacy for improving performance and satisfaction with performance of goals. Further research is needed to prove the effectiveness of telerehabilitation occupational performance coaching and to determine who may benefit most.";2021;4
"Introduction Telemedicine is an effective, emerging interface to connect practitioners with patients. It facilitates access to healthcare expertise, reduces costs, time demands and health disparities while improving satisfaction. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility, effectiveness and patient satisfaction of telerehabilitation for thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) arthroplasty and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA). Methods This prospective investigation was performed at a single academic institution with two hand and upper extremity fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons. All patients undergoing CMC arthroplasty or rTSA were eligible for inclusion. Telerehabilitation was delivered by a hybrid model including an in-person post-operative visit, followed by alternating in-clinic and virtual videoconference visits. All patients were offered participation in the study arm; those that preferred in-person therapy were included as a control group. Therapy was initiated two weeks post-operative with an in-clinic evaluation. Patients then participated in alternating in-clinic and virtual visits weekly for eight weeks, followed by one virtual visit at 14-weeks post-operative and one clinical visit at 16-weeks post-operative. Patient reported and functional outcomes were collected at each visit. Results In the CMC group, 19 study and 11 control patients were enrolled. In the rTSA group, five study and 14 control patients were enrolled. No statistically significant differences between telerehabilitation and control for range-of-motion, pain and patient-reported functional outcomes was noted. All patients in the telerehabilitation arms reported high satisfaction. Discussion Utilizing telehealth in rehabilitation may be a viable option in upper extremity recovery. We hope this pilot programme can be a model for development of future telerehabilitation programmes.";2021;4
Introduction Telerehabilitation (TR) may be useful for rehabilitation therapy after stroke. However, stroke is a heterogeneous condition, and not all patients can be expected to derive the same benefit from TR, underscoring the need to identify predictors of response to TR. Methods A prior trial provided patients with 6 weeks of intensive rehabilitation therapy targeting arm movement, randomly assigned to be provided in the home via TR (current focus) or in clinic. Eligible patients had moderate arm motor deficits and were in the subacute-chronic stage post stroke. Behavioral gains were measured as change in the arm motor Fugl-Meyer score from baseline to 30 days post therapy. To delineate predictors of TR response, multivariable linear regression was performed, advancing the most significant predictor from each of eight categories: patient demographics, stroke characteristics, medical history, rehabilitation therapy outside of study procedures, motivation, sensorimotor impairment, cognitive/affective deficits, and functional status. Results The primary focus was on patients starting TR >90 days post stroke onset (n = 44), among whom female sex, less spasticity, and less visual field defects predicted greater motor gains. This model explained 39.3% of the variance in treatment-related gains. In secondary analysis that also included TR patients enrolled <= 90 days post stroke (total n = 59), only female sex was a predictor of treatment gains. A separate secondary analysis examined patients >90 days post stroke (n = 34) randomized to in-clinic therapy, among whom starting therapy earlier post stroke and less ataxia predicted greater motor gains. Discussion Response to TR varies across patients, emphasizing the need to identify characteristics that predict treatment-related behavioral gain. The current study highlights factors that might be important to patient selection for home-based TR after stroke.;2021;4
Introduction The aim of the present review is to track the evolution of wearable IMUs from their use in supervised laboratory- and ambulatory-based settings to their application for long-term monitoring of human movement in unsupervised naturalistic settings. Areas covered Four main emerging areas of application were identified and synthesized, namely, mobile health solutions (specifically, for the assessment of frailty, risk of falls, chronic neurological diseases, and for the monitoring and promotion of active living), occupational ergonomics, rehabilitation and telerehabilitation, and cognitive assessment. Findings from recent scientific literature in each of these areas was synthesized from an applied and/or clinical perspective with the purpose of providing clinical researchers and practitioners with practical guidance on contemporary uses of inertial sensors in applied clinical settings. Expert Opinion IMU-based wearable devices have undergone a rapid transition from use in laboratory-based clinical practice to unsupervised, applied settings. Successful use of wearable inertial sensing for assessing mobility, motor performance and movement disorders in applied settings will rely also on machine learning algorithms for managing the vast amounts of data generated by these sensors for extracting information that is both clinically relevant and interpretable by practitioners.;2021;4
Introduction The aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of a novel tele-rehabilitation system on self-reported functional outcomes compared to usual care during the first three months after stroke. Methods A parallel, two-arm, evaluator-blinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Adults aged >= 40 years who had suffered a stroke within four weeks of the start of the study were recruited from the general community. The intervention group received access to a novel tele-rehabilitation system and programme for three months. The primary outcome measures utilised were the frequency and limitation total scores of the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) at three months. Results A total of 124 individuals were recruited. The mean differences in the LLDFI frequency and limitation total scores at three months comparing the intervention and control groups were -3.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) -7.81 to 1.21) and -6.90 (95% CI -15.02 to 1.22), respectively. Adjusting for the respective baseline covariates and baseline Barthel Index also showed no significant difference between interventions in the LLFDI outcomes. Discussion The intervention and control groups self-reported similar improvements in functional outcomes. Tele-rehabilitation may be a viable option to provide post-stroke rehabilitation services in Singapore while reducing barriers to continue rehabilitation conventionally after discharge from hospital and encouraging more participation.;2021;4
Introduction The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the available evidence on the effectiveness of internet-based telerehabilitation among patients after total joint arthroplasty regarding pain, range of motion, physical function, health-related quality of life, satisfaction, and psychological well-being. Methods This was a systematic review with meta-analysis based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions guidelines. Studies published in English or Chinese were searched using defined search periods, databases, and search terms. Two reviewers assessed independently the quality of studies. RevMan 5.3 was used for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi(2) and I-2 statistic. A random effect model and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was adopted. Standardised mean difference (SMD) was used if the outcome was measured by different scales. Results Eleven studies with 1020 participants were analysed. Compared to face-to-face rehabilitation, internet-based telerehabilitation showed no significant difference in outcomes of pain (SMD-0.11, 95% CI-0.32 to 0.10), range of motion in flexion (MD 0.65, 95% CI-1.18 to 2.48) and extension (MD-0.38, 95% CI-1.16 to 0.40), patient-reported physical function (SMD 0.01, 95% CI-0.15 to 0.17), health-related quality of life (SMD-0.09, 95% CI-0.26 to 0.07), satisfaction (SMD-0.04, 95% CI-0.21 to 0.14), and psychological well-being (SMD 0.10, 95% CI-0.13 to 0.33). Internet-based telerehabilitation showed better outcomes in physical functional tests (SMD-0.54, 95% CI-1.08 to-0.01). Discussion This review suggests that internet-based telerehabilitation has comparable effectiveness to face-to-face rehabilitation on rehabilitation outcomes among patients after total joint arthroplasty.;2021;4
Introduction The aim of this study was to assess the acute and sustained effects of a six-month heart-rate-based telerehabilitation programme, following the completion of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), on peak oxygen uptake (peakVO(2)), quality of life (QoL), cardiovascular risk factors and care utilisation in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods A total of 122 patients with CAD were randomised, after the completion of CR, to an intervention group with six months of telemonitoring and telecoaching (TELE) or a control group with a traditional six-month follow-up programme with monthly calls (CON). The primary outcome was peakVO(2) at 12 months, to assess the sustained effects of TELE. The secondary outcomes included QoL, cardiovascular risk factors (lipid spectrum), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and habitual physical activity. Results PeakVO(2) increased significantly from baseline to 12 months in TELE (+2.5 mL center dot kg(-1)min(-1) (95% CI 1.5-3.2)) and CON (+1.9 mL center dot kg(-1)min(-1) (95% CI 1.0-2.5)), and did not differ between groups (P = 0.28). Similarly, QoL (P = 0.31), total cholesterol (P = 0.45), MACE (P = 0.86) did not differ between groups and in time. Discussion Extending CR with a heart-rate-based telerehabilitation programme did not yield additional sustainable health benefits compared with regular care with monthly telephone calls. These observations highlight that both telerehabilitation and regular care with monthly telephone calls may prevent the typically observed reductions in peakVO(2) following the completion of a CR programme.Trial registration: Dutch Trial Register NL4140 (registered 6 December 2014);2021;4
Introduction The aim of this study was to determine the concurrent validity and reliability of telerehabilitation (TR)-based evaluation of the cervical spine among adults with non-specific neck pain (NS-NP). Methods A total of 11 participants with NS-NP were recruited. Pain intensity, active range of motion (AROM), posture, deep neck flexor (DNF) endurance, combined neck movements and disability were measured using face-to-face and TR methods, with a one-hour break in between. TelePTsys, an image-based TR system, was used for TR assessment. Results A high degree of concurrent validity for pain (bias = 0.90), posture (bias = 0.96 degrees), endurance (bias = -2.3 seconds), disability (bias = 0.10), AROM (extension bias = -0.60 cm, flexion bias = 1.2 cm, side flexion bias = -1.00, rotation bias = -0.30 cm) was found. Standard error of measurement and coefficient of variation (CV) values were within the acceptable level for concurrent validity, except the CV for cervical flexion and endurance. There was a high degree of reliability demonstrated for pain, posture, AROM, endurance and disability measurements. The average-measure interclass correlation coefficient (ICC(3,1)) ranged from 0.96 to 0.99 for inter-rater, and 0.93 to 0.99 for intra-rater reliabilities. There was moderate agreement for combination movement for validity (78.5%, p < 0.05), inter- (78.5%, p < 0.05) and intra-rater (76.4%, p < 0.05) reliabilities. Discussion TR-based physiotherapy assessment of cervical spine is a valid and reliable tool for measuring pain intensity, AROM, DNF muscle endurance, sagittal neck posture and disability among adults with NS-NP via telePTsys.;2021;4
Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could cause physical and psychological dysfunction in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. Pulmonary telerehabilitation is strongly recommended due to the contagious nature of the disease, but its efficacy and benefit need to be comprehensively evaluated. Methods An 8-week pulmonary telerehabilitation programme is designed in a real-world and prospective manner, aiming to assess the efficacy of remote rehabilitation among discharged patients with COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in the epicenter of China (Wuhan City). The telerehabilitation programme includes physicians and physiotherapists remotely guided training (online) for 2 weeks, and patient self-managed rehabilitation (offline) for 6 weeks with assistance of information technology and digital device. The main rehabilitation intervention includes breathing exercise, respiratory muscle training, aerobic exercise, and resistance training. The primary outcome is 6-min walk distance, and secondly pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, physical activity, symptom, psychological status and quality of life, etc. will also be assessed. Patients will be followed up periodically at week two, four, eight after enrolment and at month one, three, six and 12 after the rehabilitation accomplished, respectively. Current study has been approved by the ethics committee of China-Japan Friendship Hospital and three participating centers in Wuhan City. Discussion We anticipate that the health status of discharged patients with COVID-19 could be improved through this systemic pulmonary telerehabilitation programme. The interdisciplinary remote mode of rehabilitation could be an optimal way in management of emerging respiratory tract infectious disease. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04368793.;2021;4
Introduction The pandemic has implemented the need for new digital technologies as useful tools during the emergency and the long recovery phase that will follow. SARS-CoV-2 has strongly impacted stroke care with significant contraction in a number of patients treated. Methods This mini-review is an initiative of the Digital Technologies, Web and Social Media Study Group of the Italian Society of Neurology and briefly discusses digital tools for managing the acute phase and the rehabilitation after stroke, even considering the new apps that will improve the process of remote monitoring of patients after discharge at home. Results Telemedicine and digital technologies could play a role in each of the three stroke-belt stages: hyperacute treatment and reperfusion, acute care, etiological classification and secondary prevention and rehabilitation. Conclusion The global emergency represented by the COVID-19 pandemic can be the stimulus to accelerate the digitalization process in the field of stroke for the use of new methods on a large scale.;2021;4
Introduction The purpose of this study is to show the non-inferiority of the telemedicine therapy versus face-to-face using the exercise therapy of oropharyngeal muscles in 183 patients treated consecutively from 2010 to 2020. Method We conducted a retrospective study comparing two dysphagia treatment groups: online versus face-to-face. Patients were distributed in a non-random way but according to patient's preferences. All patients followed the same pathway and were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study using the dysphagia outcome and severity scale and the functional oral intake scale. A non-inferiority analysis approximation was done with delta = 1 in both variables. Results Within a total of 183 patients, 114 (62.3%) used the online treatment and 69 (37.7%) the face-to-face one. The main cause of dysphagia was neurological in the total sample (60.7%) and within both groups. When we evaluate the clinical response, we find that both groups improved regardless of the type of therapy. The confidence interval of the difference between the beginning and the end of treatment did not reach the inferior limit of the delta defined, therefore supporting the no inferiority of online versus presential. Discussion This study shows the no inferiority of the online therapy versus the face-to-face one for the oropharyngeal training of the swallow muscles.;2021;4
Introduction The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a telehealth intervention combining computerised cognitive training and occupation-based treatment among adult cancer survivors experiencing cancer-related cognitive impairment. Method This was a single-arm study including six cancer survivors with cancer-related cognitive impairment. Participants completed the computerised retraining and functional treatment intervention consisting of 10 hours of computerised cognitive training (BrainHQ) and approximately 10 1:1 remote sessions with an occupational therapist using an occupation-based approach. Feasibility was measured in terms of recruitment, adherence, acceptability and potential effectiveness. Assessments were administered at baseline, post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up and included measures of occupational performance, objective cognitive functions, quality of life and mood questionnaires. Results From the nine participants enrolled in the study, six completed 8-13 weeks of computerised retraining and functional treatment intervention and reported high satisfaction levels. Positive and significant improvements were found in occupational performance, useful field of view and social quality of life (all P < 0.05). The positive gains were maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Conclusion A combined model of computerised cognitive training and occupation-based treatment delivered remotely to adults with cancer-related cognitive impairment was found feasible and may improve occupational performance, cognitive functions and quality of life.;2021;4
Introduction The use of telemedicine in orthopaedics can provide high-quality orthopaedic services to patients in remote areas. Tele-orthopaedics is widely acknowledged for decreasing travel, time and cost, increasing accessibility and quality of care. In the absence of a comprehensive review on tele-orthopaedics applications and services, here, we systematically identify and classify the tele-orthopaedic applications and services and provide an overview of the trends in the field. Methods In this study, a systematic mapping was conducted to answer six research questions, we searched the databases Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Digital Library and Web of Science up to 2019. Consequently, 77 papers were screened and selected on the basis of specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results We found that mobile-based teleconsultation was mostly asynchronous, while non-mobile teleconsultation was synchronous. The results showed that the physician-patient relationship was more common than other interactions, such as physician-physician and physician-robot interactions. In addition, more than half of the services provided by tele-orthopaedics have been used for orthopaedic diseases/traumas in which joint replacement and fracture reduction have been the most important orthopaedic procedures. It has been noted that more attention has been paid to tele-orthopaedics in developed countries such as the USA, Australia, Canada and Finland. Discussion Telemonitoring (teleconsultation and telemetry) and telesurgery (telerobotics and telementoring) were found to be the two major forms of tele-orthopaedics. Mobile phones were used asynchronously in most of the teleconsultations. The development of different applications may result in the use of multiple smartphones applications in real-time teleconsultation. The use of smartphones is expected to increase in the near future.;2021;4
Introduction This study aimed to investigate the effects of a home-based occupational therapy telerehabilitation (TR) via smartphone in enhancing functional and motor performance and fall efficacy for outpatients receiving day hospital rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery in Hong Kong. Methods This was a feasibility randomised controlled trial with two groups - an experimental group and a comparison group - and a sample of 31 older adults attending a geriatric day hospital who had undergone hip fracture surgery within 12 weeks of diagnosis. Patients were assessed at baseline, immediately after a three-week intervention and at three-week post-intervention follow-up for motor performance, activities of daily living (ADL) functioning and fall efficacy. The experimental group received a home programme using the Caspar Health e-system and a mobile app for smartphones, while the comparison group received paper-and-pencil instructions for the home programme on a weekly basis for three weeks. Results Compared to the comparison group, significant improvements in fall efficacy and instrumental ADL performance at post intervention and follow-up were found in the experimental group. However, in the comparison group, inadequate social support was a factor contributing to better muscle strength testing in both the affected and non-affected legs. There were no significant differences between the two groups in regard to the other variables. Discussion This study supports the potential use of TR via smartphone as an alternative home programme for use in occupational therapy practice with older adults after hip fracture surgery.;2021;4
"Introduction. Learning disabilities are due to genetic and/or neurobiological factors that alter brain functioning by affecting one or more cognitive processes related to learning. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of cognitive telerehabilitation in adolescents with learning disabilities to overcome the treatment problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Methods. Twenty-four patients diagnosed with Unspecified Learning Disability (mean +/- SD age: 18.2 +/- 2.9 years; 50% male) were enrolled in this study. The patients were assessed by a neuropsychological evaluation at the beginning and at the end of the program. All patients received cognitive treatment via a specific telehealth app to stimulate the cognitive skills related to learning. The treatment lasted four weeks, with a daily training (lasting up to 60 min), for five days a week. Results. Our young patients reported a statistically significant improvement in the main cognitive domains that are usually compromised in learning disabilities, including sustained and selective attention, shifting of attention, control of interference, memory and speed of information processing. Moreover, the patients showed a good usability and motivation during the training. Conclusions. Our study has shown that telerehabilitation could be a valid tool for the rehabilitation of specific cognitive skills in adolescents with learning difficulties.";2021;4
"Introduction: High doses of activity-based rehabilitation therapy improve outcomes after stroke, but many patients do not receive this for various reasons such as poor access, transportation difficulties, and low compliance. Home-based telerehabilitation (TR) can address these issues. The current study evaluated the feasibility of an expanded TR program. Methods: Under the supervision of a licensed therapist, adults with stroke and limb weakness received home-based TR (1 h/day, 6 days/week) delivered using games and exercises. New features examined include extending therapy to 12 weeks duration, treating both arm and leg motor deficits, patient assessments performed with no therapist supervision, adding sensors to real objects, ingesting a daily experimental (placebo) pill, and generating automated actionable reports. Results: Enrollees (n = 13) were median age 61 (IQR 52-65.5), and 129 (52-486) days post-stroke. Patients initiated therapy on 79.9% of assigned days and completed therapy on 65.7% of days; median therapy dose was 50.4 (33.3-56.7) h. Non-compliance doubled during weeks 7-12. Modified Rankin scores improved in 6/13 patients, 3 of whom were >3 months post-stroke. Fugl-Meyer motor scores increased by 6 (2.5-12.5) points in the arm and 1 (-0.5 to 5) point in the leg. Assessments spanning numerous dimensions of stroke outcomes were successfully implemented; some, including a weekly measure that documented a decline in fatigue (p = 0.004), were successfully scored without therapist supervision. Using data from an attached sensor, real objects could be used to drive game play. The experimental pill was taken on 90.9% of therapy days. Automatic actionable reports reliably notified study personnel when critical values were reached. Conclusions: Several new features performed well, and useful insights were obtained for those that did not. A home-based telehealth system supports a holistic approach to rehabilitation care, including intensive rehabilitation therapy, secondary stroke prevention, screening for complications of stroke, and daily ingestion of a pill. This feasibility study informs future efforts to expand stroke TR.";2021;4
"Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease involving a progressive alteration of the motor and non-motor function. PD influences the patient's daily living and reduces participation and quality of life in all phases of the disease. Early physical exercise can mitigate the effects of symptoms but access to specialist care is difficult. With current technological progress, telemedicine, and telerehabilitation is now a viable option for managing patients, although few studies have investigated the use of telerehabilitation in PD. In this systematic review, was investigated whether telerehabilitation leads to improvements in global or specific motor tasks (gait and balance, hand function) and non-motor dysfunction (motor speech disorder, dysphagia). The impact of TR on quality of life and patient satisfaction, were also assessed. The usage of telerehabilitation technologies in the management of cognitive impairment was not addressed.</p> & nbsp;</p> Method: An electronic database search was performed using the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, COCHRANE Library, PEDro, and SCOPUS for data published between January 2005 and December 2019 on the effects of telerehabilitation systems in managing motor and non-motor symptoms. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guideline and was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020141300).</p> & nbsp;</p> Results: A total of 15 articles involving 421 patients affected by PD were analyzed. The articles were divided into two categories based on their topic of interest or outcome. The first category consisted of the effects of telerehabilitation on gait and balance (3), dexterity of the upper limbs (3), and bradykinesia (0); the second category regarded non-motor symptoms such as speech disorders (8) and dysphagia (0). Quality of life (7) and patient satisfaction (8) following telerehabilitation programs were also analyzed, as well as feasibility and costs.</p> & nbsp;</p> Conclusion: Telerehabilitation is feasible in people affected by PD. Our analysis of the available data highlighted that telerehabilitation systems are effective in maintaining and/or improving some clinical and non-clinical aspects of PD (balance and gait, speech and voice, quality of life, patient satisfaction).</p> Systematic Review Registration: , identifier: CRD42020141300.</p>";2021;4
"Introduction: Physical rehabilitation for total hip replacement patients following hospital discharge is beneficial; however, accessing rehabilitation is often challenging. Telerehabilitation helps negate access issues and is efficacious in total knee and hip replacement patients. This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of a telerehabilitation programme delivered remotely into patients' homes versus traditional care for total hip replacement patients following hospital discharge. Methods: A cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) analysis was conducted from the perspective of a health service alongside a two-arm randomised controlled trial comparing telerehabilitation (n=35) with in-person care (n=35) following hospital discharge after total hip replacement. The primary analysis used an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio to compare the cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) accrued in the telerehabilitation group versus in-person control using costs and effects data from the randomised trial. A secondary analysis was conducted whereby the time accrued by patients attending rehabilitation sessions (including travel time) was considered the cost (i.e. a time burden), rather than cost from the health service perspective. Results: Estimated mean differences in healthcare costs and QALYs gained were detected but were not significant. The estimated mean (95%CI) difference in cost of telerehabilitation versus in-person was -$28.90 (-$96.37 to $40.45), favouring the telerehabilitation group. The estimated mean (95%CI) difference in QALYs gained from telerehabilitation versus in-person was -0.0025 (-0.0227 to 0.0217). The estimated mean (95%CI) difference in time burden favoured less time burden for the telerehabilitation group (-4.21 (-4.69 to -3.74) hours). Discussion: Telerehabilitation in the total hip replacement population incurred similar costs and yielded similar effects to traditional in-person care. Telerehabilitation significantly reduced the time burden for patients and carers. These findings are valuable for healthcare providers seeking to implement accessible patient-centred rehabilitation services.";2021;4
Introduction: Pre-pandemic, telepractice was not globally implemented despite its effectiveness. Clinicians reported challenges related to technology, confidence, and inadequate resources. Objectives: To document global telepractice, identify current obstacles and measure the impact of a possible solution. The timing of this research facilitated tracking telepractice changes during the pandemic. Methods: Two surveys measured practitioners' experience and attitude towards telepractice. Survey 1 was completed in February-March 2020. Participants then received two specialized lesson kits to trial if desired. Survey 2 was a follow-up after 4-6 weeks. Results: Between surveys, the proportion of participants providing telepractice increased from 47.6% to 91.7%. The lesson kits were trialled by 74.3%. Their use had a positive impact on three of the top five factors affecting the delivery oftetepractice: parent coaching, clinician experience and accessing resources. Conclusion: Telepractice was rapidly adopted globally during the pandemic. The specialized resources were helpful in overcoming some of the barriers to delivery.;2021;4
Introduction: Research suggests the need for further studies of patients' experiences of cardiac tele-rehabilitation to understand how they adapt to life with heart disease in a program with long-distance contact, remote supervision and monitoring of health behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore patients' experiences of tele-rehabilitation and the perceived gains of taking part in the program. Materials and methods: Seven patients were interviewed using a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach. Interview transcripts were analyzed as narratives using the interpretation theory of the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur. This involves three levels of textual analysis: a naive reading as the first interpretation followed by a structural analysis, where the text is explored in detail, before identifying the most significant interpretation through critical interpretation. Results: Patients valued cardiac tele-rehabilitation because it was not restricted to the hospital setting. They felt that the program's flexibility was an advantage because the program could be adjusted to their daily lives. The patients showed greater acknowledgement of and commitment towards the rehabilitation interventions if they were consistent with the patients' self-image, and if the activities were already part of their daily lives. If they were not, they were experienced as an extra challenge. Conclusions: Understanding patients' self-image and prior lifestyle may better inform clinicians about why it can be difficult for patients to follow rehabilitation recommendations. Therefore, clinicians may need to focus more on these two factors to help patients adapt to life with heart disease.;2021;4
"Introduction: Telehealth is an increasingly common approach to improve healthcare delivery, especially within the Veterans Health Administration and Department of Defense (DoD). Telehealth has diminished many challenges to direct access for clinical follow-up; however, the use of mobile telehealth for specialty rehabilitative care is emerging and is referred to as telerehabilitation. As early adopters of telehealth, the Veterans Affairs and DoD have supported collaborated efforts for programs designed to increase the access and quality of rehabilitative care while improving the functional ability of our service members (SMs) and veterans with lower limb amputation (LLA). The DoD and Veterans Health Administration collaborated on a Mobile Device Outcomes-based Rehabilitation Program (MDORP) to help injured SMs and veterans with LLA. The MDORP project utilized a mobile health system called the Rehabilitative Lower Limb Orthopedic Accommodating Device (ReLOAD) to assess walking quality. The ReLOAD system includes real-time auditory biofeedback to notify the user of their most prominent gait deviation and then recommends exercises that address specific balance and strength impairments. The purpose of this study was to describe the responses to a postintervention survey evaluating the feasibility and usability of ReLOAD completed by SMs and veterans with LLA who used the system for 5 months. Materials and Methods: A link to an anonymous usability survey was emailed to all participants who completed MDORP. The survey was modeled after the System Usability Scale, with agreeableness to items rated on a 5-point Likert-style questionnaire in addition to open feedback. Data visualization of Likert-style questionnaires was conducted using ggplot2 and reshape2 statistical packages and was analyzed using R. We obtained institutional review board approval through both Miami Veterans Affairs Healthcare System and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Results: The majority of participants reported that they would use the system again for home rehabilitation (65%) and that auditory biofeedback helped them walk better (59%). Participants also suggested that future work should include a greater variety of exercise options and the use of smart phones for the ReLOAD application in addition to the iPad tablet. Conclusions: The participants provided positive and constructive feedback that will enhance the value and usability of telerehabilitation interventions like the ReLOAD system for future users.";2021;4
Introduction: Telemedical video consultations are a powerful support for patient-doctor interactions. For optimal digital settings, explanatory illustrations may be helpful for patients. This study analyzed patients' the attitude of patients to illustrations preparing for an orthopedic telemedical consultation (OTC).</p> Methods: A leaflet with eight illustrations was designed and their acceptance and estimated necessity was evaluated among patients who had experienced an OTC (EXP-group) and others who had not (NOV-group) with a 12-item-questionnaire.</p> Results: Sixty patients participated (n = 30 each group). All illustrations were evaluated positively. The EXP-group gave significantly higher ratings than the NOV-group for improved understanding by the given keywords of the illustrations (p = 0.046), preference for being informed by illustrations than by merely by a pure text (p = 0.023), better feeling of preparation for an OTC by the illustrations (p = 0.005), and the impression of a simplified process of the OTC by the illustrations (p = 0.012).</p> Discussion: While the illustrations were well-accepted by the participants, significant differences were revealed between the valuation of single aspects by patients, depending on a previous experience with an OTC. Therefore, a leaflet with explanatory illustrations may be helpful in preparing patients for an OTC to support the digital patient-doctor contact.</p>;2021;4
"Introduction: The Brazilian Council of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy regulated the use of teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating uncertainty about its use in Brazil. Objective: To describe the experience of teleconsultations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Four patients participated in the study with the following diagnoses: Parkinson's disease, stroke, peripheral facial paralysis, and tibial plateau fracture. Patients underwent Lip to 10 physiotherapy sessions via digital tools. The 5-A self-management tool (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange) guided the sessions. Results: The teleconsultation type varied between synchronous (n = 1; 25%); asynchronous (n = 2; 50%) and synchronous/asynchronous (n = 1; 25%). There was 75% (n = 3) adherence and one withdrawal (25%). As the benefits of teleconsultations, the patients pointed out the convenience, maintenance of the exercises, and contact with the professional. The reported limitations were the lack of the use of physiotherapeutic devices. Conclusion: Teleconsultations contribute to the continuity of physiotherapy treatment during social isolation. Adherence to treatment was facilitated by access to the technology and by offering patients the choice of teleconsultation type.";2021;4
Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered transformative changes in how clinicians interact with patients. There has been a shift toward virtual consultations. The evidence to support this change in practice is unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically review the evidence base for virtual consultations for orthopedics. Materials and Methods: Two independent reviewers performed a literature search based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, utilizing the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases. Only studies reporting outcomes following the use of telemedicine for diagnosis, consultation, rehabilitation, and follow-up were included. Outcomes analyzed were: (1) patient and clinician satisfaction, (2) clinical outcome measures, and (3) cost analysis of traditional versus teleconsultation. Results: A total of 41 studies were included. Fifteen studies compared clinical outcomes of telemedicine against a matched traditional cohort. Of these 15 studies, 2 demonstrated noninferiority, 9 showed no statistically significant difference, and 4 found telemedicine to be superior. Eleven studies recorded patient reported outcomes, which demonstrated high patient satisfaction. Nine studies reported decreased costs when telemedicine was compared to traditional care. The remaining six studies had varied aims and methodologies that didn't fit well with any of these subheadings. Discussion: While the available evidence is limited, the studies assessed here show that telemedicine can deliver high quality health care with good clinical outcomes and high patient satisfaction in a cost-effective manner. Our team thinks what this has highlighted is that communication technology is advancing rapidly and that we as a community of surgeons need to be able to adapt rapidly and adopt innovative technology to continue to improve patient experience and outcomes.;2021;4
Introduction: The Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia (PrAISED) is delivering an exercise programme for people with dementia. The Lincolnshire partnership National Health Service (NHS) foundation Trust successfully delivered PrAISED through a video-calling platform during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: This qualitative case-study aimed to identify participants that video delivery worked for, to highlight its benefits and its challenges. Interviews were conducted between May and August 2020 with five participants with dementia and their caregivers (n = 10), as well as five therapists from the Lincolnshire partnership NHS foundation Trust. The interviews were analysed through thematic analysis. Results: Video delivery worked best when participants had a supporting caregiver and when therapists showed enthusiasm and had an established rapport with the client. Benefits included time efficiency of sessions, enhancing participants' motivation, caregivers' dementia awareness, and therapists' creativity. Limitations included users' poor IT skills and resources. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic required innovative ways of delivering rehabilitation. This study supports that people with dementia can use tele-rehabilitation, but success is reliant on having a caregiver and an enthusiastic and known therapist.;2021;4
Introduction: There is a need to maintain rehabilitation activities and motivate movement and physical activity during quarantine in individuals with Cerebral Palsy (CP). Objective: This paper sets out to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of using computer serious game in a non-immersive virtual reality (VR) implemented and evaluated completely remotely in participants with CP for Home-Based Telerehabilitation during the quarantine period for COVID-19. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, a total of 44 individuals participated in this study between March and June 2020, 22 of which had CP (14 males and 8 females, mean age = 19 years, ranging between 11 and 28 years) and 22 typically developing individuals, matched by age and sex to the individuals with CP. Participants practiced a coincident timing game(1) and we measured movement performance and physical activity intensity using the rating of perceived exertion Borg scale. Results: All participants were able to engage with the VR therapy remotely, reported enjoying sessions, and improved performance in some practice moments. The most important result in this cross-sectional study was the significant increasing in rating of perceived exertion (through Borg scale) in both groups during practice and with CP presenting a higher rating of perceived exertion. Conclusion: Children with CP enjoyed participating, were able to perform at the same level as their peers on certain activities and increased both their performance and physical activity intensity when using the game, supporting the use of serious games for this group for home therapy and interactive games.;2021;4
Introduction: We present Lil'Flo, a socially assistive robotic telerehabilitation system for deployment in the community. As shortages in rehabilitation professionals increase, especially in rural areas, there is a growing need to deliver care in the communities where patients live, work, learn, and play. Traditional telepresence, while useful, fails to deliver the rich interactions and data needed for motor rehabilitation and assessment. Methods: We designed Lil'Flo, targeted towards pediatric patients with cerebral palsy and brachial plexus injuries using results from prior usability studies. The system combines traditional telepresence and computer vision with a humanoid, who can play games with patients and guide them in a present and engaging way under the supervision of a remote clinician. We surveyed 13 rehabilitation clinicians in a virtual usability test to evaluate the system. Results: The system is more portable, extensible, and cheaper than our prior iteration, with an expressive humanoid. The virtual usability testing shows that clinicians believe Lil'Flo could be deployed in rural and elder care facilities and is more capable of remote stretching, strength building, and motor assessments than traditional video only telepresence. Conclusions: Lil'Flo represents a novel approach to delivering rehabilitation care in the community while maintaining the clinician-patient connection.;2021;4
It is clear already that in current and future years more people will suffer from stroke, whether related to COVID-19 or not, and given its prevalence, many more people's lives will be affected by neglect. Here we hope to have contributed to its possible amelioration with highlights of the latest thinking on neglect diagnosis, prevalence and treatment.;2021;4
Key summary pointsAim To examine the feasibility of conducting videoconferencing telerehabilitation in groups of a geriatric population recently discharged from hospital. Findings Telerehabilitation recently after an acute hospitalisation was not feasible in a geriatric population. Message Aspects such as recruitment procedures and IT solutions designed for older people must be considered in geriatric patients. Purpose Exercise at home and improvement in the ability to undertake daily tasks are highly valued by older people after hospitalisation. New telerehabilitation (TR) technologies make it possible to supervise and communicate with exercising participants through videoconferencing equipment. This technology has been shown to be both feasible and effective in Danish chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in terms of basic mobility, safety, social interactions and patient perception. This study sought to examine whether it was feasible to carry out TR through home exercises in groups. Methods Both medical and hip-fracture home-dwelling patients aged 65 years and older admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) and Department of Geriatrics for acute reasons were asked to participate in the study just before their discharge. The inclusion criteria were normal cognitive function, being dependent on a walking aid and computer users before hospitalisation. Results At discharge, 333 patients were consecutively screened for participation. Of those, 300 patients were excluded. Thirty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. They had a mean age of 82.3 years (+/- 7.8) and 76% were women. Nine patients agreed to participate, but seven withdrew. The most frequent explanation was exhaustion in the continuation of hospitalisation. Conclusion It was not possible to conduct a videoconference TR study in a geriatric population, as many were excluded and those who were eligible withdrew after inclusion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, TR may be an important tool for isolated older persons to hinder functional decline. Aspects such as recruitment procedures and IT solutions designed for older people must be considered.;2021;4
"Many people living with Parkinson's Disease (PD) face issues with healthcare services, including delays in diagnosis and treatment, as well as limited access to specialized care, including rehabilitation programs. Non-motor and motor signs and symptoms typically observed in people with PD, such as tremor, rigidity, postural instability, bradykinesia, and freezing are particularly disabling and have been associated with falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and a worse quality of life. Baduanjin Qigong (BDJ) programs have been proven potentially effective in improving physical outcomes and reducing the incidence of falls in PD. The aim of this case report, proof-of-concept, study was to explore the adherence, feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a BDJ program offered via telerehabilitation in people with PD living in the community. Two participants performed semi-supervised exercise sessions at home, twice a week (over eight weeks) using the TeraPlus platform. Adherence, adverse events, and feasibility (technical implementability), acceptability (patient satisfaction), patient-reported, self-reported, and performance outcomes were measured. Results were based on single-subject descriptive data, minimal detectable change, and anchor-based minimally important difference. Our findings suggest that the intervention seems feasible with no major technical issues or adverse events, and high adherence; acceptable (patient satisfaction); and potentially effective to improve markers of walking performance (gait speed, balance), and quality of life (activities of daily living, mobility).";2021;4
Measurement of joint range of motion is a common measure in the functional evaluation of a patient. This clinical measurement is performed through the use of mechanical goniometry, currently presenting various problems mainly of a human nature. This article introduces ROMCam, an alternative system for measuring joint range of motion, based on estimating the human pose in 2D. For this, use is made of artificial vision libraries and the use of an RGB webcam type camera. The results obtained corroborate the validity of the use of ROMCam as a low cost, accessible tool that can even be used as a resource in telerehabilitation treatments.;2021;4
Mental health disturbances are common after stroke and linked to a slower recovery. Current face-to-face treatment options are costly and often inaccessible. Technology advances have made it possible to overcome some of these barriers to deliver technology-based mental health interventions remotely, but we do not know how acceptable and feasible they are. This systematic review aims to provide an examination of the acceptability and feasibility of technology-based mental health interventions provided to stroke patients and evaluate any barriers to their adoption. A total of 13 studies were included investigating interventions targeting non-specific mental health, depression or anxiety. The delivery technologies were: video conferencing, computer programmes, telephones, DVDs, CDs, robot-assisted devices, and personal digital assistants. Rates of refusal to participate were low (7.9-25%). Where satisfaction was reported, this was generally high. Many studies achieved high levels of adherence (up to 89.6%). This was lower for some technologies (e.g., robotic assistive devices). Where dropout occurred, this was for reasons including a decline in health as well as technical difficulties. Overall, the literature displays early evidence of using technology to deliver mental health interventions to patients with stroke. This review has identified factors that the design of future studies should take into consideration.;2021;4
"More than 5 million patients in the United States are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) annually, and an increasing percentage of patients treated in the ICU survive to hospital discharge. Because these patients require follow-up in the outpatient setting, family physicians should be prepared to provide ongoing care and screening for post-ICU complications. Risk factors for complications after ICU discharge include previous ICU admissions, preexisting mental illness, greater number of comorbidities, and prolonged mechanical ventilation or higher opioid exposure while in the ICU. Early nutritional support and mobilization in the ICU decrease the risk of complications. After ICU discharge, patients should be screened for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and cognitive impairment using standardized screening tools. Physicians should also inquire about weakness, fatigue, neuropathy, and functional impairment and perform a targeted physical examination and laboratory evaluation as indicated; treatment depends on the underlying cause. Exercise regimens are beneficial for reducing several post-ICU complications. Patients who were treated for COVID-19 in the ICU may require additional instruction on reducing the risk of virus transmission. Telemedicine and telerehabilitation allow patients with COVID-19 to receive effective care without increasing exposure risk in communities, hospitals, and medical offices.

Most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis are heterogeneous in their clinical profiles and underlying pathophysiology, although they typically share the presence of cognitive impairment that worsens significantly during the course of the disease. Viable pharmacological options for cognitive symptoms in these clinical conditions are currently lacking. In recent years, several studies have started to apply Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) and Virtual Reality (VR) tools to try and contrast patients' cognitive decay over time. However, no in-depth literature review of the contribution of these promising therapeutic options across main neurodegenerative diseases has been conducted yet. The present paper reports the state-of-the-art of CCT and VR studies targeting cognitive impairment in most common neurodegenerative conditions. Our twofold aim is to point out the scientific evidence available so far and to support health professionals to consider these promising therapeutic tools when planning rehabilitative interventions, especially when the access to regular and frequent hospital consultations is not easy to be provided.;2021;4
Neurological diseases are the most common cause of disability worldwide. In addition to physical limitations, they often lead to cognitive deficits that make active participation in professional and social life difficult. Due to physical and cognitive deficits, it is often difficult for neurological patients to gain access to specialized knowledge or to receive specialized treatment and is associated with greatly increased effort. Neurological diseases account for 11.6% of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, a measure for quantifying disease burden) and 16.5% of deaths, and remain the leading cause of DALYs and the second leading cause of death worldwide. Neurorehabilitation encompasses the goal of reintegrating patients with neurological dysfunctions into everyday life. The ongoing situation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges for the healthcare system. Social distancing and quarantine have deprived many people with neurological disorders of access to routine medical care. The corona pandemic is a catalyst for the widespread use of telemedicine in the field of neurology and neurorehabilitation. Projects such as the Brunei project of the Nordwest Krankenhaus Frankfurt as well as an MS clinic in Canada show that highly specialized medicine and neurorehabilitation can be delivered to remote areas or in the living room of patients or any doctor's office. Telemedical, telerehabilitative and teletherapeutic applications offer the opportunity to supplement and optimize existing care structures and with modern technology to make a new and contemporary interpretation of old-fashioned medical and therapeutic home visits.;2021;4
"No standardized guideline for the reporting of outcomes measures in randomized controlled trials of rehabilitation interventions is currently available. This study includes four phases to identify, synthesize, and make recommendations for potential attributes of reporting criteria of outcome measures in rehabilitation randomized controlled trials. First, we surveyed the author instructions for rehabilitation journals to determine how journals require authors to report outcomes. Second, we reviewed all consolidated standards of reporting trials extensions to determine how other speciality groups require reporting of outcomes in randomized controlled trials. Third, we conducted a focused scoping review to examine the nature and variations of criteria used to evaluate the quality of outcome measures in randomized controlled trials. Finally, we synthesized the information from phases 1-3 and propose four criteria specific to the reporting of outcomes in randomized controlled trials of rehabilitation interventions: (1) clearly describe the construct to be measured as outcome(s); (2) justify the selection of outcome measures by mapping to World Health Organization International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health (International Classification of Functioning) framework; justify the psychometric properties (relevance, validity, reliability) of the selected measurement tool; (3) clearly describe the timing of outcome measurement, with consideration of the health condition, the course of disease, and hypothesized effect of intervention; and (4) complete and unselective reporting of outcome data.";2021;4
Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, forcing changes to health care systems across the globe. COVID-19 outbreak in Qatar has led to the application of preventive measures and cutting of face-to-face outpatient services across Hamad Medical Corporation, the main provider of primary and tertiary health care, aiming to reduce the risk of transmission. The disruption of face-to-face management of patients with cancer and primary lymphedema added to the lack of literature, specifically on its rehabilitation, during such unprecedented crisis and raised the need to quickly modulate our lymphedema outpatient physiotherapy services to ensure the continuity of care. This article describes how our team redesigned its lymphedema management approach through rapid development of online educational treatment resources and implementation of telerehabilitation to patients with lymphedema for the first time in Qatar. Unforeseen challenges were addressed in a 4-phased plan comprising operational, telephonic, virtual, and face-to-face phases, with a descriptive statistical analysis of data and the outpatient activity recorded throughout the phases. Evaluating the efficacy of such program in future research may open up windows for telerehabilitation to become a cornerstone in lymphedema care even after the pandemic.;2021;4
OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has become a global public health emergency affecting 223 countries and territories, and it drastically changed the life of public and health care delivery systems. Although many guide-lines have been proposed to avoid infection from COVID-19 and to promote the use of telerehabilitation. there is still no clear answer for the current scenario and strategies of therapists' practice during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on Occupational Therapists' (OTs) practice. the use of telerehabilitation strategies by OTs, and their employment and mental health. Also, this study aimed to explore the OTs perspective on the role of telerehabilitation during this pandemic lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 2020 and May 2020. RESULTS: 114 OTs completed the survey. The results of this study showed that 52.8% of therapists had stress and anxiety due to COVID-19 lockdown. We found that 60.7% of OTs (n=65) used telerehabilitation, versus 36.1% (n=39) before the lockdown. Telerehabilitation approaches were mostly implemented during this lockdown for children with autistic problems (66.6%), stroke (12.9%), cerebral palsy (6.4%), learning disabilities (9.6%), Parkinson's diseases (1.6%). and other medical conditions (2.8%). 10% of therapists reported that they lost their job, and 76% reported that this lockdown affected their income negatively. Overall. 87.8% of therapists reported that mobile technology was very useful to overcome the stress due to COVID-19 related lockdown, social isolation, and social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown experiences made us rethink the current approach of therapy services into alternative method (mixed mode) delivery of occupational therapy practice, which is including the combined method of video-based (telerehabilitation) consultation and face to face intervention.;2021;4
OBJECTIVE: Patients who have sustained a stroke suffer from residual motor impairments. Stroke can limit their ability to employ their impaired upper limb properly. Hand function is particularly one of the most frequently persisting consequences of stroke. This paper introduces a new portable hand telerehabilitation platform (PHTP) for home-based personalized treatment of stroke patients. The aims of this study are (1) to document the iterative design and development process of the PHTP, and (2) to explore the therapists' perspectives on implementing home-based treatment of stroke patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Local therapists were involved early in designing and developing the PHTP. We collected views of 84 therapists practicing in North America via an online survey. RESULTS: Therapists' perspectives on the introduced prototype support the use of the PHTP to provide home-based telerehabilitation for stroke patients. The System Usability Scale score was 70 for the PHTP, indicating that the platform is usable. The rest of the qualitative results obtained from custom questionnaires showed consistency in the platform design, high perceived usability and good acceptability among the therapists' community. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, the results encourage and support fine-tuning of the PHTP, commercializing it, and conducting prospective clinical studies.;2021;4
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the effects of home-and center-based exercise training programs on functional capacity, inspiratory muscle strength, daily physical activity level, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) over a 12-week period. METHODS: This study included 23 patients with CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction 31 +/- 6%) randomized to a home-based (n=11) or center-based (n=12) program. Patients underwent 12 weeks of aerobic training (60%70% heart rate reserve): walking for the home-based and supervised cycling for the center-based group, both combined with resistance training (50% of 1 maximum repetition). At baseline and after 12 weeks of training, we assessed cardiopulmonary test variables, 6-min walk test distance (6 MWD), steps/day with accelerometry, and QoL (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire). Maximal inspiratory pressure and handgrip strength were measured at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of training. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03615157. RESULTS: There were no adverse events during training in either group. The home- and center-based training groups obtained similar improvements in peak oxygen uptake, maximal ventilation, and 6 MWD. However, there were significant between-group differences: center-based training was more effective in improving maximal inspiratory pressure (p=0.042), number of steps/day (p=0.001), and QoL (p=0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Home-based training is safe and can be an alternative to improve the exercise capacity of patients with stable CHF. However, center-based training was superior in improving inspiratory muscle strength, QoL, and daily physical activity.;2021;4
Objective Action Observation Treatment is a novel rehabilitation approach exploiting a neurophysiological mechanism that allows one to recruit the neural structures sub-serving action execution during the mere observation of those same actions. Action Observation Treatment is effective in the rehabilitation of several neurological diseases. In this pilot study, we used Action Observation Treatment in a telerehabilitation setting in children with Cerebral Palsy. Materials and methods Ten children with Cerebral Palsy, aged 5-12 years, entered the study. They followed the Action Observation Treatment rehabilitation program at home with remote supervision by a child neurologist located at the hospital. Outcome measures were the scores at the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function Scale and the Assisting Hand Assessment. Results Scores obtained after treatment and at a two months' follow-up significantly differed from baseline and overlapped those obtained in randomized controlled studies carried out in a conventional setting. Conclusions Action Observation Treatment is therefore a promising approach that can be used on a large scale in a telerehabilitation setting.;2021;4
Objective After completing formal stroke rehabilitation programs, most patients do not achieve full upper limb motor function recovery. Music-supported Therapy (MST) can improve motor functionality post stroke through musical training. We designed a home-based enriched Music-supported Therapy (eMST) program to provide patients with chronic stroke the opportunity of continuing rehabilitation by themselves. We developed an app to conduct the eMST sessions at home with a MIDI-piano and percussion instruments. Here, we tested the feasibility of the eMST intervention using the novel app. Method This is a pilot study where five patients with chronic stroke underwent a 10-week intervention of 3 sessions per week. Patients answered feasibility questionnaires throughout the intervention to modify aspects of the rehabilitation program and the app according to their feedback. Upper limb motor functions were evaluated pre- and post-intervention as well as speed and force tapping during daily piano performance. Results Patients clinically improved in upper limb motor function achieving the Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) or Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) in most of motor tests. The app received high usability ratings post-intervention. Conclusion The eMST program is a feasible intervention for patients with chronic stroke and its efficacy should be assessed in a clinical trial.;2021;4
Objective Investigate whether exercise-based telerehabilitation improves pain, physical function and quality of life in adults with physical disabilities. Design Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Data sources Searches were performed in AMED, MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Embase, PEDro, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO. Eligibility criteria Trials were considered if they evaluated exercise by telerehabilitation. The population included adults with physical disability. Comparisons were control and other interventions. The outcomes were pain, physical function and quality of life. Study selection, data extraction and analysis followed the protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019122824). GRADE determined the strength of evidence. Results Forty-eight trials were included in the quantitative analysis. When compared with other interventions, there was high-quality evidence that telerehabilitation was not different to other interventions for pain (95% CI: -0.4 to 0.1), physical function (95% CI: -0.2 to 0.2) and quality of life (95% CI: -0.1 to 0.5) at long-term. There was moderate-quality evidence that telerehabilitation was not different to other interventions for physical function (95% CI: -0.1 to 0.5) and quality of life (95% CI: -0.2 to 0.5) at short-term. However, due to the low-quality evidence and the small number of trials comparing exercise protocols offered by telerehabilitation with control groups, it is still not possible to state the efficacy of telerehabilitation on pain, function and quality of life at short-term and long-term. Conclusions Exercise by telerehabilitation may be an alternative to treat pain, physical function and quality of life in adults with physical disabilities when compared with other intervention.;2021;4
Objective Many unmet rehabilitation needs of patients with stroke can be addressed effectively using technology. However, technological solutions have not yet been seamlessly incorporated into clinical care. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine how to bridge the gaps between the recovery process, technology, and clinical practice to impact stroke rehabilitation meaningfully. Design Semistructured interviews were performed using a grounded theory approach with purposive sampling of 17 diverse expert providers in acute care, inpatient, and outpatient stroke rehabilitation settings. Common themes were identified from qualitative analyses of the transcribed conversations to develop a guiding framework from the emerging concepts. Results Four core themes emerged that addressed major barriers in stroke rehabilitation and technology-assisted solutions to overcome these barriers: (1) accessibility to quality rehabilitation, (2) adaptability to patient differences, (3) accountability or compliance with rehabilitation, and (4) engagement with rehabilitation. Conclusions The results suggest a four-pronged framework, the A3E framework that stands for Accessibility, Adaptability, Accountability, and Engagement, to comprehensively address existing barriers in providing rehabilitation services. This framework can guide technology developers and clinicians in designing and deploying technology-assisted rehabilitation solutions for poststroke rehabilitation, particularly using telerehabilitation.;2021;4
Objective Telehealth platforms have potential utility for providing remote access to supportive care to people with brain tumour. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of delivering supportive care via telehealth platforms to adults with primary brain tumour and family caregivers. Methods A systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library was conducted from 1980 to 1st June 2020 to identify eligible studies. Methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. Results Seventeen articles, reporting on 16 studies, evaluated telephone-based support (5 studies), videoconferencing (3 studies), web-based programs and resources (7 studies) or combined use of videoconferencing and web-based modules (1 study) to deliver supportive care remotely. Caregivers were involved in 31% of interventions. Mean rates of accrual (68%) and adherence (74%) were moderate, whereas acceptability or satisfaction for those completing the interventions was typically high (Msatisfied or very satisfied = 81%). Adherence rates were generally higher and clinical gains were more evident for interventions involving real-time interaction as opposed to self-guided interventions. Conclusions Telehealth delivery of supportive care is feasible and acceptable to a high proportion of individuals with primary brain tumour and their caregivers. It is recommended that future research focuses on implementation outcomes, including factors influencing the uptake and sustainability of telehealth platforms in practice.;2021;4
"Objective To evaluate the evidence of effectiveness of exergame-based rehabilitative interventions on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in persons with chronic diseases. Type Systematic review and meta-analysis. Literature survey Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials of exergame rehabilitation interventions in populations with chronic diseases reporting HRQoL outcomes were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar, using keywords and MeSH terms for papers published between January 2005 and March 2019. Methodology Risk of bias was assessed by using the PEDro scale. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to score the quality of evidence. Pooled effects were reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs) or weighted mean difference (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was weighted by inconsistency I(2)tests. Synthesis Thirty-four trials were identified (1594 participants). Overall, the evidence was low quality. Exergames significantly improved HRQoL in populations with chronic diseases, with a small effect size (32 studies; 1544 participants; SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.4; I-2 = 27%) and specifically in people with neurological disorders (20 studies, 956 participants, SMD 0.22; 95% CI 0.2 to 0.4; I-2 = 49%), rheumatologic diseases (four studies, 210 participants, SMD 0.39; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7; I-2 = 4%), and cardiorespiratory and chronic metabolic conditions (five studies, 309 participants, SMD 0.23; 95% CI 0.0 to 0.5; I-2 = 0%). Exergaming interventions in health care settings demonstrated similarly small but positive effects (22 studies, 905 participants, SMD 0.30; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5; I-2 = 41%), whereas those carried out in home-based contexts did not. Conclusions Exergame-based rehabilitative interventions performed in health care settings led to small but statistically significant improvements in HRQoL in persons with chronic diseases.";2021;4
Objective To identify the available guidance and training to implement telerehabilitation movement assessments for people (adults and children) with a physical disability, including those recovering from COVID-19. Design Rapid scoping review. Included sources and articles PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, PEDro, UK Health Forum, WHO, National Archives and NHS England were searched using the participant-concept-context framework from 2015 to August 2020. Primary studies that recruited individuals with physical disabilities and guidance documents aimed at providers to implement movement-related telerehabilitation were included. Results 23 articles (11 primary research studies, 3 systematic reviews and 9 guidance documents) were included out of 7857 that were identified from the literature search. Two main issues were found: (1) telerehabilitation guidance (from both research studies and guidance documents) was not specific to movement-related assessment and (2) most primary research studies provided neither guidance nor training of movement-specific assessment to practitioners. Of the COVID-19 related guidance, two articles reported COVID-19 management that only referred to identifying COVID-19 status without references to specific movement-related guidance. Conclusions Telerehabilitation guidance and training have existed pre-COVID-19, yet the lack of specific movement-related information and provider support is surprising. This gap must be addressed to optimise effective implementation of remote assessments for those with physical disabilities. Review registration Open Science Framework: .;2021;4
Objective To summarize guidelines on self-care and clinical management of persons with laryngectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Articles published in electronic databases-PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINHAL with the compliant keywords-were scouted from December 2019 to November 2020. All original articles, letters to editors, reviews, and consensus statements were reviewed and included. Results In all, 20 articles that had information pertaining to self-care of persons with laryngectomy or guidelines for clinicians working with this population were identified. Four of the included studies were case reports of persons with laryngectomy who contracted the COVID-19 virus. One of the included articles was a cohort study that explored the use of telerehabilitation in persons with laryngectomy. Conclusion The hallmarks of preventative strategies for persons with laryngectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic are as follows: physical distancing, use of a three-ply mask or surgical mask to cover the mouth and nose, and use of Heat Moisture Exchange (HME) device over stoma in addition to covering it with a surgical mask or laryngectomy bib. Telerehabilitation, not a preference with this population prior to the pandemic, has gained popularity and acceptance during the COVID-19 situation. The reports of COVID-positive persons with laryngectomy have indicated contrary findings from the tracheal and nasal swabs, necessitating compulsory inclusion of both nasal and tracheal swabs.;2021;4
"Objective To synthesize the nature and extent of research on rehabilitation care provision to patients with COVID-19. Specifically, we aimed to (1) describe the impact of COVID on patients and associated rehabilitation needs, (2) outline the adaptations and preparations required to enable the provision of COVID rehabilitation, (3) describe the types of rehabilitation services and treatments provided to COVID patients, and (4) identify barriers and facilitators to delivering COVID rehabilitation. Literature Survey We searched Medline, PsychINFO, Embase, and CINAHL on June 26, 2020 using key words such as rehabilitation, physical medicine, allied health professionals, and variations of COVID. The search was updated on October 13, 2020. We included articles published in English and that focused on some aspect of COVID rehabilitation for adults. We excluded articles focused on pediatric populations and those not focused (or minimally focused) on rehabilitation for COVID patients. Methodology Data were charted based on article type (ie, primary data, secondary data, guidelines). Key information extracted included (1) COVID sequelae; (2) rehabilitation adaptations; (3) structure, function, and content of rehabilitation services/programs; (4) facilitators and/or barriers to providing COVID rehabilitation; and (5) recommendations for COVID rehabilitation programming. Data were synthesized narratively. Synthesis In total, 128 articles were included in the review that reported primary data (n = 33), secondary data (n = 82), and clinical practice/patient self-management guidelines (n = 13). Evidence begins to suggest that rehabilitation is necessary and valuable for addressing COVID-related declines in health, function, and well-being. Most articles recommended that an individualized rehabilitation program be provided across the continuum of care by an interdisciplinary team of professionals and that the nature and extent of rehabilitation be informed by the care setting and COVID severity. Most issues that challenged COVID rehabilitation delivery were directly addressed by the facilitators and adaptations identified. Conclusions Future recommendations include a greater emphasis on the psychosocial aspects of COVID rehabilitation, inclusion of families in rehabilitation planning, and the use of qualitative approaches to complement clinical data.";2021;4
"Objective. The objective was to explore family caregivers' perspectives of the recovery process of older adults with hip fracture and describe experiences from caregivers who: (1) used the online intervention, or (2) received home-based care provided by the Andalusian Public Health Care System. Methods. This was an exploratory secondary study with informal family caregivers who had an older adult family member with hip fracture enrolled in a novel telerehabilitation (telerehab) clinical trial. Forty-four caregivers of older adults with hip fracture were interviewed at 6 to 9 months after their family member's hip fracture. Results. Caregivers shared concerns of family members' survival and recovery; they recounted increased stress and anxiety due to the uncertainty of new tasks associated with providing care and the impact on their lifestyle. Although most caregivers were satisfied with the health care received, they made suggestions for better organization of hospital discharge and requests for home support. The main reasons why caregivers and their family member chose the telerehab program were to enhance recovery after fracture, gain knowledge for managing at home, and because of the convenience of completing the exercises at home. There were more family caregivers in the control group who expressed a high level of stress and anxiety, and they also requested more social and health services compared with caregivers whose family member received telerehab. Conclusion. Family caregivers are an essential component of recovery after hip fracture by providing emotional and physical support. However, future clinical interventions should evaluate person-centered interventions to mitigate possible stress and anxiety experienced by family caregivers. Impact. Family caregivers' perspectives are necessary in the co-design of management strategies for older adults after hip fracture.";2021;4
"Objective.Telerehabilitation is an option that should be adapted as soon as possible to face the crisis caused by coronavirus disease 2019. An umbrella and mapping review with meta-meta-analysis (MMA) of the available scientific evidence was performed to determine whether telerehabilitation could be an effective alternative to conventional rehabilitation in physical therapist practice. Methods. A systematic review of reviews and a synthesis of the findings of all systematic evidence published to date with a visual map and a meta-meta-analysis (MMA) were performed. A systematic search was realized in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE (PubMed), and Google Scholar. Two independent reviewers performed a data analysis and assessed the quality of the included reviews, assessing the risk of bias using ROBIS. Results. Twenty-nine articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected and divided according to the type of patient targeted for rehabilitation (patients with cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological conditions). The MMA regarding physical function between telerehabilitation and usual care rehabilitation did not reveal a statistically significant difference for patients with cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal conditions. For patients with neurological conditions, the MMA revealed a statistically significant but negligible effect size in 6 reviews in favor of telerehabilitation (standardized mean difference = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.03-0.34). Conclusion. The results of the present review showed that telerehabilitation offers positive clinical results, even comparable to conventional face-to-face rehabilitation approaches. Impact. The advantages of lower cost and less interference by the rehabilitation processes in patients' daily life could justify implementing telerehabilitation in clinical settings in the coronavirus disease 2019 era.";2021;4
Objective: Cognitive deficits following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) are a leading cause of disability in young adults and there is a critical need for novel approaches to improve cognitive outcomes in TBI survivors. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with cognitive remediation has emerged as a viable, cost-effective, noninvasive approach for treating cognitive impairments in a wide variety of neurological conditions. Here, we report the first case study utilizing remotely supervised tDCS (RS-tDCS) protocol paired with cognitive remediation in a 29-year-old man with persisting cognitive and emotional sequelae following TBI. Method: Neuropsychological measures were administered before and after the patient completed 20 daily sessions of RS -tDCS (2.0 mA x 20 minutes, left anodal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex montage). During the daily stimulation period, he completed adaptive cognitive training All treatment procedures were delivered at home and monitored in real time via videoconference with a study technician. Results: Following 20 RS-tDCS and cognitive training sessions, he had significant improvements (>1 SD) on tests of attention and working memory, semantic fluency, and information processing speed. Mood was also improved. Conclusions: This is the first demonstration of at-home telerehabilitation with RS-tDCS and cognitive training to improve cognitive outcomes following TBI.;2021;4
Objective: Due to social distancing guidelines during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, most providers and patients have wanted to avoid close contact. This makes physical therapy (PT) assessments difficult because of the lack of empirical evidence about the reliability of various clinical measurements performed in a virtual environment. One such procedure is the photometric measurement of craniovertebral (CV) angle. Craniovertebral angle measurement is usually performed in an outpatient setting and is defined as the acute angle formed between a straight line connecting the spinous process of C7 to the tragus of the ear, and the horizontal line passing through the spinous process of the C7. Although the photometric measurement of CV angles is considered both valid and reliable in the clinics, no empirical evidence exists about the CV angle measurement reliability when performed in a virtual environment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the inter- and intra-rater reliability of photometric CV angle measurement using a cloud-based video communication platform. Number of Subjects: 66 subjects (57 females). Methods: All measurements were performed by two final year PT students who had completed the musculoskeletal part of the curriculum and were blinded to each other's measurements. Each subject was photographed in two postures over a HIPAA-compliant video-based telehealth platform: (1) normal/ relaxed posture and (2) ideal posture (posture the subject considered good). Student researcher 1 measured the CV angle in both the relaxed posture and ideal posture, while student researcher 2 measured the CV angle only in the relaxed posture. Each subject's CV angle measurement was performed three times on three separate days and the means were used for further analysis. The shape of the CV angle frequency distribution was assessed using kurtosis and skewness values. Rater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and interpreted based on the guidelines provided by Portney and Watkins (2009). Results: The CV angles were normally distributed in both relaxed and ideal postures. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of relaxed posture was 50.70 +/- 6.30 with kurtosis and skewness of 0.67 and -0.74 respectively. The mean and SD of ideal posture was 55.50 +/- 5.40, with kurtosis and skewness of 0.1 and -0.54 respectively. The ICC for interrater reliability in the relaxed posture was 0.88 and the ICC for intra-rater reliability for relaxed posture was 0.91. Conclusion: Craniovertebral angles were normally distributed in the sample. An acceptable level of inter- and intra-rater reliability can be attained when measuring CV angle using a cloud-based video communication platform.;2021;4
"Objective: Telerehabilitation (TR) is now, in the context of COVID-19, more clinically relevant than ever as a major source of outpatient care. The social network of a patient is a critical yet understudied factor in the success of TR that may influence both engagement in therapy programs and post-stroke outcomes. We designed a 12-week home-based TR program for stroke patients and evaluated which social factors might be related to motor gains and reduced depressive symptoms. Methods: Stroke patients (n = 13) with arm motor deficits underwent supervised home-based TR for 12 weeks with routine assessments of motor function and mood. At the 6-week midpoint, we mapped each patient's personal social network and evaluated relationships between social network metrics and functional improvements from TR. Finally, we compared social networks of TR patients with a historical cohort of 176 stroke patients who did not receive any TR to identify social network differences. Results: Both network size and network density were related to walk time improvement (p = 0.025; p = 0.003). Social network density was related to arm motor gains (p = 0.003). Social network size was related to reduced depressive symptoms (p = 0.015). TR patient networks were larger (p = 0.012) and less dense (p = 0.046) than historical stroke control networks. Conclusions: Social network structure is positively related to improvement in motor status and mood from TR. TR patients had larger and more open social networks than stroke patients who did not receive TR. Understanding how social networks intersect with TR outcomes is crucial to maximize effects of virtual rehabilitation.";2021;4
"Objective: The aim of the study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) and the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ) into Turkish and also to analyze the reliability and validity of both questionnaires. Materials and Methods: A total of 107 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were recruited. The department clinician monitored all participants with telemedicine for 4 years. Internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The test-retest reliability was calculated with intraclass correlation coefficient by analyzing the scores of retested 52 patients 1 week later. The construct validity was examined by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Besides, the internal consistency for the subscores of the TUQ and exploratory factor analysis of the TSQ was analyzed. Results: The mean age was 40.5 +/- 11.0 years. Internal consistency of all items and the total score of the TUQ were excellent (>0.80; ranged: 0.976-0.979). On the other hand, the internal consistency of all items and total score of the TSQ was excellent, either (>0.80; ranged: 0.969-0.973). The reproducibility of the total score for the TUQ was excellent (>0.80). The test-retest reliability of all items and the total score of the TSQ were within limits ranging from acceptable to excellent (0.617-0.860). The reliability of the total score for the TSQ was excellent (>0.80). The internal consistency of all subscales of the TUQ was excellent (>0.80). The correlation between TUQ and TSQ was strong (r = 0.882, P < 0.001). The factor loading scores of the TSQ were high (0.814-0.919). Conclusions: The Turkish version of the TUQ and the TSQ are valid and reliable in MS patients. </p>";2021;4
Objective: The use of telemedicine has dramatically increased due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Many neurosurgeons are now using telemedicine technologies for preoperative evaluations and routine outpatient visits. Our goal was to standardize the telemedicine motor neurologic examination, summarize the evidence surrounding clinical use of telehealth technologies, and discuss financial and legal considerations. Methods: We identified a 12-member panel composed of spine surgeons, fellows, and senior residents at a single institution. We created an initial telehealth strength examination protocol based on published data and developed 10 agree/disagree statements summarizing the protocol. A blinded Delphi method was utilized to build consensus for each statement, defined as > 80% agreement and no significant disagreement using a 2-way binomial test (significance threshold of p<0.05). Any statement that did not meet consensus was edited and iteratively resubmitted to the panel until consensus was achieved. In the final round, the panel was unblinded and the protocol was finalized. Results: After the first round, 4/10 statements failed to meet consensus (< 80% agreement, and p=0.031, p=0.031, p=0.003, and p=0.031 statistical disagreement, respectively). The disagreement pertained to grading of strength of the upper (3/10 statements) and lower extremities (1/10 statement). The amended statements clarified strength grading, achieved consensus (> 80% agreement, p>0.05 disagreement), and were used to create the final telehealth strength examination protocol. Conclusion: The resulting protocol was used in our clinic to standardize the telehealth strength examination. This protocol, as well as our summary of telehealth clinical practice, should aid neurosurgical clinics in integrating telemedicine modalities into their practice.;2021;4
Objective: To assess the effectiveness of tele-monitored cardiac rehabilitation in patients who have undergone ablation for atrial fibrillation. Design: Single-centre, prospective, assessment-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Setting: Domiciliary rehabilitation with support from a tertiary care hospital. Subjects: One hundred patients who underwent ablation for atrial fibrillation were recruited. Interventions: Participants were randomly allocated to a 12-week standard rehabilitation treatment (control group) or a comprehensive, domiciliary, mobile application-guided and tele-monitored cardiac rehabilitation program (intervention group) in a 1:1 fashion. Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was the improvement in V-O2peak. The secondary outcomes included adherence, physical activity, beliefs related to cardiovascular disease and exercise self-efficacy. Results: Ninety-seven patients completed follow-up. The mean V-O2peak increased significantly in both the intervention group (n = 49) (baseline vs 12 weeks: 19.1 +/- 4.7 vs 27.3 +/- 5.6 ml/(min kg), P < 0.01) and the control group (n = 48) (baseline vs 12 weeks: 18.7 +/- 4.9 vs 22.9 +/- 6.3 ml/(min kg), P < 0.01). The results of the between-group analysis of aerobic capacity were significantly in favour of the intervention group. During the 12-week program, patients in the intervention group exhibited better adherence than those in the control group. Moreover, self-reported physical activity improved more in the intervention group than in the control group, as did the beliefs related to cardiovascular disease and exercise self-efficacy (all P < 0.01). Conclusions: Our domiciliary, mobile application-guided and tele-monitored cardiac rehabilitation program could lead to a more significant improvements in physical fitness, adherence and health beliefs than standard cardiac rehabilitation in patients who have undergone ablation for atrial fibrillation.;2021;4
"Objective: To describe the adaptations made to implement virtual cancer rehabilitation at the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as well as understand the experiences of patients and providers adapting to virtual care. Design: Multimethod study. Setting: Cancer center. Participants: A total of 1968 virtual patient visits were completed during the study period. Adult survivors of cancer (n =12) and oncology health care providers (n =12) participated in semi-structured interviews. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Framework-driven categorization of program modifications, qualitative interviews with patients and providers, and a comparison of process outcomes with the previous 90 days of in-person care via referrals, completed visits and attendance, method of delivery, weekly capacities, and wait times. Results: The majority of program visits could be adapted to virtual delivery, with format, setting, and content modifications. Virtual care demonstrated an increase or maintenance in the number of completed visits by appointment type compared with in-person care, with attendance ranging from 80%-93%. For most appointment types, capacities increased, whereas wait times decreased slightly. Overall, 168 patients (11% of all assessments and follow-ups) assessed virtually were identified by providers as requiring an in-person appointment because of reassessment of musculoskeletal and/or neurologic impairment (n= 109, 65%) and lymphedema (n =59, 35%). The interviews (n =24) revealed that virtual care was an acceptable alternative in some circumstances, with the ability to (1) increase access to care; (2) provide a sense of reassurance during a time of isolation; and (3) provide confidence in learning skills to self-manage impairments. Conclusions: Many appointments can be successfully adapted to virtual formats to deliver cancer rehabilitation programming. Based on our findings, we provide practical recommendations that can be implemented by providers and programs to facilitate the adoption and delivery of virtual care.

Objective: To explore professionals', adult patients', and children's caregivers' perception and satisfaction with telerehabilitation during COVID-19 lockdown. Design: An observational transversal study on a web-based survey was conducted in order to explore participants' perception and satisfaction of telerehabilitation during COVID-19 lockdown. Setting: The study was conducted at our Outpatient Neurorehabilitation Service. Subjects: All rehabilitation professionals, adult patients, and children's caregivers who accepted telerehabilitation were recruited. Interventions: Participants had to respond to the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 and to a purpose-built questionnaire on their perception and satisfaction of the service provided. Main Measures: Data were analyzed by qualitative statistics and logistic regression models. Results: All 144 caregivers, 25 adult patients, and 50 professionals reported a medium-high level of perception and a high level of satisfaction. Results showed a correlation among caregivers of children aged 0-3 and feeling overwhelmed with remote care (OR = 3.27), a low perception of telerehabilitation for enhancing goals (OR = 6.51), and a high perception of feeling helped in organizing daily activity (OR = 2.96). For caregivers of children aged over 6 years, changes in the therapy plan were related to a low perception of feeling in line with the in-person therapy (OR = 2.61 and OR = 9.61) and a low satisfaction (OR = 5.54 and OR = 4.97). Changes in therapy were related to concern (OR = 4.20). Caregivers under 40 and professionals showed a high probability to perceive telerehabilitation as supportive (OR = 2.27 and OR = 5.68). Level of experience with remote media was shown to influence perception and satisfaction. Interpretation: Telerehabilitation can be a useful practice both during a health emergency and in addition to in-presence therapy.;2021;4
"Objective: To investigate an intensive asynchronous computer-based treatment delivered remotely with clinician oversight to people with aphasia. Design: Single-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Free-standing urban rehabilitation hospital. Participants: Adults with aphasia (at least six months post-onset). Interventions: Experimental treatment was Web ORLA(R) (Oral Reading for Language in Aphasia) which provides repeated choral and independent reading aloud of sentences with a virtual therapist. Placebo was a commercially available computer game. Participants were instructed to practice 90 minutes/day, six days/week for six weeks. Main measures: Change in Language Quotient of the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised from pre-treatment to post-treatment and pre-treatment to six weeks following the end of treatment. Results: 32 participants (19 Web ORLA(R), 13 Control) completed the intervention and post-treatment assessment; 27 participants (16 Web ORLA(R), 11 Control) completed the follow-up assessment six weeks after treatment had ended. Web ORLA(R) treatment resulted in significant improvements in language performance from pre-treatment to immediately post-treatment (X = 2.96; SD = 4.32; P < 0.01; ES = 0.68) and from pre-treatment to six weeks following the end of treatment (X = 4.53; SD = 3.16; P < 0.001; ES = 1.43). There was no significant difference in the gain from pre-treatment to post-treatment for the Web ORLA(R) versus Control groups. However, the Web ORLA(R) group showed significantly greater gains at the six-week follow-up than the control group (X = 2.70; SD = 1.01; P = 0.013; ES = 1.92). Conclusion: Results provide evidence for improved language outcomes following intensive, web-based delivery of ORLA(R) to individuals with chronic aphasia. Findings underscore the value of combining clinician oversight with the flexibility of asynchronous practice.";2021;4
Objective: To investigate the effect of a home-based interactive telerehabilitation program on balance performance in older people, and to compare the results with a nonsupervised home exercise (NHE) program. Subjects and Methods: A total of 50 participants (35 females), aged 65-90 years, were included in the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups as the interactive telerehabilitation home exercise group (ITHE), NHE group or control group. The ITHE and NHE groups exercised three times per week for 8 weeks. The outcome measures were the Berg Functional Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Sway Balance Mobile Application, Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Older Adults Module (WHL). Results: In the control group, no difference was observed in the TUG and BBS scores, at the end of the 8 weeks compared with preexercise (pre-ex), whereas these scores increased significantly in the NHE (TUG: P < 0.001, BBS: P < 0.001) and ITHE groups (TUG: P < 0.001, BBS: P = 0.003). The WHL scores increased significantly in all three groups, and no difference was observed in the TAI scores. There was a significant difference in SWAY score only in the telerehabilitation group compared with pre-ex (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although NHE and ITHE were effective on the improvement of balance, mobility and reduction of fall risk in older individuals, this effect was found to be greater in the ITHE group. Quality of life increased in all groups, but no change in anxiety level was observed. </p>;2021;4
Objective: To report symptoms, disability, and rehabilitation referral rates after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization in a large, predominantly older population. Design: Cross-sectional study, with postdischarge telemonitoring of individuals hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 at the first month after hospital discharge, as part of a comprehensive telerehabilitation program. Setting: Private verticalized health care network specialized in the older population. Participants: Individuals hospitalized because of COVID-19. We included 1696 consecutive patients, aged 71.8 +/- 13.0 years old and 56.1% female. Comorbidities were present in 82.3% of the cases (N=1696). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Dependence for basic activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) using the Barthel Index and Lawton's Scale. We compared the outcomes between participants admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) vs those admitted to the ward. Results: Participant were followed up for 21.8 +/- 11.7 days after discharge. During postdischarge assessment, independence for ADL was found to be lower in the group admitted to the ICU than the ward group (61.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), 55.8%-66.2%] vs 72.7% [95% CI, 70.3%-75.1%], P<.001). Dependence for IADL was also more frequent in the ICU group (84.6% [95% CI, 80.4%-88.2%] vs 74.5%, [95% CI, 72.0%-76.8%], P<.001). Individuals admitted to ICU required more oxygen therapy (25.5% vs 12.6%, P<.001), presented more shortness of breath during routine (45.2% vs 34.5%, P<.001) and nonroutine activities (66.3% vs 48.2%, P<.001), and had more difficulty standing up for 10 minutes (49.3% vs 37.9% P<.001). The rehabilitation treatment plan consisted mostly of exercise booklets, which were offered to 65.5% of participants. The most referred rehabilitation professionals were psychologists (11.8%), physical therapists (8.0%), dietitians (6.8%), and speech-language pathologists (4.6%). Conclusions: Individuals hospitalized because of COVID-19 present high levels of disability, dyspnea, dysphagia, and dependence for both ADL and IADL. Those admitted to the ICU presented more advanced disability parameters. (C) 2021 The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2021;4
"Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of structured telerehabilitation on fatigue, health status, quality of life (QoL), and activities of daily living (ADL) and compare the possible effects with structured supervised exercise programs in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Materials and methods This study was a randomized, single-blind trial. Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis were included in the study and randomly divided into two groups; structured supervised exercise group (Group 1) and telerehabilitation group (Group 2). Group 1 (n = 15) completed a 12 week structured supervised exercise program. Group 2 (n = 15) completed a 12 week structured home-based exercise program. Patients were evaluated with functional independence measure (FIM), first section of Nottingham Health Profile (NHP-I), fatigue severity scale (FSS), and quality of life scale (QoLS) before and after the intervention. Results Significant differences were found in all parameters in both groups after the treatment (p < .05). No significant difference was found between groups regarding FIM-total, FIM-motor, FIM-cognitive, NHP sub-parameters, and QoLS (p > .05). Between-group differences revealed a significant difference in FSS and NHP total in favor of Group 1 (p < .05). Conclusion A structured home-based exercise program can be an alternative to supervised exercises with no side effects in patients with multiple sclerosis. Home-based rehabilitation exercises that are checked and controlled through telerehabilitation can help patients improve their health-related QoL and ADL. However, supervised exercises can be more beneficial regarding the fatigue and health profile compared to the home-based exercises.";2021;4
Objectives: An increasing reliance on telemedicine for older adults with cognitive impairment requires a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators for this unique patient population. Design: The study team queried PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov on May 1, 2020, for studies in English published from January 2010 to May 2020. Setting and Participants: We conducted a systematic review of articles investigating the use of telemedicine among older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that focused on the patient and care partner perspectives. Methods: Telemedicine encounter purpose, technological requirements, and findings regarding sensory needs were extracted. The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool was applied for quality assessment. Results: The search yielded 3551 abstracts, from which 90 articles were reviewed and 17 were included. The purpose of telemedicine encounters included routine care, cognitive assessment, and telerehabilitation. All studies reported successful implementation of telemedicine, supported by patient and care partner satisfaction, similar results on cognitive assessment and diagnosis compared to in-person visits, and improvement in outcome measures following rehabilitation. Sixteen studies relied on staff and care partners to navigate technologies. Six studies reported participants reporting difficulty hearing the provider during the telemedicine visits. Five studies excluded participants with visual or hearing impairment because of the potential difficulty of using telemedicine technology. No studies reported technological adaptations to account for sensory impairment . Conclusions and Implications: Telemedicine is well received among patients and care partners, but successful delivery incorporates support staff and the care partners to navigate technologies. The exclusion of older adults with sensory impairment, especially given that it is highly prevalent, in developing telemedicine systems may further exacerbate access to care in this population. Adapting technologies for sensory needs is critical to the advancement of accessible dementia care through telemedicine. (c) 2021 AMDA -The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.;2021;4
"Objectives: Computer game assisted task specific exercises (CGATSE) are rehabilitation gaming systems (RGS) used in stroke rehabilitation to facilitate patient performance of high intensity, task based, repetitive exercises aiming to enhance neuroplasticity. CGATSE maybe an appealing option in home based rehabilitation of stroke patients, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine the effects of CGATSE on hemiplegic arm-hand function, cognitive function and quality of life in stroke. Materials and methods: Thirty stroke patients were randomized into two groups. All participants received twenty sessions of physical therapy. In addition, the therapy group undertook thirty minutes of CGATSE using the Rejoyce gaming system; while the control group undertook thirty minutes of occupational therapy (OT). Motor function was evaluated before and after treatment using the Fugl Meyer upper extremity (FMUE), Brunnstrom stages of stroke recovery (BSSR) arm and hand. The CGATSE group also completed the Rejoyce arm hand function test (RAHFT). Cognitive function was evaluated using the mini mental state examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SS-QOL) scale. Results: The FMUE, BSSR arm and SSQOL improved in both groups (p < 0.05). BSSR of the hand improved only in the CGATSE group (p = 0.024). RAHFT scores improved in the CGATSE group (p = 0.008). MoCA scores significantly improved in the control group (p = 0.008). Conclusions: CGATSE may be beneficial in providing continuation of care after stroke, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic when home based rehabilitation options are becoming increasingly important. Benefits of CGATSE in improving cognitive function is less clear. RGS aimed at improving motor function may be compared to gaming systems designed to target cognitive development and more detailed higher cortical function deficit tests can be used as outcome measures.";2021;4
"Objectives: Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by the repetition of sounds, syllables, or words; prolongation of sounds; and interruptions in speech. Telepractice allows speech services to be delivered to patients regardless of their location. This review investigated factors influencing the use of telepractice in stuttering treatment. Methods: Articles related to the application of telepractice in stuttering were searched using the Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, and ProQuest databases without consideration of any time limit. Initially, 79 articles were found and after application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles were selected for the review study. Data were analyzed by using the content analysis method and synthesized narratively. Results: Factors influencing the use of telepractice in stuttering treatment were categorized into individual, technical, clinical, and economic factors. Providing access to healthcare services, maintaining personal privacy, and allowing flexibility in arranging appointments were among individual factors. In terms of the technical factors, technical problems and Internet speed were addressed. Clinical factors were divided into positive and negative outcomes, and economic factors were mainly related to time and cost savings. Conclusions: Although patients may benefit from using telepractice, the widespread adoption of this technology can be hindered by some technical and non-technical factors. Because telepractice can be employed as a complementary method to treat stuttering, more attention should be paid to the required infrastructure and factors that may negatively impact the use of this technology.";2021;4
"Objectives: To evaluate effectiveness or non-inferiority of telerehabilitation for people with aphasia when compared to conventional face-to-face speech and language therapy. Materials and methods: Five electronic databases (PUBMED, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Library) were searched. We extrapolated data from the included studies and evaluated the methodological quality using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for Randomized Trials (RoB 2) and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). A meta-analysis compared effects of intervention, and it was conducted using the Review Manager 5.3 software. GRADE profile to assess overall quality of evidence was carried out. Results: Out of a total of 1157 records, five studies met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for meta-analysis with a total of 132 participants with post-stroke aphasia. Discussion: Results revealed that telerehabilitation and face-to-face speech and language treatment are comparable with respect to the gains achieved in auditory comprehension (SMD = -0.02; 95% CI -0.39, 0.35), naming accuracy (SMD = -0.09; 95% CI -0.44, 0.25), Aphasia Quotient (MD = -2.18; 95% CI -16.00, 11.64), generalization (SMD = 0.77; 95% IC -0.95, 2.49) and functional communication skills (SMD = -0.08; 95% IC -0.54, 0.38). Conclusion: Although evidence is still insufficient to guide clinical decision making due to the relatively low quality of the evidence identified, the analysis of the results suggest that telerehabilitation training for aphasia seems to be as effective as the conventional face-to-face treatment.";2021;4
"Objectives: To examine the adoption of telerehabilitation services from the stakeholders' perspective and to investigate recent advances and future challenges. Data Sources: A systematic review of English articles indexed by PubMed, Thomson Institute of Scientific Information's Web of Science, and Elsevier's Scopus between 1998 and 2020. Study Selection: The first author (N.N.) screened all titles and abstracts based on the eligibility criteria. Experimental and empirical articles such as randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, pre-experimental studies, case studies, surveys, feasibility studies, qualitative descriptive studies, and cohort studies were all included in this review. Data Extraction: The first, second, and fourth authors (N.N., W.I., B.N.) independently extracted data using data fields predefined by the third author (M.B.). The data extracted through this review included study objective, study design, purpose of telerehabilitation, telerehabilitation equipment, patient/sample, age, disease, data collection methods, theory/framework, and adoption themes. Data Synthesis: A telerehabilitation adoption process model was proposed to highlight the significance of the readiness stage and to classify the primary studies. The articles were classified based on 6 adoption themes, namely users' perception, perspective, and experience; users' satisfaction; users' acceptance and adherence; TeleRehab usability; individual readiness; and users' motivation and awareness. Results: A total of 133 of 914 articles met the eligibility criteria. The majority of papers were randomized controlled trials (27%), followed by surveys (15%). Almost 49% of the papers examined the use of telerehabilitation technology in patients with nervous system problems, 23% examined physical disability disorders, 10% examined cardiovascular diseases, and 8% inspected pulmonary diseases. Conclusion: Research on the adoption of telerehabilitation is still in its infancy and needs further attention from researchers working in health care, especially in resource-limited countries. Indeed, studies on the adoption of telerehabilitation are essential to minimize implementation failure, as these studies will help to inform health care personnel and clients about successful adoption strategies.

Off-the-shelf gaming technology is designed for young, fit, and motor intact individuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) has a role in making controllers and therapeutic games adaptable to the disabled. Post-stroke rehabilitation outcomes can be enhanced by gaming technology within the home to enable engaging telerehabilitation. BrightBrainer (TM) Grasp (BBG) is a novel therapeutic game controller designed to adapt to arm and hand impairments post-stroke. It mediates intensive arm reach, grasp and finger extension training and has the ability to track relevant outcomes. The newly designed controller uses BrightBrainer gamification system with AI technology to provide automatic adaptation, requiring minimal clinician input. This article describes the BBG design, hardware, force and movement detection and calibration, and its integration with the therapeutic games. The use of AI in adapting a library of custom therapeutic games is also described. Results of a usability study with healthy individuals and related design modifications are presented, with implications for future trials.;2021;4
"Over the past 20 years, the use of telemedicine has increased exponentially. Its fundamental aim is to improve access to care. In this review, we assess the extent to which telemedicine has fulfilled this promise across medical domains. Additionally, we assess whether telemedicine has improved related health outcomes. Finally, we determine who has benefited from this novel form of health care delivery. A review of the literature indicates that (a) telemedicine has improved access to care for a wide range of clinical conditions ranging from stroke to pregnancy; (b) telemedicine in select circumstances has demonstrated improved health outcomes; and (c) telemedicine has addressed geographical, but less so social, barriers to care. For telemedicine to fulfill its promise, additional evidence needs to be gathered on health outcomes and cost savings, the digital divide needs to be bridged, and policy changes that support telemedicine reimbursement need to be enacted.";2021;4
"Parkinson's disease is a long-term and progressive degenerative disorder of the nervous system, affecting primarily motor coordination, noticeable as a tremor in one hand. Recent studies reported on positive outcomes of intensive physiotherapy of upper extremities. We built a telerehabilitation system with virtual pick and place tasks for small scale hand movements, and designed a pilot study to find whether such exergaming as a telerehabilitation service provides comparable outcomes as an outpatient exergaming service. A non-randomized pilot trial was designed. Hospital outpatients (28/40) with Parkinson's disease were recruited. Those meeting the inclusion criteria were divided into two groups; seven outpatients were assigned to the home (H) group and 21 outpatients to the hospital (URI) group. Both groups received 10 days of exergaming over the course of 2 weeks, each daily session lasting a maximum of 1 h. Primary outcomes were clinical tests; Box and Blocks Test (BBT), Jebsen Hand Function Test (JHFT), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS part III) were carried out before and after the study. Secondary outcomes were hand kinematics and exergaming results; number of successfully moved objects and task time. Statistical analysis was carried out to find significant (p < 0.05) differences and Cohen's U3 was used to determine effect sizes. The differences between the groups in gender (p = 0.781), age (p = 0.192), and duration of the disease (p = 0.195) were tested with Bartlett's test and no statistical differences were found with an F test. Both groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in clinical test UDPRS III (p = 0.006 and p = 0.011) and the hospital group also in BBT (p = 0.002) and JHFT (p = 0.015) and with UDPRS Ill and JHFT even in favor of the home group (chi(2) = 5.08, p = 0.024, chi(2) = 7.76, p = 0.005). Nevertheless, the exergaming results show significant improvement after training (U3 > 0.86). Exergaming has already been suggested as an effective approach in the planning of rehabilitation tasks for persons with Parkinson's disease. We have prepared a pilot study demonstrating that exergaming at home with telerehabilitation support may provide comparable clinical outcomes. The study shall be followed by a randomized study with higher statistical power to provide clinical evidence. Nevertheless, carrying out even part of the rehabilitation program at home is crucial for the development of future telerehabilition clinical services.";2021;4
People with Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly have gait impairments that reduce their ability to walk safely in the community. These impairments are characterized, in part, by a compromised ability to turn and negotiate both predictable and unpredictable environments. Here, we describe the development and usability assessment of a virtual reality training application, Wordplay VR, that allows people with PD to practice skills such as turning, obstacle avoidance, and problem-solving during over-ground walking in a game-based setting. Nine people with PD completed three sessions with Wordplay VR, and each session was directed by their personal physical therapist. Our outcome measures included perceived sense of presence measured using the International Test Commission-Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI), levels of motivation using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), overall system usability using the System Usability Scale (SUS), and setup time by the physical therapists. Both the people with PD and the physical therapists rated their sense of presence in the training system positively. The system received high ratings on the interest and value subscales of the IMI, and the system was also rated highly on usability, from the perspective of both the patient during gameplay and the therapist while controlling the experience. These preliminary results suggest that the application and task design yielded an experience that was motivating and user-friendly for both groups. Lastly, with repeated practice over multiple sessions, therapists were able to reduce the time required to help their patients don the headset and sensors and begin the training experience.;2021;4
Physical activity monitoring with wearable technology has the potential to support stroke rehabilitation. Little is known about how physical therapists use and value the use of wearable activity monitors. This cross-sectional study explores the use, perspectives, and barriers to wearable activity monitoring in day-to-day stroke care routines amongst physical therapists. Over 300 physical therapists in primary and geriatric care and rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands were invited to fill in an online survey that was developed based on previous studies and interviews with experts. In total, 103 complete surveys were analyzed. Out of the 103 surveys, 27% of the respondents were already using activity monitoring. Of the suggested treatment purposes of activity monitoring, 86% were perceived as useful by more than 55% of the therapists. The most recognized barriers to clinical implementation were lack of skills and knowledge of patients (65%) and not knowing what brand and type of monitor to choose (54%). Of the non-users, 79% were willing to use it in the future. In conclusion, although the concept of remote activity monitoring was perceived as useful, it was not widely adopted by physical therapists involved in stroke care. To date, skills, beliefs, and attitudes of individual therapists determine the current use of wearable technology.;2021;4
Physical training in Parkinson disease improves motor performance, alleviates nonmotor symptoms, and enhances cognition and quality of life. Nonetheless, adherence to exercise is low and travel costs and time may limit participation and compliance. Training at home can help avoid these burdens and, as needed during the recent global pandemic (COVID-19), reinforce social distancing and reduce the risk of infection. However, training at home requires motivation and self-control and telerehabilitation is time-consuming for both patient and therapist. In recent years, there is growing use of virtual reality and exergaming to increase motivation and adherence for exercising with evidence of improvements in mobility and balance after using virtual reality in the clinic. Here, a novel telerehabilitation training program using a treadmill-virtual reality system for simultaneous training of two patients with Parkinson disease in their homes is described. Remote monitoring software enabled visual and auditory communication with the two patients, allowing the trainer to adapt the settings remotely and provide feedback. Participants received weekly training sessions over 1 yr. The findings show high adherence to training, increased walking duration throughout the sessions, and increased patient confidence, gait speed, and mobility. Training multiple participants simultaneously was feasible, enabling an individualized treatment approach while conserving therapist time.;2021;4
Postacute COVID-19 patients are at risk of long-term functional impairment, and the rehabilitation community is calling for action preparing for a tsunami of rehabilitation needs in this patient population. In the absence of standard guidelines and local evidence, a 3-wk pulmonary telerehabilitation program was successfully delivered to a postacute severe COVID-19 patient in Malawi. The patient experienced persistent dyspnea and fatigue, with a remarkable impact on his health status. On the final assessment, all his respiratory severity scores had fallen by more than their thresholds for clinical significance. He reported no continued or new complaints, was walking longer distances, had returned to work, and was discharged from follow-up. Our case shows that an improvised pulmonary telerehabilitation program for postacute COVID-19 patients could be feasible and acceptable in a low-resource setting. Benefits include reducing risk of transmission and use of personal protective equipment.;2021;4
Promoting regular physical activity (PA) and improving exercise capacity are the primary goals of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Mobile technologies (mTechs) like smartphones, smartwatches, and fitness trackers might help patients in reaching these goals. This review aimed to scope current scientific literature on mTechs in CR to assess the impact on patients' exercise capacity and to identify gaps and future directions for research. PubMed, CENTRAL, and CDSR were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These RCTs had to utilize mTechs to objectively monitor and promote PA of patients during or following CR, aim at improvements in exercise capacity, and be published between December 2014 and December 2019. A total of 964 publications were identified, and 13 studies met all inclusion criteria. Home-based CR with mTechs vs. outpatient CR without mTechs and outpatient CR with mTechs vs. outpatient CR without mTechs did not lead to statistically significant differences in exercise capacity. In contrast, outpatient CR followed by home-based CR with mTechs led to significant improvement in exercise capacity as compared to outpatient CR without further formal CR. Supplying patients with mTechs may improve exercise capacity. To ensure that usage of and compliance with mTechs is optimal, a concentrated effort of CR staff has to be achieved. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented lack of patient support while away from institutional CR. Even though mTechs lend themselves as suitable assistants, evidence is lacking that they can fill this gap.;2021;4
Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is effective in reducing symptoms and improving health status, and exercise tolerance of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly impacted PR programs and their delivery to patients. Owing to fears of viral transmission and resultant outbreaks of COVID-19, institution-based PR programs have been forced to significantly reduce enrolment or in some cases completely shut down during the pandemic. As a majority of COPD patients are elderly and have multiple co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, they are notably susceptible to severe complications of COVID-19. As such, patients have been advised to stay at home and avoid social contact to the maximum extent possible. This has increased patients' vulnerability to physical deconditioning, depression, and social isolation. To address this major gap in care, some traditional hospital or clinic-centered PR programs have converted some or all of their learning contents to home-based telerehabilitation during the pandemic. There are, however, some significant barriers to this approach that have impeded its implementation in the community. These include variable access and use of technology (by patients), a lack of standardization of methods and tools for evaluation of the program, and inadequate training and resources for health professionals in optimally delivering telerehabilitation to patients. There is a pressing need for high-quality studies on these modalities of PR to enable the successful implementation of PR at home and via teleconferencing technologies. Here, we highlight the importance of telerehabilitation of patients with COPD in the post-COVID world and discuss various strategies for clinical implementation.;2021;4
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a highly effective treatment for people with chronic lung disease but remains underused across the world. Recent years have seen the emergence of new program models that aim to improve access and uptake, including telerehabilitation and low-cost, home-based models. This workshop was convened to achieve consensus on the essential components of pulmonary rehabilitation and to identify requirements for successful implementation of emerging models. A Delphi process involving experts from across the world identified 13 essential components of pulmonary rehabilitation that should be delivered in any program model, encompassing patient assessment, program content, method of delivery, and quality assurance, as well as 27 desirable components. Only those models of pulmonary rehabilitation that have been tested in clinical trials are currently considered as ready for implementation. The characteristics of patients most likely to succeed in each program model are not yet known, and research is needed in this area. Health professionals should use clinical judgment to determine those patients who are best served by a center-based, multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. A comprehensive patient assessment is critical for personalization of pulmonary rehabilitation and for effectively addressing individual patient goals. Robust quality-assurance processes are important for ensuring that any pulmonary rehabilitation service delivers optimal outcomes for patients and health services. Workforce capacity-building and training initiatives should consider the skills necessary for emerging models, many of which are delivered remotely. The success of all pulmonary rehabilitation models will be judged on whether the essential components are delivered and on whether the expected patient outcomes, including improved exercise capacity, reduced dyspnea, enhanced health-related quality of life, and reduced hospital admissions, are achieved.;2021;4

Purpose In this study, the effect of a remotely supervised, home-based, family-centered individualized rehabilitation program of motor activities for individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) was evaluated. Materials and methods Thirteen participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. Results Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604). Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction (4.5/5). Conclusions Our findings strongly support the implementation of such programs for this population. As these programs were remotely supervised, they can be implemented when the children are away from referenced facilities for long durations, such as during long holidays or a Covid-19 type lockdown.;2021;4
Purpose of the study: Explore perceptions, expectations and challenges following a telerehabilitation programme using augmented reality glasses (ARG) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or recently diagnosed myocardial infarction (MI). Materials and Methods: A qualitative approach was employed to track perspectives from a range of patients with chronic lung and/or heart diseases. COPD, IPF and MI outpatients from Denmark and Finland were invited to participate. Data were collected through focus group and semi-structured in-depth interviews. Qualitative analysis was performed using standard thematic analytical approaches. A topic guide was used to explore experiences and perceptions of the ARG telerehabilitation device among participants. Results: Thirteen patients (4 MI, 2 IPF and 7 COPD), 3 women and 10 men aged 56 to 75 years (mean age 63.3 years) were allocated into one focus group (9 patients) and 4 interviews (4 patients). Twelve patients reported the added value of ARG and suggested constructive changes such as the adjustable screen/brightness, robust head fixation for exercise performance, easy to navigate interface and supported feedback based on exercise performance. Conclusion: Patients with chronic heart or lung diseases described the added value in an ARG telerehabilitation programme. Improvements for a future version of the ARG were suggested.;2021;4
Purpose Rehabilitation services for children with mild motor difficulties are limited. Telehealth could be a novel avenue through which to provide these services. With the input of various stakeholder groups, this study aimed to develop a logic model for a new primary care telerehabilitation intervention and to identify influencing implementation factors. Methods and materials A participatory research design was used. A logic model, developed in consultation with five healthcare managers, was discussed with four stakeholder groups. Focus groups were conducted with clinicians (n = 9), pediatric healthcare managers (n = 5), and technology information consultants (n = 2), while parents (n = 4) were interviewed to explore their perceptions of the proposed intervention, and factors influencing implementation. Transcribed discussions were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results Stakeholders supported the delivery of telerehabilitation services for children with mild motor difficulties. Although agreement was generated for each logic model component, important recommendations were voiced related to service relevance and sustainability, parent and community capacity building, and platform dependability, security, and support. Identified factors influencing the implementation encompassed consumer, provider, technological, systemic and contextual barriers and facilitators. Strategies to address them were also suggested. Conclusion This study demonstrates the value of, and a process to engage stakeholders in the designing of pediatric telerehabilitation services and its implementation.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Pediatric telerehabilitation service are complex interventions which operate in complicate systems. Designing telerehabilitation services with stakeholders is recommended, yet how to do so often not clear. This study demonstrated that the development of a logic model can provide a systematic framework to helps guide the co-design process with stakeholders. Resulting recommendation underscored a broader vision for the intervention and identified crucial factors and strategies required for its successful implementation and sustainability.;2021;4
Purpose Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in the adult population. It is feasible to think about the use of telerehabilitation devices, such as the smartphone, to respond to the growing demand, even in isolation cases, such as during confinement due to coronavirus disease in 2020. It is intended to explore the available Apps for Spanish-speaking patients with Stroke for a specific sensory-motor rehabilitation process. Materials and methods A search of the available apps in Google Play and Apple Store was carried out using the keywords Stroke, hemiplegia and hemiparesis. The Apps detected have been described and evaluated by an anonymous survey among stroke survivors. Results Nine Apps have been identified and explored, four of which are available in Spanish: NeuroRHB, Stroke Hope Health4TheWorld, 9zest stroke recovery and Farmalarm. Twelve survivors with stroke have participated in the anonymous survey evaluating with the best score the App Farmalarm. Conclusions There are few specific Apps for the Stroke rehabilitation of sensory-motor impairments, and with important limitations that prevent their incorporation into clinical practice. The creation and adaptation of Apps for health professionals such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists and their users are recommended.;2021;4
Purpose The aim of this study was to characterize the practice of telemediated training for patients with very severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and to inform the development of clinical/professional practice. Methods Inspired by ethnographic methodology, participating observation, informal and formal interviews were conducted with patients (11), their partners (4), and physiotherapists (6) at sites where the telemediated training was practiced. Postphenomenology was used as theoretical and analytical framework. Results Telemediated training in the homes of the patients takes place where most daily activities happen, and together with activities in the rehabilitation units they are included in the training in a reduced or amplified version that may compromise the privacy of the patients. The mediated image and sound challenge the training and communication activities and the possibility for the physiotherapists to estimate the condition of the patients. Consequently, the physiotherapists lower how much they push the patients in the exercises. Conclusions Making training accessible to very severely ill patients with COPD through homebased telemediation comes with several trade-offs. This study can be used to educate clinical practice before and during the practicing of telemediated services, which need to be organized in a way that allows continuous adjustment.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The technology itself is not a neutral device in online health care provision. Health professionals should therefore: Play an active role in structuring the content, communication, and inclusion of the patients' context during online health care provision. Receive training in how to spot ways in which online health care provision transforms traditional practice and to how to work around its limitations. Organize online health care practices in ways that allow for continuous adjustment (for which they need back up from management).;2021;4
Purpose The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in dramatic changes to avoid virus spread. In Canada, following provincial legislation the Workers' Compensation Board of Alberta (WCB-Alberta) stopped in-person rehabilitation services on March 23, 2020. On April 1, training began on remote service delivery using videoconferencing or telerehabilitation, which started April 3. We studied WCB-Alberta's transition to remote rehabilitation service delivery. Methods A population-based descriptive study was conducted, with data extracted from the WCB-Alberta database. This included clinical data from rehabilitation providers. We included workers completing services between January 1 and May 31, 2020. We statistically examined differences before and after the transition to remote services. Results The dataset included 4,516 individuals with work-related injuries. The mean number of work assessments per week pre-COVID was 244.6 (SD 83.5), which reduced to 135.9 (SD 74.5). Workers undergoing remote assessments were significantly more likely to work in health care or trades, did not require an interpreter, and were less likely to be working or judged as ready to return to work. Number of completed rehabilitation programs also reduced from 125.6 to 40.8 per week, with most (67.1%) remote programs being functional restoration. Few adverse effects were observed. Conclusions We describe the transition to completely remote delivery of occupational rehabilitation due to COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions in one Canadian compensation jurisdiction. It appears the use of remote services was successful but proceeded cautiously, with fewer complex cases being referred for assessment or rehabilitation. Further research examining longer-term work outcomes and stakeholder perceptions is needed.;2021;4
"Purpose The healthcare system and service capacity are overwhelmed by the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a substantial unmet need for rehabilitation service to all patients affected by Covid-19 directly or indirectly. This article aims to describe how to rapidly reconfigure and bring rehabilitation services back during the pandemic. Method The Steer committee meeting was held for the development of a strategic preparedness plan and safety management based on principles and evidence of rehabilitation, which will lead to effective mitigation of consequences resulted from Covid-19. Results Five measures were taken in Southwest China during the pandemic, which includes the First contact responsibility and management system; the full-coverage system for nosocomial infection control; the Closed-off management system; the full-coverage system for body temperature monitoring; the adoption of 5G-based telerehabilitation. With the implementation of these measures, the capacity and capability were enhanced to safely reopen and operate rehabilitation facilities in Southwest China. Conclusion Further measurement of quality of care and outcomes during and beyond the pandemic is needed in transforming the healthcare system and improving rehabilitation services. Hopefully, the positive message conveyed by this paper could encourage and support communities and the society of physical medicine and rehabilitation worldwide during this challenging time.";2021;4
Purpose The objective of this scoping review was to get an overview of barriers emerging across the globe from the pandemic that are likely to increase the level of pre-existing disability status of neurologically challenged populations. Methods Database searches (PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science) updated to December 2020 were conducted. Articles that identified challenges or barriers to neuro-rehabilitation, impact on disability status and health care services were included. Full-text articles limited to the English language with no restrictions on study design were included. Data was synthesized based on recurrent themes that were identified. Results Thirty-seven studies were included in this review. Neurological populations considered: stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, parkinson's disease, autism, developmental disabilities, and those who required neurosurgical care. Barriers were grouped into categories as increased disease risk and complications, delayed or restricted access to neuro-rehabilitation, limited hospital access, telerehabilitation limitations, and shutdown of special centers of aid. Conclusions COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to barriers that affect almost every aspect of healthcare and rehabilitation in neurologically challenged populations prompting an increase in their disability level. This can assist policymakers in designing mitigation strategies to minimize the detrimental effects on this vulnerable population.;2021;4
Purpose The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the current literature on the clinical outcomes of physiotherapy (PT) program after reversed total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) and to summarize the improvements in this population. Methods A search was performed in four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Google Scholar) from its inception to 30 April 2020. Data were extracted to describe the study design and rehab programs. The quality of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, and low-level according to the Evaluation of Quality of an Intervention Study critical appraisal criteria. Results There were 22 eligible studies including two randomized controlled trials, four prospective cohort studies, 10 retrospective reviews, five case-series, and one case-control study, with the sample sizes ranging from 9 to 474 patients followed for 1-10 years. All studies indicated substantial improvement in patients after PT program in terms of functional outcomes and forward flexion. Conclusions High-quality RCTs are required to provide more conclusive results. We identified substantial variation in the post-operative PT programs except for the progressive mobilization strategy and the common management following surgery to increase the soft tissue healing within 4-6 weeks.;2021;4
"Purpose This study aims to evaluate the relevance of telerehabilitation during the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic based on the prevalence of participation and activity International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) domains in a population with disabilities. Design/methodology/approach We perfomed an observational study of ICF files of people with disabilities pre- and post-three-months lockdown imposed by the government to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings ICF qualifiers such as performing the daily routine (d230), using communication devices and techniques (d360) and doing housework (d640) showed a significant decrease of the disabilities (p < 0.05). Instead, a significant increase (p < 0.05) in disability was evident in relating with strangers (d730); informal social relationships (d750); acquiring, keeping and terminating a job (d845); complex economic transactions (d865); community life (d910); and recreation and leisure (d920). Practical implications Telerehabilitation should not be regarded as home-based rehabilitation delivered through technology. The results show how telerehabilitation should be a functional diagnostic tool and monitoring of patients' rehabilitation needs. Originality/value Through a comprehensive classification scale of disability, it is possible to redefine the term telerehabilitation.";2021;4
Purpose To translate and cross-culturally adapt the Ottawa Sitting Scale (OSS) developed for acute care patients into Turkish and to examine its psychometric properties in intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. Methods After translation process the Turkish version of the scale was adminstered to eighty-one patients aged 39-82 years after discharge from the ICU and videotape was recorded. Two physiotherapists watched the videotaped records during the evaluation and scored. Test-retest reliability was assesed by scoring the same video recordings 15 days after the initial scoring. Correlations of the OSS with Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Functional Independence Measurement (FIM), the ICU length of stay and, total mechanical ventilation duration were assessed for convergent validity. Results The intra-class correlation coefficient for inter and intra-rater reliability was 0.989-0.994 and 0.998 respectively. The internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.998). The OSS score was highly correlated with the BBS total score (r = 0.716), the BBS unsupported sitting item score (r = 0.863), and moderately correlated with the total score of the FIM (r = 0.602), the number of days in ICU (r= -0.545), and total mechanical ventilation duration (r = -0.518). Conclusion The Turkish version of OSS has been found to be valid and reliable in assessment of sitting balance in patients discharged from intensive care unit.;2021;4
Purpose To understand the user expectations and the facilitators and barriers of using a virtual multidisciplinary stroke care clinic (virtual clinic). Methods A qualitative descriptive study involving two rounds of face-to-face semi-structured interviews per participant was conducted. We purposively recruited ten participants in Hong Kong who were receiving traditional stroke rehabilitation. The first interview was conducted to explore participants' expectations. The second interview was conducted after a 4-week trial of the virtual clinic. Both interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The findings were translated from Cantonese into English. Results Before using the virtual clinic, the participants perceived a need for (i) information communication technology guidance and support, (ii) familiar hardware and applications, and (iii) services to meet psychosocial needs. Facilitators identified by the participants included (i) feeling safe and supported, (ii) willingness to learn, adapt to, and use the new service, and (iii) ease of use with a flexible schedule. Issues relating to (i) internet connectivity, (ii) hardware, and (iii) interface and design were perceived barriers to the use of the clinic. Conclusion This study provides findings of users' expectations of using telehealth services. Their perspectives on facilitators and barriers may increase the adoption of the newly developed telehealth service.;2021;4
Purpose Until now, the use of telemedical applications in orthopedics was limited to sparsely populated countries. However, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, interest in orthopedics in these procedures has increased significantly. The aim of this systematic review was to find out to what extent there is scientific evidence for the use of telemedicine in the orthopedic field. Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in various databases on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on telemedical applications in orthopedics. Results Altogether, 14 articles were identified that reported about a total of eight RCTs of telemedical applications in orthopedics. Two RCTs were about a patient-to-doctor video consultation and six RCTs were about telerehabilitation after knee and hip arthroplasty (4 x knee arthroplasty, one hip and knee arthroplasty, one hip arthroplasty). For the majority of outcome parameters evaluated, there were no significant differences between the study groups. The cost effectiveness of videoconsultations depended on the workload (number of patient consultations) as well as the effectiveness of telerehabilitation on the distance of the patient's home to the health care center (30 km round-trip). Conclusion There is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of telemedical methods in orthopedics. However, more research is necessary to further expand the possibilities of telemedical methods with regard to physical examination.;2021;4
Purpose. The purpose of this study was to pilot a home-based pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program administered via a telemedicine approach using a combination of fitness application and self-selected activity in lung transplant candidates with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods. We recruited adult patients with CF. The main outcome was adherence, measured by number of sessions completed in 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, six-minute walk distance (6MWD), and dyspnea. Participants were provided a personalized exercise program and equipment including a fitness application that provided exercise videos, recorded exercise time, and corresponding heart rate. We reviewed data daily and provided text messages with feedback We compared our study outcomes to a retrospective data set of CF patients who participated in a 24-session outpatient hospital-based PR program. Data presented as mean +/- standard deviation. Results. Eleven patients participated in the home PR program, 45% female, age 33 +/- 7 years, FEV1 27 +/- 5% predicted. Sessions completed were 19 +/- 12 home-based PR vs. 9 +/- 4 hospital-based PR, p = .03. Fifty percent of the home-based group completed >= 24 sessions in 12 weeks versus 0% of the hospitalbased patients (p = .03). There were no adverse events during exercise. Completers of the home-based program demonstrated a clinically meaningful lower decline in 6 MWD than noncompleters (6MWD -7 +/- 15 vs. -86 +/- 108 meters). Only one participant performed a post 6 MWD in the hospital-based PR. Conclusion. Patients with severe CF demonstrated adherence to home PR delivered using fitness application and self-selected activity with no adverse events. This program style may be a viable solution for telerehabilitation in severe CF and is particularly relevant in the COVID era.;2021;4
Purpose: COVID-19 has shifted models of health care delivery, requiring the rapid adoption of telehealth, despite limited evidence and few resources to guide speech-language pathologists. Management of dysarthria presents specific challenges in the telehealth modality. Evaluations of dysarthria typically rely heavily on perceptual judgments, which are difficult to obtain via telehealth given a variety of technological factors such as inconsistencies in mouth-to-microphone distance, changes to acoustic properties based on device settings, and possible interruptions in connection that may cause video freezing. These factors limit the validity, reliability, and clinicians' certainty of perceptual speech ratings via telehealth. Thus, objective measures to supplement the assessment of dysarthria are essential. Method: This tutorial outlines how to obtain objective measures in real time and from recordings of motor speech evaluations to support traditional perceptual ratings in telehealth evaluations of dysarthria. Objective measures include pause patterns, utterance length, speech rate, diadochokinetic rates, and overall speech severity. We demonstrate, through clinical case vignettes, how these measures were completed following three clinical telehealth evaluations of dysarthria conducted via Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic. This tutorial describes how each of these objective measures were utilized, in combination with subjective perceptual analysis, to determine deviant speech characteristics and their etiology, develop a patient-specific treatment plan, and track change over time. Conclusion: Utilizing objective measures as an adjunct to perceptual ratings for telehealth dysarthria evaluations is feasible under real-world pandemic conditions and can be used to enhance the quality and utility of these evaluations.;2021;4
"Purpose: Enhancing social participation and reducing emotional distress in persons with aphasia (PWA) are a critical rehabilitation goal. Social relationships and meaningful activities performed by PWA are also crucial to promote positive psychosocial well-being. As a precautionary measure specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, most PWA worldwide have generally followed the guidelines of going out less, restricting when and where to gather with friends and peers, reducing social activities, and maintaining appropriate social distance; these acts are contrary to the traditional principles of managing aphasia. This article aims to (a) highlight and add to our understanding of issues related to the impact of the currently evolving COVID-19 pandemic on PWA, (b) direct readers to relevant reports in the literature of telerehabilitation for aphasia to look for useful information regarding remote assessment and therapy to be considered during the pandemic, (c) summarize support initiatives developed and resources compiled thus far as well as provide links for caregivers and PWA to find more information about COVID-19 in their communities, and (d) offer recommendations to potentially move the field of aphasia research and clinical PWA services forward in a positive way to endure the pandemic and in the forthcoming post-COVID world. Conclusions: At present, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the short and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on PWA and their caregivers. It is crucial that different stakeholders be sensitive and flexible when addressing the psychosocial and rehabilitation needs of PWA to mitigate the negative effects during and after the COVID-19 era.";2021;4
Purpose: Falls among persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) decrease health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and are a risk factor for hospitalization. Although physiotherapy can decrease falls and improve functional capacity, people living in remote areas have limited access to such services. This pilot study aimed to document the feasibility of a physiotherapy telerehabilitation intervention for patients with PD and to estimate the change over time in functional capacity, HRQOL, and the rate of falls. Methods: Eleven persons with PD participated in an 8-week physiotherapy telerehabilitation intervention. We assessed feasibility by computing retention rate and assiduity, number of undesirable health events, and technical problems. We assessed functional capacity, HRQOL, and falls at baseline, after the intervention, and at the 3-month follow-up. Results: Retention rate and assiduity were 91% and 100%. We resolved all technical problems (21.9% of sessions). No undesirable health events occurred. Point estimates suggest an improvement in functional capacity (Mini-BESTest) and HRQOL. Forty percent of participants fell during the intervention phase. Conclusion: Physiotherapy telerehabilitation is feasible and safe for persons with PD. Improvements in functional capacity and HRQOL must be confirmed with an appropriate design.;2021;4
Purpose: Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can provide an option for the delivery of intensive aphasia rehabilitation but the users' views (i.e., People with Aphasia) must be considered to ensure satisfaction, motivation and adherence with this mode of rehabilitation. The aim of this literature review is to provide a critical overview of studies where feedback was elicited from participants about their experiences with ICT-delivered aphasia rehabilitation. Methods: A systematic search using six electronic databases was conducted in July 2015 and updated in May 2019. Studies of synchronous telerehabilitation and interventions targeting compensatory strategies were excluded from the review. Studies retrieved were screened for eligibility and information was extracted on the characteristics of each study, methods of data collection and study outcomes. Results: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria including studies with quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods research designs. The studies employed a variety of data collection methods, examining a number of ICT-delivered aphasia rehabilitation activities and the findings investigated aspects of feasibility, usability and acceptance of this mode of rehabilitation. Conclusions: The findings indicate ICT-delivered aphasia rehabilitation is considered an acceptable mode of rehabilitation by people with aphasia who reported generally positive feedback, though variation among personal perspectives and experience is noted. There is currently no consensus measure of self-reported feedback in ICT-delivered aphasia rehabilitation.;2021;4
"Purpose: Stroke survivors living in rural and remote communities experience challenges in accessing specialized rehabilitation services. Access to balance assessment after stroke is an essential aspect of the physiotherapy assessment. Telerehabilitation (TRH) can eliminate access disparities; however, adoption into practice has been limited. Our primary objective was to examine agreement between Berg Balance Scale (BBS) scores obtained through TRH and those obtained through traditional in-person assessment of community-dwelling individuals with stroke. Method: Two raters administered the BBS to 20 community-dwelling individuals with stroke, using both TRH and traditional in-person approaches. The order of assessments and rater assignment was randomized. Interrater reliability between the methods was assessed using Krippendorff's alpha reliability estimate. A survey was then administered to examine the participants' perceptions of the two means of assessment. Results: Excellent interrater agreement was found between TRH and in-person assessment (kappa = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.96, 0.99), and responses regarding patients' perceived hearing and understanding of instructions as well as perceived safety were comparable. In addition, the vast majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would use TRH for future physiotherapy sessions. Conclusions: The results of this study support administration of the BBS using TRH technology; this could improve access to balance assessment for stroke survivors in rural and remote communities.";2021;4
"Purpose: Telerehabilitation could prevent sequelae from COVID-19. We aimed to assess the feasibility of telerehabilitation; describe pulmonary and functional profiles of COVID-19 patients; and explore the effect of telerehabilitation on improving pulmonary symptoms and quality of life. Methods: We conducted a pre-experimental, pre-post pilot study. We recruited COVID-19 patients who had returned home following hospitalization. The intervention included eight weeks of supervised physiotherapy sessions. We documented technological issues, success of recruitment strategies, and participants' attendance to supervised sessions. We measured the impact of pulmonary symptoms on quality of life and functional health. Results: We scheduled 64 supervised sessions with seven participants with few technological issues. Initial scores showed that pulmonary symptoms moderately to highly impacted quality of life. At eight weeks, all patients had improved from 10 to 45 points on the EuroQol-Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) instrument, indicating clinical significance. Conclusion: We developed and administered a telerehabilitation intervention during a global pandemic that targets key symptoms of the relevant disease.";2021;4
"Purpose: The aim of this pilot study is to gather preliminary results on the effectiveness of intensive, parent-oriented, telepractice-based intervention to improve language skills in preschool children with neuromotor and intellectual disorders. Method: Nine preschool children (M = 63 months, SD = 8.7 months) underwent a telepractice program 4 times a week designed to promote speech, lexical, and syntactic skills. Families were remotely connected from home with the therapists, who controlled the rehabilitation procedures from the hospital. The number of stable phonemes, of understood and repeated words, and of understood and repeated sentences were evaluated as outcome measures 3 months (prebaseline) and 1 week (baseline) before the intervention, immediately after the intervention (T1) and at a 3-month follow-up (T2). Results: An increase in the number of stable phonemes was detected after the treatment, even if it was not statistically significant. After the intervention program, there was a significant increase in the number of understood words (ratio T1 vs. baseline: 1.33; 95% CI [1.03, 1.71]) and repeated words (ratio T1 vs. baseline: 1.39; 95% CI [1.00, 1.92]), as well as of understood sentences (ratio T1 vs. baseline: 1.80; 95% CI [1.24, 2.35]) and repeated sentences (ratio T1 vs. baseline: 4.23; 95% CI [1.96, 9.12]). No significant differences were found when comparing all the outcome measures at prebaseline and at baseline. Conclusion: An intensive, parent-oriented, telepractice-based intervention has the potential to increase scores of lexical and syntactic tasks in children with neuromotor and intellectual disorders.";2021;4
Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of tele-speech therapy on the recovery of patients with a stutter. Methods: This research was an interventional study conducted on the patients visiting two rehabilitation centres. In this study, patients with a stutter participated in the tele-speech therapy sessions via Skype. Stuttering Severity Instrument-Fourth Edition was used to determine the severity of stutter before and after the intervention. Results: The results showed a significant difference in the mean scores of stuttering severity before and after tele-speech therapy (p = 0.001). Our findings showed a mean reduction of 13.8% in stuttering scores. More than half of the patients (56.6%) reported a high and very high satisfaction with this treatment method. Conclusions: Tele-speech therapy is an effective way for the treatment of stuttering patients irrespective of their age, gender, and educational background. This method can improve patient's speech and reduce stuttering. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Tele-rehabilitation is an effective way to treat stuttering. Tele-speech therapy can be implemented for any group of stuttering patients. Participants were satisfied with the tele-rehabilitation intervention. Tele-speech therapy accelerates the treatment process. Tele-speech therapy eliminates patient travels to speech therapies.;2021;4
Purpose: The COVID-19 outbreak poses a global crisis in health care delivery system, including habilitation and rehabilitation services. In this study, we shared our experiences on telerehabilitation services established primarily for students with visual disabilities (SwVD) amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its outputs. Methods: Following the lockdown declared on March 23, 2020, the rehabilitative team of a tertiary eye center in north India received information that many visually challenged students (VCS) were stranded in schools for the blind in Delhi, and feeling with anxiety and panic in absence of teachers. Shortly, the room for vision rehabilitation clinic was set-up for telefacilities. The intended services were explained while disseminating the mobile numbers. A semi-structured questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended was developed to record COVID-19 knowledge and concerns. Inductive content analysis was used to report the qualitative information. Results: As of June 30, 2020, a total of 492 clients contacted the team, with maximum from Delhi (41.5%), and predominantly males (78.8%). Around 80.3% of callers were VCS with age range of 11 to 30 years. The two most frequently encountered health needs were itching in eyes (36.1%) and headache (29%). Television news was the most used medium among callers to get COVID-19 information. Cough is a less frequently known mode of transmission (28%), similarly handwashing as a less known for prevention (17.2%). Eight concerns were recorded based on qualitative data analysis. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation provides valuable insights and has the potential to address various concerns, uncertainty, anxiety, and fear among VCS during the pandemic.;2021;4
Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe the development of a new Web platform to optimize self-management after pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for persons living with a chronic respiratory disease (CRD) and to present data on its usability. Method: The Web platform is informed by a theoretical framework of behaviour changes and concepts of self-management and self-efficacy. It uses breathing exercises and a logbook and is meant to be a self-management tool. Usability was tested for 8 months after PR with a group consisting of five patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and one with pulmonary fibrosis. We evaluated adherence (e.g., number of exercise/weeks), quality of life, dyspnoea, and functional capacity. We measured frequency count for adherence and pre-post differences per patient for clinical outcomes. Results: Four participants' adherence was higher than 50% of completed exercises (72 exercise/weeks). Five of six participants showed maintenance of functional capacity (6-minute walk test) 8 months after PR. Four participants showed maintenance of their quality of life. Four participants showed a deterioration in dyspnoea on the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion. Conclusions: We developed a new theory-informed Web platform to optimize self-management after PR for persons living with a CRD. The pilot Web platform appears to optimize adherence to self-management techniques and possibly stabilize people's health outcomes.;2021;4
Purpose: The purpose of this clinical focus article is to illustrate an interprofessional cognitive rehabilitation approach. Invited experts representing physical medicine and rehabilitation, clinical neuropsychology/rehabilitation psychology, registered nurse care coordination, and speech-language pathology share viewpoints from their discipline to engage in collaborative interventions with the goal of enhancing treatment outcomes. Conclusions: Treating the multifactorial symptoms of concussion requires expertise from an interdisciplinary team (IDT) of professionals, contributing unique perspectives and providing integrative services to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for patients. Speech-language pathologists serve an important role on IDTs to deliver personalized, targeted therapies for prolonged or persistent postconcussion cognitive impairment.;2021;4
"Purpose: The use of technology (e.g., telehealth) in clinical settings has rapidly increased and its use in research settings continues to grow. The aim of this report is to present one potential solution to a clinical issue, that of virtual and remote assessment for the purposes of spoken language research in persons with aphasia. To do so, we report detailed methods for conducting a multi-timepoint (test-retest) virtual paradigm, assessing lifestyle, physiological, cognitive, and 1inguistic factors in persons with and without aphasia. Methods: Procedures for virtual assessment are detailed in a sample of non-brain damaged adults (NB; N=24) and persons with aphasia (PWA; N=25) on a test-retest paradigm (data collection approximately 10 +/- 3 days apart). This report provides practical information about pre-assessment (e.g., recruitment, scheduling), assessment (e.g., aphasia-friendly consent presentation, investigator fidelity), and post-assessment (e.g., data storage, quality check) procedures for human behavior research using a virtual platform. Results: Preliminary study data are provided, indicating high retention rates, high rates of data acquisition, and feasibility. Common technological troubles and solutions are discussed, and solutions offered. The results suggest that our pre-assessment, assessment, and post-assessment procedures contributed to the success of our study. Conclusion: We provide a practical methodology for conducting a multi-timepoint study, with considerations for persons with aphasia, adding to the body of research on telehealth in clinical populations. Future studies should continue to evaluate tele-methodology, which may be core for diversifying studies, improving study retention, and enrolling larger sample sizes.";2021;4
Purpose: To carry out a systematic review about the information about the application of of virtual reality and videogames in cardiac rehabilitation. Methods: A systematic review was conducted. Jadad scale was applied to evaluate the methodological quality of the articles included and the degree of evidence and the level of recommendation were determined through the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. PRISMA guidelines statement for systematic reviews were followed. Results: The total number of articles included in the present review was 10, with heterogeneity in the study populations, cardiac rehabilitation phases, technology used and protocols. Most of the studies showed an increase in heart rate, less pain, a greater ability to walk, higher energy levels, an increase in physical activity and improvements of motivation and adherence. The methodological quality of the studies was between acceptable and poor. Conclusions: The use of virtual reality and videogames could be considered as complementary tools of physical training in patients with cardiovascular diseases in the different phases of cardiac rehabilitation. However, it is also necessary to carry out studies with adequate methodological quality to determine the ideal technological systems, target populations and clearly protocols to study their effects in the short, medium and long-term assessments.;2021;4
Purpose: To examine the experiences of people with ALS (pALS) and their communication partners (cALS) regarding receiving speech-generating device (SGD) evaluation and treatment via telepractice. Method: Eight pALS along with a primary cALS participated in telepractice SGD evaluation and treatment with an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) specialist and representatives from multiple SGD vendors. Participants were interviewed postevaluation and post-SGD training to examine their experiences. Mixed methods data were collected through Likert scale responses and qualitative interviews. Results: Telepractice SGD evaluation and training were feasible and resulted in all pALS receiving SGDs they were able to use to communicate. In both Likert rating items and qualitative interviews, participants rated the telepractice experience very highly in terms of giving them access to AAC services via an AAC specialist that they would not have otherwise been able to access, and doing so in a format that was possible given their limitations in mobility, endurance, and caregiver availability. Suggestions for improving the telepractice experience were provided. Conclusions: Telepractice should be considered as an option to provide vital SGD services to patients who are geographically remote, mobility impaired, unable to leave their home, experience fatigue with travel, or otherwise would not have access to these specialized services. Telepractice allows patients to preserve their time and energy for the assessment and treatment sessions, resulting in perhaps deeper and more frequent engagement in evaluation and training. Telepractice could serve as an alternative to outpatient, in-person evaluations, or be utilized in conjunction with in-person appointments.;2021;4
Purpose: To investigate COPD patients' experience on the mastering of their illness during participation in a long-term interprofessional and cross-sectoral telerehabilitation programme called > C(sic)PD-Life>>. Materials and methods: A phenomenological-hermeneutic study design with combined participant observations and individual interviews formed a continuous data generation among fifteen patients while they participated in the programme. Data underwent a three-levelled interpretation inspired by the theory of the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur. Results: During participation in > C(sic)PD-Life>> patients experienced an improvement in how to master their living with COPD. They felt invigorated by an interprofessional rehabilitation team to raise how to deal with physical, mental, social and relational challenges. Programme participation was experienced as surprisingly easy by the patients. Conclusions: The telerehabilitation solution > C(sic)PD-Life>>provides benefits for COPD patients who report improved illness-mastering, attendance and outcome of rehabilitation, as well as enhanced physical and social activity. As an assistive technology intervention, > C(sic)PD-Life>>appears to be a valuable addition to existing rehabilitation programmes. However, more knowledge is required to further understand the full-range capacity and impact of tele-based pulmonary rehabilitation.;2021;4
"Purpose: To provide a theoretically grounded understanding of engagement in interactive computer play-based motor therapies by children with cerebral palsy in home settings. Methods: A motivational framework for engagement and its relationship with three contemporary theories (self-determination theory, expectancy-value theory, social cognitive theory of self-regulation) was overviewed. A scoping review was conducted to understand how engagement is influenced by features of the technology and intervention design that impact intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, child and parent values and expectancies, and the processes of self-regulation. Multiple reviewers screened and extracted data from 26 articles describing home-based clinical trials of interactive computer play-based motor interventions for children with cerebral palsy. A narrative synthesis framework was used for analysis. Results: Features of the technology and the intervention influence feelings of autonomy (e.g., personalization), competence (e.g., calibration), and relatedness (e.g., social play, virtual therapist/coach). There may be multiple and differently valued goals in interactive computer play-based interventions (e.g., game- and therapy-focused) that, if disconnected or unmet, negatively impact engagement. Multiplayer interactions, real-time feedback and progress tracking provide information that influences self-regulation and engagement over time. Conclusions: Optimizing engagement in interactive computer play-based motor interventions requires closer alignment with client-led values/goals; design of technologies and interventions that sustain intrinsic motivation; and feedback that informs/builds self-efficacy.";2021;4
Purpose:The aim of this study was to assess physiotherapists' clinical use and acceptance of a novel telemonitoring platform to facilitate the recording of measurements during rehabilitation of patients following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Additionally, suggestions for platform improvement were explored. Methods:Physiotherapists from seven Dutch private physiotherapy practices participated in the study. Data were collected through log files, a technology acceptance questionnaire and focus group meetings using the buy a feature method. Data regarding platform use and acceptance (7-point/11-point numeric rating scale) were descriptively analysed. Total scores were calculated for the features suggested to improve the platform, based on the priority rating (1 = nice to have, 2 = should have, 3 = must have). Results:Participating physiotherapists (N= 15, mean [SD] age 33.1 [9.1] years) together treated 52 patients during the study period. Platform use by the therapists was generally limited, with the number of log-ins per patient varying from 3 to 73. Overall, therapists' acceptance of the platform was low to moderate, with average (SD) scores ranging from 2.5 (1.1) to 4.9 (1.5) on the 7-point Likert scale. The three most important suggestions for platform improvement were: (1) development of a native app, (2) system interoperability, and (3) flexibility regarding type and frequency of measurements. Conclusions:Even though health care professionals were involved in the design of the telemonitoring platform, use in routine care was limited. Physiotherapists recognized the relevance of using health technology, but there are still barriers to overcome in order to successfully implement eHealth in routine care.;2021;4
"Question: What are the core capabilities that physiotherapists need in order to deliver quality care via videoconferencing? Design: A three-round modified e-Delphi survey. Participants: An international Delphi panel comprising a Steering Group and experts in the field, including physiotherapy researchers, physiotherapy clinicians, representatives of physiotherapy organisations, and consumers. Methods: The draft framework was developed by the research team and Steering Group, based on relevant documents identified within the literature. The panel considered a draft framework of 73 specific capabilities mapped across eight domains. Over three rounds, panellists rated their agreement (Likert or numerical rating scales) on whether each capability was essential (core) for physiotherapists to deliver quality care via videoconferencing. Those capabilities achieving consensus, defined as 75% of the panel ratings being > 7 out of 10 in Round 3, were retained. Results: A total of 130 panellists from 32 countries participated in Round 1, with retention rates of 65% and 60% in Rounds 2 and 3, respectively. The final framework comprised 60 capabilities across seven domains: compliance (n = 7 capabilities); patient privacy and confidentiality (n = 4); patient safety (n = 7); technology skills (n = 7); telehealth delivery (n = 16); assessment and diagnosis (n = 7); and care planning and management (n = 12). Conclusion: This framework outlines the specific core capabilities required of physiotherapists to provide quality care via videoconferencing. The core capability framework provides guidance for physiotherapists to deliver care via videoconferencing and will help inform future development of physiotherapy curricula and professional development initiatives in the delivery of telehealth.

Question: What were the experiences of physiotherapists and patients who consulted via videoconference during the COVID-19 pandemic and how was it implemented? Design: Mixed methods study with cross-sectional national online surveys and qualitative analysis of free-text responses. Participants: A total of 207 physiotherapists in private practice or community settings and 401 patients aged >= 18 years who consulted (individual and/or group) via videoconference from April to November 2020. Methods: Separate customised online surveys were developed for physiotherapists and patients. Data were collected regarding the implementation of videoconferencing (cost, software used) and experience with videoconferencing (perceived effectiveness, safety, ease of use and comfort communicating, each scored on a 4-point ordinal scale). Qualitative content analysis was performed of physiotherapists' free-text responses about perceived facilitators, barriers and safety issues. Results: Physiotherapists gave moderate-to-high ratings for the effectiveness of and their satisfaction with videoconferencing. Most intended to continue to offer individual consultations (81%) and group classes (60%) via videoconferencing beyond the pandemic. For individual consultations and group classes, respectively, most patients had moderately or extremely positive perceptions about ease of technology use (94%, 91%), comfort communicating (96%, 86%), satisfaction with management (92%, 93%), satisfaction with privacy/security (98%, 95%), safety (99% both) and effectiveness (83%, 89%). Compared with 68% for group classes, 47% of patients indicated they were moderately or extremely likely to choose videoconferencing for individual consultations in the future. Technology was predominant as both a facilitator and barrier. Falls risk was the main safety factor. Conclusion: Patients and physiotherapists had overall positive experiences using videoconferencing for individual consultations and group classes. The results suggest that videoconferencing is a viable option for the delivery of physiotherapy care in the future. (C) 2021 Australian Physiotherapy Association. Published by Elsevier B.V.;2021;4
Questions: How effective is home-based exercise therapy delivered using advanced telehealth technology (ATT-ET) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with: no exercise therapy (ET), in/outpatient ET, and home-based ET without ATT? Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials. Participants: People with stable COPD referred for ET. Intervention: ATT-ET. Outcome measures: Exercise capacity, quality of life, functional dyspnoea, cost-effectiveness and various secondary outcomes. Results: Fifteen eligible trials involved 1,522 participants. Compared with no ET, ATT-ET improved exercise capacity (four studies, 6-minute walk test MD 15 m, 95% CI 5 to 24) and probably improved quality of life (four studies, SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.43) and functional dyspnoea (two studies, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire-Dyspnoea MD 2, 95% CI 0 to 4). ATT-ET had a similar effect as in/outpatient ET on functional dyspnoea (two studies, SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.29) and a similar or better effect on quality of life (two studies, SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.50) but its relative effect on exercise capacity was very uncertain (three studies, 6-minute walk test MD 6 m, 95% CI -26 to 37). ATT-ET had a similar effect as home-based ET without ATT on exercise capacity (three studies, 6-minute walk test MD 2 m, 95% CI -16 to 19) and similar or better effects on quality of life (three studies, SMD 0.79, 95% CI -0.04 to 1.62) and functional dyspnoea (two studies, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire-Dyspnoea MD 2, 95% CI 0 to 4). ATT-ET had effects on most secondary outcomes that were similar to or better than each comparator. Conclusion: ATT-ET improves exercise capacity, functional dyspnoea and quality of life compared with no ET, although some benefits may be small. Its benefits are generally similar to in/outpatient ET and similar to or better than home-based ET without ATT. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020165773. (c) 2020 Australian Physiotherapy Association.

"Rehabilitation needs are increasing globally due to population growth, aging population, high survival rates for people with disability, and severe health conditions. In the past few years, new telecommunication-based practices, including various forms of e-rehabilitation have gained attention all over the world, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Telerehabilitation is an alternative way of delivering rehabilitation services in which information and communication technologies are used to expedite communication between the health care professional and the patient at a distant location. It can be beneficial to people in rural areas, especially individuals in isolated communities. At present, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced speedy adoption of telerehabilitation due to restricted traditional in-person visits all over the world, including KSA; however, no telerehabilitation guidelines are available in the country. Since specialized rehabilitation services are limited to main cities of the country, the provision of care by reaching out the underserved areas using telemedicine technology is deemed important. These guidelines were established collaboratively by panel of various rehabilitation experts with input from other practitioners in the field and strategic stakeholders. It will facilitate rehabilitation clinicians practicing in KSA providing consultation, counseling, education, assessment, monitoring, therapy, or follow-up to a patient remotely using telemedicine communication technologies. This document includes administrative, clinical, and technical guidelines, which are aimed to standardize telerehabilitation practice across the country. The core principles are based on standards set forth by American Telemedicine Association and are guided by telemedicine policy in KSA. Additionally, ethical considerations of telerehabilitation practice pertinent to Saudi culture and health care system are elaborated as well. This document serves as a general guide for the provision of telerehabilitation services and do not describe a specialty-specific clinical practice guideline.";2021;4
Rehabilitation of memory remains an unmet need for many stroke survivors. Telehealth methods may provide a solution, however evidence supporting the efficacy of remotely-delivered therapy is needed. A non-concurrent multiple baseline design was used with randomized onset of intervention across five individuals with chronic stroke-related memory complaints. A six-week compensatory memory skills programme was delivered individually via internet videoconferencing. Target behaviours of frequencies of self-reported lapses of everyday and prospective memory were measured weekly across baseline, intervention, and follow-up phases. A secondary outcome of functional goal attainment was measured once per phase, with participants setting two personal rehabilitation goals. Data were analysed visually and statistically. Improvements in memory functioning were statistically significant on at least one measure of target behaviour for four out of five participants at intervention or follow-up. Visual evidence of level change indicated at least modest improvements for all participants by follow-up. All participants attained at least one functional goal by follow-up. High rates of treatment adherence and participant satisfaction were observed. Technological issues were minimal and did not impact content delivery or engagement. These results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of a telehealth-delivered rehabilitation programme in improving memory function and achieving memory-related goals for stroke survivors.;2021;4
"SIGNIFICANCE A recent trend in low vision rehabilitation has been the use of portable head-mounted displays to enhance residual vision. Our study confirms the feasibility of telerehabilitation and informs the development of evidence-based recommendations to improve telerehabilitation interventions to reduce device abandonment. PURPOSE To develop evidence-based recommendations for telerehabilitation, we conducted a feasibility study in preparation for a future randomized trial on the use of head-mounted displays. METHODS We recruited novice eSight Eyewear users, randomized 1:1: the experimental group received telerehabilitation by a low vision therapist using video conferencing; the control group completed at home self-training provided by the device manufacturer. The primary feasibility outcomes were whether the recruitment goal of 60 participants (30/group) was attainable within 1 year and how participants judged the accessibility and acceptability of the telerehabilitation. An exploratory outcome was the impact of telerehabilitation on eSight Eyewear use behavior. RESULTS Among 333 eSight users, 57 participants were enrolled, of which 35% withdrew from the study, whereas the remainder completed the 6-month follow-up. The withdrawal rate was higher in the control group but did not differ significantly from the experimental group. High accessibility (93% of participants accessed the platform) and global acceptability (100% overall satisfaction) were reported among those who completed the telerehabilitation protocol. The therapist had no difficulty judging the participants' reading performances qualitatively while participants used their device to read their eSkills and VisExc guides. Most participants improved their daily activities, based on qualitative reports of the attained goals. Seventy-nine percent of individuals declined to participate, whereas 16% of participants decided not to use eSight Eyewear anymore. CONCLUSIONS The data demonstrated the feasibility of a randomized controlled telerehabilitation study for people with low vision using a head-mounted display. Positive feedback from the participants and the therapist suggests the potential value of this modality for low vision services.";2021;4
"SIGNIFICANCE Head-mounted low vision devices have become a viable alternative to enhance residual vision. This study supports the use of a head-mounted display to improve aspects of functional vision and quality of life. Much is still unknown regarding the required frequency, duration, or potential effectiveness of this telerehabilitation training protocol or what characteristics best identify optimal users. PURPOSE A randomized study explored the effect of telerehabilitation on quality of life and functional vision in individuals with low vision using a head-mounted display. METHODS We recruited 57 participants (age, 21 to 82 years; mean, 54.5 years) among new prospective eSight Eyewear users, randomized 1:1 into two parallel groups; the experimental group received the telerehabilitation training provided by a low vision therapist, whereas the control group received the self-training standard offered by the device manufacturer and without involvement of a low vision therapist. The primary outcome measures were the impact of telerehabilitation on validated measures of assistive technology-related quality of life: the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale and the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology scale. Exploratory outcomes were the assessment of self-reported functional vision using the Veterans Affairs Low Vision Visual Functioning Questionnaire-48 and cybersickness associated with head-mounted display use with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. RESULTS Assistive technology-related quality of life was improved when measured by the satisfaction scale but not the psychosocial scale within the first 3 months, independently of training type. Overall, functional vision improvement was observed within the first 2 weeks of device use and maintained during the 6-month study, independently of group type. Cybersickness outcomes were similar between training groups and did not change significantly for 6 months. CONCLUSIONS eSight Eyewear, either with telerehabilitation or with the manufacturer self-training comparison, improved functional vision and increased users' quality of life within the initial 3 months of device training and practice.";2021;4
Speech-language therapists along with affected individuals face various challenges for accomplishing the rehabilitation services. In the current COVID19 pandemic scenario, telerehabilitation has emerged as a substitute to the traditional face-to-face therapy, and is the only option possible in some cases. To subjectively assess the feasibility & acceptability of telerehabilitation provided by speech-language pathologist to patients of speech and language disorders. This qualitative study includes 20 patients suffering from disorders of fluency, voice, swallowing and neurogenic disorders. The participants included were undergoing face-to-face therapy at our institute. After the completion of face-to-face session series, telerehabilitation services were provided through a video calling app. The outcomes of teletherapy were assessed subjectively using a structured questionnaire on 11 parameters using a Likert scale. Of the included 20 patients, after completion of teletherapy, four patients chose the physical interaction as the preferred mode of therapy while 16 chose teletherapy as the preferred mode. Except three clients who rated their overall satisfaction as '3', others rated as '4' or '5'. The therapists were satisfied with the outcomes in 17 cases, and were pleased with the overall progress of all the clients (rated 4 or 5). Telerehabilitation is a reliable method to deliver speech and language services at community level, on long-term basis, as is proven by the high satisfaction scores among the clients as well as the service providers.;2021;4
"Static and dynamic posture analysis was a critical clinical examination in physiotherapy and rehabilitation. It was a time-consuming task for clinicians, so a semi-automatic method can facilitate this process as well as provide well-documented medical records and strong infrastructure for deep learning scenarios. The current research presents a mechatronics platform for static and real-time dynamic posture analysis, which consisted of hybrid computational modules. Our study was a developmental and applied research according to a system development life cycle. The designed modules are as follows: (1) a mechanical structure includes patient place, 360-degree engine, mirror, laser, distance meter, and cams; (2) a software module includes data collection, electronic medical record, semi-automatic image analysis, annotation, and reporting, and (3) a network to exchange raw data with deep learning server. Patients were informed about the research by their healthcare provider and all data were transformed into a Fourier format, in which the patients remained autonomous without a bit of information. The results show acceptable reliability and validity of the instruments. Also, a telerehabilitation application was designed to cover the patients after diagnosis. We suggest a longer time for data acquisition. It will lead to a more accurate and fully automated dynamic posture analysis. The result of this study suggest that the designed mechatronics device used in conjunction with smartphone application is a valid tool that can be used to obtain reliable measurements.";2021;4
Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. Recent studies have shown that high doses of repeated task-specific practice can be effective at improving upper-limb function at the chronic stage. Providing at-home telerehabilitation services with therapist supervision may allow higher dose interventions targeted to this population. Additionally, muscle biofeedback to train patients to avoid unwanted simultaneous activation of antagonist muscles (co-contractions) may be incorporated into telerehabilitation technologies to improve motor control. Here, we present the development and feasibility of a low-cost, portable, telerehabilitation biofeedback system called Tele-REINVENT. We describe our modular electromyography acquisition, processing, and feedback algorithms to train differentiated muscle control during at-home therapist-guided sessions. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of low-cost sensors for our training task with two healthy individuals. Finally, we present the results of a case study with a stroke survivor who used the system for 40 sessions over 10 weeks of training. In line with our previous research, our results suggest that using low-cost sensors provides similar results to those using research-grade sensors for low forces during an isometric task. Our preliminary case study data with one patient with stroke also suggest that our system is feasible, safe, and enjoyable to use during 10 weeks of biofeedback training, and that improvements in differentiated muscle activity during volitional movement attempt may be induced during a 10-week period. Our data provide support for using low-cost technology for individuated muscle training to reduce unintended coactivation during supervised and unsupervised home-based telerehabilitation for clinical populations, and suggest this approach is safe and feasible. Future work with larger study populations may expand on the development of meaningful and personalized chronic stroke rehabilitation.;2021;4
Stroke recovery therapies promote favorable neural plasticity, both during spontaneous recovery and the chronic phase. Activity-based therapies based on intense practice, some aided by integration of computers and telehealth, have shown promise. These studies emphasize key therapeutic variables such as dose, intensity, and timing. Preclinical drug studies have shown promise, but human translation has been challenged by identifying the target patient subgroup, requirements for concomitant training, and aligning biomarkers with preclinical evidence.;2021;4
Stroke represents a global concern that currently affects a significant part of the world's population. Physical rehabilitation plays a fundamental role for stroke patients to recover mobility and improve quality of life. This process is costly, considering that patients must attend face-to-face rehabilitation sessions in hospitals or rehabilitation centers. Plus, there is a lack of specialized medical staff, who are usually insufficient to properly address the growing number of stroke patients that need physical rehabilitation. This situation has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as some of the human resources have been devoted to fight against the pandemic, and the physical presence of rehabilitation patients in hospitals has been severely limited. This paper proposes PhyRe Up!, a novel remote rehabilitation system that uses mixed reality and gamification techniques. PhyRe Up! has been devised for stroke patients to perform therapeutic exercises at home, with great precision, and with the potential supervision of clinicians. The system aims to increase the patient's motivation as well as maintaining the quality of performance for the exercises, similar to the obtained levels when attending face-to-face sessions with therapists. The underlying architecture combines declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge to manage the rehabilitation process, which offers flexibility and scalability to enhance the capabilities of the proposed system. Experimental results highlight how the combination of mixed reality and gamification significantly influences the accuracy of rehabilitation exercises previously defined by therapists. Particularly, the conducted experiments in the first validation phase of PhyRe Up! shows that our proposal drastically reduces the intermediate steps required to complete an exercise thanks to the provided visual feedback. The accuracy with which the patient performs the assessed exercise for the first time is greater than when using traditional rehabilitation techniques.;2021;4
Stroke survivors commonly experience unilateral muscle weakness, which limits their engagement in daily activities. Bimanual training has been demonstrated to effectively recover coordinated movements among those patients. We developed a low cost telerehabilitation platform dedicated to bimanual exercise, where the patient manipulates a dowel to control a computer program. Data on movement is collected using a Microsoft Kinect sensor and an inertial measurement unit to interface the platform, as well as to assess motor performance remotely. Toward automatic classification of bimanual movements executed by the user, we test the performance of a linear and a nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques.;2021;4
"Studies on end-user adaptable applications for rehabilitation aim to offer exercises to patients based on their therapeutic goals and individual advances. The process of adapting the applications is usually done by therapists, who have the clinical knowledge necessary for the effective design of the exercises; thus, their participation is essential in this process. In this sense, it is crucial that studies on adaptable applications consider their relevance for various users: patients who use an application (potential end users) and therapists who perform the process of adapting the application (end users). This study aims, through a systematic review, to identify how the use of adaptable applications has contributed, in the context of rehabilitation, not only to the treatment of patients but also to therapists in their work, in addition to identifying how they have addressed the process of adaptation and extension of the applications. A total of 28 studies from four electronic databases were considered and analyzed. The results indicate promising benefits for patients and some benefits that support the therapist's work. However, there are some difficulties faced by therapists in the use and adoption of the applications. Further studies on the impact of adaptable applications in view of the end users (therapists adapting the applications) are needed. A longer-term follow-up is required to evaluate the treatment outcomes in the patients and improve the required aspects according to therapeutic contexts.";2021;4
Study Design: This is a systematic review. Objective: To systematically review (1) the reliability of the physical examination of the spine using telehealth as it pertains to spinal pathology and (2) patient satisfaction with the virtual spine physical examination. Methods: We searched EMBASE, PubMed, Medline Ovid, and SCOPUS databases from inception until April 2020. Eligible studies included those that reported on performing a virtual spine physical examination. Two reviewers independently assessed all potential studies for eligibility and extracted data. The primary outcome of interest was the reliability of the virtual spine physical exam. Secondary outcomes of interest were patient satisfaction with the virtual encounter. Results: A total of 2321 studies were initially screened. After inclusion criteria were applied, 3 studies (88 patients) were included that compared virtual with in-person spine physical examinations. These studies showed acceptable reliability for portions of the low back virtual exam. Patient satisfaction surveys were conducted in 2 of the studies and showed general satisfaction (>80% would recommend). Conclusions: These results suggest that the virtual spine examination may be comparable to the in-person physical examination for low back pain, though there is a significant void in the literature regarding the reliability of the physical examination as it pertains to specific surgical pathology of the spine. Because patients are overall satisfied with virtual spine assessments, validating a virtual physical examination of the spine is an important area that requires further research.;2021;4
Supervised, center-based, daily physiotherapy presents limitations: transport, need for an accompanying person, or risk of infection. Home-based rehabilitation protocols (HBRP) can be effective alternatives. We use a HBRP for the nonsurgically treated proximal humeral fractures (PHF) in older patients. Objectives: To assess patient satisfaction and preferences of using a booklet, videos, or an app to guide physiotherapy. Patients and methods: Prospective, single-center observational study of patients >= 55 years old who sustained a non-surgically treated PHF. The HBRP consisted of immediate mobilization, followed by 5 physiotherapist-guided, weekly sessions of rehabilitation and standard physiotherapy after 3 months, if needed. A booklet with images, videos, or a smartphone application were offered to guide the patients. Results: Mean degree of satisfaction (1-5) was 4.66 +/- .9: 84 patients (82.4%) were very satisfied, 11 patients (10.8%) were satisfied, and 5 patients (4.9%) were not satisfied at all. Mean Oxford Shoulder Score achieved was 40.5 +/- 6.6. 59.8% patients preferred the booklet and 29.4% the videos. Exercise compliance was considered very high in 87.3% of patients, while 4% hardly never followed the HBRP. Only 17.7% patients needed center-based physiotherapy after the HBRP. Discussion: Reasons for satisfaction were good final functional outcome, no need for transportation, being away from hospital, immediate rehabilitation availability and being capable of maintaining independence. Adherence is a major concern. Videos are more didactic explaining the exercises. Conclusion: If standard physiotherapy is not available, the HBRP can be a valid treatment option for PHF management in older patients, with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Older patients preferred the booklet to guide physiotherapy.;2021;4
"SYNOPSIS: Telehealth is rapidly being implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite evidence for the effectiveness of telehealth for musculoskeletal examination and treatment, there is a lack of clear guidance related to implementation. We provide recommendations on practical concerns related to delivering telehealth, including choice of platform; legal, ethical, and administrative considerations; building a webside manner; and implications for musculoskeletal examination and treatment.";2021;4
"Tele-(remote) rehabilitation is attracting increased attention from society, including the research community and commercial marketplace with an estimated global market value of $160 billion. Meanwhile, mobile device-based healthcare (mHealth) has appeared as a revolutionary approach to tele-rehabilitation practice. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on smartphone-based systems designed for remote facilitation of physical rehabilitation. A total of 74 documents from Web of Science search results were reviewed. Systems were classified based on target medical conditions, and a taxonomy of technology was created along with identification of monitored activities. Beyond monitoring, some systems also provide patient-caregiver communication and progress management functions. The review identifies major research interests in stroke, cardiac disease, balance impairment and joint/limb rehabilitation; however, there is a lack of attention to other diseases. There are also few systems that have computerized existing clinical tests. On the basis of the review, design recommendations are formulated to encourage implementation of advanced functionalities, usability considerations, and system validation based on clinical evidence. Results of this study may help researchers and companies to design functions and interactions of smartphone-based rehabilitation systems or to select technology.";2021;4
Telehealth (TH) intervention is a method to optimize self-management (SM) support in stroke survivors. Objectives of this study included identifying the TH-SM intervention's focus and SM support components, the TH delivery type, and the TH-SM support effects on stroke survivors. Five databases were searched for the years 2005-2020 to identify TH-SM support interventions for stroke survivors. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental, one-group re-post study designs were included. Ten studies were reviewed. TH-SM support focused on post-stroke depression, obesity management, participation, functional mobility, and activities of daily living. The TH delivery type most used in selected studies was messaging. Regarding the SM support components, the education component was used in all studies, and psychological support and lifestyle advice and support were used in 8 out of 10 studies. TH-SM intervention had positive effects in terms of goal achievement for SM behavior, emotional state, and mobility of clinical outcomes, and TH acceptance in stroke survivors. Although the TH-SM-supported intervention effects were not found consistently in all outcomes, this review discovered a positive effect on various SM-related outcomes. In addition, TH delivery types and SM support components showed the possibility of various options to be considered for intervention. Therefore, we suggest that TH-SM supported intervention is a positive alternative for SM support in stroke survivors.;2021;4
Telehealth cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a feasible and effective alternative to conventional outpatient CR. Present evidence is limited on the comparison of exercise intensity adherence in telehealth and outpatient CR. The purpose of the study was to evaluate and compare training intensity adherence through 12-week phase II CR in telehealth and outpatient CR. A sample of 56 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with a mean age of 56.7 +/- 7.1 entering comprehensive secondary prevention phase II was randomized into telehealth CR (n = 28) and control outpatient CR (n = 28) groups. The primary outcome was a comparison of training intensity adherence in both CR models and heart rate (HR) response from individual CR sessions, expressed by the HR reserve percentage. As a result, the parameter HR reserve percentage as the total average of the training intensity during the telehealth intervention and the outpatient CR did not differ statistically (p = 0.63). There was no death case, and all severe adverse cases required medical admission throughout an exercise training session in study subjects in both groups. This research evidence demonstrated that the telehealth CR model is similar in training intensities to the conventional outpatient CR in CAD patients with low to moderate cardiovascular risk.;2021;4
Telehealth has been referred has an innovative solution for COPD patient treatment, minimizing the costs related with medical assistance while improving the patient care support and health outcomes. We have designed an innovative telehealth program of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) that aims to increase long term adherence of patient to physical activity (PA), self-care management of health condition and facilitation of social participation following an approach of community-based intervention, taking account the patient preferences. Therefore, our telehealth program combine education sessions, exercise training and follow up of health outcomes using a mobile application and a wrist oximeter, through bluetooth technology, for facilitating outdoor exercise and social participation of people living with COPD.

Telehealth is the delivery of many health care services and technologies to individuals at different geographical areas and is categorized as asynchronously or synchronously. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major disruptions in health care delivery to breast cancer (BCa) patients and there is increasing demand for telehealth services. Globally, telehealth has become an essential means of communication between patient and health care provider. The application of telehealth to the treatment of BCa patients is evolving and increasingly research has demonstrated its feasibility and effectiveness in improving clinical, psychological and social outcomes. Two areas of telehealth that have significantly grown in the past decade and particularly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic are telerehabilitation and teleoncology. These two technological systems provide opportunities at every stage of the cancer care continuum for BCa patients. We conducted a literature review that examined the use of telehealth services via its various modes of delivery among BCa patients particularly in areas of screening, diagnosis, treatment modalities, as well as satisfaction among patients and health care professionals. The advantages of telehealth models of service and delivery challenges to patients in remote areas are discussed.</p>;2021;4
Telehealth refers to the application of telecommunications technology to deliver clinical services at a distance by linking clinician to patient, caregiver, or any person(s) involved in client care for assessment, intervention, consultation, and supervision. Telehealth for occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), and speech and language pathology (SLP) have produced service delivery venues that are of great benefit during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The concept of telehealth for rehabilitation services is relatively new in the Middle East, and no specialty-specific clinical practice standards or guidelines are published to guide the rehabilitation practitioners. Therefore, a specialty-specific telehealth practice guide for rehabilitation practitioners has been developed by an expert panel in the field of rehabilitation. This guide is documented in this article. Such a guide will be beneficial when providing tele-evaluation, teleintervention/telerehabilitation, teleconsultation, and telemonitoring through communication technologies. The purpose of this guide is to enable understanding of core telehealth clinical principles and aid the provision of OT, PT, and SLP telehealth services in Saudi Arabia. Also, the guide can potentially be implemented in other Middle Eastern countries. The guide is based on key telehealth guidelines involving the American Occupational Therapy Association telehealth resources, American Physical Therapy Association, American Speech and Hearing Association, telemedicine policies in Saudi Arabia by the national health information center at the Saudi Health Council, and a blueprint for telerehabilitation guidelines that are based on the American Telemedicine Association's Core Standards for Telemedicine Operations.;2021;4
"Telehealth systems have shown success in the remote management of several neurological disorders, but there is a paucity of evidence in disorders of consciousness (DOC). In this study, we explore the effectiveness of a new telemonitoring system, for monitoring Vegetative State (VS) and Minimally Conscious State (MCS) patients. This was a prospective, mono-center randomized controlled study. We included only traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients who required long-term motor/cognitive assistance having a stable clinical condition. We examined their clinical evolution over similar to 4 years of the follow-up period. Twenty-two TBI patients were enrolled and equally divided into two groups: one telemonitored at home with our service and the second admitted to a standard long-stay hospitalization (LSH) program. Patients enrolled in the telehealth service (age: 49.9 +/- 20.4; 45% female; diagnosis: 36% VS/64% MCS) were demographically and clinically-matched with those admitted to the LSH program (age: 55.1 +/- 15; 18% female; diagnosis: 54% VS/46% MCS). Thirty-six percent of patients in the LSH program died before completing follow up evaluation with respect to 18% of death in the group of TBI patients telemonitored at home. At follow-up, patients in LSH and telemonitoring groups showed similar clinical progression, as measured by CRS-r, NCS, WHIM, and LCF scales, as well as by the number of medical complications (i.e., bedsores, infections). Finally, we estimated the total daily cost per patient. Severe TBI patients enrolled in the conventional LSH program cost 262euro every single day, whereas the cost per patient in the telehealth service resulted to be less expensive (93euro). Here, we highlight that our telehealth monitoring service is as efficacious as in-person usual care to manage a severe neurological disorder such as TBI in a cost-effective way.";2021;4
Telemedicine involves diagnostic, therapeutic and educational services being offered remotely by healthcare professionals to exchange crucial clinical information. It is a rapidly developing form of medical activity and part of medical industry, with advanced technologies already available in Poland. Cardiology is one of the fields in which telemedicine methods were pioneered and introduced into everyday practice. Some of these methods have already become standard procedures for diagnosis and treatment in some Polish centers, with other soon to follow. Clinical study results not only demonstrate reliability and usefulness of telemedicine technologies but also show that their use in clinical practice improves the patients' prognoses and quality of life. Moreover, study results in highly developed countries show a potential cost-effectiveness of telemedicine from the perspective of healthcare systems. There is an unquestionable need to establish clear rules for telemedicine use in Poland, which would ensure their high quality and adequate clinical application. This paper is a summary of the current status of telemedicine solutions used in cardiology, with a particularfocus on the Polish healthcare system, and presents both the commonly available solutions and those that are expected to develop rapidly in the near future.;2021;4
Telemedicine programs are particularly suited to evaluating patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders, primarily because much of the physical exam findings are visual. Telemedicine uses information and communication technologies to overcome geographical barriers and increase access to healthcare service. It is particularly beneficial for rural and underserved communities, groups that traditionally suffer from lack of access to healthcare. There is a growing evidence of the feasibility of telemedicine, cost and time savings, patients' and physicians' satisfaction, and its outcome and impact on patients' morbidity and quality of life. In addition, given the unusual current situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has offered the opportunity to address the ongoing healthcare needs of patients with PD, to reduce in-person clinic visits, and human exposures (among healthcare workers and patients) to a range of infectious diseases including COVID-19. However, there are still several challenges to widespread implementation of telemedicine including the limited performance of parts of the neurological exam, limited technological savvy, fear of loss of a personal connection, or uneasiness about communicating sensitive information. On the other hand, while we are facing the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic, patients and clinicians are gaining increasing experience with telemedicine, facilitating equity of access to specialized multidisciplinary care for PD. This article summarizes and reviews the current state and future directions of telemedicine from a global perspective.;2021;4
Telerehabilitation is an evolving modality for the delivery of rehabilitation care. It allows for innovative approaches for delivery of care in different locations and using different technology based on the patient?s needs, clinical judgment of the provider, access to technology, and existing infrastructure of the health care system. Technology continues to evolve to expand the scope of care that can be provided over telerehabilitation, particularly to home. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to accelerated adoption of telerehabilitation with potential to expand access, improve interdisciplinary collaboration, and customize patient-centered care to an unprecedented degree.;2021;4
Telerehabilitation offers a unique solution for continuity of care in pediatric rehabilitation under physical distancing. The major aims of this study were to: (1) describe the development of telerehabilitation usage guidelines in a large hospital in Israel, and to (2) evaluate the implementation of telerehabilitation from the perspectives of healthcare practitioners and families. An expert focus group developed guidelines which were disseminated to multidisciplinary clinicians. Following sessions, clinicians filled The Clinician Evaluation of Telerehabilitation Service (CETS), a custom-built feedback questionnaire on telerehabilitation, and parents completed the client version of the Therapist Presence Inventory (TPI-C) and were asked to rate the effectiveness of sessions on an ordinal scale. Four goals of telerehabilitation sessions were defined: (1) maintenance of therapeutic alliance, (2) provision of parental coping strategies, (3) assistance in maintaining routine, and (4) preventing functional deterioration. Principal Components Analysis was used for the CETS questionnaire and the relationships of CETS and TPI-C with child's age and the type of session were evaluated using Spearman's correlations and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. In total, sixty-seven telerehabilitation sessions, with clients aged 11.31 +/- 4.8 years, were documented by clinicians. Three components (child, session, parent) explained 71.3% of the variance in CETS. According to therapists, their ability to maintain the therapeutic alliance was generally higher than their ability to achieve other predefined goals (p < 0.01). With younger children, the ability to provide feedback to the child, grade treatment difficulty and provide coping strategies to the parents were diminished. Families perceived the therapist as being highly present in therapy regardless of treatment type. These results demonstrate a potential framework for the dissemination of telerehabilitation services in pediatric rehabilitation.;2021;4
The advent of telerobotic systems has revolutionized various aspects of the industry and human life. This technology is designed to augment human sensorimotor capabilities to extend them beyond natural competence. Classic examples are space and underwater applications when distance and access are the two major physical barriers to be combated with this technology. In modern examples, telerobotic systems have been used in several clinical applications, including teleoperated surgery and telerehabilitation. In this regard, there has been a significant amount of research and development due to the major benefits in terms of medical outcomes. Recently telerobotic systems are combined with advanced artificial intelligence modules to better share the agency with the operator and open new doors of medical automation. In this review paper, we have provided a comprehensive analysis of the literature considering various topologies of telerobotic systems in the medical domain while shedding light on different levels of autonomy for this technology, starting from direct control, going up to command-tracking autonomous telerobots. Existing challenges, including instrumentation, transparency, autonomy, stochastic communication delays, and stability, in addition to the current direction of research related to benefit in telemedicine and medical automation, and future vision of this technology, are discussed in this review paper.;2021;4
The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) developed the National Outcomes Measurement System for aggregating standardized patient outcomes. Outcomes are standardized using Functional Communication Measures (FCM), scales designed to describe communicative function across specific areas of clinical need. This investigation compared in-person and telepractice service delivery for children in elementary school settings who received treatment targeting the FCM categories of either spoken language production or spoken language comprehension. De-identified cases were secured from ASHA's NOMS database and the database of a private e-learning provider that implemented the NOMS format. There were minimal significant differences in the median change scores between the traditional and telepractice interventions. These results support comparable treatment outcomes between in-person service delivery and telepractice for treatment of children exhibiting impaired spoken language production or spoken language comprehension in an elementary school setting.;2021;4
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak requires rapid reshaping of rehabilitation services to include patients recovering from severe COVID-19 with post-intensive care syndromes, which results in physical deconditioning and cognitive impairments, patients with comorbid conditions, and other patients requiring physical therapy during the outbreak with no or limited access to hospital and rehabilitation centers. Considering the access barriers to quality rehabilitation settings and services imposed by social distancing and stay-at-home orders, these patients can be benefited from providing access to affordable and good quality care through home-based rehabilitation. The success of such treatment will depend highly on the intensity of the therapy and effort invested by the patient. Monitoring patients' compliance and designing a home-based rehabilitation that can mentally engage them are the critical elements in home-based therapy's success. Hence, we study the state-of-the-art telerehabilitation frameworks and robotic devices, and comment about a hybrid model that can use existing telerehabilitation framework and home-based robotic devices for treatment and simultaneously assess patient's progress remotely. Second, we comment on the patients' social support and engagement, which is critical for the success of telerehabilitation service. As the therapists are not physically present to guide the patients, we also discuss the adaptability requirement of home-based telerehabilitation. Finally, we suggest that the reformed rehabilitation services should consider both home-based solutions for enhancing the activities of daily living and an on-demand ambulatory rehabilitation unit for extensive training where we can monitor both cognitive and motor performance of the patients remotely.;2021;4
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated adoption of telerehabilitation in services where face-to-face consultations were previously standard. We aimed to understand barriers to implementing a telerehabilitation clinical service and design a behavior support strategy for clinicians to implement telerehabilitation. A hybrid implementation study design included pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, identification of key barriers to implementation using the theoretical domains framework, and development of a targeted intervention. Thirty-one clinicians completed baseline questionnaires identifying key barriers to the implementation of telerehabilitation. Barriers were associated with behavior domains of knowledge, environment, social influences, and beliefs. A 6-week brief intervention focused on remote clinician support, and education was well received but achieved little change in perceived barriers to implementation. The brief intervention to support implementation of telerehabilitation during COVID-19 achieved clinical practice change, but barriers remain. Longer follow-up may determine the sustainability of a brief implementation strategy, but needs to consider pandemic-related stressors.

The Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shifted research and healthcare system priorities, stimulating literature on implementation and evaluation of telerehabilitation for a variety of patient populations. While there is substantial literature on individual telerehabilitation, evidence about group telerehabilitation remains limited despite its increasing use by rehabilitation providers. Therefore, the purpose of this manuscript is to describe our expert team's consensus on practice considerations for adapting in-person group rehabilitation to group telerehabilitation to provide rapid guidance during a pandemic and create a foundation for sustainability of group telerehabilitation beyond the pandemic's end.;2021;4
The COVID-19 emergency has imposed distanced education and has interrupted most rehabilitation services. Adolescents with disabilities have been isolated, and the burden on their families has been exacerbated. A cross-sectional survey was administered to adolescents with disability and to parents of disabled children to describe their experience during lockdown and their concerns or expectations about rehabilitation. A sample of 53 adolescents and 239 parents completed the survey. Adolescents were ages 13-18 years old (45.3% female). Most parents were between 35 and 55 years old (84.9% female). While 53.6% of the parents reported no positive effects of the lockdown, 92.5% of the adolescents expressed favorable consequences. The increased time spent with family members was judged positively by 27.2% of parents and by 64.2% of adolescents. Concern for their child's disability was expressed by 47.3% of parents, while 73.6% of adolescents expressed concerns regarding the ban on meeting friends. In both groups, anxiety symptoms were correlated with the fear of contracting COVID-19 and with financial problems. Parents would have liked even more remote support from school and healthcare professionals, which was available for most participants. Thus, socioeconomic support, assistive technology and telerehabilitation strategies might help families with disabilities during a lockdown.;2021;4
"The COVID-19 pandemic forced many health care providers to modify their service model by adopting telehealth and tele-rehabilitation with minimal time to plan for its execution. ALYN-Pediatric Rehabilitation Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel, responded with alacrity by providing a broad range of rehabilitation services to young people via online therapy during the first 5 months of the pandemic. The objectives of this naturalistic study were: (1) to monitor usage and user experience of online rehabilitation provided to young people receiving out-patient sessions of physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychology and (2) to consider the advantages and disadvantages of retaining this model of online treatment in full or in part post-COVID-19. The online rehabilitation treatment program was provided to 147 young people, aged 3 months to 20 years (mean 8.5 y; SD 5.3), and monitored and evaluated via data from the medical records as well as interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. The results use descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze data on the types and frequencies of therapy provided to 147 young people. Over a five month-period, 2392 therapy sessions were provided, 61 therapists from four disciplines were involved and 56.4% of the young people received two or more types of therapies via online rehabilitation. A repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences over time per therapy. Feedback and recommendations about the process from therapists, parents and young people were collected during two focus groups of the professional staff (n = 12), parents and young people (parents n = 5, young people n = 3). Tele-rehabilitation services were perceived to be beneficial and effective by the great majority of young people, their parents and the healthcare professionals. The results are discussed within the context of conventional therapy as well as in comparison to reports of other online services for similar populations. We conclude that a hybrid approach in which in-person therapy sessions are coordinated with synchronous, online sessions, will provide a best-case fit for young people with chronic disabilities.";2021;4
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused distress for healthcare providers due to the respiratory problems it causes, among others. In this situation, rehabilitation of the respiratory system has been suggested and implemented in different COVID-19 patients. This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel program based on breathing exercises through telerehabilitation tools in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptomatology in the acute stage. Forty subjects were randomized in an experimental group, based on pulmonary rehabilitation, and in a control group, of which the subjects did not perform physical activity. Thirty-eight subjects, with nineteen in each group, completed the one-week intervention. We performed measurements using the Six-Minute Walk Test, Multidimensional Dyspnoea-12, Thirty-Second Sit-To-Stand Test, and Borg Scale. Both groups were comparable at baseline. Significant differences were found for all of the outcome measures in favour of the experimental group. Ninety percent adherence was found in our program. A one-week telerehabilitation program based on respiratory exercises is effective, safe, and feasible in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptomatology in the acute stage.;2021;4
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed people's lives and the way in which certain services are provided. Such changes are not uncommon in healthcare services and they will have to adapt to the new situation by increasing the number of services remotely offered. Limited mobility has resulted in interruption of treatments that traditionally have been administered through face-to-face modalities, especially those related to cognitive impairments. In this telerehabilitation approach, both the patient and the specialist physician enter a virtual reality (VR) environment where they can interact in real time through avatars. A spaced retrieval (SR) task is implemented in the system to analyze cognitive performance. An experimental group (n = 20) performed the SR task in telerehabilitation mode, whereas a control group (n = 20) performed the SR task through a traditional face-to-face mode. The obtained results showed that it is possible to carry out cognitive rehabilitation processes through a telerehabilitation modality in conjunction with VR. The cost-effectiveness of the system will also contribute to making healthcare systems more efficient, overcoming both geographical and temporal limitations.;2021;4
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for advancing the development and implementation of novel means for home-based telerehabilitation in order to enable remote assessment and training for individuals with disabling conditions in need of therapy. While somatosensory input is essential for motor function, to date, most telerehabilitation therapies and technologies focus on assessing and training motor impairments, while the somatosensorial aspect is largely neglected. The integration of tactile devices into home-based rehabilitation practice has the potential to enhance the recovery of sensorimotor impairments and to promote functional gains through practice in an enriched environment with augmented tactile feedback and haptic interactions. In the current review, we outline the clinical approaches for stimulating somatosensation in home-based telerehabilitation and review the existing technologies for conveying mechanical tactile feedback (i.e., vibration, stretch, pressure, and mid-air stimulations). We focus on tactile feedback technologies that can be integrated into home-based practice due to their relatively low cost, compact size, and lightweight. The advantages and opportunities, as well as the long-term challenges and gaps with regards to implementing these technologies into home-based telerehabilitation, are discussed.;2021;4
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health problem that is radically transforming public and private healthcare organizations around the world, negatively affecting the rehabilitative treatments of non-COVID pathologies as well. In this situation, it becomes crucial to be able to guarantee the continuity of care also to all those patients with neurodegenerative diseases unable to reach healthcare services. Remote communication technologies are gaining momentum as potentially effective options to support health care interventions-including cognitive rehabilitation-while patients can stay safely at home. In this context, we are implementing HomeCoRe (i.e., Home Cognitive Rehabilitation software) in order to offer an innovative approach and a valid support for home-based cognitive rehabilitation in neurodegenerative diseases, such as mild cognitive impairment and early dementia. HomeCoRe has been developed within a research project between engineers and clinicians in order to obtain a usable and safe cognitive rehabilitation tool. This software has multiple advantages for patients and therapists over traditional approaches, as shown in its use in hospital settings. HomeCoRe could then represent an opportunity for accessing cognitive rehabilitation in all those situations where patients and therapists are not in the same location due to particular restrictions, such as COVID-19 pandemic.;2021;4
"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a general reorganization of rehabilitation services in Italy. The lockdown in Italy led to the use of telepractice for the delivery of speech therapy, including stuttering. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Multidimensional, Integrated, Differentiated, Art-Mediated Stuttering Program (MIDA-SP; Tomaiuoli et al., 2012), delivered online for school-age children who stutter. A non-randomized controlled pre- and post-treatment study included an experimental group (11 children) receiving a telepractice adaptation of MIDA-SP and a historical control group (11 children) receiving in-person MIDA-SP. Both groups had been assessed with the Stuttering Severity Instrument - Fourth Edition (SSI-4) and Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES-S) pre- and post-treatment. No statistically significant differences were found between the two modes of delivery. These findings suggest that MIDA-SP treatment delivered via telepractice is effective for school-age children who stutter.";2021;4
The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a sudden limitation of in-person outpatient occupational and physical therapy services for most patients at a large, multisite pediatric hospital located in the Midwest, United States. To ensure patient and staff safety, the hospital rapidly shifted to deliver most of these services via telerehabilitation. The purposes of this study were to (1) describe the rapid implementation of telerehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) describe the demographic characteristics of patients who continued in-person services and those who received telerehabilitation, and (3) evaluate the therapists' perceptions of telerehabilitation for physical and occupational therapy. Most of the children (83.4% of n=1352) received telerehabilitation services. A family was more likely to choose to continue in-person visits if their child was <1-year-old, had a diagnosis of torticollis, received serial casting, or was post-surgical. Occupational and physical therapy therapists (n=9) completed surveys to discern their perceptions of the acceptability of telerehabilitation, with most reporting that telerehabilitation was as effective as in-person care.;2021;4
The deterioration of gait can be used as a biomarker for ageing and neurological diseases. Continuous gait monitoring and analysis are essential for early deficit detection and personalized rehabilitation. The use of mobile and wearable inertial sensor systems for gait monitoring and analysis have been well explored with promising results in the literature. However, most of these studies focus on technologies for the assessment of gait characteristics, few of them have considered the data acquisition bandwidth of the sensing system. Inadequate sampling frequency will sacrifice signal fidelity, thus leading to an inaccurate estimation especially for spatial gait parameters. In this work, we developed an inertial sensor based in-shoe gait analysis system for real-time gait monitoring and investigated the optimal sampling frequency to capture all the information on walking patterns. An exploratory validation study was performed using an optical motion capture system on four healthy adult subjects, where each person underwent five walking sessions, giving a total of 20 sessions. Percentage mean absolute errors (MAE%) obtained in stride time, stride length, stride velocity, and cadence while walking were 1.19%, 1.68%, 2.08%, and 1.23%, respectively. In addition, an eigenanalysis based graphical descriptor from raw gait cycle signals was proposed as a new gait metric that can be quantified by principal component analysis to differentiate gait patterns, which has great potential to be used as a powerful analytical tool for gait disorder diagnostics.;2021;4
"The development of mobile technology and mobile Internet offers new possibilities in rehabilitation and clinical assessment in a longitudinal perspective for multiple sclerosis management. However, because the mobile health applications (mHealth) have only been developed recently, the level of evidence supporting the use of mHealth in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is currently unclear. Therefore, this review aims to list and describe the different mHealth available for rehabilitation and self-assessment of pwMS and to define the level of evidence supporting these interventions for functioning problems categorized within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). In total, 36 studies, performed with 22 different mHealth, were included in this review, 30 about rehabilitation and six for self-assessment, representing 3091 patients. For rehabilitation, most of the studies were focusing on cognitive function and fatigue. Concerning the efficacy, we found a small but significant effect of the use of mHealth for cognitive training (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.28 [0.12; 0.45]) and moderate effect for fatigue (SMD = 0.61 [0.47; 0.76]). mHealth is a promising tool in pwMS but more studies are needed to validate these solutions in the other ICF categories. More replications studies are also needed as most of the mHealth have only been assessed in one single study.";2021;4
The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented a global health threat, and it poses challenges to how physiotherapists deliver health care. Physiotherapists have an ethical obligation not only to reduce the spread of COVID-19 but also to provide client-centred care and to improve or maintain function among those living in the community. Telerehabilitation provides an opportunity to maintain function, prevent future hospitalizations, and assist with discharge from hospitals while maintaining physical distancing recommendations. This editorial outlines the evidence for telerehabilitation, key considerations for its use, challenges to its use, and we issue a call to action.;2021;4
The healthcare industry requires the integration of digital technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), to their full potential, particularly during this challenging time and the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the disruptions in healthcare delivery, service operations, and shortage of healthcare personnel. However, every opportunity has barriers and bumps, and when it comes to IoT healthcare, data privacy is one of the main growing issues. Despite the recent advances in the development of IoT healthcare architectures, most of them are invasive for the data subjects. In this context, the broad applications of AI in the IoT domain have also been hindered by emerging strict legal and ethical requirements to protect individual privacy. Camera-based solutions that monitor human subjects in everyday settings, e.g., for Online Range of Motion (ROM) detection, are making this problem even worse. One actively practiced branch of such solutions is telerehabilitation, which provides remote solutions for the physically impaired to regain their strength and get back to their normal daily routines. The process usually involves transmitting video/images from the patient performing rehabilitation exercises and applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques to extract meaningful information to help therapists devise further treatment plans. Thereby, real-time measurement and assessment of rehabilitation exercises in a reliable, accurate, and Privacy-Preserving manner is imperative. To address the privacy issue of existing solutions, this paper proposes a holistic Privacy-Preserving (PP) hierarchical IoT solution that simultaneously addresses the utilization of AI-driven IoT and the demands for data protection. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed architecture is demonstrated by a novel machine learning-based system that allows immediate assessment and extraction of ROM as the critical information for analyzing the progress of patients.;2021;4
The human musculoskeletal (MSK) system (also known as the locomotor system) provides strength and assistance to perform functional tasks and daily life activities. The MSK health monitoring plays a vital role in maintaining the body mobility and quality of life. Manual approaches for musculoskeletal health monitoring are subjective and require a clinician's intervention. The evolution in motion tracking technology enables us to capture the fine details of body movements. The research community has proposed various approaches to help clinicians in diagnosis and monitor treatment sessions. This paper succinctly reviews the evolution of technologyassisted approaches for musculoskeletal health monitoring, using motion capture sensors. To streamline the search through the literature database, the PICOS framework and PRISMA method have been incorporated. The present study reviews methods to transform motion capture data into kinematics variables and factors that affect the tracking performance of RGB-D sensors. Furthermore, widely utilized time-series filters for skeletal data denoising and smoothing for kinematics analysis, stochastic models for movement modeling, rule-based and template-based approaches for rehabilitation exercises assessment, and telerehabilitation sessions for remote health monitoring are explored. This article analyzes skeletal tracking methods by providing advantages and drawbacks of the state of the art rehabilitation sessions assessment, skeletal joint kinematics analysis, and MSK Telerehabilitation approaches. It also discusses the possible future research avenues to improve musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Our review signifies that RGB-D sensor-based approaches are inexpensive and portable for disorder diagnosis and treatment monitoring. It can also be a viable option for clinicians to provide contactless healthcare access to patients in the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic.;2021;4
"The importance of telemedicine technologies around the world has been growing for many years, and it turned out to be a particularly important issue for conducting some medical procedures during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It is necessary to create interdisciplinary teams to design and implement improved procedures using telemedicine tools. The aim of the article is to develop original, improved posthospital patient care process after total hip arthroplasty (THA) with the use of telemedicine technologies. In the study, a literature review and empirical research were used. The conducted research resulted in the designing an original posthospital patient care process after THA that uses telematics technologies. Due to the use of analyzed telemedicine technologies, the designed patient care process brings a possibility to increase the patient & PRIME;s safety by monitoring life parameters, allowing for regular, remote contact with specialists and to be supervised remotely. All this may contribute to shortening the convalescence time, reducing the risk of complications, as well as reducing treatment costs. The designed model is ready for further clinical research with the participation of medical staff, patients after THA and patient caregivers.</p>";2021;4
The increasing cost of healthcare services is accelerating the development of the telehealth system to fulfill the necessity of delivering an efficient and cost-effective remote healthcare services. Moreover, the ageing of the global population and the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic are creating a rapid rise of demand for healthcare services. This includes those who are in need of remote monitoring for chronic conditions through rehabilitation exercises. Therefore, this paper presents a telehealth system using PoseNet for in-home rehabilitation, with built-in statistical computation for doctors to analyze the patient's recovery status. This system enables patients to perform rehabilitation exercises at home using an ordinary webcam. The PoseNet skeleton-tracking method is applied to detect and track the patients' angular movements for both elbows and knees. By using this system, the measurement of the elbow and knee joint angles can be calculated and recorded while patients are performing rehabilitation exercises in front of the laptop webcam. After the patients complete their rehabilitation exercises, the skeleton results of four body parts will be generated. Based on the same actions performed by patients on selected days, the doctors can examine and evaluate the deviation rate of patients' angular movements between different days to determine the recovery rate.;2021;4
"The increasingly positive outcomes of childhood cancer treatments are among the most inspiring stories in modern medicine. Many of the children and adolescents surviving cancer will have a healthy life; however, many others will suffer from physical, cognitive, psychological, and social sequelae. During treatment, many children experience multiple temporary and permanent side effects which negatively impact their quality of life. Low- and middle-income countries where childhood cancer treatment outcomes are improving are facing the reality of a growing population of teenagers and young adults suffering from long-term disease- and treatment-related consequences. In Chile, 500 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. Treatment is granted for all through public health policies and NGO collaboration. In order to address the complex problems from acute and long-term consequences of disease and treatment, the Oncological Rehabilitation Center Fundacion Nuestros Hijos (CROFNH) provides multidisciplinary attention to an extensive variety of rehabilitation needs for children and adolescents with cancer. With its integrated services in the medical treatment of children and adolescents with cancer, the CROFNH helps reduce the impact of treatment-related side effects in children's daily lives, improves quality of life, and aims at contributing to these children becoming independent and functional adults to the maximum of their capacities. The aim of this article is to show the experience of the Chilean Oncological Rehabilitation Centre and its unique multidisciplinary approach. In addition, we discuss the successful telerehabilitation strategy implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to secure continuity of treatment.";2021;4
The lack of physical exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic-related quarantine measures is challenging, especially for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Without regular exercise not only patients, but also nursing staff and physicians soon noticed a deterioration of motor and non-motor symptoms. Reduced functional mobility, increased falls, increased frailty, and decreased quality of life were identified as consequences of increased sedentary behavior. This work overviews the current literature on problems of supplying conventional physiotherapy and the potential of telerehabilitation, allied health services, and patient-initiated exercise for PD patients during the COVID-19 period. We discuss recent studies on approaches that can improve remote provision of exercise to patients, including telerehabilitation, motivational tools, apps, exergaming, and virtual reality (VR) exercise. Additionally, we provide a case report about a 69-year-old PD patient who took part in a 12-week guided climbing course for PD patients prior to the pandemic and found a solution to continue her climbing training independently with an outdoor rope ladder. This case can serve as a best practice example for non-instructed, creative, and patient-initiated exercise in the domestic environment in difficult times, as are the current. Overall, many recent studies on telemedicine, telerehabilitation, and patient-initiated exercises have been published, giving rise to optimism that facilitating remote exercise can help PD patients maintain physical mobility and emotional well-being, even in phases such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic itself may even boost the need to establish comprehensive and easy-to-do telerehabilitation programs.;2021;4
The main objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the self-reported depressive symptoms and physical activity (PA) levels among participants who performed self- nonexercising (NE), guided exercise (SGE), remotely supervised exercise (RSE), and face-to-face supervised exercise (FFE) during social distancing. Three hundred and forty-four individuals (>= 18 years and 67% women) answered a self-reported online survey that included questions related to the physical exercise practice (e.g., supervised and remote) during social distancing and questions about perceptions of depressive symptoms (Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Rated [MADRS-S] scores) and metabolic equivalent task minutes per week (METs min center dot wk-1) of moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and total PA scores (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form) before and during social distancing. The RSE group (n=45) showed higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA than the SGE (n=146) and NE (n=109) groups. The RSE and FFE (n=44) groups showed higher METs of the total PA scores than the SGE and NE groups. The NE group showed higher MADRS-S scores than the other groups. Lower MADRS-S scores depend on the exercise practice and higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA depend on the supervised exercise practice. Thus, telehealth interventions can be implemented during the pandemic to enhance vigorous PA.;2021;4
The patient, clinician and administration staff perspectives of telehealth (specifically videoconferencing) services provided by Allied Health Professions (AHP) at a large quaternary hospital were explored. The purpose was to understand stakeholders' perceptions of the service during initial COVID-19 restrictions and examine factors that influenced the implementation and sustained use of telehealth. A sequential mixed-methods approach was undertaken. Stage 1 involved surveys completed by patients (n = 109) and clinicians (n = 66) who received and provided care via telehealth, respectively, across six AHP departments. Stage 2 involved focus groups with clinicians (n = 24) and administrative staff (n = 13) to further examine implementation and sustainability factors. All participant groups confirmed that telehealth was a valid service model and valued the benefits it afforded, particularly during COVID-19 restrictions. Both patients and clinicians reported that not all AHP services could be delivered via telehealth and preferred a blended model of telehealth and in-person care. Increased administrative staff assistance was needed to support growing telehealth demand. Main factors to address are the need to expand AHP telehealth models and workforce/patient training, improve workflow processes and enhance technical support. Despite rapid implementation, telehealth experiences were overall positive. Study findings are being used to generate solutions to enhance and sustain AHP telehealth services.;2021;4
The present review is aimed at the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) and exergames in the prevention of falls among the elderly. Falls become a significant problem in the aging population and lead to psychological, social, and physical impairment. Prevention of falls is crucial to the well-being of the elderly population and is one of the challenges of contemporary rehabilitation. Recently, in view of the threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, contactless methods of rehabilitation, including telerehabilitation, appear as valuable rehabilitation tools. This review is based on the PRISMA guidelines and was carried out in five databases: PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and PEDro. Twenty-one randomized controlled trials, focused on the application of VR and exergames in the prevention of falls, were included. This review suggests that VR training in rehabilitation appears to be a promising complement to traditional techniques of physiotherapy to improve specific physical outcomes. VR and exergames could be considered as a complement of standard physiotherapy and its possible continuation at home for elderly. However, further high-quality studies, with carefully designed protocols and proper blinding, are needed.;2021;4
"The primary purpose of this study was to craft and validate a set of core competencies necessary for a tele-facilitator to possess in the school setting. Competencies were created through literature review and qualitative analysis. Following expert review, the competencies were revised and formatted into an online survey which was sent to respondents in four target groups: (a) school administrators who had adopted telepractice as a service delivery model; (b) speech-language pathologists (SLPs) experienced in telepractice within a school setting; (c) current tele-facilitators, and (d) scholars experienced in telepractice. Fifty-seven percent (20 out of 35) of the competencies were rated as Essential Skills. The remaining competencies could be more or less important depending on workplace requirements.";2021;4
The purpose of this study was to discern the barriers faced by school-based clinicians, chiefly occupational therapists (OTs) and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) who provided telehealth in a primarily rural state during an unexpected declaration of a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey results found the major barriers to implementation of telehealth services to be lack of practitioner training, a lack of access to technology for students, and concerns that the quality of intervention might not be equivalent to in-person service delivery. This article discusses both the benefits and barriers to providing telehealth services in school-based practice and offers considerations for future studies on this topic.;2021;4
The purpose of this study was to investigate the benefits and challenges of the tele-speech therapy from the perspective of patients who stutter, and their parents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 patients and three parents in two rehabilitation centers. Data were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach proposed by Graneheim and Lundman. Seven categories were determined: accessible treatment, motivation of comfort in tele-speech therapy, challenges of tele-therapy, satisfaction, virtual competency, lower quality compared to face-to-face therapy, and uncertainty about the effectiveness of tele-speech therapy. The participants had a two-sided perspective regarding tele-speech therapy. Positive experiences included benefitting from more qualified therapists at multiple locations, faster access to treatment, and saving cost and time. Negative experiences and challenges consisted of low-quality of technology infrastructure for rehabilitation including low quality of shared images and videos, ineffective communication, insufficient sympathy, indirect communication, and technology incompetency. Findings showed that the participants were interested in the application of tele-speech therapy, as this method could increase their accessibility and provide the opportunity to choose proper therapists. The determined benefits and challenges can provide the policy-makers with beneficial information to implement tele-speech therapy.;2021;4
The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the experiences of occupational therapists (OTs) who switched to telehealth for clients with visual impairments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted over Zoom and transcriptions were analysed and narrowed down to four themes. Participants often did not identify clients' visual impairments as the major barrier to participating in telehealth, rather addressing a combination of factors: stress of the pandemic, access to materials at home, and family support. Participants shared ways they modified their practice during telehealth visits for patients with visual impairments and suggestions to make virtual platforms more accessible.;2021;4
The research area of activity recognition is fast growing with diverse applications. However, advances in this field have not yet been used to monitor the rehabilitation of individuals with spinal cord injury. Noteworthily, relying on patient surveys to assess adherence can undermine the outcomes of rehabilitation. Therefore, this paper presents and implements a systematic activity recognition method to recognize physical activities applied by subjects during rehabilitation for spinal cord injury. In the method, raw sensor data are divided into fragments using a dynamic segmentation technique, providing higher recognition performance compared to the sliding window, which is a commonly used approach. To develop the method and build a predictive model, a machine learning approach was adopted. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset obtained from a single wrist-worn accelerometer. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing all of the activities that were examined, and it achieved an overall accuracy of 96.86%.;2021;4
The role of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation is well established in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart failure. Numerous trials have demonstrated both the effectiveness as well as the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation in improving exercise capacity and quality of life, and in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has led to closure of many cardiac rehabilitation centres in Europe resulting in many eligible patients unable to participate in the optimisation of secondary prevention and physical performance. This elicits an even louder call for alternatives such as cardiac telerehabilitation to maintain the delivery of the core components of cardiac rehabilitation to cardiovascular disease patients. The present call for action paper gives an update of recent cardiac telerehabilitation studies and provides a practical guide for the setup of a comprehensive cardiac telerehabilitation intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. This set up could also be relevant to any cardiovascular disease patient not able to visit cardiac rehabilitation centres regularly after the COVID-19 pandemic ceases.;2021;4
The third phase of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Program (CRP) is a lifelong, maintenance phase beginning 3 to 6 months after the cardiac event. Individualized surveillance and monitoring schedules are established. The exercise prescription guidelines are practically identical to those of the other phases of the CRP with personalized monitoring. Currently, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, telerehabilitation and telemonitoring are of great value in this phase. The benefits of phase 3 have been demonstrated with prolonged survival by 1.82 years, at a cost of $ 1773 per year of life saved.;2021;4
The total isolation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires non-face-to-face medical assistance. There is evidence of the efficacy of home treatments with exercises in patients with respiratory disorders which could become the therapeutic method of choice for the treatment and supervision of patients isolated due to infection during home confinement. This study's objective was to analyse the experience and opinions of isolated patients with COVID-19 included in a programme of telerehabilitation exercises for 14 days and it is intended to reflect, from a qualitative point of view, the viability and usefulness of telerehabilitation tools in the management of these patients. Twenty-five participants of a telerehabilitation programme were interviewed by telephone through semi-structured interviews, following a positivist and objective model. The data were categorised and analysed through NVIVO qualitative analysis software. The information obtained was classified into four main topics (telerehabilitation programme, perception of clinical benefit, psychological aspects and level of health care) and six subtopics (technical aspects, communication, improvement aspects, exercise plan, motivation and applicability to public health systems). The telerehabilitation programme established in patients confined by COVID-19 is very well received, without considerable technical difficulties and generates physical and psychological improvements. Patients highlight the importance of applying this type of programme in public health systems.;2021;4
"The use of telehealth to deliver occupational therapy services rapidly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are frameworks to evaluate services delivered through telehealth; however, none are specific to occupational therapy. Therefore, occupational therapy would benefit from a framework to systematically evaluate components of telehealth service delivery and build evidence to demonstrate the distinct value of occupational therapy. The PACE Framework outlines four priority domains to address areas of need: (1) Population and Health Outcomes; (2) Access for All Clients; (3) Costs and Cost Effectiveness; and (4) Experiences of Clients and Occupational Therapy Practitioners. This article describes the development and expert reviewer evaluation of the PACE Framework. In addition, the PACE Framework's domains, subdomains, and outcome measure examples are described along with future directions for implementation in occupational therapy research, practice, and program evaluation.";2021;4
There is a gap in the evidence on telerehabilitation (TR) for people with fragility fractures. It is unclear whether this group with recent falls who are often frail with cognitive changes will accept tele-rehabilitation and functional gains can be achieved using this approach. Prospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted with femoral or pelvic fracture to a hospital-based home rehabilitation service (HRS) between January and November 2017. Using tablets, multidisciplinary rehabilitation was provided via videoconferencing and use of exercise apps. Patients chose a face-to-face visit or TR. Information on demographic characteristics, functional levels, the total number of therapy sessions, TR episodes, reasons for non-acceptance of TR, and patient-reported experience using TR was collected. Fifty-two patients with hip and pelvic fractures were admitted to the HRS and 35 (67.3%) received TR. Patients who did not accept TR were older, frailer and more likely to be female than those who received TR. Of the 17 who did not receive TR, 6 were deemed unsuitable by staff due to hearing, vision or cognitive problems and 3 refused. The TR group achieved acceptable functional gains. In the TR group on average, participants had 13.63 (+/- 7.29) home visits however they only elected to have 3.43 (+/- 2.48) sessions delivered via TR. TR was acceptable to a subset of hip fracture patients but face-to-face was the preferred mode of delivery. More research is needed to understand patients' preferences and beliefs, and the influence of clinician attitudes on uptake of TR.;2021;4
There is a need for innovation to improve the engagement and accessibility of rehabilitation programs for children and adults with upper extremity motor impairments due to neurodevelopmental disorders, acquired brain injuries, or spinal cord injuries. For this purpose, a computer game-based telerehabilitation platform (GTP) was developed to address this need. Through the application of a miniature inertial-based computer mouse and the wide variety of commercial computer games, the developed GTP can provide engaging task-specific exercises for the rehabilitation of manual dexterity (object handling and manipulation). A purpose-built repetitive task practice software (RTP) was also developed to gather event data and synchronize it with patient movements during gameplays. This provides automated monitoring and quantification of patients' motor skills, while they practice a range of game-based exercises with their hand and/or arm. The GTP would initially be used in a supervised clinical setting followed by a transition to function at home and be monitored by clinician specialists. Clinical support for home and rural communities, with protocols that can be easily updated, will help increase accessibility to targeted and personalized solutions for patients and achieve the desired training effect.;2021;4
There is a plethora of technology-assisted interventions for hand therapy, however, less is known about the effectiveness of these interventions. This scoping review aims to explore studies about technology-assisted interventions targeting hand rehabilitation to identify the most effective interventions. It is expected that multifaceted interventions targeting hand rehabilitation are more efficient therapeutic approaches than mono-interventions. The scoping review will aim to map the existing haptic-enabled interventions for upper limb rehabilitation and investigates their effects on motor and functional recovery in patients with stroke. The methodology used in this review is based on the Arksey and O'Malley framework, which includes the following stages: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting the data, and collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Results show that using three or four different technologies was more positive than using two technologies (one technology + haptics). In particular, when standardized as a percentage of outcomes, the combination of three technologies showed better results than the combination of haptics with one technology or with three other technologies. To conclude, this study portrayed haptic-enabled rehabilitation approaches that could help therapists decide which technology-enabled hand therapy approach is best suited to their needs. Those seeking to undertake research and development anticipate further opportunities to develop haptic-enabled hand telerehabilitation platforms.;2021;4
There is known to be a decrease in quality of life and perceived occupational performance and satisfaction following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study was planned to examine the effectiveness of a client-centered (CC) intervention with the telerehabilitation (TR) method on the quality of life, perceived occupational performance, and satisfaction after TKA. A total of 38 patients who had undergone TKA were randomly assigned to the CC and control groups. A 12-day intervention program was applied to the CC group. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) were applied before and after intervention. The 12-day intervention showed a strong effect on all parameters in the CC group (p<.001). In the postintervention comparisons, a significant difference was found in favor of the CC group (p < .001). CC interventions with the TR method can be used in post-TKA interventions.;2021;4
This article describes the impact of the pandemic on physical medicine and rehabilitation in a COVID-19 referral center of a developing country. It describes how telerehabilitation can be leveraged to fill in the gaps in service, training, and research arms of the physical medicine and rehabilitation specialty. The ITAWAG (to call) telerehabilitation program is the response of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at Philippine General Hospital, which is the country's national university hospital, to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis that continues to limit face-to-face access to physical medicine and rehabilitation services throughout the country. With the significant decline in the number of patients served since the start of the pandemic, the ITAWAG program aimed to bridge the physical distance between patients and clinicians after a set of eligibility criteria for teleconsultation or teletherapy and a step-by-step process used before, during, and after each virtual encounter. However, because many physical medicine and rehabilitation consultants, residents, and therapists were not trained for the virtual approach to patient care, a telerehabilitation curriculum was developed to help in providing quality and competent services. Finally, despite the growing awareness of telerehabilitation throughout the country, several research gaps about this emerging technology are identified to determine its acceptance, applicability, and cost-effectiveness among others.;2021;4
This paper describes the development of the 'Brain-Fit' app, a digital secondary prevention intervention designed for use in the early phase after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. The aim of the study was to explore perceptions on usability and relevance of the app in order to maximise user engagement and sustainability. Using the theory- and evidence-informed person-based approach, initial planning included a scoping review of qualitative evidence to identify barriers and facilitators to use of digital interventions in people with cardiovascular conditions and two focus groups exploring experiences and support needs of people (N = 32) with a history of TIA or minor stroke. The scoping review and focus group data were analysed thematically and findings were used to produce guiding principles, a behavioural analysis and explanatory logic model for the intervention. Optimisation included an additional focus group (N = 12) and individual think-aloud interviews (N = 8) to explore perspectives on content and usability of a prototype app. Overall, thematic analysis highlighted uncertainty about increasing physical activity and concerns that fatigue might limit participation. Realistic goals and progressive increases in activity were seen as important to improving self-confidence and personal control. The app was seen as a useful and flexible resource. Participant feedback from the optimisation phase was used to make modifications to the app to maximise engagement, including simplification of the goal setting and daily data entry sections. Further studies are required to examine efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this novel digital intervention.;2021;4
This paper presents a dynamic gesture recognition approach using a novel spatiotemporal 2D skeleton image representation that can be fed to computationally efficient deep convolutional neural networks, for applications on human-robot interaction. Gestures are a seamless modality of human interaction and represent a potentially natural way to interact with the smart devices around us, like robots. The contribution of this paper is the proposal of a visually interpretable representation of dynamic gestures, which has a two-fold advantage: (i) conveys both spatial and temporal characteristics relying on a technique inspired in computer graphics, (ii) and can be used with simple and efficient architectures of convolutional neural networks. In our representation, a 3D skeleton model is projected to a 2D camera's point-of-view, preserving spatial relations, and through a sliding window the temporal domain is encoded in a fused image of consecutive frames, through a shading motion effect achieved by manipulating a transparency coefficient. The result is a 2D image that when fed to simple custom-designed convolutional neural networks, it is achieved accurate classification of dynamic gestures. Experimmental reuslts obtained with a purposely captured 6 gesture dataset of 11 subjects, and also 2 public datasets, give evidence of a strong performance of our approach, when compared to other methods.;2021;4
This study aimed to determine the difficulties of teaching children with hearing loss in the special education centre during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey. Sixty-three professionals who works children with hearing loss participated in this study. The demographic form included personal information about the professional' and a checklist to determine the effects of the Pandemic on special education. Lastly, the professionals and the teachers completed 'The Special Education Teachers' Sense of Professional Self-Efficacy Scale'. An email or a phone message was sent to potential participants, and interested individuals were requested to complete an online questionnaire by clicking on a link that led them to a secure online data collection service (Google Forms). Statistically significant relationships were determined between professionals using virtual communication tools in the distance education, contact with their students, continuing the rehabilitation with them and providing consultancy support to their parents. While a positive correlation was observed between the professionals contacted with their students during the Pandemic, evaluating their students' development, a negative correlation was found between their competencies to meet their rehabilitation needs and their counselling needs for families. Special education specialists should be supported under special conditions such as the Pandemic and informed about telerehabilitation options.;2021;4
"This study aimed to examine the effect of a multidisciplinary tele-rehabilitation program on functional recovery of older adults with hip fracture compared with home-based in-person rehabilitation. In this single-blinded, non-randomized clinical trial, we included older with hip fracture. The tele-rehabilitation group received a 12-week tele-rehabilitation program (supervised by their family caregivers). The control group received the usual postoperative rehabilitation provided by the Andalusian health system (Spain). The primary outcome was the patient-reported functional status assessed with the Functional Independence Measure. We also measured performance-based functional recovery using the Timed Up and Go Test and Short Physical Performance Battery. We performed both a per-protocol (62 participants; 28 tele-rehabilitation and 34 control groups) and an intention-to-treat analysis (71 participants; 35 tele-rehabilitation and 36 control groups). Participants who used the tele-rehabilitation program had higher Functional Independence Measure scores (high effect size: 0.98 Cohen's d; p < 0.001) and better performance in the Timed Up and Go Test (medium effect size: 0.63 Cohen's d; p = 0.025) compared with the control group. Differences between groups post-intervention were not statistically significant in the Short Physical Performance Battery. The tele-rehabilitation intervention proposed in this study is a valuable treatment option in the recovery process for older adults with hip fracture. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02968589.";2021;4
This study aims to investigate the effect of a preoperative telerehabilitation (PT) program on muscle strength, knee range of motion (ROM), and functional outcomes in candidates for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Sixty patients (all women, mean age 70.53 +/- 2.7 years) scheduled for bilateral TKA participated in this study. The PT and preoperative patient education (PE) groups participated in a 3-week intensive exercise program (30 min/session, 2 times/day, 5 days/week), whereas the control group received the usual care before TKA. Quadriceps muscle strength, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), ROM of knee flexion, pain, and time up-and-go (TUG) test time were evaluated at 4 weeks preoperatively, post-interventionally, and 6 weeks after TKA. Significant differences were found in the time-by-group interaction for 60 degrees/s extension peak torque [F(4, 100) = 2.499, p = 0.047, eta(2)(p) = 0.91], 180 degrees/s extension peak torque [F(4, 100) = 3.583, p = 0.009, eta(2)(p) = 0.125], ROM [F(4, 100) = 4.689, p = 0.002, eta(2)(p) = 0.158], TUG time [F(4, 100) = 7.252, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.225], WOMAC pain [F(4, 100) = 9.113, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.267], WOMAC functional outcome [F(4, 100) = 6.579, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.208], and WOMAC total score [F(4, 100) = 10.410, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.294]. The results of this study demonstrate the early benefits of a PT program in elderly female patients with end-stage osteoarthritis. The PT program improved muscle strength, ROM, and functional outcomes before TKA, which contributed to better functional recovery after TKA.;2021;4
This study describes the feasibility of using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) as a multidisciplinary outcome measure for pediatric telerehabilitation (TR). The COPM was administered at monthly time points over four months. A follow-up survey was conducted with the therapists to assess clinical utility of the COPM. Seventy-three percent of the children seen in TR > one month had at least two administrations of the COPM. Eighty percent of therapists agreed or strongly agreed that the COPM was easy to use in a reasonable amount of time, helped identify functional goals, could be used with various children with varied diagnoses, and measured functional change. In 37 children, the median clinical change in performance and satisfaction was two points or greater on the COPM over the episode of TR. The COPM is a feasible measure perceived positively by pediatric therapists for TR use.;2021;4
This study investigated an alternative home-based cardiac telerehabilitation model in consideration of the recommendations for the COVID-19 quarantine of people diagnosed with coronary heart disease (CHD). We hypothesized that using a 200 m fast walking test (200 mFWT) and telerehabilitation would create an effective alternative cardiac rehabilitation (CR) intervention that could improve cardiorespiratory fitness. Participants (n = 19, mean age 60.4 +/- 9.6) of the 8-week intervention performed regular physical exercise at the target heart rate zone determined by calculations based on the 200 mFWT results. In our study, the participants were supervised using telerehabilitation. A total of 84% of participants completed the 8-week intervention. No adverse events were reported during telerehabilitation. The study participants noted a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in cardiorespiratory fitness expressed by an 8% reduction in the walking test time (Delta 8.8 +/- 5.9 s). Home-based telerehabilitation based on 200 mFWT effectively increased the cardiorespiratory fitness in people with CHD with a low to moderate cardiovascular risk. This was a novel approach in CR during the COVID-19 pandemic. As research in this area is justified, this paper may serve as an alternative method of providing healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic and as a basis for further upcoming randomized controlled trials.;2021;4
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of home-based telerehabilitation on physical function among community-dwelling elderly people in Southeast Asian countries and regions, and to investigate its feasibility. A systematic electronic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and PEDro according to PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials conducted in the area that involved elderly people and any physical function indexes were included. Home-based telerehabilitation was defined as a specific remote rehabilitation intervention that used any kind of technological device allowing healthcare professional/patient interaction. Information regarding the effect and feasibility (intervention completion rate) of home-based telerehabilitation was extracted from eligible articles. We used the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials to assess methodological quality of the included articles. Eventually, six studies were included as eligible articles. The overall risk of bias judgement was assessed as High in five studies. All studies were conducted in either China or South Korea, and heterogeneity in terms of participants' health condition and intervention regimen was observed across the studies. Our narrative-based analysis showed that compared with conventional rehabilitation, either equal or better effects on physical function were reported across the six studies. The intervention completion rates were 81% +/- 11 on average (range 59-96%). Although we could not obtain conclusive evidence due to limited relevant information with heterogeneity across the studies, our findings suggest that home-based telerehabilitation can be a strategy for rehabilitation service delivery with acceptable feasibility comparable to conventional rehabilitation for elderly people in the area.;2021;4
"To validate the telephone-based application of the modified Gait Efficacy Scale (mGES) for the assessment of walking confidence in older people. Participants answered the mGES-Brazil on two randomized occasions, face-to-face and by telephone. The mean difference (MD) between the interviews was reported. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC3,1) was used to investigate the levels of agreement between the two occasions for total mGES-Brazil scores and for the individual items. A total of 78 individuals were included. There was no significant difference in the MD obtained between applications of the mGES (1 point, 95% confidence interval -6 to 7). A very high level of agreement was found between the mGES total scores during face-to-face and telephone applications (ICC = 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99). All items, except one (item 3), had a very high agreement between the two applications. The mGES showed to be reliable to be applied for telephone assessments of walking confidence in older people.";2021;4
Two occupational therapists with extensive experience in providing telehealth services provided training to prepare other practitioners to transition to a telehealth service delivery model by collaborating with their state association. This article details the development, implementation, and outcomes of an innovative response to the challenges presented by the pandemic. The collaborative model, joining practitioners, educators, and professional organizations to promote innovation in the face of rapid and unpredicted societal change, is described.;2021;4
Urgent care (UC) is one of the fastest growing venues of health care delivery for nonemergent conditions. This study compared the patient experience during virtual and in-person urgent care visits. We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with the same diagnosis during Virtual Urgent Care (VUC) and in-person UC visits with the same diagnosis with regard to time and cost over a period of one year. We recorded and analyzed 16 685 urgent care visits: In-person UC (n = 14 734), VUC (n = 1262). Significant differences were found in the average total time for a visit in an in-person UC (70.89 minutes), and VUC (9.38 minutes). The average total cost of VUC ($49) and in-person UC ($142.657) differed significantly. Significant difference was found between UC turnaround time and VC turnaround time (Dependent variable (DV): 53.77, P < .01). We found significant differences in cost and time between in favor of virtual visits. Our findings suggest additional policy reform to expand the use of virtual care among target populations to improve access, reduce costs, meet the needs of patients, and reduce emergency department visits.;2021;4
We aim to report the co-design of the implementation strategy of a telehealth-enabled cardiac rehabilitation model of care in rural and remote areas of Australia. The goal of this model of care is to increase cardiac rehabilitation attendance and completion by country patients with cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesise that a model of care co-designed with stakeholders will address patients' needs and preferences and increase participation. We applied the Model for Large Scale Knowledge Translation and engaged with patients, clinicians and health service managers across six local health networks in rural South Australia. They informed the design of a web-based cardiac rehabilitation programme and the delivery of the expanded telehealth service. The stakeholders defined face-to-face, telephone, web-based or combinations as choices of mode of delivery to patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation. A case-managed programme supported by a web portal with an interface for patients and clinicians was considered more appropriate to the local context than a self-managed programme. A business model was developed to enable the sustainability of cardiac rehabilitation clinical assessments through primary care. The impact of the model of care on cardiac rehabilitation attendance/completion, clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported experiences and cost-effectiveness will be tested in a 12-month follow-up study.;2021;4
We aimed to explore consumer experiences of ambulatory telehealth services and whether consumer experiences differed according to whether they received their consultation using telephone or video technology. We conducted structured telephone interviews with patient consumers who had received a recent remote consultation by telephone or video call, at local ambulatory allied health or multidisciplinary services within a large public metropolitan public health network. Respondents were asked about their recent experience and future choices in relation to telehealth. Responses from consumers who received telephone and video consultations were compared. Consumers from community rehabilitation, community health, allied health outpatients, multidisciplinary specialist clinics and mental health services participated (n = 379), of whom 245 received a telephone consultation (65%) and 134 a video consultation (35%). Almost half of respondents (49%) expressed preference for future face-to-face care and 29% reported they would choose to use telehealth over face-to-face consultation for a similar appointment again. Many commented that they would be influenced by the type of consultation required and expressed a desire to have a choice. Approximately 80% of both groups reported they had achieved the desired outcome from their telehealth consultation. Consumers using video were more likely to experience technical issues. Telehealth met the needs of most consumers, and responses were similar for telephone and video consultations.;2021;4
We conducted a systematic review of telerehabilitation (TR) interventions on children and young adults with multiple disabilities (MDs). This review aimed to (a) examine the effectiveness of telerehabilitation (TR) on adaptive skills that have been targeted for intervention, (b) describe the type of devices used in the intervention procedures, (c) summarize the outcomes, and (d) examine the consumer/professional satisfaction of TR. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. Results suggested that TR is an effective tool in improving the adaptive skills of children and young adults with MDs. Boh consumers and professionals reported high levels of satisfaction and acceptance of TR services. Trends across different types of devices implemented in TR programs are considered and recommendations are made for future research.;2021;4
"We investigated motivational regulation involving adjustment of recovery goals in post-stroke rehabilitation via standard in-clinic physiotherapy and in-home telerehabilitation (TR). We used a secondary dataset collected at 11 US sites as part of a clinical trial using video games and game control pads designed to induce certain arm movements required for recovery (n = 124; M-age = 61.44, SD = 13.30). Participants were randomly assigned to either the TR or in-clinic condition and underwent 36 therapy sessions, reporting on their activity-inherent enjoyment for 6-8 weeks. Compared with the in-clinic patients and TR patients with high game performance, TR patients with lower game performance reported lower activity-inherent enjoyment, which is an important motivational resource for successful recovery. The results suggest that these differences occur because TR patients become discouraged by low game score feedback, which may have signaled a poor prospect for recovery. However, the results also suggest that low game performers who successfully adjusted their recovery goals were resilient to the impact of low game score feedback on their motivational resources and satisfaction with therapy. The findings suggest that goal adjustment may be particularly beneficial when patients are discouraged by feedback indicating suboptimal recovery prospects.";2021;4
We planned this systematic review and meta-analysis to study an estimate of the effect of non-invasive home telemonitoring (TM) in the treatment of patients with recently decompensated heart failure (HF). A systematic literature search was conducted in the Medline, Cinahl, and Scopus databases to look for randomized controlled studies comparing TM with standard care in the treatment of patients with recently decompensated HF. The main outcomes of interest were all-cause hospitalizations and mortality. Eleven original articles met our eligibility criteria. The pooled estimate of the relative risk of all-cause hospitalization in the TM group compared with standard care was 0.95 (95% CI 0.84-1.08, P = 0.43) and the relative risk of all-cause death was 0.83 (95% CI 0.63-1.09, P = 0.17). There was significant clinical heterogeneity among primary studies. HF medication could be directly altered in three study interventions, and two of these had a statistically significant effect on all-cause hospitalizations. The pooled effect estimate of TM interventions on all-cause hospitalizations and all-cause death in patients with recently decompensated heart failure was neutral.;2021;4
While telerehabilitation (TR) makes it possible to respond to many significant health system problems, TR still gives rise to debates, particularly concerning ethical issues. This qualitative study collected the opinions of stakeholders with varied profiles. A guided interview focused on discerning strategies that might foster the ethical deployment of TR. Such strategies were found to be linked to the decision-making of the public authorities, the role of scientific and professional bodies, the training of health professionals, and the management of patient information. Ethical issues relating to the development of TR included universal accessibility, patients' free choice, respect of privacy, and professional confidentiality. The ethical development of TR can be fostered by the provision of information to stakeholders as well as reminding practitioners of the ethical framework that regulates medical practice.;2021;4
"While the proportion of the Older Adults (OAs) population is growing, this shift raises a challenging question: How can we support OAs to lead independent and healthy lifestyle?. Many researchers have been studying Ambient Assisted Living Technologies (or AALTs) over the last three decades to tackle this challenge. However, no literature can provide an overall view of research in the field of AALTs and linkages between technical development and related healthcare needs. Thus, we conducted a systematic mapping review of literature focusing on AALTs (N = 7006) to explore three main research questions: 1) When, where, and how AALTs are studied?; 2) What is the technological maturity level of AALTs used to support a health and wellness, and where were they evaluated and/or implemented?; and 3) To which health and wellness purposes are AALTs deployed? We found several noticeable imbalances in literature and identified some strategies to move this field of investigation further and to bring AALTs applications closer to clinical practice. While research in the area is gradually blossoming, the area mainly leads in only a few countries. Furthermore, the majority of research targeted asymptomatic older adults living at home. We hope this paper will help researchers easily understand what type of research, with whom, and where are available in AALT now. Potential challenges associated with AALTs research are also discussed.";2021;4
While use of telemedicine to guide emergent treatment of ischemic stroke is well established, the COVID-19 pandemic motivated the rapid expansion of care via telemedicine to provide consistent care while reducing patient and provider exposure and preserving personal protective equipment. Temporary changes in reimbursement, inclusion of home office and patient home environments, and increased access to telehealth technologies by patients, health care staff and health care facilities were key to provide an environment for creative and consistent high-quality stroke care. The continuum of care via telestroke has broadened to include prehospital, inter-facility and intra-facility hospital-based services, stroke telerehabilitation, and ambulatory telestroke. However, disparities in technology access remain a challenge. Preservation of reimbursement and the reduction of regulatory burden that was initiated during the public health emergency will be necessary to maintain expanded patient access to the full complement of telestroke services. Here we outline many of these initiatives and discuss potential opportunities for optimal use of technology in stroke care through and beyond the pandemic.;2021;4
With the increase in technological advances over the years, telehealth services in orthopedic surgery have gained in popularity, yet adoption among surgeons has been slow. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, orthopedic surgery practices nationwide have accelerated adaptation to telemedicine. Telehealth can be effectively applied to total joint arthroplasty, with the ability to perform preoperative consultations, postoperative follow-up, and telerehabilitation in a virtual, remote manner with similar outcomes to in-person visits. New technologies that have emerged, such as virtual goniometers, wearable sensors, and app-based patient questionnaires, have improved clinicians' ability to conduct telehealth visits. Benefits of using telehealth include high patient satisfaction, cost-savings, increased access to care, and more efficiency. Notably, some challenges still exist, including widespread accessibility and adaptation of new technologies, inability to conduct an in-person orthopedic physical examination, and regulatory barriers, such as insurance reimbursement, increased medicolegal risk, and privacy and confidentiality concerns. Despite these hurdles, telehealth is here to stay and can be successfully incorporated in any total joint arthroplasty practice with the appropriate adjustments.;2021;4
With the increasing rate of disabled people in the world, the number of people in need of physio-therapy is increasing. Most of the disabled persons with shoulder damaged should do physiotherapy exercises. The telerehabilitation systems using developed technologies have advantages over conven-tional physiotherapy methods. Such systems have the potential to improve communication between patients and physiotherapists. They also allow for easier information and medical data sharing. In this study, a telerehabilitation system based on Kinect Sensor (Kinect 2) was developed to observe and evaluate shoulder damaged patient exercises by using the Kinect skeletal monitoring feature. The proposed system consists of two basic components: the web application that enables the communication between patients and physiotherapists, allows the physiotherapist to observe/update patient exercise data, patients information, and the console application which enables the patients to perform their exercises correctly. This console app was developed for patients with shoulder damage. Abduction, flexion, internal rotation, external rotation, extension exercises can be performed correctly thanks to the developed application. The proposed system was evaluated in Bilecik State Hospital for 29 shoulder damaged volunteers. 14 of the volunteers were treated with the conventional methods and 15 of them were treated with the proposed system. The recovery of the volunteers was analyzed for each intragroup and intergroup comparison was made. Statistically, significant decreases were observed in the limitations of the patients treated with the proposed system. For abduction, flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation exercises, the Kinect-based physiotherapy mentor application was more successful than conventional method, while all volunteers treated by the proposed method had no limitations in extension exercise. As a result, the Kinect-based physiotherapy mentor application can be used as an alternative telerehabilitation method for patients with shoulder damaged. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Within the context of telerehabilitation, serious games have a significant role, but creating software for serious games is resource demanding. We present Proteo, a modular and open-source framework for developing serious games from scratch. We also present two serious game implementation examples with analysis of end user and therapist/researcher satisfaction. By involving a group of 11 specialized therapists and 9 end users we analyzed the Proteo's user satisfaction. We found that both groups scored high for the level of involvement, and the therapists scored also high for the level of suitability. More in depth, both groups showed significant differences between positive and negative feelings, with positive feelings scoring higher than negative ones. Finally, the user level of suitability was reported as high while the difficulty of the system and the difficulty of the task were reported as low. Proteo has proven to be a useful tool to develop serious games for telerehabilitation and has been well accepted by the users involved in the evaluation tests.;2021;4
Worldwide, at the time this article was written, there are over 127 million cases of patients with a confirmed link to COVID-19 and about 2.78 million deaths reported. With limited access to vaccine or strong antiviral treatment for the novel coronavirus, actions in terms of prevention and containment of the virus transmission rely mostly on social distancing among susceptible and high-risk populations. Aside from the direct challenges posed by the novel coronavirus pandemic, there are serious and growing secondary consequences caused by the physical distancing and isolation guidelines, among vulnerable populations. Moreover, the healthcare system's resources and capacity have been focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, causing less urgent care, such as physical neurorehabilitation and assessment, to be paused, canceled, or delayed. Overall, this has left elderly adults, in particular those with neuromusculoskeletal (NMSK) conditions, without the required service support. However, in many cases, such as stroke, the available time window of recovery through rehabilitation is limited since neural plasticity decays quickly with time. Given that future waves of the outbreak are expected in the coming months worldwide, it is important to discuss the possibility of using available technologies to address this issue, as societies have a duty to protect the most vulnerable populations. In this perspective review article, we argue that intelligent robotics and wearable technologies can help with remote delivery of assessment, assistance, and rehabilitation services while physical distancing and isolation measures are in place to curtail the spread of the virus. By supporting patients and medical professionals during this pandemic, robots, and smart digital mechatronic systems can reduce the non-COVID-19 burden on healthcare systems. Digital health and cloud telehealth solutions that can complement remote delivery of assessment and physical rehabilitation services will be the subject of discussion in this article due to their potential in enabling more effective and safer NMSDK rehabilitation, assistance, and assessment service delivery. This article will hopefully lead to an interdisciplinary dialogue between the medical and engineering sectors, stake holders, and policy makers for a better delivery of care for those with NMSK conditions during a global health crisis including future pandemics.;2021;4
Introduction:Vocational training in health faces great challenges since social distancing became one of the strategies controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Physiotherapy education has a practical component that requires contact with patients and through which students acquire professional skills.This face-to-face learning modality has had to be replaced by new pedagogical strategies, such as attention mediated by information and communication technology (ICT), case-based teaching, clinical simulation and tele-rehabilitation, trying to maintain patient-student interaction and compliance with professional training. Method: Descriptive cross-sectional study, in 143 practice students of a physiotherapy program in the city of Cali - Colombia, which evaluates their perception after a professional training practice mediated by ICTs. Results: 82.5% of the students answered that, if it was possible to perform tele-rehabilitation during the virtual practices, considering it as useful in 36.4%.The most used virtual platforms were Google Meet and Zoom with 81.1%. More than half of the students (58%) agreed that synchronous and asynchronous virtual activities led to significant learning Conclusion: Vocational training mediated by ICTs emerged in the face of the pandemic and reinforced this strategy as a learning tool for meeting professional training objectives and competencies, the quality is perceived as a viable strategy that implies a paradigm shift in traditional education within the training process.;2022;4
